Recent studies have shown that aquatic plants possess potential to remove pathogens from wastewater. High removal (90%) of pathogenic microbes such as Enterococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella have been achieved using aquatic plant species viz. Typha latifolia, Cyperus papyrus, Cyperus alternifolius, Phragmites mauritianus, Pistia stratiotes, Lemna paucicostata, Spirodela polyrhiza, Eichhornia crassipes. Pathogen removal by aquatic plants mainly occurs because of toxicity exerted by exudates produced by them or attachment of pathogens to plant roots followed by filtration. Constructed wetlands have proved very efficient in treating pathogen-contaminated water. More studies are required to find out the exact mechanism of pathogen removal by these plants so that their role in phytoremediation technologies can be emphasized.","output":"Chapter 17 Effective control of waterborne pathogens by aquatic plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic remains unclear. We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients from December 20, 2019, to February 25, 2020, in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS: All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS: We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men, and the average age was 51 years). A total of 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan-related history of travel or contact. Most took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds, and 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. Four upper airway infections were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the fourth recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment. Laboratory results of 47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted. Of these, 21.3% of recipients had pre-existing lymphopenia, and 87.2% of recipients had a therapeutic concentration of tacrolimus (5-12 ng/ml). Liver and kidney insufficiency was seen in 5 and 6 recipients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTx recipients who practiced appropriate prevention measures had a low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and transition to the associated disease COVID-19.

METHODS: Ninety-eight COPD patients who were treated in our hospital from January 2021 to January 2022 were selected as the research objects, and they were divided into reference group (routine treatment) and study group (Yifei-Huoxue decoction combined with tiotropium), with 49 cases in each group. The patients' clinical indexes were compared between the two groups, and the clinical efficacy in the two groups was analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the reference group, the study group had remarkably lower inflammatory cytokine levels (including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) after treatment (P > 0.05). In terms of the patients' pulmonary function indexes after treatment, the study group achieved lower forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC levels compared with the reference group (P < 0.05). Both groups had a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) after treatment compared with that before treatment. However, the intergroup difference in the ESRs after treatment was remarkable, and the study group had a much lower ESR compared with the reference group (P < 0.05).

Identify how resiliency contributes to chronic illnesses such as SCD 2. Discuss technique for assessing child resiliency (ie, parental assessment) 3. Identify potential for interventions to improve resiliency and associated markers of disease management Original Research Background Families with a child with sickle cell disease (SCD) have unique stressors and challenges. A key adaptive response to these is resiliency. Previous studies have focused on parental resiliency and psychosocial factors that affect the child's health. None have measured the resiliency of children with SCD or its relationship with their parent's resiliency or SCD complications. Research Objectives Thegoal of this study was to examine the relationship between child's and parent's resiliency and perceived stress. Our primary outcome was the association between resiliency scores and SCD specific stressors including acute access to healthcare and previous stroke or stem cell transplant. The impact of the COVID pandemic and sources of stress were surveyed. Methods Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), PROMIS 8a Depression Scale, and PROMIS 8a Anxiety Scale data were collected from children >12 years old with SCD and their parents (n = 55). Parents scored their child with a modified CD-RISC. Frequency of hospitalization, acute clinic visits, and emergency room visits over previous year and history of stroke and stem cell transplant were ed from medical record. Sources of stress and SCD management during pandemic versus before were assessed with Likert scale. Results Parentassessment of their child's resiliency was accurate (p < 0.0001). Increased hospitalization was associated with lower child CD-RISC score (p = 0.0386). No relationship between child and parent CD-RISC or PSS-10 scores was observed. Both reported no difference in SCD management during the COVID pandemic. However, concern about getting sick from COVID and concern about SCD were the most common stressors. Conclusion SCD resiliency may affect how often children need hospitalization. The COVID pandemic did not affect parent and child assessment of SCD management, despite being a common stressor. Implications for Research, Policy, or Practice Interventions to improve resiliency of children with SCD may help reduce the frequency of hospitalizations.","output":"Decreased Resiliency Associated with Increased Hospitalizations for Children with Sickle Cell Disease (S535)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) belongs to the beta coronavirus subfamily and causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans especially when infected patients have underlying diseases such chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Knowing how perceived racism influences adolescent health can help reduce health inequities. CDCs 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES), an online survey of a probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. public- and private-school students in grades 9C12 (N = 7,705), was conducted during JanuaryCJune 2021 to assess student behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC analyzed data from ABES to measure perceived racism and the extent to which perceptions of racism are associated with demographic, mental health, and behavioral characteristics. Mental health and behavioral characteristics analyzed included mental health status; virtual connection with others outside of school; serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions; and feeling close to persons at school. Demographic characteristics analyzed included sex, race and ethnicity, and grade. Prevalence of perceived racism and associations between perceived racism and demographic, mental health, and behavioral characteristics are reported overall and stratified by race and ethnicity. Approximately one third (35.6%) of U.S. high school students reported perceived racism. Perceived racism was highest among Asian (63.9%), Black (55.2%), and multiracial students (54.5%). Students who reported perceived racism had higher prevalences of poor mental health (38.1%); difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions (44.1%); and not feeling close to persons at school (40.7%). Perceived racism was higher among those students who reported poor mental health than those who did not report poor mental health during the pandemic among Asian (67.9% versus 40.5%), Black (62.1% versus 38.5%), Hispanic (45.7% and 22.9%), and White students (24.5% versus 12.7%).

By contrast, although the bootstrap t test was proposed in 1993, it is seldom adopted in medical research.

Using random data samples from normal distributions, we evaluated the testing performance, in terms of true-positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate and diagnostic abilities, in terms of the area under the curve (AUC), of the bootstrap t test and Student's t test. We explore the AUC of both tests with varying sample size and coefficient of variation. We compare the testing outcomes using the COVID-19 serial interval (SI) data in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, China, for demonstration. With fixed TPR, the bootstrap t test maintained the equivalent accuracy in TPR, but significantly improved the true-negative rate from the Student's t test. With varying TPR, the diagnostic ability of bootstrap t test outperformed or equivalently performed as Student's t test in terms of the AUC. The equivalent performances are possible but rarely occur in practice. We find that the bootstrap t test outperforms by successfully detecting the difference in COVID-19 SI, which is defined as the time interval between consecutive transmission generations, due to sex and non-pharmaceutical interventions against the Student's t test.

Critical race theory provides a race-conscious framework with which to examine inequity, power, and justice. CRT has been incorporated into law, political science, sociology, and other fields but, thus far, medicine has failed to formally embrace its teachings. Purpose/Objective: We set out to develop and carry out a Critical Race Theory curriculum to address an identified gap in emergency medicine education. Sessions explored concepts of critical race theory and issues of racism as they relate to the clinical and extraclinical environments. Methods: We developed a series of five virtual workshop sessions in 2019 which were held over Zoom in June and July 2020 in the setting of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Eight learners completed the curriculum. All sessions were facilitated by the creators of this curriculum, both facilitators have experience guiding workshop discussions related to topics of race. Sessions were held weekly for between 90 to 120 minutes. Outcomes (if available): Surveys identified increased comfort discussing topics of racism, sustained motivation, and increased familiarity with Critical Race Theory among participants. Learners were also more likely to report having a framework for approaching topics of race and racism which is critical for engaging with these and other topics in the future. Summary: We set out to develop and carry out a Critical Race Theory curriculum to address an identified gap in emergency medicine education. Sessions explored concepts of critical race theory and issues of racism as they relate to the clinical and extraclinical environments. We developed a series of five virtual workshop sessions in 2019 which were held over Zoom in June and July 2020 in the setting of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and were facilitated by the creators of the curriculum. Fifteen incoming emergency medicine interns at the University of California-San Francisco were invited to participate in the curriculum on a voluntary basis. Nine learners showed interest in the curriculum and opted-in to participation. Ultimately, eight learners completed the curriculum. Prior to each session, learners were provided pre-session materials including podcasts, recorded lectures, and readings. Pre-session materials did not exceed 2 hours of work. Thought questions were also provided with pre-session materials to facilitate discussion during sessions. Materials were curated to provide foundational knowledge on Critical Race Theory and US history as well as relate to local history in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Participants universally found our Critical Race Theory curriculum useful and reported increased comfort discussing topics of racism, sustained motivation, and increased familiarity with Critical Race Theory. Opt-in participation contributed to a very engaged cohort of learners and the small group size encouraged participation by all learners. The virtual format made attendance less burdensome for participants. Semi-structured facilitation allowed participants to guide conversations to their own topics of interest while also addressing specific topics at hand.

The development of computer-aided systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs, which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs, even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis;in particular, they emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example, we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.","output":"Vulnerability of deep neural networks for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images to universal adversarial attacks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2019 that caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) During the last year, over 70 million people were infected and more than 1 5 million people died Despite the tremendous number of people infected, children were less affected and presented milder forms of the disease A short time after the pandemic was declared, a new hyperinflammatory syndrome resembling Kawasaki disease (KD) was described in children with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) The incidence of MIS-C is low and it has a polymorphous clinical presentation, making the diagnosis difficult Although the incidence is reduced, there is a high risk of cardiovascular complications In order to raise awareness, we present the cases of two pediatric patients diagnosed with MIS-C in our clinic","output":"The Challenging Diagnosis of Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with Sars-Cov-2 Infection-Two Case Reports and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: Human post-mortem eyes from 13 non-diabetic control cases and 11 diabetic retinopathy cases were analyzed for the expression of ACE2. To compare the vascular ACE2 expression between different organs that involve in diabetes, the expression of ACE2 was investigated in renal specimens from nondiabetic and diabetic nephropathy patients. Expression of TMPRSS2, a cell-surface protease that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry, was also investigated in human nondiabetic retinas. Primary human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and primary human retinal pericytes (HRPCs) were further used to confirm the vascular ACE2 expression in human retina. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 was expressed in multiple nonvascular neuroretinal cells, including the retinal ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, and photoreceptor outer segments in both nondiabetic and diabetic retinopathy specimens. Strikingly, we observed significantly more ACE2 positive vessels in the diabetic retinopathy specimens. By contrast, in another end-stage organ affected by diabetes, the kidney, ACE2 in nondiabetic and diabetic nephropathy showed apical expression of ACE2 tubular epithelial cells, but no endothelial expression in glomerular or peritubular capillaries. Western blot analysis of protein lysates from HRECs and HRPCs confirmed expression of ACE2. TMPRSS2 expression was present in multiple retinal neuronal cells, vascular and perivascular cells, and Mller glia. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results indicate that retina expresses ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

The postnatal period is a critical time for women to develop maternal self-efficacy. Mobile health interventions may offer a way to reach women during this critical period to offer support and information. Essential Coaching for Every Mother is a text message program that seeks to educate and support women during the first 6 weeks postpartum. OBJECTIVE: The primary effectiveness objective is to compare the effectiveness of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program on maternal psychosocial outcomes (self-efficacy, social support, postpartum depression, and postpartum anxiety) immediately after the intervention and 6 months postpartum, collectively as well as stratified by parity. The primary implementation objective is to evaluate the implementation extent and quality of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program. METHODS: This will be a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial. A total of 140 mothers-to-be or new mothers from Nova Scotia will be recruited and randomized to the intervention or control arm, stratified by parity. The intervention arm will receive the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program, which consists of 53 messages sent twice a day for the first 2 weeks and daily for weeks 3 through 6. The control group will receive usual care. Messages are personalized based on the infants age and the womans self-selected preference for breastfeeding or formula feeding and tailored with the infants name and gender. Women can enroll in the program if they are 37 weeks pregnant or within 10 days postpartum, with the first message designed to be sent on the second evening after birth. The actual number of messages received will vary based on the timing of enrollment and the infants date of birth. Participants will complete questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, social support, and postpartum depression and anxiety at baseline (enrollment after birth) and 6 weeks (postintervention) and 6 months postpartum. Implementation data will be collected throughout the trial, and evaluation feedback will be collected at 6 weeks from women who received the intervention. RESULTS: Recruitment for this study started on January 5, 2021, and is currently ongoing, with an anticipated date of recruitment completion of January 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will assess the effectiveness of a postpartum text message program to improve maternal self-efficacy and social support while decreasing postpartum depression and anxiety. It will also shed light on the implementation effectiveness of the program.

The result is a cycle of normoxia and hypoxia in which blood oxygen partial pressures can decline to <20-30 mmHg during a dive, a level considered injurious to oxygen-dependent human tissues (i.e., brain, heart). Safeguards in the form of enhanced on-board oxygen stores, selective oxygen transport, and unique tissue buffering capacities enable marine-adapted mammals to maintain physiological homeostasis and energy metabolism even when breathing and pulmonary gas exchange cease. This stands in stark contrast to the vulnerability of oxygen-sensitive tissues in humans that may undergo irreversible damage within minutes of ischemia and tissue hypoxia. Recently, these differences in protection against hypoxic injury have become evident in the systemic, multi-organ physiological failure during COVID-19 infection in humans. Prolonged recoveries in some patients have led to delays in the return to normal exercise levels and cognitive function even months later. Rather than a single solution to this problem, we find that marine mammals rely on a unique, integrative assemblage of protections to avoid the deleterious impacts of hypoxia on tissues. Built across evolutionary time, these solutions provide a natural template for identifying the potential for tissue damage when oxygen is lacking, and for guiding management decisions to support oxygen-deprived tissues in other mammalian species, including humans, challenged by hypoxia.","output":"Physiological resiliency in diving mammals: Insights on hypoxia protection using the Krogh principle to understand COVID-19 symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A \\"superspreader\\" refers to an unusually contagious organism infected with a disease.

It is known to cause multi-organ failure with respiratory failure at the helm of its clinical presentation. There is limited data known about patient's experiencing acute mesenteric thrombosis. We present a case of patient admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia who experienced pneumoperitoneum secondary to acute mesenteric ischemia. CASE PRESENTATION: 64-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and former smoker presented with dyspnea, decreased appetite, nausea, and diarrhea for 10 days. On Admission he was hypoxic on room air. Lab work revealed polycythemia, lactic acidosis 3.3, D-dimer 0.87, ABG (respiratory alkalosis with underlying metabolic acidosis), elevated inflammatory markers, and positive COVID-19 PCR. Chest X ray showed diffuse pulmonary opacities. CT angiography of the chest ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs). He was placed on High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50% FiO2, and Dexamethasone 6 mg. On hospital day 8 he was tachycardic, more dyspneic and hypoxemic requiring escalation of HFNC. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia. He was empirically started on heparin drip for concern of pulmonary embolism and broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia. CT chest without contrast showed worsening GGOs and pneumoperitoneum not seen on prior images. He was taken to operating room for emergent exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperative findings revealed a thrombus at the branch of the mesenteric artery leading to perforated cecum with feculent peritonitis. Patient passed away several days post-op due to worsening clinical status. DISCUSSION: Pneumoperitoneum is usually caused by perforation of abdominal viscus. COVID19 tends to cause multi organ failure(6). Elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines can damage the microvascular system leading to uncontrolled activation of coagulation cascades which can cause small-vessel vasculitis and extensive microthrombi. There are very few cases reported regarding perforation of abdominal viscus due to microvascular thrombosis from COVID19. It is perplexing if COVID19 infection can acutely trigger this mesenteric arterial thrombus leading to ischemia and eventually perforation. It has been proposed that it might be secondary to direct viral invasion of the enterocyte cells via ACE2 receptors or immune response leading to cytokine storms (7) and activation of pro-coagulant cascades or combination of both (1,2,3). Mesenteric Ischemia is a life threatening condition requiring resection of ischemic bowel, GI decompression, and fluid resuscitation (4). Sometimes, it can be managed conservatively (5). CONCLUSIONS: It is important to recognize that COVID19 can potentially increase the risk of bowel perforation and cause pneumoperitoneum at risk groups of patients.

We aimed to explore the association between risk perception and IVH for children among reproductive women in China, a poorly studied area. METHODS: From December 14, 2020, to January 31, 2021, we conducted a national anonymous online survey on IVH for children among reproductive women in China. We assessed risk perception including perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers, and benefits using the Health Belief Model and then classified each variable into three groups based on tertiles. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of risk perception related to vaccine hesitancy after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and knowledge of influenza, among other factors. Additionally, subgroup analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among 3,011 reproductive women, 9.13% reported IVH. In multivariable models, vaccine hesitancy was associated with low perceived susceptibility (aOR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.79C3.65), higher perceived barriers (moderate: aOR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.04C2.08; high: aOR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.47C3.30), and low perceived benefit (moderate: aOR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03C1.92; low: aOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.43C3.07). Subgroup analysis showed that vaccine hesitancy was more likely to occur among women with high perceived barriers aged < 30 years compared with those older than 30 years (P for difference = 0.041) and among women with moderate perceived benefit who had never conceived compared with those had a history of pregnancy (P for difference = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in 10 reproductive women was hesitant about influenza vaccination for their children during the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate vaccine hesitancy, our findings highlight a need for tailored public health measures to increase perceived disease susceptibility and vaccine benefit and decrease perceived barriers. Furthermore, the effect of high perceived barriers and moderate perceived benefit on vaccine hesitancy was higher among younger women and women who had never conceived.

Combined outcomes were pooled as odds ratios or mean differences in a fixed-effect model, using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software for Windows. RESULTS Twelve randomized, controlled trials and 5 cohort studies (n = 3,722 patients) were included in the final analysis. The two groups, using self-gripping mesh or sutured mesh fixation, did not differ significantly in terms of recurrence rate (odds ratio = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.18-2.44; P = .54) or postoperative chronic groin pain (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.54-1.05; P = .09). The operative time was less in the self-gripping mesh group (mean difference = -7.85, 95% confidence interval -9.94 to -5.76; P < .0001). For safety analysis, there were comparable risks between self-gripping mesh and sutured mesh fixation groups in terms of postoperative infection (odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.53-1.23; P = .32), postoperative hematoma (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.7-1.36; P = .9), and urinary retention (odds ratio = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.18-2.44; P = .54). CONCLUSION Data from our analysis did not favor either of the two fixation techniques over the other in terms of recurrence or postoperative chronic groin pain.

Early start of rehabilitation and its continuation at home once the patient is discharged are key factors for the success of the process. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a home-based telerehabilitation solution (ReHub) on improving functional capacity and clinical outcomes for patients who underwent TKA. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomized, open-label with blinded outcome assessor, parallel assignment clinical trial with a sample size of 52 patients that is conducted according to the SPIRIT recommendations. After the TKA intervention, the patients are randomly allocated to the control group or the experimental group with a 1:1 ratio. Both groups follow a Fast Track recovery protocol which includes discharge after 2C3 days from surgery, a daily plan of 5 exercises for autonomous rehabilitation and domiciliary visits by a physiotherapist starting approximately 2 weeks after surgery. The experimental group uses the sensor-based telerehabilitation system ReHub to perform the exercises. The primary outcome measure is the range of motion of the knee. Secondary outcomes include physical performance, quality of life, pain intensity, muscle strength, treatment adherence and satisfaction with the ReHub system. The outcomes assessment is performed at hospital discharge (baseline), at stitch removal (2 weeks after baseline) and 2 weeks after stitch removal (4 weeks after baseline). The study conforms to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the hospitals ethics committee. DISCUSSION: The study will address an important gap in the evidence base by reporting the effectiveness of an affordable and low-cost home-based telerehabilitation solution in patients who underwent TKA.

Objective: Determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data can be used as syndromic surveillance to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in the communities where employees live. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total of 2,384 beds and 136,000 discharges in New England. Participants: 6,841 employees working on-site of Hospital 1 from April 2, 2020 to November 4, 2020, who live in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Interventions: Mandatory, daily employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text messaging system. Main Outcomes: Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 7 day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital census at each hospital. Results: 6,841 employees, with a mean age of 40.8 (SD = 13.6), 8.8 years of service (SD = 10.4), and 74.8% were female (n = 5,120), living in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Our model has an MAE of 6.9 COVID-19 patients and a WMAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital network. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5 patients (WMAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). At Hospital 1, a doubling of the number of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponds to 4 additional employees reporting symptoms at the mean for Hospital 1) is associated with a 5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at Hospital 1 in 7 days (95% CI: (0.02, 0.07)).

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on disinfectants to decontaminate N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility and extracted predefined data fields.

Residual hydrogen peroxide levels following decontamination were within safe limits. More than one decontamination cycle of vaporized H2O2 may be possible but further information is required on how multiple cycles would affect FFR fit in a real-world setting before the upper limit can be established. Although immersion in liquid H2O2 does not appear to adversely affect FFR function, there is no available data on its ability to remove infectious pathogens from FFRs or its impact on FFR fit.

Furthermore, the complex and stressful systems surrounding resuscitation events increase nursing errors. AIMS: This study aimed to assess the knowledge about resuscitation medications and understand the obstacles faced by nurses when giving resuscitation medications. Additionally, errors in the reporting of resuscitation medication administration and the reasons that prevented nurses from reporting errors were investigated. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the West Bank, Palestine. Convenient sampling was used to collect data, which was collected via a face-to-face interview questionnaire taken from a previous study. The questionnaire consisted of five parts: demographic data, knowledge of resuscitation medications (20 true/false questions), self-evaluation and causes behind not reporting ME, with suggestions to decrease ME. RESULTS: A total of 200 nurses participated in the study. Nurses were found to have insufficient knowledge about resuscitation medications (58.6%). A high knowledge score was associated with male nurses, those working in the general ward, the cardiac care unit (CCU), the intensive care unit (ICU) and the general ward. The main obstacles nurses faced when administering resuscitation medication were the chaotic environment in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (62%), the unavailability of pharmacists for a whole day (61%), and different medications that look alike in the packaging (61%). Most nurses (70.5%) hoped to gain additional training. In our study, we found no compatibility in the definition of ME between nurses and hospitals (43.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Nurses had insufficient knowledge of resuscitation medications. One of the obstacles nurses faced was that pharmacists should appropriately arrange medications, and nurses wanted continuous learning and additional training about resuscitation medications to decrease ME.","output":"Nurses knowledge and understanding of obstacles encountered them when administering resuscitation medications: a cross-sectional study from Palestine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic.

METHODS: Two cross-sectional, population-based online surveys were conducted from January 28 to February 1, 2020 and from February1 to March 18, 2020. Socio-demographic information and individual protective practice were collected and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used for measuring anxiety. The range of STAI score was 5C25, and the higher the score, the more anxious it was. The respondents of the two surveys were matched on a one-to-one basis according to their province, gender, age, education, and marriage. Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare STAI score changes in two stages and in different demographic characteristics. RESULTS: We included 9,764 individuals in the first survey and 1,669 in the second survey, covering 30 provincial administrative regions in Mainland China. COVID-19 has affected almost every aspect of peoples normal life, especially lifestyle. The proportion of people who paid attention to it every day had dropped from 97.6 to 88.9%. We identified that vast majority people wore masks when they went out. The proportion has declined from 96.5 to 92.4% for hand hygiene and from 98.4 to 95.3% for not attending parties. Peoples anxiety (STAI score) across the country has decreased from a median of 19 in the early outbreak stage to a median of 12, including people with all demographic characteristics, but some have increased in 16 provinces.

Convalescent Plasma Therapy has been authorized as an off-label therapeutic procedure. We assessed the outcome of convalescent plasma (CP) units versus standard treatment on the complete recovery, improvement and 28 days' mortality of COVID 19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present was multi-centric case controlled observational prospective study. The study was conducted for a period of four and half months from July 15 2020 to 30 November 2020 after taking approval from the Expert Committee, Health & Family Welfare Department, Government of Odisha. Plasma therapy was applied on two groups of 1189 serious COVID patients (959 number of pre- critical and 230 number of critical patients) not responding to oxygen therapy. It was compared with non- transfused control group of 1243 patients (996 number of pre-critical and 247 number of critical patients). RESULTS: Discharge was better in (55.5%) transfused than (43%)in non-transfused pre-critical patients and the mortality was lower (44.3%) in transfused, (48.9%) than non-transfused critical patients respectively. Complete recovery was highest in those who were transfused with CP with neutralizing titer more than 1:160 (52.5%), 18-30 years' age group (64%), females (53%), 'O' Rh D positive blood group (51.5%).

Even though AA is the most frequent cause of surgery from abdominal pain, little is known about the origins and etiopathogenesis of this disease, much less regarding the different disease types. In this study, we investigated the microbiome of samples from the appendix, rectum and peritoneum of 60 children and adolescents with AA to assess the composition and potential function of bacteria, archaea and fungi. The analysis of the appendix microbial community revealed a shift depending on the severity of the AA. This shift was reflected by two major community state types that represented the complicated and uncomplicated cases. We could demonstrate that complicated, but not uncomplicated, appendicitis is associated with a significant local expansion of oral, bacterial pathogens in the appendix, most strongly influenced by necrotizing Fusobacterium spp., Porphyromonas and Parvimonas. Uncomplicated appendicitis, however, was characterised by gut-associated microbiomes. Our findings support the hypothesis that two disease types exist in AA, which cannot be distinguished beyond doubt using standard clinical characterization methods or by analysis of the patients rectal microbiome. An advanced microbiome diagnosis, however, could improve non-surgical treatment of uncomplicated AA. Importance With a lifetime risk of up to 17%, acute appendicitis is one of the most frequent causes of emergency abdominal surgery in westernized countries. Latest literature reports suggests that appendicitis manifests in two disease types: complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis with different, yet unknown, etiopathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the microbial composition (bacteria, archaea and fungi) from 60 children and adolescents that were diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Appendix, rectal and peritoneal samples were analysed using amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. Our results suggest that acute appendicitis manifests in three microbial state types that reflect complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis as well as special cases that are caused by bacterial overgrowth. Strikingly, uncomplicated appendicitis appears to be caused by gut-associated pathogens while complicated appendicitis is driven by oral-associated microbes such as Fusobacterium sp. or Porphyromonas sp. The findings provided in our study are of special interest to understand the etiopathogenesis of both complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis.","output":"Acute appendicitis manifests as two microbiome state types with oral pathogens influencing severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line is commonly used for the production of biotherapeutics.

Single knockout of Cyp1a2, Atp5s, or Dgki, but not P3h2, resulted in a more than 90% increase in specific antibody productivity.

Nine vaccinated macaques exhibited significantly reduced viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs on day 2 post-challenge compared to nine unvaccinated controls. The viral control in the absence of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs was significantly correlated with vaccine-induced viral antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses.

Six cases were identified and described together with their outcome. RESULTS: Major bleeding occurred in six of the 25 studied patients. Four patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation at the onset of the bleed, two required embolization for bleeding control and one died from hemorrhagic shock. Half of the described cases had unusual sites of bleeding including gluteal and abdominal wall muscles. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of major bleeding was witnessed in our sample of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, with the majority being on therapeutic anticoagulation.

METHODS: We examine CSCs in 35 states and code how they approach disability, comparing states that have revised their plans to those that have not. We offer ethical and legal analyses evaluating to what extent changes to state policy aligned with disability rights law and ethics during the early pandemic and subsequently, as stakeholder engagement grew. FINDINGS: While disability rights views were not well represented in CSCs that were not updated or updated early in the pandemic, states that revised their plans later in the pandemic were more aligned with advocate priorities. However, many CSCs continue to include concerning provisions, especially the reliance on long-term survival, which implicates considerations of both disability rights and racial justice. CONCLUSIONS: The disability rights movement's successes in influencing state triage policy should inform future CSCs and set the stage for further work on how stakeholders influence bioethics policy debates.

Objective: To determine the impact of mandatory social isolation measures on the subjective well-being of Latin American and Caribbean dentists during the community quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Cross-sectional study in a sample of 1195 dentists from 21 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The main outcome was Subjective Well-Being, evaluated through the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). In addition, sociodemographic characteristics, variables related to the community quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic and health variables were considered. A descriptive, bivariate and multivariate (multiple linear regression) analysis was performed to observe the behavior of the variables. RESULTS: A multiple linear regression analysis was performed, where all the variables included within dimensions, were distributed in a single model, observing an R2% of 9.000 (p<0.001), where the R2% change was significant (p<0.001) and a constant of 44.190; likewise, within this model, the variable follow-up of preventive measures against COVID-19 reported an unstandardized regression coefficient (b) of 2. 316 (95%CI:1.133-3.499;p<0.001), the self-perceived level of concern against COVID-19 obtained a (b) of -5.470 (95%CI:-7.509--3.430; p<0.001), the biological sex variable manifested a (b) of -5.417 (95%CI: - 1.157-1.910; p<0.001); finally, the level of economic income during compulsory social isolation presented a (b)=5.354 (CI95%:3.461- 7.247; p<0.001).

We then determine the results that would have been obtained if the genotyping tests most widely used in Spanish gamete banks had been applied. METHODS: In this descriptive observational study, 1818 gamete donors were characterised by NGS. The pathogenic variants detected were analysed to estimate the probability of high-risk genetic matching and to determine the results that would have been obtained if the three most commonly used genotyping tests in ART had been applied. RESULTS: The probability of high-risk genetic matching with gamete donation, screened by NGS and complete gene analysis, was 5.5%, versus the 0.6-2.7% that would have been obtained with the genotyping test. A total of 1741 variants were detected, including 607 different variants, of which only 22.6% would have been detected by all three genotyping tests considered and 44.7% of which would not have been detected by any of these tests. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the considerable heterogeneity of the genotyping tests, which present significant differences in their ability to detect pathogenic variants. The complete study of the genes by NGS considerably reduces reproductive risks when genetic matching is performed with gamete donors. Accordingly, we recommend that carrier screening in gamete donors be carried out using NGS and a complete study with nontargeted analysis of the variants of the screened genes.","output":"Probability of high-risk genetic matching with oocyte and semen donors: complete gene analysis or genotyping test?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We used what is to our knowledge a new method to estimate volume loss after partial nephrectomy to assess the relative contributions of ischemic injury and volume loss on functional outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the records of 301 consecutive patients who underwent conventional partial nephrectomy between 2007 and 2010 with available data to meet inclusion criteria. Percent functional volume preservation was measured at a median of 1.4 years after surgery. Modification of diet in renal disease-2 estimated glomerular filtration rate was measured preoperatively and perioperatively, and a median of 1.2 years postoperatively. Statistical analysis was done to study associations. RESULTS Hypothermia or warm ischemia 25 minutes or less was applied in 75% of cases. Median percent functional volume preservation was 91% (range 38%-107%). Percent glomerular filtration rate preservation at nadir and late time points was 77% and 90% of preoperative glomerular filtration rate, respectively. On multivariate analysis percent functional volume preservation and warm ischemia time were associated with nadir glomerular filtration rate while only percent functional volume preservation was associated with late glomerular filtration rate (each p <0.001). Late percent glomerular filtration rate preservation and percent functional volume preservation were directly associated (p <0.001). Recovery of function to 90% or greater of percent functional volume preservation predicted levels was observed in 86% of patients. In patients with de novo postoperative stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease, percent functional volume preservation and Charlson score were associated with late percent glomerular filtration rate preservation. Warm ischemia time was not associated with late functional glomerular filtration rate decreases in patients considered high risk for ischemic injury. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort volume loss and not ischemia time was the primary determinant of ultimate renal function after partial nephrectomy. Technical modifications aimed at minimizing volume loss during partial nephrectomy while still achieving negative margins may result in improved functional outcomes.","output":"Functional recovery after partial nephrectomy: effects of volume loss and ischemic injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a new coronavirus was identified in the Hubei province of central china and named SARS-CoV-2. This new virus induces COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease with high death rate. A putative target to interfere with the virus is the host transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2). This enzyme is critical for the entry of coronaviruses into human cells by cleaving and activating the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2. Repositioning approved, investigational and experimental drugs on the serine protease domain of TMPRSS2 could thus be valuable. There is no experimental structure for TMPRSS2 but it is possible to develop quality structural models for the serine protease domain using comparative modeling strategies as such domains are highly structurally conserved. Beside the TMPRSS2 catalytic site, we predicted on our structural models a main exosite that could be important for the binding of protein partners and/or substrates. To block the catalytic site or the exosite of TMPRSS2 we used structure-based virtual screening computations and two different collections of approved, investigational and experimental drugs. We propose a list of 156 molecules that could bind to the catalytic site and 100 compounds that may interact with the exosite. These small molecules should now be tested in vitro to gain novel insights over the roles of TMPRSS2 or as starting point for the development of second generation analogs.","output":"Structure-based drug repositioning over the human TMPRSS2 protease domain: search for chemical probes able to repress SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein cleavages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, there is little data on the effect of coronavirus infection COVID-19 on pregnancy, childbirth, the condition of the fetus, and the postpartum period The article describes a clinical case of severe coronavirus infection of COVID-19 in a pregnant patient, with the rapid development of acute respiratory distress syndrome","output":"new coronavirus infection (CoVID-19) in a pregnant woman (clinical case)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques permit shorter postoperative length of stay (LOS). However, it remains unknown whether earlier discharge increases the risk of adverse postoperative events. We examined whether shorter LOS following elective VATS lung resection was associated with increased rates of readmission or postoperative complications. METHODS: Patients who underwent elective thoracoscopic segmentectomy, lobectomy, or bilobectomy for lung neoplasms from 2011 to 2018 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Postoperative LOS was treated as an ordinal variable. The examined outcomes were 30-d readmission and 30-d postdischarge death or serious morbidity (DSM). Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated the association of LOS with outcomes. The most common readmission diagnoses were identified for each operation. RESULTS: Among 14,418 patients, 12,410 (86.1%) underwent lobectomy, 1764 (12.2%) underwent segmentectomy, and 244 (1.7%) underwent bilobectomy. The median LOS was 3 d for patients undergoing lobectomy (IQR 2-5) and segmentectomy (IQR 2-4), and 4 d for bilobectomy (IQR 3-6). Readmission rates varied with admission time and ranged from 5.0% for patients with LOS 1 d to 8.5% for LOS 5 d. The most common readmission diagnoses were pneumothorax (19.0%) and wound complications (13.4%). Each one-day increase in LOS was associated with an increased risk of readmission (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.17, P < 0.001). No association was seen between earlier discharge and DSM (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.99-1.18, P = 0.070).

Information related to protection mechanisms is heterogeneous, and the infected HCWs number is increasing. This review intends to summarize the current knowledge and practices to protect ICU personnel during the patient management process in the context of the current pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: The transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly respiratory droplets, aerosols, and contact. The virus can last for a few hours suspended in the air and be viable on surfaces for several days. Some procedures carried out in the ICU can generate aerosols. The shortage of respirators, such as the N95, has generated an increase in the demand for other protective equipment in critical care settings. SUMMARY: The probability of transmission depends on the characteristics of the pathogen, the availability of quality personal protective equipment, and the human factors associated with the performance of health workers.

The clinical spectrum of MIS-C ranges from mild to severe, and even to mortal multisystem involvement. To guide clinicians, we evaluated detailed demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcomes of MIS-C cases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with MIS-C who were managed in the Department of Pediatric Infectious Disease in the Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey. MIS-C patients were divided into three clinical severity groups (mild, moderate, and severe) and separated into three age groups (< 5 years, 5-10 years, > 10 years). We compared the characteristics of MIS-C cases according to the severity of the disease and by age groups. RESULT: Thirty-six children with MIS-C were evaluated (52.8% male, median age of 7.8 years). A clinical spectrum overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD) was the most common presentation (69.4%) in all age groups. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (100%), mucocutaneous rash (69.4%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (66.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in echocardiographic abnormality between KD-like and the other clinical spectra (p > 0.05). All life-threatening rhythm disturbances were observed in severe cases. No patients died. CONCLUSION: It is important to increase the awareness of physicians about the MIS-C disease, which can present with different combinations of different systemic findings, so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Key Points a? A single tertiary centre study shows that children with MIS-C can present with different clinic spectra other than Kawasaki diseases. a? Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluation is important in early diagnosis of children with MIS-C. a? Pro-BNP can be used as a screening test in the emergency room for children with prolonged and unexplained fever for determine early cardiac involvement of MIS-C. a?

Although less common than venous thromboembolism, arterial thrombosis has been reported in COVID-19 cohorts in almost 3% of patients. We describe a patient with COVID-19 infection and concurrent cerebral and noncerebral infarction. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old man with history of COVID-19 pneumonia was admitted to a primary stroke center for speech disturbances and left hemiplegia. Urgent laboratory tests showed a great increase of inflammatory and coagulation parameters as D-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein. Neuroimaging found occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with early signs of ischemic stroke. He received intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Abdominal computed tomography discovered a splenic infarction with hemorrhagic transformation and bilateral renal infarction. Urgent angiography showed an associated splenic pseudoaneurysm, which was embolized without complications. He was treated with intermediate-dose anticoagulation (1 mg subcutaneous enoxaparin/kg/24 h), acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and 5 days of intravenous corticosteroids. In the following days, inflammatory markers decreased so anticoagulant treatment was stopped and acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg was prescribed. His condition improved and he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on hospital day 30. CONCLUSION: In this case, a patient with multiple thrombotic events in the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, the delimitation of the inflammatory state through analytical markers as D-dimer helped to individualize the antithrombotic treatment (full anticoagulation or anticoagulation at intermediate doses plus antiplatelet treatment as used in our patient) and its duration.

Post-acute care use and hospital readmission appear to be common after critical illness. It is unknown whether specialty critical care units have different readmission rates and what these trends have been over time. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a cohort of 53,539 medical/surgical patients who were treated in a critical care unit during their index admission were compared with 209,686 patients who were not treated in a critical care unit. The primary outcome was 30-day all cause hospital readmission. Secondary outcomes included post-acute care resource use and immediate readmission, defined as within 7 days of discharge. RESULTS: Compared to patients discharged after an index hospitalization without critical illness, surviving patients following ICU admission were not more likely to be rehospitalized within 30 days (15.8 vs. 16.1%, p = 0.08). However, they were more likely to receive post-acute care services (45.3% vs. 70.9%, p < 0.001) as well as be rehospitalized within 7 days (5.2 vs. 6.0%, p < 0.001). Post-acute care use and 30-day readmission rates varied by ICU type, the latter ranging from 11.7% after admission in a cardiothoracic critical care unit to 23.1% after admission in a medical critical care unit. 30-day readmission after ICU admission did not decline between 2010 and 2015 (p = 0.38). Readmission rates declined over time for 2 of 4 targeted conditions (heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), but only when the hospitalization did not include ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Rehospitalization for survivors following ICU admission is common across all specialty critical care units. Post-acute care use is also common for this population of patients. Overall trends for readmission rates after critical illness did not change over time, and readmission reductions for targeted conditions were limited to hospitalizations that did not include an ICU admission.","output":"Hospital Readmission and Post-Acute Care Use After Intensive Care Unit Admissions: New ICU Quality Metrics?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates incorporating community well-being metrics into the objectives of optimization algorithms and the teams that build them.

This study explores the characteristics and uses of the medial sural artery perforator flap along with postoperative outcomes and complications. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify all cases of medial sural artery perforator flap reconstruction. Descriptive and meta-analyses were performed on pooled outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with increased complication rates. RESULTS Thirty-five studies encompassing 526 medial sural artery perforator flaps were included for analysis. The most common reasons for surgery were oncologic (47.6 percent) and traumatic injuries (31.8 percent). The oral cavity was the most common recipient location (45.5 percent). Average flap dimensions were 6.0  2.3 cm  9.8  3.6 cm, with an average pedicle length of 10.1  6.6 cm. Meta-analysis revealed an overall complication rate of 14.3 percent (Q value = 22.16; p = 0.877; I(2)= -39.9). Use of chimeric medial sural artery perforator flaps was associated with significantly higher rates of complications (OR, 3.92; p = 0.039; 95 percent CI, 1.10 to 13.89). The majority of flap donor sites were closed primarily (68 percent) versus 32 percent that were covered with split-thickness skin grafts. A flap width greater than 5.75 cm had an odds ratio of 5.3 (95 percent CI, 1.3 to 21.8; p = 0.014) of having a donor-site complication if closed primarily. CONCLUSIONS The medial sural artery perforator flap offers thin, pliable tissue with a relatively long pedicle and has minimal donor-site morbidity when the donor site is managed appropriately.

The distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) from bioinformatics evidence, the autopsy report for COVID-19 and the published study on sperm quality indicated COVID-19 could have a negative impact on male fertility. However, whether the negative impact of COVID-19 on male fertility is persistent remains unknown, which requires long-term follow-up investigation. Methods: Semen samples were collected from 36 male COVID-19 patients with a median recovery time of 177.5 days and 45 control subjects. Then, analysis of sperm quality and alterations of total sperm number with recovery time were performed. Results: There was no significant difference in semen parameters between male recovered patients and control subjects. And the comparisons of semen parameters between first follow-up and second follow-up revealed no significant difference. In addition, we explored the alterations of sperm count with recovery time. It showed that the group with recovery time of 120 and <150 days had a significantly lower total sperm number than controls while the other two groups with recovery time of 150 days displayed no significance with controls, and total sperm number showed a significant decline after a recovery time of 90 days and an improving trend after a recovery time of about 150 days. Conclusions: The sperm quality of COVID-19 recovered patients improved after a recovery time of nearly half a year, while the total sperm number showed an improvement after a recovery time of about 150 days.

Nevertheless, as long as the fiscal and monetary policies of two countries are not extremely active, but active to a certain extent, the equilibrium point becomes locally stable. Furthermore, even if the business cycles are not synchronized, the purchase of government bonds of a particular country is effective in stabilizing the business cycles of both countries.

The objective of this study was to review information published to date on pAmpC-BL in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and on the epidemiology and detection methods used by clinical microbiology laboratories, by performing a systematic review using the MEDLINE PubMed database. The predictive capacity of a screening method to detect AmpC-BL using disks with cloxacillin (CLX) was also evaluated by studying 102 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates grown in CHROMID ESBL medium with the addition of cefepime (FEP), cefoxitin (FOX), ertapenem (ETP), CLX, and oxacillin with CLX. The review, which included 149 publications, suggests that certain risk factors (prolonged hospitalization and previous use of cephalosporins) are associated with infections by pAmpC-BL-producing microorganisms. The worldwide prevalence has increased over the past 10 years, with a positivity rate ranging between 0.1 and 40%, although AmpC was only detected when sought in a targeted manner. CMY-2 type has been the most prevalent pAmpC-BL-producing microorganism. The most frequently used phenotypic method has been the double-disk synergy test (using CLX disks or phenyl-boronic acid and cefotaxime [CTX] and ceftazidime) and the disk method combined with these inhibitors. In regard to screening methods, a 1-g oxacillin disk with CLX showed 88.9% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value (PPV), 98.9% negative predictive value (NPV), and 98.9% validity index (VI). This predictive capacity is reduced with the addition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, showing 62.5% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV, 93.5% NPV, and 94.1% VI. In conclusion, there has been a worldwide increase in the number of isolates with pAmpC-BL, especially in Asia, with CMY-2 being the most frequently detected pAmpC-BL-producing type of microorganism. Reduction in its spread requires routine screening with a combination of phenotypic methods (with AmpC inhibitors) and genotypic methods (multiplex PCR). In conclusion, the proposed screening technique is an easy-to-apply and inexpensive test for the detection of AmpC-producing isolates in the routine screening of multidrug-resistant microorganisms.","output":"Systematic Review of Plasmid AmpC Type Resistances in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Preliminary Proposal of a Simplified Screening Method for ampC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein S-acylation is the reversible addition of fatty acids to the cysteine residues of target proteins.

The most common presenting symptom was compressive symptoms, present in 15 patients (55.6%). None of the GVBAs was ruptured. Of the 27 GVBAs, 23 aneurysms were dissecting aneurysm with intramural hematoma and 4 aneurysms were saccular. Regarding treatment approach, internal trapping was used in 5 aneurysms, stent-assisted coil embolization in 10, sole stenting in 4, and flow diverters in 8. Overall, 12 patients (44.4%) had an unfavorable angiographic or clinical outcome: 3 patients presented with post-operative complications and subsequent death, and 9 with poor prognosis during follow-up. Conclusions: Patients with GVBAs may not benefit from endovascular treatment. Newer-generation devices are necessary to provide more optimal therapy for the management of these complex lesions.","output":"Unfavorable Outcomes Related to Endovascular Treatment of Giant Vertebrobasilar Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 crisis has led to a sharp deterioration in firm and bank balance sheets.

The crosscutting impacts of the virus, individual country responses to the virus, and the state of preparedness of local public health systems greatly vary across the world. The ostensibly late arrival of the virus in Africa has allowed learning, innovation, and adaptation of methods that have been successful in the early-hit countries. This article analyzes how Singapore has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes that adaptations of the Singapore pandemic response model would bode well for Africa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that also take into account regional differences in health care infrastructures, socioeconomic resilience, poverty, and the vast population diversity in the African continent. As the pandemic evolves, the lessons learned in Asia, in particular, and the emerging new experiences in African countries should inform, ideally in real time, how best to steer the world populations into safety, including those in low-resource health care settings. Finally, we note that the current COVID-19 pandemic is also a test for our collective ability to scale and surge public health in response to future and likely equally challenging zoonosis infections that jump from animals to humans, not to mention climate change-related planetary health calamities in the 21st century.

It may, however, also persist in a pathological condition incurring significant burden. While subjective symptoms and scientific consensus indicate that both physical and mental determinants of motivated behavior are affected in fatigue, the underlying processes are rarely examined using objective, task-based indicators. MethodsIn three consecutive studies, including validation (N = 48) and reliability assessments (N = 27), we use an experimental task to jointly objectify reward learning and effort execution as two determinants of behavioral motivation. In addition, we tested how fatigue and its acute perturbation in response to immune activation after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are linked to these task-based indicators of motivation in a longitudinal cross-over design (N = 55). ResultsThe validation study showed the utility of the experimental task for simultaneously assessing learning, effort exertion, and its regulation based on subjective confidence. The reliability assessment over a one-week period indicated that symptoms of fatigue and task behavior are highly reliable and that repetition effects have little impact on motivated behavior. Finally, in the vaccination trial, we found significant links between fatigue and task behavior. Baseline levels of fatigue predicted how effort is gauged in dependence of current confidence about reward outcomes, and state perturbations of fatigue in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduced confidence during learning. Importantly, task success was significantly lower in subjects who reported high fatigue at baseline and who additionally experienced stronger increase in fatigue in response to vaccination. DiscussionOur results demonstrate that the experimental task allows to jointly assess determinants of motivated behavior, and to link its constituent processes to subjective fatigue. This suggests that our understanding of fatigue and its perturbation due to acute immune activation can benefit from objective, task-based indicators of the underlying motivational mechanisms. Future studies could build on these findings to further deepen the understanding of neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying fatigue in the context of immune activation.","output":"Determinants of motivated behavior are linked to fatigue and its perturbation by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We combine observations from Western USA and inverse modelling to constrain global atmospheric emissions of microplastics (MPs) and microfibers (MFs).

Since containment measures have disrupted many data collection and research efforts, studies have had to rely on existing data or design new approaches to gathering relevant information. OBJECTIVE This article reviews the literature that has been produced on children's exposure to violence during the pandemic to understand emerging patterns and critically appraise methodologies to help inform the design of future studies. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING The study entailed a search of working papers, technical reports, and journal articles. METHODS The search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and reports published between March 1 and December 31, 2020. The sources were assessed according to scope and study design. RESULTS The review identified 48 recent working papers, technical reports, and journal articles on the impact of COVID-19 on violence against children. In terms of scope and methods, the review led to three main findings: 1) Studies have focused on physical or psychological violence at home and less attention has been paid to other forms of violence against children, 2) most studies have relied on administrative records, while other data sources, such as surveys or big data, were less commonly employed, and 3) different definitions and study designs were used to gather data directly, resulting in findings that are hardly generalizable. With respect to children's experience of violence, the review led to four main findings: 1) Studies found a decrease in police reports and referrals to child protective services, 2) mixed results were found with respect to the number of calls to police or domestic violence helplines, 3) articles showed an increase in child abuse-related injuries treated in hospitals, and 4) surveys reported an increase in family violence. CONCLUSIONS This review underscores the persistent challenges affecting the availability and quality of data on violence against children, including the absence of standards for measuring this sensitive issue as well as the limited availability of baseline data. Future research on COVID-19 and violence against children should address some of the gaps identified in this review.","output":"COVID-19 and violence against children: A review of early studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 5 million deaths worldwide.

Indeed, COVID-19 patients display increased thrombophilia with arterial and venous embolism and lung microcapillary thrombotic disease as major determinants of deaths. The pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 is not completely understood. We have investigated the role of subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1SP) in eliciting endothelial barrier dysfunction, characterized dose and time relationships, and tested the hypothesis that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors would prevent and repair such injury. S1SP activated (phosphorylated) IKB, STAT3, and AKT and reduced the expression of intercellular junctional proteins, occludin, and VE-cadherin. HSP90 inhibitors (AT13387 and AUY-922) prevented endothelial barrier dysfunction and hyperpermeability and reduced IKB and AKT activation. These two inhibitors also blocked S1SP-mediated barrier dysfunction and loss of VE-cadherin. These data suggest that spike protein subunit 1 can elicit, by itself, direct injury to the endothelium and suggest a role of HSP90 inhibitors in preserving endothelial functionality.","output":"HSP90 Inhibitors Modulate SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Subunit 1-Induced Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Activation and Barrier Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, we will discuss concepts of information diffusion in social networks.

The aim of this study was evaluate the characteristics of two multi-center cohorts of HNC patients admitted for dyspnea. Methods: .. The therapeutic activity of four University Departments of Otolaryngology was studied over two time periods: September-February 2019/2020 and 2020/2021. Results: . A group of 136 HNC patients who underwent tracheotomy in two time cohorts, pre-COVID-19 (N = 59) and COVID-19 (N = 77), were analyzed. The mean tracheotomy incidence proportion was 1.82% (SD: 1.12) for the pre-COVID-19 and 3.79% (SD: 2.76) for the COVID-19 period. A rise in emergency dyspnea was observed in the COVID-19 cohort.

Because of their origin in the bat enteric system, we wondered if severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) also use bacterial components to modulate infectivity. To test this question, we incubated CoVs with LPS and PG and evaluated infectivity, finding no change following LPS treatment. However, PG from Bacillus subtilis reduced infection >10,000-fold, while PG from other bacterial species failed to recapitulate this. Treatment with an alcohol solvent transferred inhibitory activity to the wash, and mass spectrometry revealed surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, as the inhibitory compound. This antibiotic had robust dose- and temperature-dependent inhibition of CoV infectivity. Mechanistic studies indicated that surfactin disrupts CoV virion integrity, and surfactin treatment of the virus inoculum ablated infection in vivo. Finally, similar cyclic lipopeptides had no effect on CoV infectivity, and the inhibitory effect of surfactin extended broadly to enveloped viruses, including influenza, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, chikungunya, Una, Mayaro, Dugbe, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. Overall, our results indicate that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin has broad viricidal activity and suggest that bacteria by-products may negatively modulate virus infection. IMPORTANCE In this article, we consider a role for bacteria in shaping coronavirus infection. Taking cues from studies of enteric viruses, we initially investigated how bacterial surface components might improve CoV infection. Instead, we found that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin is a potent viricidal compound that disrupts virion integrity with broad activity against enveloped viruses.

METHODS: This single-blind randomized controlled study included 231 patients with femoral intertrochanteric fracture treated in our hospital from January 2017 to December 2020. All patients were randomized into two groups, the FICB group (n = 116) and the general anesthesia group (control group, n = 115). The serum NLRP3 levels and inflammatory factors were evaluated. The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and SpO(2) values were recorded. Pain condition was measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) score. Harris score was performed for positive hip function. RESULTS: The values of HR and MAP were significantly lower after anesthesia induction in FICB groups compared with the control group. However, no significant difference was found for SpO(2). Compared with the control group, the VAS scores within 72 h after surgery were all markedly lower in the FICB group than in the control group and showed no significant difference at 1 week after surgery. The levels of NLRP3 and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were significantly lower in FICB patients at 1 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after surgery compared with the control group. Tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) showed a significant lower level in the FICB group at 1 h and 6 h after surgery, and significant lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were found at 1 h and 24 h after surgery compared with the control group. Positive correlation was found between NLRP3 and IL-6, as well as CRP and VAS scores after 1 h of the surgery. No significant difference was found for both Harris score and postoperative complications between the two groups.

It is known that GP interacts with cellular C-type lectins for virus attachment to cells. Since primary target cells of filoviruses express C-type lectins, C-type lectin-mediated entry is thought to be a possible determinant of virus tropism and pathogenesis. We compared the efficiency of C-type lectin-mediated entry between Marburg virus strains Angola and Musoke by using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype system. VSV pseudotyped with Angola GP (VSV-Angola) infected K562 cells expressing the C-type lectin, human macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (hMGL), or dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) more efficiently than VSV pseudotyped with Musoke GP (VSV-Musoke). Unexpectedly, the binding affinity of the C-type lectins to the carbohydrates on GPs did not correlate with the different efficiency of C-type lectin-mediated entry. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the amino acid at position 547, which switched the efficiency of C-type lectin-mediated entry. In a three-dimensional model of GP, this amino acid was in close proximity to the putative site of cathepsin processing. Interestingly, the cathepsin inhibitors reduced the infectivity of VSV-Angola less efficiently than that of VSV-Musoke in C-type lectin-expressing K562 cells, whereas only a limited difference was found in control cells. The amino acid at position 547 was critical for the different effects of the inhibitors on the virus infectivities.

The most important of these economic changes in developing countries with high fragility is exchange rates, because exchange rates can directly affect many macroeconomic variables, from inflation to foreign trade, from the balance of payments to interests. In countries with high fragility due to the effect of pandemic, economic uncertainty causes fluctuations in the exchange rate. Is the reason for the change in the exchange rate, the number of cases or economic risks that may occur due to possible health problems?In this study, the impact of the number of new cases and the number of new deaths for the process of Covid-19 pandemic on the exchange rate in Turkey is examined. The daily data consider the number of new cases, the number of new deaths and exchange rate for the period of 16.03.2020C06.05.2020.

The partial immunity already offered by the first dose and the high levels of uncertainty in the vaccine supplies have been characteristic of most of the vaccines used worldwide and made the planning of such a vaccination campaign extremely complex. Motivated by this compelling challenge, we propose a stochastic optimization framework for optimally scheduling a two-dose vaccination campaign in the presence of uncertain supplies, taking into account constraints on the time that should elapse between the two doses and on the capacity of the healthcare system. The proposed framework seeks to maximize the vaccination coverage, considering the different levels of immunization obtained with partial (one dose only) and complete vaccination (two doses).

The analysis emphasized on characteristics of patients with positive PCR or serology of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV2 PCR. Serum specimens were tested for SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgM. Clinical presentations of the patients, history of chronic diseases or drug use, contact with a possible COVID-19 patient and previous infection with SARS-COV2 were investigated. RESULTS: Of the total 1,363 investigated patients, 22% had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCRs, 82% had positive IgG, 38% had positive IgM, and 31% had both positive IgM and IgG values. Positive serologic tests were significantly associated with a positive PCR test obtained previously in the course of the current disease (P value<0.001). IgG and IgM antibody values were significantly associated with underlying disease, cough, fever, chills, fatigue, and myalgia (all P values <0.001). Dyspnea was significantly associated with IgG levels (P value = 0.01), yet it was not associated with IgM serology (P value = 0.2).

With all medical resources being dedicated to contain the spread of the disease, the pandemic may have impacted the burden of other infectious diseases such as dengue, particularly in countries endemic for dengue fever. Indeed, the co\\\\occurrence of COVID\\\\19 made dengue diagnosis challenging because of some shared clinical manifestations between the two pathogens. Furthermore, the sudden emergence and novelty of this global public health crisis has forced the suspension or slow-down of several research trials due to the lack of sufficient knowledge on how to handle the continuity of research trials during the pandemic. We report on challenges we have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic and measures that were implemented to continue the iDEM project (intervention for Dengue Epidemiology in Malaysia). METHODS: This randomized controlled trial aims to assess the effectiveness of Integrated Vector Management (IVM) on the incidence of dengue in urban Malaysia by combining: targeted outdoor residual spraying (TORS), deployment of auto-dissemination devices (ADDs), and active community engagement (CE). Our operational activities started on February 10, 2020, a few weeks before the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Malaysia. RESULTS: The three main issues affecting the continuity of the trial were: ensuring the safety of field workers during the interventions; ensuring the planned turnover of TORS application and ADD deployment and services; and maintaining the CE activities as far as possible. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the pandemic has created monumental challenges, we ensured the safety of field workers by providing complete personal protective equipment and regular COVID-19 testing. Albeit with delay, we maintained the planned interval time between TORS application and ADDs services by overlapping the intervention cycles instead of having them in a sequential scheme. CE activities continued remotely through several channels (e.g., phone calls and text messages). Sustained efforts of the management team, significant involvement of the Malaysian Ministry of Health and a quick and smart adaptation of the trial organisation according to the pandemic situation were the main factors that allowed the successful continuation of our research.

RESULTS: Two B cell linear epitopes, P104 and P82, located in non-RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were identified by indirect ELISA screening of an overlapping peptide library of the S protein with COVID-19 patients convalescent serum. And the peptides were verified by testing with 165 serum samples. P104 has not been reported previously; P82 is contained in peptide S21P2 reported before. The positive reaction rates of epitope peptides S14P5 and S21P2, the two non-RBD region epitopes identified by Poh et al., and P82 and P104 were 77.0%, 73.9%, 61.2% and 30.3%, respectively, for 165 convalescent sera, including 30 asymptomatic patients. Although P104 had the lowest positive rate for total patients (30.3%), it exhibited slight advantage for detection of asymptomatic infections (36.7%). Combination of epitopes significantly improved the positive reaction rate. Among all combination patterns, (S14P5 + S21P2 + P104) pattern exhibited the highest positive reaction rate for all patients (92.7%), as well as for asymptomatic infections (86.7%), confirming the feasibility of P104 as supplementary antigen for serological detection. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between epitopes with neutralizing antibody, but only S14P5 had a medium positive correlation with neutralizing antibody titre (r(s) = 0.510, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our research proved that epitopes on non-RBD region are of value in serological detection especially when combination more than one epitope, thus providing serological reaction information about the four epitopes, which has valuable references for their usage.

Background: Protective measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with isolation among people in need of elderly care. Due to the known adverse effects of social isolation on health, discussions have been held about the ethical legitimacy and commensurability of these measures. AIM: The article aims to show in which format the discourse in scientific publication on protective measures against COVID-19 took place and which contents have been addressed. METHODS: A mapping review in PubMed has been conducted. All publication types of scientific papers on nursing care of older people were considered. The results were synthesized in form of a quantitative content analysis of key aspects. RESULTS: The 38 articles included in the synthesis show that only a small part of the scientific publications on the COVID-19 pandemic deals with people living in nursing homes. Although critical aspects related to the isolation caused by the protective measures against the COVID-19 pandemic are named in half of the contributions, specific measures to address the negative effects of the isolation are rarely mentioned. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for further activities in research and nursing practice in order to meet the demand and desiderata of those in need of care and to enable personal responsibility and self-determination even in a special situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19-Schutzma?nahmen in der station?ren Altenpflege - Ein Mapping Review pflegewissenschaftlicher Publikationen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel beta coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is currently prevalent all over the world, causing thousands of deaths with relatively high virulence.

Due to impaired cellular immunity and physiological changes, pregnant women are susceptible to respiratory disease and are more likely to develop severe pneumonia. Given the prevalence of COVID-19, it is speculated that some pregnant women have already been infected. However, limited data are available for the clinical course and management of COVID-19 in pregnancy.

Corresponding selenoproteins play critical roles in protecting against reactive oxygen species and environmental stress. Using a novel animal model deficient in Alkbh8, we have investigated the importance of epitranscriptomic systems in the response to naphthalene (NA), an abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, glutathione depleter and lung toxicant found in tobacco smoke, gasoline and mothballs. Objectives Our goal was to define the molecular reprogramming of Alkbh8 deficient (Alkbh8def) mice and evaluate the roles that the epitranscriptomic writer ALKBH8 and selenoproteins play in mitigating NA-induced toxicity and lung dysfunction. Methods We performed basal lung analysis and NA exposure studies using WT, Alkbh8def and Cyp2abfgs-null mice, the latter of which lack the cytochrome P450 enzymes required for NA bioactivation. We characterized gene expression, molecular markers of damage, viability and tolerance to NA. Results Under basal conditions, lungs from Alkbh8def mice have increased oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and 8-isoprostane levels, and have reprogrammed at the molecular level to display increased stress response transcripts. In addition, the ALKBH8 writer deficient lungs have a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. Alkbh8def mice are more sensitive to NA than WT, showing higher susceptibility to lung damage both at the cellular and molecular levels. WT mice develop a tolerance to NA after 3 days, defined as resistance to a high challenging dose after repeated exposures, which is absent in Alkbh8def mice, with writer deficient not surviving NA exposure. Discussion We conclude that the epitranscriptomic writer ALKBH8 plays a protective role against NA-induced lung dysfunction and promotes NA tolerance.

We can show that it is strongly correlated with the more elaborate plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) ( = 0.9231, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, we present pre-clinical vaccine models using recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) and full-length spike antigen as immunogens showing a profound antibody neutralization capacity that exceeds the highest neutralization titers from convalescent individuals. Using a panel of novel high-affinity murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) we also show that majority of the RBD-raised mAbs have inhibitory properties while only a few of the spike-raised mAbs do. In conclusion, the ELISA-based viral neutralization test offers a time- and cost-effective alternative to the PRNT.

However, their accuracy at quantifying limb motion, and clinical acceptability, have not yet been demonstrated. To this end we conducted a two-stage study: First, we compared the inertial accuracy of wrist-worn IMUs, both research-grade (Xsens MTw Awinda, and Axivity AX3) and consumer-grade (Apple Watch Series 3 and 5), relative to gold-standard optical motion tracking (OptiTrack). Given the moderate to the strong performance of the consumer-grade sensors we then evaluated this sensor and surveyed the experiences and attitudes of hospital patients (N=44) and staff (N=15) following a clinical test in which patients wore smartwatches for 1.5-24 hours in the second study. Results indicate that for acceleration, Xsens is more accurate than the Apple smartwatches and Axivity AX3 (RMSE 0.17+/-0.01 g; R2 0.88+/-0.01; RMSE 0.22+/-0.01 g; R2 0.64+/-0.01; RMSE 0.42+/-0.01 g; R2 0.43+/-0.01, respectively).

This approach was validated in a large prospective cohort study of 1038 subjects, analysed simultaneously using (1) nasopharyngeal swabs obtained with the assistance of healthcare personnel and analysed by classic two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates and (2) nasal swabs obtained by self-collection and analysed with direct RT-qPCR. Of these subjects, 28.6% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swab sampling. Our direct RT-qPCR approach for self-collected nasal swabs performed well with results similar to those of the two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates, achieving 0.99 positive and 0.98 negative predictive values (cycle threshold [Ct] < 37). Our research also reports on grey-zone viraemia, including samples with near-cut-off Ct values (Ct &#8805; 37). In all investigated subjects (n = 20) with grey-zone viraemia, the ultra-small viral load disappeared within hours or days with no symptoms.

Dairy herds (n = 24) with a high percentage of neonatal calves scouring (>10%) were included and calves were sampled for the presence of these four enteropathogens. To decrease diarrhoea problems among neonatal calves, a standard protocol was tested on 13 herds (treatment group) where both C. parvum and either E. coli or rota- or coronavirus were identified as being involved, the other 11 herds served as control group. The protocol consisted of 2 points of action: preventive vaccination of dams against E. coli, rota- and coronavirus, and preventive administration of halofuginone lactate to newborn calves. The average percentage of calves suffering from neonatal diarrhoea (39.7% versus 14.3%, P < 0.01) and the average percentage of faecal samples positive for C. parvum (34% versus 11%, P < 0.05) differed significantly between control herds and treatment herds after implementation of the protocol.

It seems that although the mature virus did not reach the CNS or PNS of the majority of patients, its unassembled components and/or the accompanying immune-mediated responses may be responsible for the observed neurological symptoms. The viral particles and/or its components have been specifically documented in endothelial cells of lung, kidney, skin, and CNS.

Aim: To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Methods: 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020. We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups. Results: Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020. The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6). 12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms. 14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings.

Here, we investigate the efficacy of imported case detection considering quarantine length and different testing measures for travellers on arrival. METHODS: We examine eight broad border control strategies from utilizing quarantine alone, pre-testing, entry and exit testing, and testing during quarantine. In comparing the efficacy of these strategies, we calculate the probability of detecting travellers who have been infected up to 2 weeks pre-departure according to their estimated incubation and infectious period. We estimate the number of undetected infected travellers permitted entry for these strategies across a prevalence range of 0.1C2% per million travellers. RESULTS: At 14-day quarantine, on average 2.2% (range: 0.5C8.2%) of imported infections are missed across the strategies, leading to 22 (5C82) imported cases at 0.1% prevalence per million travellers, increasing up to 430 (106C1641) at 2%. The strategy utilizing exit testing results in 3.9% (3.1C4.9%) of imported cases being missed at 7-day quarantine, down to 0.4% (0.3C0.7%) at 21-day quarantine, and the introduction of daily testing, as the most risk averse strategy, reduces the proportion further to 2.5C4.2% at day 7 and 0.1C0.2% at day 21 dependent on the tests used. Rapid antigen testing every 3 days in quarantine leads to 3% being missed at 7 days and 0.7% at 14 days, which is comparable to PCR testing with a 24-hour turnaround. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory testing, at a minimal of pre-testing and on arrival, is strongly recommended where the length of quarantining should then be determined by the destination countrys level of risk averseness, pandemic preparedness and origin of travellers.

There is an urgent need for effective drugs or vaccines which can effectively combat this outbreak. The main protease (Mpro), a key component for the SARS CoV-2 replication, is considered to be one of the important drug targets for developing anti-COVID-19 drugs. This SARS CoV-2 Mpro/cysteine protease has high sequence similarity with the same protease from SARS CoV-1. Previously, it has been shown experimentally that eight diterpenoids and four biflavonoids derived from the leaf of Torreya nucifera show inhibitory effect on the cleavage/catalytic activity of the SARS CoV-1 Mpro. But whether these phytochemicals exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is unclear. To understand this fact, here, we have adopted various in-silico approaches. Diterpenoids and biflavonoids those qualified pharmacological test (hinokiol, amentoflavone, bilobetin and ginkgetin) and two well-known Mpro inhibitors (N3 and lopinavir) were subjected for molecular docking studies. Only three biflavonoids (amentoflavone, bilobetin and ginkgetin) were selected by comparing their binding affinities with N3 and lopinavir. They interacted with two most important catalytic residues of Mpro (His41 and Cys145). Molecular dynamics studies further revealed that these three Mpro-biflavonoid complexes are highly stable and share a similar degree of compactness. Besides, these complexes experience less conformational fluctuations and more expansion than Mpro-N3 and/or Mpro-lopinavir complex. MM-GBSA and H-bond analysis further corroborated these findings. Altogether, our study suggested that these three biflavonoids could possibly inhibit the proteolytic/catalytic activity of SARS CoV-2 Mpro and might be useful for COVID-19 treatment.

It is unclear whether such differences are due to factors at the level of the human host, or at the level of the coronavirus, or both. At the host level, the entry proteins which allow virus binding and entry have variants with distinct properties, and the frequency of such variants differs between ethnicities. At the level of the virus, the D614G mutation enhances virus entry to the host cell. Since the two virus strains (D614 and G614) co-existed in the first six months of the pandemic in most populations, it has been difficult to distinguish between contributions of the virus and contributions of the host for anosmia. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in South Asian populations when either the D614 or the G614 virus was dominant. We show that populations infected predominantly with the G614 virus had a much higher prevalence of anosmia (pooled prevalence of 31.8%) compared with the same ethnic populations infected mostly with the D614 virus strain (pooled anosmia prevalence of 5.3%). We conclude that the D614G mutation is a major contributing factor that increases the prevalence of anosmia in COVID-19, and that this enhanced effect on olfaction constitutes a previously unrecognized phenotype of the D614G mutation. The new virus strains that have additional mutations on the background of the D614G mutation can be expected to cause a similarly increased prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions.

Brazilian CHWs are overwhelmingly women from poor backgrounds, with precarious and sometimes hazardous working conditions, as well as fragmented and unsystematic training. This paper evaluates how the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities of CHWs (pertaining to low salary, precarious and hazardous working conditions and inadequate training) and created new ones, with a profound impact on their ability to carry out health promotion activities. Drawing on testimonials of dozens of CHWs and online discussions promoted by their unions, the paper reveals that during the pandemic CHWs were asked to continue their work without adequate training and protective equipment, thus exposing themselves to the risk of infection. It further shows how the pandemic rendered dangerous the close interaction with patients that is at the heart of their health promotion role. Nonetheless, CHWs sought to adapt their work. In the absence of leadership and coordination on the part of the federal government, CHWs mobilized different forms of resistance at the national and individual levels. Despite this, COVID-19 contributed to a trajectory of erosion of health promotion in Brazil.

Anxiety has been associated with poor diet quality and weight gain, which may lead to obesity, a risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The present study was designed to examine associations between diet quality and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This cross-sectional, international online study was conducted between March 30 and April 25, 2020 and available in seven languages: Arabic (7.6%), English (43.7%), French (0.8%), Hebrew (42.1%), Italian (3%), Russian (1.1%), and Spanish (1.6%). Diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score (possible range: 0-17 points) and anxiety scored using the General Anxiety Disorder 7-point scale (GAD-7). The Google Survey platform was used to conduct the survey. RESULTS: A total of 3797 persons were included in the present analysis. More than 75% of respondents were female; most completed the survey in English or Hebrew. Median age was 31 (IQ = 18) years. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQ = 3). The majority (54%) of participants reported at least mild anxiety, while 25% reported moderate anxiety or more severe. In a logistic regression model of at least moderate anxiety, Mediterranean diet score (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.95, p < 0.0001) reduced odds of elevated anxiety, even after controlling for age, sex and other variables.

However, it is still unknown whether the relative abundance or calculated activity of any LDH isoenzyme is predominately increased in COVID-19 subjects. METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients suffered from moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia were recruited into this study who showed enhanced total LDH activity. The ratio of LDH isoenzyme activities was further investigated using gel electrophoresis (Hydragel(?), Sebia) with densitometric evaluation. Calculated activity values of these isoenzymes were correlated with routine laboratory parameters, the degree of lung parenchymal affection based on chest CT and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Total LDH activity was raised in the range of 272-2141 U/L and significantly correlated with calculated LDH-3 and LDH-4 activities (r=0.765, P=0.0001;and r=0.783, P=0.0001, respectively). In contrast, the relative abundance of neither LDH isoenzyme was exclusively abnormal in COVID-19 patients. Calculated activity of LDH-3 and LDH-4 demonstrated a modest but statistically significant association with serum ferritin (r=0.437, P=0.042;r=0.505, P=0.016, respectively). When the relationship between the severity of pulmonary affection by SARS-CoV-2 infection and relative abundance of LDH isoenzymes was studied, a larger ratio of mid-zone fractions was observed in the presence of  50% lung parenchymal involvement. Finally, regardless of LDH isoenzyme pattern, abnormal relative ratio of LDH-4 and higher calculated LDH-3 and LDH-4 activity values were detected in subjects with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: No characteristic profile of LDH isoenzymes can be detected in COVID-19 pneumonia, however, elevated activities of LDH-3 and LDH-4 are associated with worse clinical outcomes.","output":"Profiling of Lactate Dehydrogenase Isoenzymes in COVID-19 Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) have been the mainstay for controlling the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While NPIs are effective in preventing health systems overload, these long-term measures are likely to have significant adverse economic consequences. Therefore, many countries are currently considering to lift the NPIsincreasing the likelihood of disease resurgence. In this regard, dynamic NPIs, with intervals of relaxed social distancing, may provide a more suitable alternative. However, the ideal frequency and duration of intermittent NPIs, and the ideal break when interventions can be temporarily relaxed, remain uncertain, especially in resource-poor settings. We employed a multivariate prediction model, based on up-to-date transmission and clinical parameters, to simulate outbreak trajectories in 16 countries, from diverse regions and economic categories. In each country, we then modelled the impacts on intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths over an 18-month period for following scenarios: (1) no intervention, (2) consecutive cycles of mitigation measures followed by a relaxation period, and (3) consecutive cycles of suppression measures followed by a relaxation period. We defined these dynamic interventions based on reduction of the mean reproduction number during each cycle, assuming a basic reproduction number (R(0)) of 2.2 for no intervention, and subsequent effective reproduction numbers (R) of 0.8 and 0.5 for illustrative dynamic mitigation and suppression interventions, respectively. We found that dynamic cycles of 50-day mitigation followed by a 30-day relaxation reduced transmission, however, were unsuccessful in lowering ICU hospitalizations below manageable limits. By contrast, dynamic cycles of 50-day suppression followed by a 30-day relaxation kept the ICU demands below the national capacities. Additionally, we estimated that a significant number of new infections and deaths, especially in resource-poor countries, would be averted if these dynamic suppression measures were kept in place over an 18-month period. This multi-country analysis demonstrates that intermittent reductions of R below 1 through a potential combination of suppression interventions and relaxation can be an effective strategy for COVID-19 pandemic control. Such a schedule of social distancing might be particularly relevant to low-income countries, where a single, prolonged suppression intervention is unsustainable. Efficient implementation of dynamic suppression interventions, therefore, confers a pragmatic option to: (1) prevent critical care overload and deaths, (2) gain time to develop preventive and clinical measures, and (3) reduce economic hardship globally.

Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia by board-certified psychiatrists without prior diagnosis of IBD were enrolled and matched to controls in 1:4 fashion by age, sex, residence, income level and medical comorbidities. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for new-onset IBD and sub-analyses were determined using Cox regression analysis with adjustments. RESULTS Among 116 164 patients with schizophrenia and 464 656 matched controls, overall incidence of IBD among patients was significantly higher (1.14% vs. 0.25%).

Patients had a low dynamic lung compliance [24 (20C31) mL/cmH(2)O], high ?P(L) (25  6 cmH(2)O) and high P(mus) (16  7 cmH(2)O). Low agreement was found between measured and computed ?P(L) and P(mus). Excessive ?P(L) > 20 cmH(2)O and P(mus) > 15 cmH(2)O were accurately detected (area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00C1.00], sensitivity 100% (95% CI, 72C100%) and specificity 100% (95% CI, 16C100%) and AUROC 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90C1.00), sensitivity 100% (95% CI, 54C100%) and specificity 86% (95% CI, 42C100%), respectively). Respiratory effort calculated per minute was highly correlated with ?P(occ) (for esophageal pressure time product per minute (PTP(es/min)) r(2) = 0.73; P = 0.0002 and work of breathing (WOB) r(2) = 0.85; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ?P(L) and P(mus) can be computed from an expiratory occlusion maneuver and can predict excessive ?P(L) and P(mus) in patients with COVID-19 with high accuracy.","output":"Non-invasive method to detect high respiratory effort and transpulmonary driving pressures in COVID-19 patients during mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused an important health impact that has affected renal cell carcinoma management, among other urology areas.

How clinical presentation, pathological features and therapies influence outcome was evaluated in 37 thoroughly characterized patients with celiac disease and T-cell lymphoma. Patients and methods Medical files were studied retrospectively. Lymphoma and intestinal mucosa were analysed by histopathology, multiplex PCR and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes phenotyping. Survival and prognostic factors were analysed using KaplanCMeier curves with Logrank test and Cox Model. Results Lymphoma complicated non clonal enteropathy, celiac disease (n =15) and type I refractory celiac disease (n =2) in 17 patients and clonal type II refractory celiac disease in 20 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery with resection of the main tumour mass in 22 cases. In univariate analysis, non clonal celiac disease, serum albumin level>21.6g/L at diagnosis, chemotherapy and surgical resection predicted good survival (p =0.0007, p <0.0001, p <0.0001, p <0.0001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, serum albumin level>21.6g/L, chemotherapy and reductive surgery were all significantly associated with increased survival (p <0.002, p <0.03, p <0.03, respectively).

This review aimed to evaluate the association between erythema multiforme and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scimago Scopus, and ISI/Web of Science was performed. Original articles, case series, or case reports were evaluated and selected. Results: Fourteen articles were selected, describing a total of 70 patients. EM is a cutaneous eruption rarely occurring in COVID-19 and is, in most cases, associated with a hypersensitivity reaction to the virus. In these cases, EM seems to affect patients younger than 30 years or older than 55 years. Infrequently, some drugs used in the management of COVID-19 may induce EM, especially hydroxychloroquine. The three groups of patients seem to have different clinical characteristics and courses. Conclusions: From these data, it is possible to preliminarily propose that EM or EM-like eruptions linked to COVID-19 might be divided into three types: the virus-related juvenile type (affecting patients <30-year-old), the virus-related older type (affecting patients >55 years), and the drug-induced type.

CASE REPORT A 28-year-old patient was referred for treatment of traumatic aortic transection with contained rupture at the level of an ARSA. Immediate thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was planned because of hemodynamic instability. To achieve rapid sealing and maintain perfusion to both subclavian arteries, a chimney stent to the left subclavian artery (LSA) and a periscope stent-graft to the ARSA were deployed successfully. After surgical repair of all fractures, the patient was discharged 1 month after the initial injury in good condition. Imaging follow-up at 10 months showed a stable repair, patent parallel grafts, and no complications. CONCLUSION TEVAR with chimney and periscope grafts proved to be a safe and quick treatment for a patient requiring ARSA repair in acute aortic transection. This technique maintained blood flow to the ARSA and LSA in a totally endovascular approach, which could be very valuable in transection cases where bypass surgery to supra-aortic branches is compromised or deemed challenging due to thoracic wall and/or neck trauma. Parallel grafting can be a valuable tool to address any acute aortic pathology as it can be performed with off-the-shelf devices.","output":"Chimney and periscope grafts to facilitate endovascular treatment of aortic transection in a patient with aberrant right subclavian artery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Students worldwide are at marked risk of suicidal ideation/behavior, depression, and low positive mental health (PMH).

The human health is the primary conclusion of many studies. The improving of human health may include supplying the people with enough and safe nutrients against malnutrition to fight against multiple diseases like COVID-19. Biofortification is a process by which the edible plants can be enriched with essential nutrients for human health against malnutrition. After the great success of biofortification approach in the human struggle against malnutrition, a new biotechnological tool in enriching the crops with essential nutrients in the form of nanoparticles to supplement human diet with balanced diet is called nano-biofortification. Nano biofortification can be achieved by applying the nano particles of essential nutrients (e.g., Cu, Fe, Se and Zn) foliar or their nano-fertilizers in soils or waters. Not all essential nutrients for human nutrition can be biofortified in the nano-form using all edible plants but there are several obstacles prevent this approach. These stumbling blocks are increased due to COVID-19 and its problems including the global trade, global breakdown between countries, and global crisis of food production.

The most prominent immunopathology of advanced COVID-19 is cytokine release syndrome, or \\"cytokine storm\\" which is attributed to a defect of immune-regulating mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as one of the main cells that maintain immune homeostasis. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar. All English articles related to Treg's role in COVID-19 were extracted and evaluated by two researchers independently. Study eligibility was assessed based on modified Evidence-based librarianship (EBL) checklist. RESULTS: Nineteen eligible studies comparing Treg cells in COVID-19 patients with the control group or comparing alterations of this cell in severe and moderate patients were evaluated. Currently, there is no consensus regarding the increase or decrease of Tregs in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group. However, it was observed that Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than moderate patients, resulting in uncontrolled inflammation and cytokine storm.

However, up to now, no studies investigating this association have been conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups (ie, older adults residing in nursing homes). The objective of this study was to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19-infected older adults residing in nursing homes. DESIGN: We undertook a retrospective multicenter cohort study to analyze the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with clinical outcome of COVID-19. The outcomes were (1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and (2) asymptomatic (ie, no disease symptoms in the whole study period while still being diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 154 COVID-19-positive subjects were identified, residing in 1 of 2 Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks. MEASURES: Logistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes, and hypertension as covariates. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13-6.68). Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.24-1.87). There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 2.72; CI 0.59-25.1) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.48; CI 0.10-1.97). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data indicate that statin intake in older, frail adults could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 clinical symptoms.

Despite various vaccines of COVID-19 protect million people in many countries, the worldwide situations of more the asymptomatic and mutated strain discovered are urging the more sensitive COVID-19 testing in this turnaround time. Unfortunately, it is still nontrivial to develop a new fast COVID-19 screening method with the easier access and lower cost, due to the technical and cost limitations of the current testing methods in the medical resource-poor districts. On the other hand, there are more and more ocular manifestations that have been reported in the COVID-19 patients as growing clinical evidence[1]. This inspired this project. We have conducted the joint clinical research since January 2021 at the ShiJiaZhuang City, Heibei province, China, which approved by the ethics committee of The fifth hospital of ShiJiaZhuang of Hebei Medical University. We undertake several blind tests of COVID-19 patients by Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Meantime as an important part of the ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test program by AIMOMICS since February 2020, we propose a new fast screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras. This could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with the sustainable stable high performance in different countries and races. For this clinical trial in ShiJiaZhuang, we compare and analyze 1194 eye-region images of 115 patients, including 66 COVID-19 positive patients, 44 rehabilitation patients (nucleic acid changed from positive to negative), 5 liver patients, as well as 117 healthy people. Remarkably, we consistently achieved very high testing results (> 0.94) in terms of both sensitivity and specificity in our blind test of COVID-19 patients. This confirms the viability of the COVID-19 fast screening by the eye-region manifestations. Particularly and impressively, the results have the similar conclusion as the other clinical trials of the globally COVID-19 eye test program[1]. Hopefully, this series of ongoing globally COVID-19 eye test study, and potential rapid solution of fully self-performed COVID risk screening method, can be inspiring and helpful to more researchers in the world soon. Our model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening have the merits of the lower cost, fully self-performed, non-invasive, importantly real-time, and thus enables the continuous health surveillance. We further implement it as the open accessible APIs, and provide public service to the world.

After each clip placement, a subsequent clipping device has to be introduced through the working channel. With the Clipmaster3, three consecutive clips can be placed without reloading which could reduce closure time. We performed a prospective study evaluating efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Closure using Clipmaster3 was compared to closure with standard clips. Methods: Patients undergoing closure with the Clipmaster3 were compared to patients who underwent POEM with standard clip closure. Results: In total, 12 consecutive POEM closures with Clipmaster3 were compared to 24 standard POEM procedures. The Clipmaster3 and the standard group did not differ in sex distribution, age (42 years [29 - 49] vs 41 years [34 - 54] P = 0.379), achalasia subtype, disease duration, length of the mucosal incision (25.0 mm [20 - 30] vs 20.0 mm [20 - 30], P = 1.0), and closure time (622 seconds [438 - 909] vs 599 seconds [488 - 664] P = 0.72). Endoscopically successful closure could be performed in all patients. The proportion of all clips used that were either displaced or discarded was larger for Clipmaster3 (8.8 %) compared to standard closure (2.0 %, P = 0.00782). Ease of handling VAS (visual analogue scale) score for Clipmaster3 did not differ between endoscopist and endoscopy nurse (7 out of 10). Conclusions: Clipmaster3 is feasible and safe for closure of mucosal incisions after POEM. Clipmaster3 was not associated with reduced closure time. Compared to standard closure, more Clipmaster3 clips were displaced or discarded to achieve successful closure. A training effect cannot be excluded as a cause of these results.

Yet, there has been growing discontent with social distancing rules during national lockdowns across several countries, particularly among certain demographic and socio-economic groups. Using a highly granular dataset on compliance of over 105,000 individuals between March and May 2020 in the United Kingdom (UK), we find that compliance with lockdown policies was initially high in the overall population during the earlier phase of the pandemic, but that compliance fell substantially over time, especially among specific segments of society. Warmer temperatures increased the non-compliance of individuals who are male, divorced, part-time employed, and/or parent of more than two children. Thus, while epidemiologically the virus spread was naturally more limited during the warmer period of 2020, sociologically the higher temperature led to lower individual-level compliance with public health measures. As long as new strains emerge, governments may therefore be required to complement vaccination campaigns with targeted and time limited restrictions.

In addition, they have recently faced the burden of a global pandemic that may also be a consequence of climate change. In many under-resourced communities, nongovernmental community-based organizations (CBOs) represent the backbone of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about the pandemic's impact on the efforts of these organizations to support and sustain individual and community resilience to this event and to the disruptive impacts of climate change-related weather events. Procedures embedded in the Rapid Assessment Procedure - Informed Community Ethnography methodology were used to analyze data collected from semi-structured interviews with 26 representatives of 24 different community-based programs in South Louisiana. The pandemic created numerous challenges to under-resourced community resilience by revealing the fragmented nature of community solidarity in adhering to public health guidelines;the lack of available social, political, and economic resources;and the influence of systemic racism and social determinants of health. To address these challenges, communities relied on social connections and support;prior experiences with climate-related disasters and adversity;and the resilience building, supporting, and sustaining efforts of CBOs. These organizations have responded to these challenges through provision of new services, expansion of existing services, providing access to training webinars, partnerships with other CBOs, and initiatives to address broader social issues, while balancing the disparity between increased demand and reduced supply of services and increased reliance on technology that is not uniformly accessible to all communities and residents. In responding to the pandemic, CBOs have played a major role in addressing the threats to individual and community resilience needed to prepare for and respond to natural disasters and other consequences of global environmental change in underserved communities. ?

Furthermore, the overall connectedness amplifies during crises periods compared to tranquil periods. Moreover, certain pairwise markets are comparatively highly linked such as crude oil and heating oil, wheat and corn, corn and soybean, and soybean and soybean oil. The results also demonstrate that crude oil and heating oil are net transmitters all the time and across maturities, while natural gas, gold, and wheat are net receivers all the time and across maturities.

While VTE is a known complication of ECMO therapy, the rates of increased incidence of VTE in patients with severe COVID-19 make the detection of such complications even more important to reduce overall morbidity and mortality.","output":"Hypercoagulopathy in COVID-19, Deep Venous Thrombosis After Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation Therapy: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les personnes vivant dans des squats reprsentent une population vulnrable et difficilement accessible aux mesures de prvention Le confinement y est particulirement difficile Nous rapportons lexprience et lefficacit dun dpistage du SARS-CoV-2 dans deux squats Matriels et mthodes Lassociation mdecins du monde ralisait des maraudes auprs des personnes vivant dans des squats, en accord avec les rfrents associatifs des lieux Quatre cas de COVID-19 furent ainsi diagnostiqus dans un squat A, et deux cas dans un squat B fin mars 2020, habits majoritairement par des migrants  linitiative de mdecins du monde, un groupe de travail a organis un dpistage massif des squats, dans lobjectif de limiter la dissmination virale, en proposant notamment lisolement de cas COVID-19 dans un hbergement et de renforcer les mesures barrires Ce groupe tait constitu de rfrents du squat, de mdecins du monde, de lquipe mobile de dpistage du CHU, de lAgence rgionale de sant et pour le squat B, de la Mairie Pralablement aux actions de dpistage, des mdecins informaient les squatteurs des objectifs du dpistage, de la ncessit de respecter les mesures barrires, et valuaient les besoins pour amliorer les conditions sanitaires Rsultats La population du squat A tait value  200 personnes Il nexistait aucune douche et trois toilettes fonctionnelles, avec des points deau extrieurs Cinquante (25 %) personnes ont donn leur accord pour un dpistage organis le 20 avril Lage moyen des personnes dpistes tait de 31 (16) ans, 26 taient francophones (52 %) et vivaient  1,8 (0,7) personnes par chambre Dix-neuf personnes (38 %) ont t testes positives, et trois personnes ont accept dtre transfres dans un centre dhbergement COVID-19 Il na pas t possible de revenir sur site, par opposition de certains squatteurs Cependant, le 5 juin, une action inter-associative a permis linstallation de 6 toilettes et 6 douches Le squat B tait compos de 120 personnes, et avait quatre toilettes et trois douches fonctionnelles Aprs trois passages sur 14jours, 74 (62 %) personnes furent dpistes, et deux cas supplmentaires furent diagnostiqus Lage moyen des personnes dpistes tait de 30 (13) ans, 82 % (51/62) taient francophones avec 2,2 (1,4) personnes par chambre Lintervention tait concomitante au don de deux toilettes chimiques, et  la distribution de 200 masques en tissu Dans ces deux squats, aucun cas na ncessit une hospitalisation Conclusion La prvalence leve de circulation du SARS-CoV-2 dans les squats impose un dpistage rapide et massif ds le diagnostic dun cas avr, puisque tout retard pourrait engendrer une forte dissmination du virus, comme pour le squat A Lacceptabilit du dpistage, et la possibilit dintervenir de fa?on rpte, pourraient dpendre de lamlioration rapide des conditions sanitaires, comme pour le squat B Une coordination locale mdico-sociale et politique pour ce type daction est indispensable","output":"COVID-19 : lpidmie cache des squats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cells are equipped with mechanisms that allow them to rapidly detect and respond to viruses. These defense mechanisms rely partly on receptors that monitor the cytosol for the presence of atypical nucleic acids associated with virus infection. RIG-I-like receptors detect RNA molecules that are absent from the uninfected host. DNA receptors alert the cell to the abnormal presence of that nucleic acid in the cytosol. Signaling by RNA and DNA receptors results in the induction of restriction factors that prevent virus replication and establish cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. In light of these formidable obstacles, viruses have evolved mechanisms of evasion, masking nucleic acid structures recognized by the host, sequestering themselves away from the cytosol or targeting host sensors, and signaling adaptors for deactivation or degradation. Here, we detail recent advances in the molecular understanding of cytosolic nucleic acid detection and its evasion by viruses.","output":"Cytosolic Sensing of Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Efficacy and safety of treatments for hospitalized COVID-19 are uncertain. We systematically reviewed efficacy and safety of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Studies evaluating remdesivir in adults with hospitalized COVID-19 were searched in several engines until August 21, 2020. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, clinical improvement or recovery, need for invasive ventilation, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Inverse variance random effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: We included four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2296) [two vs. placebo (n = 1299) and two comparing 5-day vs. 10-day regimens (n = 997)], and two case series (n = 88). Studies used intravenous remdesivir 200mg the first day and 100mg for four or nine more days. One RCT (n = 236) was stopped early due to AEs; the other three RCTs reported outcomes between 11 and 15 days. Time to recovery was decreased by 4 days with remdesivir vs. placebo in one RCT (n = 1063), and by 0.8 days with 5-days vs. 10-days of therapy in another RCT (n = 397). Clinical improvement was better for 5-days regimen vs. standard of care in one RCT (n = 600). Remdesivir did not decrease all-cause mortality (RR 0.71, 95%CI 0.39 to 1.28, I2 = 43%) and need for invasive ventilation (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.23 to 1.42, I2 = 60%) vs. placebo at 14 days but had fewer SAEs; 5-day decreased need for invasive ventilation and SAEs vs. 10-day in one RCT (n = 397). No differences in all-cause mortality or SAEs were seen among 5-day, 10-day and standard of care. There were some concerns of bias to high risk of bias in RCTs. Heterogeneity between studies could be due to different severities of disease, days of therapy before outcome determination, and how ordinal data was analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: There is paucity of adequately powered and fully reported RCTs evaluating effects of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Until stronger evidence emerges, we cannot conclude that remdesivir is efficacious for treating COVID-19.","output":"Efficacy and harms of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis caught many economic players unprepared and unable to act.

In addition to the current situation, two past crises as well as the contrary strategies of two companies were examined with the aim of drawing sensible conclusions towards their strategies of managing risk. Modern methods with a strong focus on data-driven examination lead to one-dimensional approaches that are unable to reflect complex interrelations. The paper concludes that existing risk management systems are already set up in a comprehensive way and that the main issue lies within behavioral patterns of individuals who are either unable or unwilling to see existing risks.

However, little is yet known about the drivers and barriers to the adoption of tracing apps. Our theoretical framework integrates concepts from technology acceptance (i.e., perceived usefulness and ease of use), health protection (i.e., perceived threat), and social norms research (i.e., perceived norms). To understand the role of these perceptions in the decision process of people who hesitated to adopt the app (N = 327), we conducted a two-wave panel study after app release in Switzerland. We found that perceived usefulness and ease of use of the app, as well as perceived threat of COVID-19 were positively correlated with adoption intention, whereas perceived threat of data misuse was negatively correlated with it. Social norms played a multifaceted role: They were positively correlated with perceived usefulness of the app and adoption intention. Adoption intention, in turn, predicted app adoption 10 weeks later. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings ? 2022 (Sarah Geber and Thomas N. Friemel).

The major Western guidelines recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for \\"high-risk stage II\\" cancer, but this is not clearly defined and the efficacy has not been confirmed. METHODS/DESIGN SACURA trial is a multicenter randomized phase III study which aims to evaluate the superiority of 1-year adjuvant treatment with UFT to observation without any adjuvant treatment after surgery for stage II colon cancer in a large population, and to identify \\"high-risk factors of recurrence/death\\" in stage II colon cancer and predictors of efficacy and adverse events of the chemotherapy. Patients aged between 20 and 80 years with curatively resected stage II colon cancer are randomly assigned to a observation group or UFT adjuvant therapy group (UFT at 500-600 mg/day as tegafur in 2 divided doses after meals for 5 days, followed by 2-day rest. This 1-week treatment cycle is repeated for 1 year). The patients are followed up for 5 years until recurrence or death. Treatment delivery and adverse events are entered into a web-based case report form system every 3 months. The target sample size is 2,000 patients. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival, and the secondary endpoints are overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and incidence and severity of adverse events. In an additional translational study, the mRNA expression of 5-FU-related enzymes, microsatellite instability and chromosomal instability, and histopathological factors including tumor budding are assessed to evaluate correlation with recurrences, survivals and adverse events. DISCUSSION A total of 2,024 patients were enrolled from October 2006 to July 2010.

METHODS: An observational study was performed in 11 hospitals participating in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program between January 7 and March 30, 2011. Using a standardized data collection tool, observers recorded HCWs selecting and removing PPE and performing hand hygiene on entry into the rooms of febrile respiratory illness patients. RESULTS: The majority of HCWs put on gloves (88%, n = 390), gown (83%, n = 368), and mask (88%, n = 386). Only 37% (n = 163) were observed to have put on eye protection. Working in a pediatric unit was significantly associated with not wearing eye protection (7%), gown (70%), gloves (77%), or mask (79%). Half of the observed HCWs (54%, n = 206) removed their PPE in the correct sequence. Twenty-six percent performed hand hygiene after removing their gloves, 46% after removing their gown, and 57% after removing their mask and/or eye protection. CONCLUSION: Overall adherence with appropriate PPE use in health care settings involving febrile respiratory illness patients was modest, particularly on pediatric units. Interventions to improve PPE use should be targeted toward the use of recommended precautions (eg, eye protection), HCWs working in pediatric units, the correct sequence of PPE removal, and performing hand hygiene.","output":"Are health care workers protected?

The study of bNAbs arising in natural infection is essential in this endeavor. We generated a human antibody, 8D6, recognizing the E2 protein of HCV isolated from a chronic hepatitis C patient. This antibody shows broadly neutralizing activity, which covers a pan-genotypic panel of cell culture-derived HCV virions (HCVcc). Functional and epitope analyses demonstrated that 8D6 can block the interaction between E2 and CD81 by targeting a highly conserved epitope on E2. We describe how the 8D6 lineage evolved via somatic hypermutation to achieve broad neutralization. We found that the V(D)J recombination-generated junctional and somatic hypermutation-induced disulfide bridge (C-C) motif in the CDRH3 is critical for the broad neutralization and binding activity of 8D6. This motif is conserved among a series of broadly neutralizing HCV antibodies, indicating a common binding model. Next, the 8D6 inferred germline (iGL) was reconstructed and tested for its binding affinity and neutralization activity. Interestingly, 8D6 iGL-mediated relatively strong inhibition of the 1b genotype PR79L9 strain, suggesting that PR79L9 may serve as a potential natural viral strain that provides E2 sequences that induce bNAbs. Overall, our detailed epitope mapping and genetic studies of the HCV E2-specific mAb 8D6 have allowed for further refinement of antigenic sites on E2 and reveal a new mechanism to generate a functional CDRH3, while its iGL can serve as a probe to identify potential HCV vaccine strains.","output":"Junctional and somatic hypermutation-induced CX(4)C motif is critical for the recognition of a highly conserved epitope on HCV E2 by a human broadly neutralizing antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many websites track the devastating spread of disease and death caused by the now-pandemic coronavirus, from the World Health Organizations (WHOs) global map to The New York Timess tally of U S cases at the county level But one of the earliest, an online dashboard run by Johns Hopkins University, has become the go-to place for the latest data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) With its black world map strewn with red circles and global, country, and state counts of cases, deaths, and recoveries, the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases tracker sticks to the basicsno fancy graphs Yet the site, which gets more than 1 billion hits a day, has become the most authoritative source for COVID-19 case data It is used by news organizations and government agencies around the world Its dashboard has been copied by states and countries It has been spotted on a wall in a photo of the U S Department of Health and Human Servicess coronavirus war room","output":"Every day is a new surprise.

For each, a control was identified based on age, sex, and co-staring in the same film. RESULTS: Overall, 2,111 individuals were analyzed with 1,122 total deaths occurring during a median follow-up of 68.8 years. Comparisons of winners to controls yielded a 4.8% relative difference average life-span (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 7.9, p = 0.004), a 5.1 year absolute increase in life expectancy (95% confidence interval: 3.0 to 7.2, p < 0.001), and a 41% improvement in mortality hazard (95% confidence interval: 19 to 68, p < 0.001).

Objective: This literature review focused on delayed reactions to vaccines, including possible causative agents and practical information on how to diagnose, evaluate with patch testing, and manage subsequent dose administration. Methods: Currently published reviews and case reports in PubMed, along with data on vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web site. Relevant case reports and reviews that focused on delayed reactions to vaccines were selected. Results: Most delayed hypersensitivity reactions to vaccines include cutaneous manifestations, which vary from local persistent pruritic nodules to systemic rashes. The onset is usually within a few days but can be delayed by weeks. Multiple excipients have been identified that have been implicated in delayed vaccine reactions, including thimerosal, formaldehyde, aluminum, antibiotics, and gelatin. Treatment with antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, or systemic corticosteroids alleviates symptoms in most patients. Such reactions are generally not contraindications to future vaccination. However, for more-severe reactions, patch testing for causative agents can be used to aid in diagnosis and approach further vaccination. Conclusion: Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to vaccines are not uncommon. If needed, patch testing can be used to confirm agents, including antibiotics, formaldehyde, thimerosal, and aluminum.

The notification was based on a serological diagnosis in a small farm with a morbidity rate of 2.3% without enteric clinical signs. In order to determine if TGEV was circulating before the official report, a retrospective study on cases of neonatal diarrhea was performed. The selection criteria was a sudden increase in mortality in 1- to 21-day-old piglets with watery diarrhea that did not respond to antibiotics. Based on these criteria, three clinical cases were identified during 2010C2015. RESULTS: All animals that were evaluated presented histological lesions consistent with enteric viral infection. The feces and ultrathin sections of intestine that were evaluated by electron microscopy confirmed the presence of round particles of approximately 80 nm in size and characterized by finely granular electrodense nucleoids consistent with complete particles of coronavirus. The presence of the TGEV antigen was confirmed by monoclonal specific immunohistochemistry, and final confirmation of a metabolically-active virus was performed by in situ hybridization to detect a TGE mRNA encoding spike protein. All sections evaluated in this case were negative for PEDV and rotavirus A. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case series describing neonatal mortality with etiological confirmation of TGEV in Argentina.

Due to the economic importance of beach tourism, many governments reopened tourist beaches after the number of confirmed cases decreased. It is essential to open beaches orderly to meet the needs of tourists, maintain beachs health and restore coastal economy under the new reality. This paper selected Qingdao in China as a case study, drew on a questionnaire survey among beach tourists, summarized the effects of the COVID-19 on beach tourism industry and tourism enterprise, analyzed beach tourists psychology and behavior, and developed beach management strategy under the ongoing prevention and control of COVID-19. The results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic caused severe damage to beach tourism which bases on travel and mobility, and this industry was temporarily suspended. With the changing epidemic situation, beach tourism witnessed a gradual recovery from stagnation to local tourism. Meanwhile, tourism enterprises were hit by the devastating impact of the COVID-19, causing problems such as business reduction, tense cash flow, high operating cost and unclear market prospect. Under the normalization of pandemic prevention, tourists did not have severe fear and anxiety about the pandemic, and placed great importance on the prevention and control measures, emergency measures and pandemic risk level of the beach destination. The pandemic also reshaped the perception and mode of beach tourism. Ecological tourism, travelling with family, and local tourism became the primary choices for tourists. Beach congestion, health status, and the quality of tourism services were the biggest concerns for tourists. Additionally, social media and short video APP became the new marketing channels. Finally, beach management strategies were proposed from the aspects of pandemic prevention and control, emergency management, information communication, tourist management, service management, and environmental management.","output":"Beach tourists behavior and beach management strategy under the ongoing prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study of Qingdao, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolving crypto-currency market is seen as dynamic, segmented, and inefficient, coupled with a lack of regulatory oversight, which together becomes conducive to observing the arbitrage.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of transgastric sigmoidectomy in a survival animal model, as well as to evaluate the safety and usability of a custom paired magnetic intraluminal device, which we developed for the NOTES procedure. METHODS Survival experiments were conducted on 24-33-kg dogs. After anesthesia, a gastrotomy was created using double-channel endoscope, and peritoneoscopy was performed. The sigmoid colon was retracted laterally using paired magnetic intraluminal device, the mesocolon was dissected, and the branch vessel was sealed. The anvil was placed into the descending colon through anus. A proximal and distal colonic transection was then performed. The circular stapler was passed through the anus and performed end-to-end anastomosis. Afterwards the specimen was removed through gastrotomy, and the gastric incision was closed. Postoperatively, all dogs were recovered and monitored for well-being during convalescence. Reexploration was practiced under anesthesia 2 weeks after surgery for evaluation of intra-abdominal complications, and intra-peritoneal cultures for microorganism. RESULTS The mean operative time was 141 (range, 122-157) min. There were no complications or physical evidence of sepsis or bowel obstruction during the observation period. Only one dog exhibited decreased body weight, decreasing to 20.4 kg from 22.4 kg after surgery; all of the other dogs exhibited increased body weight. We observed no evidence of peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, bleeding, or organ injury on reexploration conducted on day 14 after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Transgastric NOTES sigmoidectomy is a safe operation technique as evaluated in a dog model. The paired magnetic intraluminal device that was used in this study was useful to avoid an abdominal incision for retracting the sigmoid colon.","output":"Multimedia article.

Although previous studies of community families have shown an association between parenting quality and a child's cognitive functions, little is known about the effects of BPT on cognitive manifestations in children with ADHD. In this study, we focused on inhibitory control among cognitive domains, which is considered to be the most malleable to direct types of psychosocial treatment for ADHD. We hypothesized that inhibitory control is affected by BPT, which uses parents as the primary agents of change to help their children. Thirty school-age children (6-12 years old) with ADHD and their parents (mothers) participated and were randomly assigned to either the standard BPT or waitlist control group. Using two objective laboratory-based tasks of inhibitory control (i.e., go/no-go and single response selection tasks), we assessed baseline and post-treatment response inhibition to suppress task-irrelevant responses and response selection to select task-relevant responses. In addition to decreased ADHD symptoms and negative parenting, the BPT group exhibited significantly improved performance in the single response selection task, but not in the go/no-go task, compared with the waitlist control group. Although tentative, these findings partially support our hypothesis that BPT has beneficial effects on the cognitive inhibitory control of ADHD, highlighting the potential for supportive environmental modifications to advance cognitive development in children with ADHD.","output":"Beneficial Effects of Behavioral Parent Training on Inhibitory Control in Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Small-Scale Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current clinical trials are testing the life-extending benefits of the diabetes drug metformin in healthy individuals without diabetes. However, the metabolic response of a non-diabetic cohort to metformin treatment has not been studied. Here, we show in C. elegans and human primary cells that metformin shortens lifespan when provided in late life, contrary to its positive effects in young organisms. We find that metformin exacerbates ageing-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, causing respiratory failure. Age-related failure to induce glycolysis and activate the dietary-restriction-like mobilization of lipid reserves in response to metformin result in lethal ATP exhaustion in metformin-treated aged worms and late-passage human cells, which can be rescued by ectopic stabilization of cellular ATP content. Metformin toxicity is alleviated in worms harbouring disruptions in insulin-receptor signalling, which show enhanced resilience to mitochondrial distortions at old age. Together, our data show that metformin induces deleterious changes of conserved metabolic pathways in late life, which could bring into question its benefits for older individuals without diabetes.","output":"Loss of metabolic plasticity underlies metformin toxicity in aged Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Background The activity of the rotator cuff muscles has not previously been measured with indwelling electromyography (EMG) comparing ambulation and other movements. Knowledge of the relative contribution of these muscles during various tasks may help to guide rehabilitation progression. Objective To measure activity of the rotator cuff muscles and other shoulder muscles during normal ambulation, shirt and sling donning and doffing, and rehabilitation tasks commonly performed after rotator cuff surgery. Methods In 28 volunteers (15 men, 13 women; mean age, 32.2 years), indwelling EMG activity was measured in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles during various tasks; and surface EMG activity was measured in the middle deltoid, biceps, and upper trapezius muscles. Results Using median EMG activity, in general, donning and doffing a shirt or sling recruited the rotator cuff muscles more than the other 7 tasks tested. Self-ranging motion using pulleys, especially in the scapular plane, was also consistently associated with greater recruitment of the shoulder muscles. Pendulum exercises, passive range of motion by a physical therapist, and self-ranging motion with a dowel recruited the shoulder muscles to a lesser extent. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that rehabilitation tasks such as pendulum exercises, passive range of motion by a physical therapist, and self-ranging motion with a dowel show low EMG activity, whereas pulleys in the sagittal plane and scapular plane show greater activity. Scapular plane activity was consistently higher than sagittal plane activity. Of all the tasks assessed, ambulation without a sling and donning and doffing a sling and a shirt consistently showed the highest activity. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2016;46(5):375-383.

Inhaled NO was administered at a dose of 20 ppm during the first hour and subsequently decreased to a dose of 5 ppm. The effects on oxygenation were assessed by changes in arterial oxygen tension and in the oxygenation index at one and 4 hours after initiating iNO therapy. Results: Inhaled NO dramatically improved oxygenation in 3 of 4 children and reduced the oxygenation index by more than 30%. One patient showed no improvement in oxygenation, but a significant reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance.

IPAA in the elderly has been reported as safe and feasible, but little work to date has assessed outcomes by procedure. The aim of our study was to assess use and short-term outcomes of 2- and 3-stage IPAA in older adults. METHODS The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) Database was searched for  65-year-old patients who underwent IPAA for UC in 2- or 3-stage from 2012 to 2016. The primary endpoint was the rate and trends of the two approaches over time. Secondary endpoints included 30-day adverse events and complication-associated costs. RESULTS Overall, 123 patients were included: 77.5% (n = 83) 2-stage and 40 (32.5%) 3-stage IPAA. Mean age was 68.7  3.9 years, with 43 (34.9%) women. The use of the 3-stage IPAA increased over time (18.8% in 2012 vs. 33.3% in 2016), with decreasing use of 2-stage IPAA (81.3% vs. 66.7%, p < 0.001). The morbidity associated with the procedures decreased over time, overall (81.3% in 2012 and 51.5% in 2016, p < 0.001) and in each group individually. No differences were observed in postoperative complications across groups (45.8% 2-stage, 32.5% 3-stage). The overall mean costs of care when no postoperative complications occurred was $25,910, vs. $38,577 when any complication occurred (p < 0.001), but no differences were observed between groups. CONCLUSION In a national analysis, there was a trend of increasing 3-stage vs. 2-stage IPAA for UC in older Americans. Complications and complication-associated costs were comparable across approaches, suggesting that the choice of procedure type should be based on the specific patient comorbidities and surgeon preferences.","output":"Restorative surgery for ulcerative colitis in the elderly: an analysis of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedures from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research assessed instructors usage of emojis in distance education for high diploma students A quantitative approach was employed comprising an e-survey consisting of 11-items, one closed-ended question, and two open-ended questions The participants were a randomly selected sample of 343 high diploma students, 243 attending Al al-Bayt University (AABU) in Jordan and 100 students attending the Arab Academic College in Haifa (AAC) The results indicated that instructors usage of emojis in distance education was moderate in both universities All students strongly preferred instructors to use emojis to express what is on their minds as an alternative to facial expressions, and female instructors were more active in using emojis in virtual lectures The emoji used most frequently by distance education instructors for the sample was the thumbs-up emoji () Based on the results, several recommendations are put forth that will be of value to researchers and workers in this field ?2021 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi All rights reserved","output":"Assessing instructors usage of emojis in distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the lack of prophylactic vaccines and effective treatment strategies against numerous public health conditions, viral infections remain a serious threat to global public health and socioeconomic development.

While ancient earth's atmosphere was rich in iron and manganese and low in oxygen, periods of atmospheric oxygenation significantly altered the availability of certain metal ions, resulting in ion replacement within biomolecules. This adaptation mechanism has given rise to the phenomenon of metal cofactor interchangeability, whereby contemporary proteins and nucleic acids interact with multiple metal ions interchangeably, with different coordinated metals influencing biological activity, stability, and toxic potential. The ability of extant organisms to adapt to fluctuating metal availability remains relevant in a number of crucial biomolecules, including the superoxide dismutases of the antioxidant defense systems and ribonucleotide reductases. These well-studied and ancient enzymes illustrate the potential for metal interchangeability and adaptive utilization. More recently, the ribosome has also been demonstrated to exhibit interchangeable interactions with metal ions with impacts on function, stability, and stress adaptation. Using these and other examples, here we review the biological significance of interchangeable metal ions from a new angle that combines both biochemical and evolutionary viewpoints.

Little is known about the experiences of critical care physicians caring for the sickest coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Our goal is to understand how high stress levels and shortages faced by these physicians during Spring 2020 have evolved. DESIGN We surveyed (October 23, 2020 to November 16, 2020) U.S. critical care physicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients who participated in a National survey earlier in the pandemic (April 23, 2020 to May 3, 2020) regarding their stress and shortages they faced. SETTING ICU. PATIENTS Coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTION Irrelevant. MEASUREMENT Physician emotional distress/physical exhaustion: low (not at all/not much), moderate, or high (a lot/extreme). Shortage indicators: insufficient ICU-trained staff and shortages in medication, equipment, or personal protective equipment requiring protocol changes. MAIN RESULTS Of 2,375 U.S. critical care attending physicians who responded to the initial survey, we received responses from 1,356 (57.1% response rate), 97% of whom (1,278) recently treated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Two thirds of physicians (67.6% [864]) reported moderate or high levels of emotional distress in the Spring versus 50.7% (763) in the Fall. Reports of staffing shortages persisted with 46.5% of Fall respondents (594) reporting a staff shortage versus 48.3% (617) in the Spring. Meaningful shortages of medication and equipment reported in the Spring were largely alleviated. Although personal protective equipment shortages declined by half, they remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS Stress, staffing, and, to a lesser degree, personal protective equipment shortages faced by U.S. critical care physicians remain high. Stress levels were higher among women. Considering the persistence of these findings, rising levels of infection nationally raise concerns about the capacity of the U.S. critical care system to meet ongoing and future demands.","output":"Changes in Stress and Workplace Shortages Reported by U.S. Critical Care Physicians Treating Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral infections (RVI) are becoming increasingly recognized as an important cause of pneumonia.

Patient clinical and virologic characteristics, LOS, antibiotic use, and duration of treatment were collected. A Students t-test was performed for all comparisons. RESULTS: We identified 540 patients who were admitted and underwent RP testing. The mean age was 57.1 years (range 19C99), 50.2% were immunocompromised, 23.8% were transplant recipients, 70.4% had respiratory symptoms, and 35.7% had an admitting diagnosis of pneumonia. 55.6% required supplemental O(2) and 24.6% had an ICU admission that required either noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. 22.6% (N = 122) of these patients were diagnosed with an RVI, of which 15 were co-infected with two or more respiratory viruses. There were 41 (34%) rhinovirus/enterovirus, 41 (34%) influenza (Types A/H1, A/H3, A/H1-2209, and B), 16 (13%) RSV, 15 (12%) coronavirus (Types NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1), 13 (11%) metapneumovirus, and 7 (5%) parainfluenza (Types 2, 3, and 4). 85.2% (104/122) of patients with an RVI received antibiotics. The mean LOS and antibiotic duration were 9.07 days and 7.31 days for patients with an RVI when compared with 11.5 days and 10.4 days for patients without an RVI (P = 0.098; P = 0.032), respectively. In patients with an RVI and negative bacterial cultures, the mean LOS was 8.4 days and mean antibiotic duration was 5.9 days when compared with 16.4 days and 15.5 days for all patients with positive bacterial cultures (P = 0.003; P < 0.0001), respectively. The mean time from available results of + RP to antibiotic discontinuation was 5.1 days in the setting of negative bacterial cultures.

Aim: To explore the views and experiences of general practitioners (GPs), PBPs, and community pharmacists (CPs) about PBPs' integration into general practice and their impact on primary healthcare delivery. Methods: Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit triads (a GP, a PBP, and a CP) from across five administrative healthcare areas in one region in the UK to participate in one-to-one semi-structured interviews. Sampling of practices to recruit GPs and PBPs commenced in August 2020. These HCPs identified the CPs who had most contact with the general practices in which the recruited GPs and PBPs were working. The interview topic guides were developed based on the published literature, and through discussion within the research team;they were piloted with two GPs, two PBPs, and two pharmacists. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, interviews were conducted via telephone or Microsoft Teams platform. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Eleven triads were recruited from across the five administrative areas. Analysis of interview transcripts is ongoing. Findings to date have revealed four main themes in relation to PBPs' integration into general practices (Table): evolution of the role, PBP attributes, collaboration and communication, and impact on care. A number of areas for development were identified such as patient awareness of the role and communication pathways between PBPs and CPs. Many saw PBPs as a central hub-middleman' between general practice and community pharmacies and between primary and secondary care. Conclusion: Participants reported that PBPs had integrated well, and perceived a positive impact on primary health care delivery.

We assessed meningococcal ACWY antibodies across the Dutch population in 2016/17 and 2020. METHODS: In a nationwide cross-sectional serosurvey in 2016/17, sera from participants aged 0-89 years (n = 6886) were tested for MenACWY-polysaccharide-specific (PS) serum IgG concentrations, and functional MenACWY antibody titers were determined in subsets. Moreover, longitudinal samples collected in 2020 (n = 1782) were measured for MenACWY-PS serum IgG concentrations. RESULTS: MenC antibody levels were low, except in recently vaccinated 14-23 month-olds and individuals who were vaccinated as teenagers in 2002, with seroprevalence of 59% and 20-46%, respectively.

It has also given rise to fears of an imminent economic crisis and recession. Social distance, self-isolation, and travel restrictions have led to a reduction in the workforce across all economical sectors and have led to a loss of many jobs. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured goods has decreased. On the other hand, the need for medical supplies has increased significantly. The food sector is also facing increased demand as a result of panic buying and storing food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on the various aspects of the world economy. In Malaysia, the COVID-19 epidemic has checked the resilience of the agriculture sector. Especially the Malaysian paddy industry as country imports 30% of its overall consumption from different parts of the world. The real price of rice triplicating for the consumers, which was alarming for nations in this pandemic situation. The Government of Malaysia introduced the National Agrofood Policy 2011-2020 (NAP4) in 2010 as a guidance document for the implementation of agricultural sector development programs and projects in Malaysia. The NAP4 's 10-year term is to be finished by the end of 2020. Several sectors demonstrate substantial success after approximately 8 years of introduction, while the other classes often lag behind the goal and progress quite slowly. Agricultural sector performance is affected by many problems and challenges. In acknowledgment of the poor success of this field, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Based Industry has launched new approaches, policies, and programs that can change the agricultural sector more rapidly. The new direction is aimed at ensuring national food security and boosting farm and revenues. The authorized government agency needs to revise the policy formulation where Malaysia needs to set stages to revolutionize and modernize the rice farming to address the problem faced by the paddy sector in this pandemic situation to adopt GF. In this study, the researcher focuses on the improvisation of the policy to increase the paddy production sustainably.","output":"How COVID 19 effect Malaysian paddy industry?

Methods: : 162 patients with severe/critical type COVID-19 were reviewed retrospectively in 13 medical centers from China. According to the level of eGFR, 162 patients were divided into three groups, group A (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 ), group B (60 ml/min/1.73m 2  eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73m 2 group) and group C (eGFR  90 ml/min/1.73m 2 ). All patients baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory data, CT features and clinical outcomes were collected and compared. The eGFR and CT features was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression. Results: : Baseline clinical characteristics showed that there were significant differences in age, hypertension, cough and fatigue among groups A, B and C. Laboratory data analysis revealed significant differences between the three groups of leukocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase. Chest CT features analysis indicated that crazy-paving pattern has significant statistical difference in groups A and B compared with group C.

Methods: A total of 52 patients with TMJOA diagnosed in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, General Hospital of Chinese PLA, from January 2018 to December 2019 were selected. There were 10 males and 42 females, with an average age of 38.6 years (21-70 years). All patients underwent spiral CT and CBCT examinations. Two oral radiologists and two oral and maxillofacial surgeons measured and evaluated the joint spaces and condylar bone lesions of each side of temporomandibular joint. According to the presence or absence of osteoarthrosis, the patients were divided into osteoarthrosis group (92 sides) and non osteoarthrosis group (12 sides). The mean size of joint spaces and the detection rate of lesions were compared between the two groups. SPSS 20.0 was used to analyze the data. Results: There was no significant difference between the measurements of joint space size and joint position in the spiral CT group and the CBCT group (P>0.05). The mean size of the anterior space and the ratio of the posterior condyle in the osteoarthrosis side were larger than that in the normal side. The LR index was smaller in the osteoarthrosis side than that in the normal side indicating that the position of the posterior condyle in the osteoarthrosis side was deviated. However, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Both spiral CT and CBCT showed good consistency in displaying condylar osteopathy. The most common types of condylar osteopathy was surface defect. The detection rates of defects by spiral CT were surface erosion (85.6%, 89/104), articular surface flattening and shortening (82.7%, 86/104), subcortical sclerosis (40.4%, 42/104), osteophyte (40.4%, 42/104) and subcortical cyst (11.5%, 12/104) respectively. The detection rates of defects by CBCT were surface erosion (88.5%, 92/104), articular surface flattening and shortening (86.5%, 90/104), subcortical sclerosis (35.6%, 37/104), osteophyte (41.3%, 43/104) and subcortical cyst (11.5%, 12/104).

This work empirically tests Strong's model at scale by studying the use of language of 122M tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted in the U.S. during the whole year of 2020. On Twitter, we identified three distinct phases. Each of them is characterized by different regimes of the three psycho-social epidemics. In the refusal phase, users refused to accept reality despite the increasing number of deaths in other countries. In the anger phase (started after the announcement of the first death in the country), users' fear translated into anger about the looming feeling that things were about to change. Finally, in the acceptance phase, which began after the authorities imposed physical-distancing measures, users settled into a\\"new normal\\"for their daily activities. Overall, refusal of accepting reality gradually died off as the year went on, while acceptance increasingly took hold.

In parallel, a decrease in emergency patients was observed in the public health system. METHODS: For two 10-week periods before and during the lockdown, ambulance service deployment rates were analysed in 6 ambulance service areas for 6 tracer diagnoses. Random effects were minimised by comparing the results with the corresponding 2018 and 2019 time periods and a calculated expected value. RESULTS: For emergency ambulance service calls, there was a reduction in call numbers (?16%) during the lockdown. A 20% reduction for the categories cardiac and cerebral ischaemia was found. In the urban area, the reduction in cardiac ischaemia was less pronounced at 14% than in the surrounding area at 23%. The deployment figures for intoxications decreased by 27% and for psychiatric emergencies by 16%. CONCLUSION: The public ambulance service was not overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic; there was a decrease in depolyments during the lockdown. For the reduction in cerebral or cardiac ischaemias, the explanatory models for the influence of the lockdown are missing.

The current global coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted health professions education (HPE) and has been of particular consequence for routine face-to-face (F2F) skill education for health professionals and clinical students worldwide. What is being experienced on an unprecedented scale parallels a problem familiar to regional, rural and remote health professionals and students: the learners are willing, and the educational expertise exists, but the two are separated by the tyranny of distance. This article considers how the problem of physical distance might be overcome, so that quality skill education might continue. ISSUES: Psychomotor skills are undeniably easier to teach and learn F2F, and training schedules in tertiary, in-service and accredited professional courses reflect this. This aspect of HPE is therefore at significant risk in the context of social distancing and physical isolation. Psychomotor skills are much more complex than the physical motor outputs alone might suggest, and an F2F skill session is only one way to build the complementary aspects of new skill performance. This article argues that educators and course designers can progress with psychomotor skill education from a physical distance. LESSONS LEARNED: Videos can be used to either passively present content to learners or actively engage them. It is the design of the educational activity, rather than the resource medium itself, that enables active engagement. Furthermore, while many training schedules have been adapted to accommodate intensive F2F skill training once it is safe to do so, distributed practice and the need for reflection during the acquisition and development of new skills may challenge the pedagogical effectiveness of this approach. Skill development can be fostered in the absence of F2F teaching, and in the absence of a shared physical space. Embracing the creative licence to do so will improve equitable access to regional, rural and remote clinicians and students well beyond the resolution of the current pandemic.","output":"Teaching psychomotor skills online: exploring the implications of novel coronavirus on health professions education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in December, 2019. As drugs and vaccines of COVID-19 remain in development, accurate virus detection plays a crucial role in the current public health crisis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) kits have been reliably used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, whereas isothermal nucleic acid amplification-based point-of-care automated kits have also been considered as a simpler and rapid alternative. However, as these kits have only been developed and applied clinically within a short timeframe, their clinical performance has not been adequately evaluated to date. We describe a comparative study between a newly developed cross-priming isothermal amplification (CPA) kit (Kit A) and five RT-qPCR kits (Kits BCF) to evaluate their sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and accuracy. Methods: Fifty-two clinical samples were used including throat swabs (n=30), nasal swabs (n=7), nasopharyngeal swabs (n=7) and sputum specimens (n=8), comprising confirmed (n=26) and negative cases (n=26). SARS-CoV-2 detection was simultaneously performed on each sample using six nucleic acid amplification kits. The sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) and the accuracy for each kit were assessed using clinical manifestation and molecular diagnoses as the reference standard. Reproducibility for RT-qPCR kits was evaluated in triplicate by three different operators using a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive sample. On the basis of the six kits evaluation results, CPA kit (Kit A) and two RT-qPCR Kits (Kit B and F) were applied to the SARS-CoV-2 detection in close-contacts of COVID-19 patients. Results: For Kit A, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV/NPV and accuracy were 100%. Among the five RT-qPCR kits, Kits B, C and F had good agreement with the clinical diagnostic reports (Kappa0.75);Kits D and E were less congruent (0.4Kappa<0.75). Differences between all kits were statistically significant (P<0.001). The reproducibility of RT-qPCR kits was determined using a coefficients of variation (CV) between 0.95% and 2.57%, indicating good reproducibility. Conclusions: This is the first comparative study to evaluate CPA and RT-qPCR kits specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and could serve as a reference for clinical laboratories, thus informing testing protocols amid the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the clinical application of sigh during pressure support ventilation (PSV) feasible? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a multi-center non-inferiority randomized clinical trial on adult intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing PSV. Patients were randomized to the No Sigh group and treated by PSV alone, or to the Sigh group, treated by PSV plus sigh (increase of airway pressure to 30 cmH2Ofor 3 seconds once per minute) until day 28 or death or successful spontaneous breathing trial. The primary endpoint of the study was feasibility, assessed as non-inferiority (5% tolerance) in the proportion of patients failing assisted ventilation. Secondary outcomes included safety, physiological parameters in the first week from randomization, 28-day mortality and ventilator-free days. RESULTS: Two-hundred fifty-eight patients (31% women; median age 65 [54-75] years) were enrolled. In the Sigh group, 23% of patients failed to remain on assisted ventilation vs. 30% in the No Sigh group (absolute difference -7%, 95%CI -18% to 4%; p=0.015 for non-inferiority). Adverse events occurred in 12% vs. 13% in Sigh vs. No Sigh (p=0.852). Oxygenation was improved while tidal volume, respiratory rate and corrected minute ventilation were lower over the first 7 days from randomization in Sigh vs. No Sigh. There was no significant difference in terms of mortality (16% vs. 21%, p=0.342) and ventilator-free days (22 [7-26] vs. 22 [3-25] days, p=0.300) for Sigh vs. No Sigh.

We distributed a survey to 502 mental health providers to investigate the challenges and concerns of the delivery of clinical work during the pandemic. Our study found that most therapists (75.9%) transitioned to telepsychology without suspension of services. Therapists reported varied concerns regarding telepsychology, clinical practice, and their personal lives. The most common concerns identified were the use of therapeutic techniques in telepsychology, provision of remote services, and the practitioner's own health. Our findings also indicated that therapists who are students, female, sexual minorities, unpartnered, and working in public settings experienced relatively greater concerns.

NMR diffusometry with chemical resolution is used to identify unexpected loading- and composition-dependent anomalous diffusion in water/cyclohexane mixtures confined to solid nanoporous glass (NPG) hosts. Diffusion NMR results indicate that data obtained on pure-component liquids in confinement cannot be extrapolated to their nonideal liquid mixtures confined in the same solid host. Loading-dependent data must be obtained on each component in the confined mixture in order to determine which of the liquid components exhibits chemical affinity for the host and, conversely, which of the components exhibits anomalous diffusivity. Most notably, NMR diffusometry revealed that cyclohexane diffusivity varied by 2 orders of magnitude in a water-rich mixture depending on the total fluid loading in the NPG host, ranging from anomalously high diffusivities that significantly exceeded that for pure cyclohexane in NPG at low fluid loadings to kinetically trapped sequestration at high fluid loadings. NMR diffusometry indicates that nonideal solution behavior in fluids confined within nanoporous hosts may have practical implications for enhanced oil recovery methods.

Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective case series was conducted of 35 children admitted to 2 hospitals in New York City between April 1 and July 14, 2020, who met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or epidemiologic criteria for MIS-C. Main Outcomes and Measures: Laboratory and clinical characteristics, with emphasis on mucocutaneous findings, of children who met criteria for MIS-C. The characterization of mucocutaneous features was verified by 2 board-certified pediatric dermatologists. Results: Twenty-five children (11 girls [44%]; median age, 3 years [range, 0.7-17 years]) were identified who met definitional criteria for MIS-C; an additional 10 children (5 girls [50%]; median age, 1.7 years [range, 0.2-15 years]) were included as probable MIS-C cases (patients met all criteria with the exception of laboratory test evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection or known exposure). The results of polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive for 10 patients (29%), and the results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G tests were positive for 19 patients (54%).

In this study, we aimed to develop a column that effectively adsorbs high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein 1 by altering the pore size of the fiber. MATERIALS AND METHODS First, we produced three types of porous polymethylmethacrylate fiber by altering the concentration of polymethylmethacrylate dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. We then selected a fiber based on the results of an in vitro incubation test of high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein 1 adsorption. Using the selected fiber, we constructed a new column and tested its high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein 1 adsorption capacity during 4-h extracorporeal hemoperfusion in a swine acute liver failure model. RESULTS Electron microscope observation showed that the three types of fibers had different pore sizes on the surface and in cross section, which were dependent on the concentration of polymethylmethacrylate. In the in vitro incubation test, fiber with moderate-sized pores demonstrated the highest adsorption capacity.

However, vaccination may lead to some complications. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the complications of transplant recipients who received Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted among 667 transplant recipients (211 liver transplant recipients and 456 kidney transplant recipients), who received the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine during March to August 2021 and had medical records in Montaserieh Hospital, affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. The demographic and clinical information as well as patient's symptoms after each dose of the vaccine were recorded. RESULTS: Only 16.8% and 13.7% of the patients experienced some symptoms following the first and second doses of Sinopharm vaccine, respectively. No significant difference was observed between patients younger than 50 years and those aged 50 years and over in terms of complication rate of Sinopharm vaccine (P>0.005). Vaccine failure was reported in 10% of the cases; however, mortality rate due to infection with the Delta variant of COVID-19 in this population was reported to be 0.7%. CONCLUSION: Based on the obtained results, adverse reactions of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine are generally mild, predictable, and non-life-threatening both in the first and second doses.

Here we describe the integration of genomic surveillance into epidemiologic response within Humboldt County, a rural county in northwest California. METHODS: Through a collaborative effort, 853 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generated, representing ~58% of the 1,449 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases detected in Humboldt County as of March 12, 2021. Phylogenetic analysis of these data was used to develop a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 introductions to the county and to support contact tracing and epidemiologic investigations of all large outbreaks in the county. RESULTS: In the case of an outbreak on a commercial farm, viral genomic data were used to validate reported epidemiologic links and link additional cases within the community who did not report a farm exposure to the outbreak. During a separate outbreak within a skilled nursing facility, genomic surveillance data were used to rule out the putative index case, detect the emergence of an independent Spike:N501Y substitution, and verify that the outbreak had been brought under control. CONCLUSIONS: These use cases demonstrate how developing genomic surveillance capacity within local public health departments can support timely and responsive deployment of genomic epidemiology for surveillance and outbreak response based on local needs and priorities.

RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with IBD are not at increased risk of COVID-19 but several risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) have been identified, such as active IBD, obesity, and corticosteroid use. COVID-19 outcomes are similar among patients with IBD and the overall population. Although biologics have not been shown to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 complications, several risk factors have been associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD, including older age, obesity, the presence of comorbidities, active disease, and corticosteroid use. IBD therapy should, therefore, be continued with the aim of attaining or maintaining remission, except for corticosteroids, which should be held or reduced to the minimal effective dose. Although it has been recommended that immunosuppressive therapy be held during a case of COVID-19, the half-lives of these drugs and data on the timing of restarting therapy limit the strength of these recommendations. We recommend COVID-19 vaccination for IBD patients whenever available, as benefits to the individual and to society outweigh the risks. SUMMARY: As our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 continues to evolve, we are learning more about its impact in patients with IBD and how to better manage patients in this setting. Managing IBD during this pandemic has also highlighted the importance of restructuring services in order to adapt to current and potential future outbreaks.

The limited number of authorized small-molecule direct-acting antivirals present challenges with pill burden, the necessity for intravenous administration or potential drug interactions. There remains an unmet medical need for effective and convenient treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that depends on host intracellular ribonucleotide pools for its replication. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a ubiquitous host enzyme that is required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The inhibition of DHODH leads to a depletion of intracellular pyrimidines, thereby impacting viral replication in vitro. Brequinar (BRQ) is an orally available, selective, and potent low nanomolar inhibitor of human DHODH that has been shown to exhibit broad spectrum inhibition of RNA virus replication. However, host cell nucleotide salvage pathways can maintain intracellular pyrimidine levels and compensate for BRQ-mediated DHODH inhibition. In this report, we show that the combination of BRQ and the salvage pathway inhibitor dipyridamole (DPY) exhibits strong synergistic antiviral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 by enhanced depletion of the cellular pyrimidine nucleotide pool. The combination of BRQ and DPY showed antiviral activity against the prototype SARS-CoV-2 as well as the Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants.

Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs > 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR > 3). LIMITATIONS: A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes.

Inclusion criteria were patients with suspected PE and positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Exclusion criteria were negative or inconclusive RT-PCR and other chest CT indications. CTPA features were evaluated and severity scores, presence, and localisation of PE were reported.

Sixteen patients were diagnosed with PE with a predominant segmental distribution. Statistically significant differences were found in the highest D-dimer determination in patients with PE and ICU admission regarding elevated IL-6 values.

Although preclinical studies have demonstrated that CRPS may be driven in part by autoinflammation, clinical use of immune-modulating drugs in CRPS is limited. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug used to treat malaria and autoimmune disorders that may provide benefit in CRPS. OBJECTIVES: To describe the use of HCQ in patients with refractory CRPS and investigate possible mechanisms of benefit in a mouse model of CRPS. METHODS: We initiated HCQ therapy in 7 female patients with refractory CRPS undergoing treatment at the Stanford Pain Management Center. We subsequently undertook studies in the mouse tibial fractureCcasting model of CRPS to identify mechanisms underlying symptom reduction. We evaluated behavior using mechanical allodynia and spinal cord autoinflammation by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We treated 7 female patients with chronic, refractory CRPS with HCQ 200 mg twice daily for 2 months, followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. Two patients stopped HCQ secondary to lack of response or side effects. Overall, HCQ significantly improved average numerical rating scale pain from 6.8  1.1 before HCQ to 3.8  1.9 after HCQ treatment. In the tibial fractureCcasting mouse model of CRPS, we observed reductions in allodynia, paw edema, and warmth following daily HCQ treatment starting at 3 weeks after injury. Spinal cord dorsal horn microglial activation and cytokine levels were also reduced by HCQ treatment. CONCLUSION: Together, these preclinical and clinical results suggest that HCQ may benefit patients with CRPS at least in part by modulating autoinflammation and support further investigation into the use of HCQ for CRPS.","output":"Of mice, microglia, and (wo)men: a case series and mechanistic investigation of hydroxychloroquine for complex regional pain syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The myopia epidemic has become a global public health problem.

The main outcomes of the study were cumulative incidence, defined as number of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19 admitted in emergency department divided by the total number of patients with epilepsy at risk; and CFR based on the number of deaths during the enrolment period. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for fatality in patients with active epilepsy. RESULTS Of the 1537 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 21 (1.3%) had active epilepsy. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of COVID-19 in epilepsy patients was higher (1.2% [0.6-2.4]) compared to population without epilepsy (0.5% [0.5-0.5]). In RT-PCR positive patients there were no significant differences in CFR in patients with active epilepsy compared to patients without epilepsy (33.3% vs. 8.3%; p =0.266).

In this multicenter, retrospective study, we collected data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, who died or were discharged between February 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. The data on demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations on admission, complications, treatment, and outcome were collected. A total of 482 patients were enrolled in this study. Of those, 142 (29.5%) patients showed abnormal liver biochemistries on admission, and patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) accounted for 67.6%, 69.0%, and 16.2%, respectively. Those with abnormal liver biochemistries showed higher percentages of severe cases and comorbidities and were more likely to have dyspnea, chest distress or pain, and increased hemoglobin (Hb) on admission. Higher rates of complications and mortality and worse recovery when discharged were observed in patients with abnormal AST or TBIL. The multivariable regression analysis showed that chest distress or pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.765; P = 0.018), dyspnea (OR, 2.495; P = 0.001), elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level (OR, 1.007; P = 0.008), elevated white blood count (WBC) (OR, 1.139; P = 0.013), and elevated Hb concentration (OR, 1.024; P = 0.001) were independent factors associated with elevated liver biochemistries in COVID-19 patients.

The number of participants in the studies ranged from 6 to 70 people living with dementia and lasted for 3 weeks up to 5 months. The interventions were aquatic exercise, wheelchair cycling, art gallery discussion groups, an intergenerational mentorship programme, horse riding, walking and outdoor gardening. Overall, the studies indicated preliminary evidence of psychological (n=7), physical (n=4) and physiological (n=1) benefits, and all interventions were feasible to conduct away from the aged care facilities. However, the low number of participants in the included studies (n=177), the absence of a control group in all but three studies, and potential for selection bias, limits the generalisability of the findings. CONCLUSIONS Activities outside of the residential aged care setting have the potential to be effective at providing a range of benefits for people living with dementia. Higher quality studies are required to encourage care providers to implement these type of activities in dementia care settings.

Otorhinolaryngologists deal intimately with pathologies of the head and neck region and upper respiratory tract and have been reported as a vulnerable group of healthcare workers who may be more susceptible to COVID-19 nosocomial infection. METHODS: In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the adaptations of Singapore's largest tertiary Otorhinolaryngology department during the COVID-19 outbreak. This was undertaken via an evidence-based approach. The relevant medical literature and evidence underlying our adaptations are highlighted. RESULTS: A four-pronged strategy including (1) personnel segregation, (2) triaging and decantment, (3) use of personal protective equipment and (4) changes in clinical practice was employed. The strategy was bolstered by drawing upon a collective learnt experience from the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. CONCLUSION: A rigorous framework which can preserve operationality while navigating the heightened risks during this outbreak is critical for every Otorhinolaryngology department. As the pandemic continues to evolve and more scientific reports of this disease are made available, approaches will need to be morphed.","output":"Adaptations of a Tertiary Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Department in Singapore during the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Serosurveys help to ascertain burden of infection. Prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serosurveys in New York City (NYC) used nonrandom samples. During June-October 2020, the NYC Health Department conducted a population-based survey estimating SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in NYC adults. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the NYC 2020 Community Health Survey. We estimated citywide and stratified antibody prevalence using a hybrid design: serum tested with the DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay and self-reported antibody test results were used together. We estimated univariate frequencies and 95% confidence intervals (CI), accounting for complex survey design. Two-sided P valuesa? &#8804;a? .05 were statistically significant. RESULTS: There were 1074 respondents; 497 provided blood and 577 provided only a self-reported antibody test result. Weighted prevalence was 24.3% overall (95% CI, 20.7%-28.3%).

This educational gap is prominent in many medical schools as most radiology curricula are a part of other specialty trainings, usually provided by non-radiologists. After COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increased trend in online education. However, questions have been raised about the efficacy and acceptance of online education. We developed a course on the principles of radiology and medical imaging basics to target Egyptian medical students. We then assessed the impact of these educational videos through several online surveys. Our \\"The Principles of Radiology Online Course\\" was delivered to students at various Egyptian medical schools;it was a prerecorded series composed of nine sessions, and each session followed the sequence of a pre-test, video, and post-test. There was a final survey to assess the overall feedback. Finally, we analyzed the results to give insight onto how teaching radiology through online lectures can help build better physicians. Results Among various medical schools around Egypt, 1396 Egyptian medical students joined this cohort. Cohort population percentage was 56% female and 44% male. Ninety-eight percent of the students agreed that this program increased their understanding of radiology. Eighty-four percent of the students found the platform friendly and easy to use. Seventy-nine percent found these webinars were more convenient compared to in-person education. Statistical significance (p-value < 0.05) was achieved in all sessions after comparing students pre and post-test scores, and in students confidence and knowledge level before and after the course.

The overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also uses ACE2 as the cell receptor4.

Therefore, this systematic review was designed to assess the available data regarding the efficacy of the immunomodulatory drugs used to manage COVID-19. A systematic literature search was carried out up to May 27, 2020, in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) and also Clinicaltrials.gov. Sixty-six publications and 111 clinical trials were recognized as eligible, reporting the efficacy of the immunomodulatory agents, including corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, passive and cytokine-targeted therapies, mesenchymal stem cells, and blood-purification therapy, in COVID-19 patients. The data were found to be heterogeneous, and the clinical trials were yet to post any findings. Medicines were found to regulate the immune system by boosting the innate responses or suppressing the inflammatory reactions. Passive and cytokine-targeted therapies and mesenchymal stem cells were mostly safe and could regulate the disease much better. These studies underscored the significance of severity profiling in COVID-19 patients, along with appropriate timing, duration, and dosage of the therapies.

Here we have a comprehensive characterization of HMS at urban and rural sites in North China Plain (NCP) by using the real-time measurements from a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and a single-particle AMS together with offline filter analysis. Our results showed much higher winter concentration of HMS at the rural site (average1: 2.58a?a?2.56a?ga?m-3) than that (1.70a?a?2.68a?ga?m-3) in Beijing due to the more frequent fog events, low particle acidity and high concentration of precursors. The HMS on average contributed 6.3% and 5.2% to organic aerosol (OA), and 16% and 12% to the total particulate sulfur, at the rural and urban sites, respectively. HMS was highly correlated with aqueous-phase secondary OA and sulfate, and its contribution to the total particulate sulfur increased significantly as a function of relative humidity demonstrating the effective HMS production from aqueous-phase processing. Single-particle analysis showed that HMS-containing particles were mainly mixed with amine-related compounds. In addition, we found that organosulfur compounds (OS) estimated from sulfur-containing fragments of AMS correlated well with HMS at both urban and rural sites. While OS at the rural site was dominated by HMS, other types of OS were also important in urban area. The high HMS also affected the estimation of particle acidity using the AMS measured and predicted ammonium, particularly during severe haze episodes. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of HMS in winter in NCP, and it could be more important in total particulate sulfur budget as the continuous decrease in sulfate in the future.","output":"The importance of hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) in winter haze episodes in North China Plain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to determine weights for eleven criteria in order to prioritize COVID-19 non-critical patients for admission to hospital in healthcare settings with limited resources.

We propose a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) procedure without mesenteric closure with several specific technical details to avoid IH. To support this view, we have reviewed the outcome of our LRYGB patients and have carried out an anatomical study on cadavers. METHODS A retrospective observational study was carried out using the Unit's prospective database. The patients selected were those who were operated on for morbid obesity using LRYGB and who presented to the Emergency Unit with symptoms of intestinal obstruction (IO). Data concerning demographics, weight progress, technical details of the surgery, follow-up percentage, morbidity, and mortality were collected. Furthermore, an anatomical model was made in order to recreate the surgery on cadavers. RESULTS Only 1.6 % of postoperative IO and very few (0.3 %) of IH cases were associated with our technique of LRYGB without mesenteric closure. The anatomical model showed two large potential hernia spaces, but their supramesocolic situation, the orientation of the bowel loops, leaving the mesentery and omentum undivided and the antecolic passage of the alimentary limb made intestinal herniation difficult even though the mesenteric spaces were not closed. CONCLUSIONS With a proper technique, the closure of mesenteric spaces after a LRYGB is not essential to avoid postoperative IH in bariatric patients, as evidenced in an anatomical model.","output":"Anatomical basis for the low incidence of internal hernia after a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass without mesenteric closure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) has been suggested in legal settings as an alternative cause of retinal hemorrhages (RHs) in young children who may have sustained abusive head trauma.

METHODS We conducted a prospective, multicenter study of children <4 years old with newly diagnosed increased ICP as determined by using direct measurement and/or clinical criteria. Infants who were premature, neonates, and suspected survivors of abusive head trauma were excluded on the basis of nonocular findings. Fundus examinations were performed; extent, number, and type of RH in each of 4 distinct retinal zones were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-six children (27 boys) were studied (mean age 15.4 months; range 1-43 months). All of the children had elevated ICP that required intervention. One child had papilledema. No child (0%; 95% confidence interval: 0%-6.4%) or eye (0%; 95% confidence interval: 0%-3.3%) was found to have an RH.

RESULTS: Except for inflammatory cell infiltration under the skin at the injection sites and transient elevation of body temperature and serum albumin, no Ad-HBV-related toxic effects were noted in any treatment group. Moreover, interferon (IFN)- enzyme-linked immunospot assays showed that Ad-HBV induced the targeting of T cells to a broad spectrum of HBV-specific epitopes spanning all three of the selected HBV immunogens (core, polymerase, and envelope domains) in a dose-dependent manner. Although anti-Ad antibody was produced in all groups (except for the saline control), the antibody titers were significantly lower in the high-dose Ad-HBV group than in the group that received the same dose of the Ad-null empty vector. In addition, the IFN- and IL-2 expression levels in the liver were significantly improved for the mid-dose, high-dose, and Ad-null control group (p < 0.05), but not for the low-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this safety assessment indicates that the Ad-HBV candidate vaccine is a potent specific immunotherapeutic agent, supporting its further clinical development as an anti-HBV infection vaccine.

OBJECTIVE: Characterize safety and occurrence of immediate relapses following COVID-19 vaccination in a large cohort of MS patients. METHODS: We assessed the safety of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in adult MS patients. RESULTS: Between 20 December 2020 and 25 January 2021, 555 MS patients received the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and 435 received the second dose. There were three cases of COVID-19 infection encountered after the first dose. Safety profile of COVID-19 vaccine was characterized by pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. No increased risk of relapse activity was noted over a median follow-up of 20 and 38 days after first and second vaccine doses, respectively. The rate of patients with acute relapse was 2.1% and 1.6% following the first and second doses, respectively, similar to the rate in non-vaccinating patients during the corresponding period. Mild increase in the rate of adverse events was noted in younger patients (18-55 years), among patients with lower disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) a??3.0), and in patients treated with immunomodulatory drugs.

Prior to COVID-19, the global burden of disease attributable to sedentary behavior disproportionately affected the health of people with disabilities (PWD). This pre-existing gap has only widened during COVID-19 due to limited disability-friendly digital exercise resources. The purpose of this work is to examine this gap in accessibility to digital fitness resources, and re-frame the notion of accessibility to suit the contemporary context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using machine learning, video titles/descriptions about home exercise ordered by relevance populated on YouTube between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 were examined. RESULTS: Using the search terms, \\"home exercise,\\" \\"home-based exercise,\\" \\"exercise no equipment,\\" \\"workout no equipment,\\" \\"exercise at home,\\" or \\"at-home exercise,\\" 700 videos ordered by relevance included 28 (4%) that were inclusive of participants with disabilities. Unfortunately, most digital fitness resources are therefore inaccessible to PWD. The global pause the pandemic has induced may be the right moment to construct a comprehensive, indexed digital library of home-based fitness video content for the disabled. There is a further need for more nuanced understandings of accessibility as technological advancements continue. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical activity is incredibly important to the quality of life and health of all people. Physical activity levels, however, remain lower among persons with disabilities. Access to disability-friendly resources remains a challenge and worsened by the circumstances of COVID-19 due to an apparent lack of digital fitness resources for persons with disabilities. A broader and comprehensive definition of accessibility must recognize digital advances and access to physical activity for persons with disabilities must feature digital resources.","output":"Access denied: the shortage of digitized fitness resources for people with disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fairness-aware online learning framework has arisen as a powerful tool for the continual lifelong learning setting. The goal for the learner is to sequentially learn new tasks where they come one after another over time and the learner ensures the statistic parity of the new coming task across different protected sub-populations (e.g. race and gender). A major drawback of existing methods is that they make heavy use of the i.i.d assumption for data and hence provide static regret analysis for the framework. However, low static regret cannot imply a good performance in changing environments where tasks are sampled from heterogeneous distributions. To address the fairness-aware online learning problem in changing environments, in this paper, we first construct a novel regret metric FairSAR by adding long-term fairness constraints onto a strongly adapted loss regret. Furthermore, to determine a good model parameter at each round, we propose a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, namely FairSAOML, which is able to adapt to changing environments in both bias control and model precision. The problem is formulated in the form of a bi-level convex-concave optimization with respect to the model's primal and dual parameters that are associated with the model's accuracy and fairness, respectively. The theoretic analysis provides sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and violation of cumulative fairness constraints. Our experimental evaluation on different real-world datasets with settings of changing environments suggests that the proposed FairSAOML significantly outperforms alternatives based on the best prior online learning approaches.","output":"Adaptive Fairness-Aware Online Meta-Learning for Changing Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicidal behaviour is a global public health problem, and one population group with high prevalence rates is medical students, especially in the ideation component.

VIRAL INFECTION - FIV FIV, a lentivirus that shares many properties with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can cause an acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which predisposes cats to other infections, stomatitis, neurological disorders and tumours. Although secondary infections are common, specific opportunistic infections or acquired immunodeficiency virus-defining infections, such as those that occur with HIV, are not commonly reported in FIV-infected cats. In most naturally infected cats, FIV does not cause a severe clinical syndrome; with appropriate care, FIV-infected cats can live many years before succumbing to conditions unrelated to their FIV infection. Thus, overall survival time is not necessarily shorter than in uninfected cats, and quality of life is usually high over many years or lifelong. VIRAL INFECTION - FELV FeLV, an oncornavirus, is more pathogenic than FIV. Historically, it was considered to account for more disease-related deaths and clinical syndromes in cats than any other infectious agent. Recently, the prevalence and importance of FeLV have been decreasing, mainly because of testing and eradication programmes and the use of FeLV vaccines. Progressive FeLV infection can cause tumours, bone marrow suppression and immunosuppression, as well as neurological and other disorders, and leads to a decrease in life expectancy. However, with appropriate care, many FeLV-infected cats can also live several years with a good quality of life. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE A decision regarding treatment or euthanasia should never be based solely on the presence or absence of a retrovirus infection.

Insect cell and mammalian Id generated similar levels of tumor-specific antibodies, showing no impairment in antibody responses to native tumor antigen despite the glycoslylation differences in the immunogen. Combining insect cell production and maleimide-based KLH conjugation offered the highest levels of anti-tumor immunity.

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to study the influence of governmental prevention and control response on orthopedic trauma in children. Methods: : We collected and reviewed data on orthopedic trauma from the first half of 2018, 2019, and 2020. The data were divided according to the time of prevention and control response level in 2020. By comparing the relevant data from orthopedic emergency and operating rooms from the past three years, the influence of governmental pandemic prevention measures on orthopedic trauma in children was analyzed. Results: : A total of 36301 children were included in the study cohort. Before the prevention and control response, the data of the orthopedic emergency department in 2020 was the same as the previous two years. Under the first-level response, the number of fractures, open injuries, radial head subluxation, and surgery were significantly reduced, and the severity of patients with surgery was also significantly reduced. Under the second-level response, the number of operations began to increase, and the severity of the disease also began to rise. Under the third-level response control, the number of fractures, open injuries, and operations have returned to the levels of the previous two years. The severity of the operation has also returned to its previous level. The number of subluxations of the radial head is still different from before.

Household contacts were then prospectively followed active symptom monitoring through the 21-day period and nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3-7 days intervals. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data (when available) were collected. RESULTS: Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility. Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This avoids the partial reduction of the nanorods from Cu(2)O to Cu that was observed during chemical removal of the template, which was attributed to the presence of residual aluminium from the template fabrication process that reacts with the etchant and lowers the electrochemical potential of the nanorods to a value that favours reduction. Using the electrochemical removal method, the reliable production of phase-pure, free-standing, crystalline Cu(2)O nanorod arrays on ITO/glass substrates is demonstrated.

Replication of picornaviruses and coronaviruses requires 3Cpro (3C protease) and 3CLpro (3C-like protease) respectively, which are structurally analogous with chymotrypsin-fold, but the former is a monomer and the latter is dimeric due to an extra third domain for dimerization. Subtle structural differences in the S2 and S3 pockets of these proteases make inhibitors selective, but some dual inhibitors have been discovered.

At the moment no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with COVID19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft. Case report A 67-year old male patient, undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft six years before, was admitted to the Emergency Department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Due to the progressive impairment of respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission. The day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography (CT) scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died upon the arrival in radiological suite. Conclusion Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID19 infection. In COVID19 patients with prosthetic graft an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.","output":"Acute thrombosis of an aortic prosthetic graft in a patient with severe COVID-19 related pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to manifest in our society, we still lack evidence-based treatment guidelines.

In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. CHAPTER 2: ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER CONNECTION TO CULTURE: BUILDING STRONGER INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE WELLBEING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said - that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. CHAPTER 3: PHYSICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: HEALTHY, LIVEABLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners - to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE ANTHROPOCENE: THE ECOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia's position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches - planetary health, Indigenous people's knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. CHAPTER 5: DISRUPTING THE COMMERCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. CHAPTER 6: DIGITAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. CHAPTER 7: GOVERNANCE FOR HEALTH AND EQUITY: A VISION FOR OUR FUTURE: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia's direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing - most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media. Measures to overcome the climate crisis were adopted and democratic processes introduced in the provision of housing, education and community development.","output":"Australia in 2030: what is our path to health for all?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We extend the generalised functional additive mixed model to include (functional) compositional covariates carrying relative information of a whole.

Although they have proven to be very effective in the general population, little is known about their efficacy in immunocompromised patients. HIV-infected individuals response to vaccine may vary according to the type of vaccine and their level of immunosuppression. We evaluated immunogenicity of an mRNA anti-SARS CoV-2 vaccine in HIV-positive individuals. Methods HIV-positive individuals (n=121) were recruited from HIV clinics in Montreal and stratified according to their CD4 counts. A control group of 20 health care workers na?ve to SARS CoV-2 was used. The participants Anti-RBD IgG responses were measured by ELISA at baseline and 3 to 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine). Results Eleven of 121 participants had anti-COVID-19 antibodies at baseline, and a further 4 had incomplete data for the analysis. Mean anti-RBD IgG responses were similar between between the HIV negative control group (n=20) and the combined HIV+ group (n=106) (p = 0.72). However, these responses were significantly lower in the group with <250 CD4 cells/mm3. (p<0.0001). Increasing age was independently associated with decreased immunogenicity. Conclusion HIV-positive individuals with CD4 counts over 250 cells/mm3 have an anti-RBD IgG response similar to the general population.

While aging in place has been a policy priority in rapidly greying Canada, a lack of complementary public supports poses challenges for many older adults and their family members. Employing a qualitative methodology, and drawing from the notion of aging in the right place, we collected personal narratives of 12 women (aged 65 to 92) in two geographic areas in Ontario, including residents of regular houses, apartments, condominiums, assisted living and community housing for seniors. Through thematic analysis, we identified four overarching themes: 1) striving to continue on at home, 2) living as a strong independent woman, 3) the help needed to support their independence, and 4) social activities to maintain self. Our findings illustrate how, despite their mobility limitations, older women can change their residential environment and their behavior by deploying the coping strategies and resources they have developed over time. However, we also found that older women are largely silent about their needs, and that experiences varied depending on life histories, health conditions, and the availability of supports in their wider environment (home care, alternative housing options, accessible transportation, opportunities for social and physical activities). We hope these findings will incite further studies and discussion to help make aging in the right place a real choice for anyone who wishes to do so.","output":"Fiercely independent: Experiences of aging in the right place of older women living alone with physical limitations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Numerous reports have demonstrated the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 has had on vulnerable populations.

METHODS: We convened a Workgroup with the goal to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the most medically vulnerable people in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, particularly those with significant social needs. We did this through (1) identifying vulnerable patients in high-need geographic areas, (2) developing and implementing a needs assessment/outreach tool tailored to meet cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, (3) surveying pharmacies for access to medication delivery, (4) gathering information about sources of food delivery, groceries and/or prepared food, (5) gathering information about means of travel, and (6) assessing need for testing. We then combined these six elements into a patient-oriented branch and a community outreach/engagement branch. CONCLUSIONS: Our highly intentional and methodical approach to patient and community outreach with a strong geographic component has led to fruitful efforts in COVID-19 mitigation. Our patient-level outreach engages our health centers clinical teams, particularly community health workers, and is providing the direct benefit of material and service resources for our at-risk patients and their families.

Increasing demand coupled with limited resources in a publicly funded system (e.g. Ontario, the largest province in Canada) resulted in a waitlist for this procedure. Our province has recommended maximum wait times (RMWT) for patients referred to CATH. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience over the past decade in attempting to meet RMWTs for patients needing CATH at our centre, and to discuss issues concerning capacity planning in providing timely service. METHODS: We measured the proportion of patients undergoing a procedure within the RWMT, and calculated both the mean number of patients and mean length of time on the wait list for each year over a decade for those referred to CATH using prospectively collected registry data. We identified factors that increased referrals or improved capacity. Wait time was compared to community standard RMWTs in order to establish if and how RMWTs were achieved. RESULTS: Despite a number of systematic and capacity improvements, RMWTs were not achieved until after the addition of a 4th laboratory. INTERPRETATION: Improving access to CATH in our centre was reactive to the increasing need of the community rather than based on anticipation of need and continuity of service within RMWTs. Registry data can help monitor key indicators (e.g. RMWT).

To investigate how mutations that alter the activation pH of the HA protein influence the fitness of an avian H5N1 influenza virus in a mammalian model, we infected C57BL/6J or DBA/2J mice and compared the replication and virulence of recombinant A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/04 (H5N1) HA-Y231H mutant, wild-type, and HA-H241Q and HA-K582I mutant viruses that have HA activation pH values of 6.3, 5.9, 5.6, and 5.4, respectively. The HA-Y231H mutant virus was highly susceptible to acid inactivation in vitro and was attenuated for growth and virulence in mice, suggesting that an H5N1 HA protein triggered at pH 6.3 is too unstable for the virus to remain fit. Wild-type and HA-H241Q viruses were similar in pathogenicity and grew to similar levels in mice, ducks, and cell cultures derived from both avian and mammalian tissues, suggesting that H5N1 HA proteins triggered at pH values in the range of 5.9 to 5.6 broadly support replication. The HA-K582I mutant virus had greater growth and virulence in DBA/2J mice than the wild type did, although the mutant virus was highly attenuated in ducks. The data suggest that adaptation of avian H5N1 influenza virus for infection in mammals is supported by a decrease in the HA activation pH to 5.4.

By applying three successive freezing/thawing cycles, a stable porous network structure with elastic properties is designed, as evidenced by SEM and rheology.

The implementation of distance education has led to an increased sedentary lifestyle, decreased physical activity, and increased use of information technologies. The purpose of this study was to analyze the sedentary habits of female students and their physical health during a period of restricted physical activity with reference to online instruction. Methods: The research was conducted among the first to third grade students of Secondary School Konjic, 45 days after the implementation of online instruction. Students of general secondary school (N = 83), business school (N = 68), and medical school (N = 55) completed the questionnaire after their parents gave their consent. Results: The total number of students surveyed was 206, with students from all three schools studied participating in online classes for up to 4 hours. Medical school students spend more than 3 hours completing schoolwork, while students at the other two schools spend up to 2 hours. Statistically significant differences in non-use of information technology during free time exist among medical students (p = 0.00). Female medical students reported daily symptoms such as headaches, reactions to the visual organ (dry eye, redness, and tearing), and pain in the fist area (twitching, cramps, and tingling). Statistically significant differences in the occurrence of pain in the upper back and chest girdle occurred in students of business school (p = 0.00) and general high school (p = 0.00) compared to medical students. Conclusion: Medical students who use information technology the most reported headaches, pain in the fist area, and frequent reactions to the sense of sight (dry eye, lacrimation, and redness).

Responses to surveys, however, are susceptible to psychological biases, including framing effects and social desirability. Our aim was to measure the effects of these biases on estimates of compliance with public health guidance (eg, hand-washing, social distancing). DESIGN We conducted two online experiments (n=1800) and varied whether questions were framed positively or negatively (eg, 'I always wash my hands' vs 'I don't always wash my hands'). We also varied the degree to which anonymity was assured, via a 'list' experiment. RESULTS Reported compliance, despite being generally high, was reduced by negatively framing questions and increasing anonymity using a list experiment technique. Effect sizes were large: compliance estimates diminished by up to 17% points and 10% points, respectively. CONCLUSION Estimates of compliance with COVID-19 guidance vary substantially with how the question is asked. Standard tracking surveys tend to pose questions in ways that lead to higher estimates than alternative approaches. Experimental tests of these surveys offer public health officials greater insight into the range of likely compliance estimates to better inform policy and communications.","output":"It depends on how you ask: measuring bias in population surveys of compliance with COVID-19 public health guidance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To prevent or reduce mortality from lung diseases, new biological materials and scaffolds are needed to conduct more accurate research and support lung tissue regeneration.

Design-Expert software was employed for studying various compositions for 3D printing. The selected scaffolds underwent physiochemical, biological and mechanical studies to evaluate if they are capable of MRC-5 cell line growth, proliferation, and migration. Based on the results, the average diameter of the chitosan/polycaprolactone strands was measured at 360 m. Chitosan concentration controlled the printability, while changes in polycaprolactone content did not affect printability. The scaffolds showed excellent potential in swelling, degradation, and mechanical behavior, although they can be modified by adjusting the polycaprolactone content. The scaffolds also revealed notable cell adhesion, nontoxicity, low apoptosis, high proliferation, and cell biocompatibility in vitro. To sum up, scaffold 3 (chitosan/polycaprolactone ratio: 4 : 1) revealed better activity for MRC-5 cell culture.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the ad-hoc strategic plan developed to cope with this crisis and to share its outcomes. METHODS: We describe participants clinical and demographic features. Additionally, we explain our strategic plan aimed at minimizing the impact on clinical trial research activities, which included SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG serological tests to all participants and personnel. The outcomes of the plan are described in terms of observed safety events and drop-outs during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were participating in 16 active clinical trials in Fundaci ACE when the lockdown was established. During the confinement, we performed 1018 calls to the participants, which led to identify adverse events in 26 and COVID-19 symptoms in 6. A total of 83 patients (64%) could restart on-site visits as early as May 11, 2020. All SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests performed before on-site visits were negative and only three IgG serological tests were positive. Throughout the study period, we only observed one drop-out, due to an adverse event unrelated to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The plan implemented by Fundaci ACE was able to preserve safety and integrity of ongoing clinical trials.

Replication of RVs is restricted in a host species-specific manner, and this barrier is determined predominantly by the host interferon (IFN) signaling and the ability of different RV strains to successfully negate IFN activation and amplification pathways. In addition, viral attachment to the target intestinal epithelial cells also regulates host range restriction. Several studies have focused on the role of the innate immune response in regulating RV replication and pathogenesis. The knowledge accrued from these efforts is likely to result in rational attenuation of RV vaccines to closely match circulating (and host species-matched) virus strains. In this chapter, we review prevalent models of RV interactions with innate immune factors, viral strategies employed to regulate their function, and the implications of these findings for improved RV vaccine development.","output":"The Role of Innate Immunity in Regulating Rotavirus Replication, Pathogenesis, and Host Range Restriction and the Implications for Live Rotaviral Vaccine Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gold nanoantennas have been used in a variety of biomedical applications due to their attractive electronic and optical properties, which are shape- and size-dependent.

It can be successfully prevented with live attenuated CPV-2 vaccines when given at the appropriate age and in the absence of maternal antibody interference. Rapid diagnosis of parvoviral enteritis in young dogs is essential to ensuring suitable barrier nursing protocols within veterinary hospitals. The current diagnostic trend is to use multiplexed PCR panels to detect an array of pathogens commonly responsible for diarrhea in dogs. The multiplexed PCR assays do not distinguish wild from vaccine CPV-2. They are highly sensitive and detect even a low level of virus shedding, such as those caused by the CPV-2 vaccine. The aim of this study was to identify the CPV-2 subtypes detected in diagnostic specimens and rule out occult shedding of CPV-2 vaccine strains. For a total of 21 samples that tested positive for CPV-2 in a small animal fecal pathogens diagnostic multiplexed tandem PCR (MT-PCR) panel during 2014C2016 we partially characterized the VP2 gene of CPV-2. Vaccine CPV-2 strain, wild type CPV-2a subtypes and vaccine-like CPV-2b subtypes were detected. High copy number was indicative of wild-type CPV-2a presence, but presence of vaccine-like CPV-2b had a variable copy number in fecal samples. A yardstick approach to a copy number or C(t)-value to discriminate vaccine strain from a wild type virus of CPV-2 can be, in some cases, potentially misleading.

Countless epidemics have produced high mortality rates in vulnerable populations. With the understanding of the spread of these types of diseases, population groups have been able to adapt and better cope with infections. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the strategies used is the modeling of infectious diseases with the aim of establishing protection measures for people and stopping the spread of the epidemic. Our study evaluates protection strategies through infectious disease modeling with COVID-19 data in a commune in Chile. The results of the simulations indicate that the model generates important protection for the population by recognizing the super-propagating people (bridge nodes). This type of protection can be key in the fight against COVID-19. ABSTRACT: Among the diverse and important applications that networks currently have is the modeling of infectious diseases. Immunization, or the process of protecting nodes in the network, plays a key role in stopping diseases from spreading. Hence the importance of having tools or strategies that allow the solving of this challenge. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of the DIL-W [Formula: see text] ranking in immunizing nodes in an edge-weighted network with 3866 nodes and 6,841,470 edges. The network is obtained from a real database and the spread of COVID-19 was modeled with the classic SIR model. We apply the protection to the network, according to the importance ranking list produced by DIL-W [Formula: see text] , considering different protection budgets. Furthermore, we consider three different values for [Formula: see text]; in this way, we compare how the protection performs according to the value of [Formula: see text].","output":"Protection Strategy against an Epidemic Disease on Edge-Weighted Graphs Applied to a COVID-19 Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The egg\\\\laying seasons of various captive waterfowl in the Wildfowl Trust collections at Slimbridge and Peakirk are compared with the situation in the wild. Special attention is focussed on the shelduck and sheldgeese (Tadornini), perching duck (Cairinini), diving duck (Aythyini), sea duck (Mergini), eiders (Somateriini) and stifftails (Oxyurini). Two kinds of response could be distinguished at Slimbridge. In one, egg\\\\laying began sometime in spring, when daylengths reached a stimulatory level, and continued until the corresponding daylengths in summer or autumn were reached, that is, the egg\\\\laying season extended symmetrically on either side of the summer solstice. This is regarded as a primitive\\\\type response and is characteristic of phylogenetic lines which are thought to have evolved in, and radiated from, the tropics; the comb duck, muscovy duck, ringed teal and southern pochard are examples. The second kind of response was characterized by the cessation of egg\\\\laying when daylengths still remained stimulatory, that is, a characteristic photo\\\\refractoriness to long days developed, and egg\\\\laying occurred during the first half of the year at Slimbridge. We term this a temperate\\\\type response, and examples are provided by nearly all the sheldgeese and shelduck, by the mandarin, Carolina, white\\\\winged wood duck and all Aythya and the sea duck. Only a few examples of apparently intermediate breeding response were noted and these transitional species are discussed, for example the Andean goose, Abyssinian blue\\\\winged goose and Radjah shelduck. The egg\\\\laying cycles can be described as entrained rhythms and their phase angles measured in relation to seasonal daylength changes at Slimbridge. In Aythya, the onset of reproductive activity was strongly correlated with the latitude of origin whereas the end of breeding was not. This was because refractoriness developed at about the same time in all species, even though they began breeding in response to different photoperiods. For this reason, the length of breeding season expressed at Slimbridge was correlated with the midlatitude of the breeding range in the wild but even more strongly with the photoperiod under which egg\\\\laying was initiated. The onset of breeding in the sheldgeese and perching duck was not related to latitude, perhaps because species have had time to modify their ranges. However, the end of breeding in perching duck was related to latitude. Cessation of breeding corresponds to the onset of moult and the secretion of thyroid hormones. We suggest that as waterfowl radiated to higher latitudes their biological clocks became entrained to the new light regimes and a host of physiological functions were ordered in an adaptive rather than competitive sequence. It is because so many biological functions are liable to compete for scarce environmental energy supplies that some kind of endogenous partitioning is necessary. This endogenous component is seen when different species are kept under standard lighting conditions. It follows that the photo\\\\response of a species reflects its evolutionary history and so the discussion broaches zoogeographical and taxonomic topics. For example, it seems unlikely that the white\\\\winged wood duck evolved in the tropics, and likely that the sheldgeese and shelduck radiated from a post\\\\","output":"Photoperiodism in waterfowl: phasing of breeding cycles and zoogeography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) It is a respiratory tract infection and currently becoming pandemic worldwide affecting more than 50 lakh people As of now, there is no treatment or vaccine developed for disease management The main protease, Mpro in SARS-CoV-2 is a druggable target explored by many scientists We targeted this with the well-known approach of drug repurposing by using computational tools Methods: Schr?dinger software was used for the study Ligands were prepared from US-FDA drug-bank by importing it to Maestro graphical user interphase, optimised using LigPrep, and molecular geometry minimized using OPLS3e force-field Mpro crystal structure 6LU7 was downloaded from PDB and optimised Molecules were docked using CovDock module in Glide docking Further, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for 100 ns using Desmond module Results: In docking and molecular interactions studies, penicillins emerged as hits with consistent binding pattern by forming hydrophilic, hydrophobic, electrostatic interactions The molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the interactions Phenoxymethylpenicillin and Carbenicillin were found to interact consistently and appeared to be the most promising Conclusion: Usually, antibiotics are discouraged from using in the viral pandemic because of the development of resistance Azithromycin was combined with hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 Penicillins are less potent and first-line antibiotics for most of the bacterial infections This study suggests Phenoxymethylpenicillin and Carbenicillin can be tried along with hydroxychloroquine Further, this study shows the possible exploration by drug repurposing using computer-aided docking tools and the potential roles of beta-lactams in COVID-19 ? 2020 The Author(s) This is an open access article and applies the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons org/licenses/by-nc/4 0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, as long as the original authors and source are cited","output":"In silico drug repurposing of penicillins to target main protease mpro of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How to cite this article: Venkataraman R.

To efficiently detect numerous viruses in a large epidemiologic study, we developed a fast, multitarget, sensitive, and specific assay named the Respiratory MultiCode-PLx Assay (RMA). The RMA utilizes improved multiplex PCR chemistry (EraGen MultiCode-PLx technology) coupled with high-throughput microsphere flow cytometry (Luminex). Eighteen sets of virus-specific multiplex PCR primers were developed based on the conserved sequences of all available respiratory-virus sequences for eight distinct groups: human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (InfV), metapneumovirus, adenovirus (Ad), coronavirus, and enterovirus. Each primer set detected 20 cDNA copies of the intended target per sample and had no reaction with 60,000 copies of human genomic DNA. The accuracy and sensitivity of the RMA for detecting respiratory viruses in human samples were tested with two sets of clinical specimens. First, 101 nasal-wash specimens that were positive for HRV, RSV, InfV, PIV, or Ad by traditional techniques were reanalyzed by RMA, and all target viruses were detected with an overall sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 99%. Second, 103 nasal-wash samples from 5-year-old children with asthma and respiratory symptoms were analyzed; RMA detected viruses in 74 specimens (71.8%) compared to only 24 (23.3%) by traditional culture and immunofluorescent-staining techniques.

Both Abs display comparably high affinities for distinct epitopes of viral Spike (S)-protein trimers. Gluc activity is reconstituted when the Abs are simultaneously bound to S-protein bringing the Ab-fused N- and C-terminal fragments close enough together (8 nm) to fold. We thus achieve high specificity both by requirement of simultaneous binding of the two Abs to the S-protein and also, in a steric configuration in which the two Gluc complementary fragments can fold and thus reconstitute catalytic activity. Gluc activity can also be reconstituted with virus-like particles that express surface S-protein with detectable signal over background within 5 minutes of incubation.

We recruited patients presenting with keratitis to a tertiary eye hospital in lowland eastern Nepal between June 2019 and November 2020. A structured assessment, including demographics, history, and clinical signs, was carried out. The aetiology was investigated with in vivo confocal microscopy and corneal scrape for microscopy and culture. A predictor score was developed using odds ratios calculated to predict aetiology from features. A fungal cause was identified in 482/642 (75.1%) of cases, which increased to 532/642 (82.9%) when including mixed infections. Unusually, dematiaceous fungi accounted for half of the culture-positive cases (50.6%). Serrated infiltrate margins, patent nasolacrimal duct, raised corneal slough, and organic trauma were independently associated with fungal keratitis (p < 0.01). These four features were combined in a predictor score. The probability of fungal keratitis was 30.1% if one feature was present, increasing to 96.3% if all four were present. Whilst microbiological diagnosis is the gold standard to determine the aetiology of an infection, certain clinical signs can help direct the clinician to find a presumptive infectious cause, allowing appropriate treatment to be started without delay. Additionally, this study identified dematiaceous fungi, specifically Curvularia spp., as the main causative agent for fungal keratitis in this region.

Given prior research, we would expect many more studies to emerge in the future. Also, the pandemic has illustrated the major gaps in data available to disentangle the health and social concerns facing Asian Americans and NHPI communities. Significant issues include the lack of systematic reporting of data for these communities both across states, and even among agencies within a state; erroneous aggregation of Asians with NHPIs; and censoring of data. These gaps and issues contribute to bias that obscures objective data and amplifies health inequalities. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the well-being of Asian American and NHPI communities. It is critical to provide disaggregated data, not only so that we can have accurate reporting, but also to ensure data and health equity.","output":"Considerations of Racism and Data Equity Among Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, And Pacific Islanders in the Context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Anesthetic care in patients undergoing thoracic surgery presents specific challenges that necessitate standardized, multidisciplionary, and continuously updated guidelines for perioperative care. METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert group, the Perioperative Anesthesia in Thoracic Surgery (PACTS) group, comprising 24 members from 19 Italian centers, was established to develop recommendations for anesthesia practice in patients undergoing thoracic surgery (specifically lung resection for cancer). The project focused on preoperative patient assessment and preparation, intraoperative management (surgical and anesthesiologic care), and postoperative care and discharge. A series of clinical questions was developed, and PubMed and Embase literature searches were performed to inform discussions around these areas, leading to the development of 69 recommendations. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were graded using the United States Preventative Services Task Force criteria. RESULTS: Recommendations for preoperative care focus on risk assessment, patient preparation (prehabilitation), and the choice of procedure (open thoracotomy vs. video-assisted thoracic surgery). CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations should help pulmonologists to improve preoperative management in thoracic surgery patients. Further refinement of the recommendations can be anticipated as the literature continues to evolve.

A founder mutation in the human endolysosomal trafficking protein VPS11 has been identified in Ashkenazi Jewish patients manifesting classic gLE symptoms of hypomyelination, developmental delay, motor and systemic deficits. In this study, we characterized the visual and sensorimotor function of two zebrafish vps11 mutant lines: the previously reported vps11(plt), and a new vps11(-/-) null mutant line, using behavioral analysis to track larval motor responses to visual and acoustic stimuli. We found that mutant larvae from both vps11(plt) and vps11(-/-) lines were able to visually distinguish light and dark, but showed a progressive loss of a normal sensorimotor response to visual stimuli from 5 days post fertilization (dpf) to 7dpf. Additionally, optokinetic response analysis performed at 5dpf indicated that the mutants were significantly visually impaired. Both mutant lines also displayed a progressively lower sensorimotor response to a singular acoustic stimulus from 5-7dpf. Next, we tested the habituation response of the mutant lines to series of acoustic taps. We found both mutant lines habituated faster than their siblings, and that vps11(plt) mutants habituated faster than the vps11(-/-) mutants. Together, these data suggest that loss of Vps11 function results in progressive visual and sensorimotor abnormalities in the zebrafish vps11(plt) and vps11(-/-) mutant lines. This is the first study to characterize behavioral deficits in a vertebrate model of Vps11-dependent gLE.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3.

This paper reports on 327 women who had asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and sarcoidosis as a sole or primary lung condition. Women with CF and LAM were most likely to report that their condition influenced their decision to have children. Those with CF and LAM who did become pregnant reported greater satisfaction with their healthcare during pregnancy and gave more consideration to factors such as location and type of birth; they were also more concerned about the impact of the pregnancy on their health than women with other diseases. Women with sarcoidosis reported receiving conflicting advice as to both the impact of their condition on pregnancy and how becoming pregnant might impact their health. Women with asthma reported not always being able to access the information they needed from healthcare professionals.

Among the multi-dimensional factors, the neighborhood built environment is crucial for one's health. Although the relationship between the built environment and health in the general population has been thoroughly investigated, it has been ignored in the case of frail older adults, who may have difficulties in their daily basic living skills. A path analysis is constructed to model the proposed theoretical framework involving the neighborhood built environment and health among frail older adults. This study thus aims to investigate the environmental influences on health, and to validate the theoretical framework proposed for health and social services. Methods: This study used secondary data collected in Hong Kong. A sample of 969 older community dwellers aged 60 or above were frail with at least one activity of daily living. Demographic information, neighborhood built environment data, service utilization, and health conditions were collected from these participants and their caregivers. A path analysis was performed to examine the proposed theoretical framework. Results: The health condition was of general concern, including frailty and incapacities in daily activities in frail older adults. Besides psychosocial factors, service use, and caregivers' care quality, the built environment had a significant impact on the health of older adults as well. Specifically, more facilities offering services and groceries, a shorter distance to the nearest metro station, and more greenery exposure are associated with a better-expected health condition among frail older adults. Discussion: The proposed theoretical framework successfully supplements past negligence on the relationship between the built environment and the health of frail older adults. The findings further imply that policymakers should promote the usability of transit and greenery in neighborhoods and communities. In addition, service utilization should be improved to meet the basic needs of frail older adults in the communities.","output":"A Path Analysis of the Effect of Neighborhood Built Environment on Public Health of Older Adults: A Hong Kong Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) was an early and widely adopted putative therapy for severe COVID-19. Results from randomized control trials and observational studies have failed to demonstrate a clear therapeutic role for CCP for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Underlying these inconclusive findings is a broad heterogeneity in the concentrations of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) between different CCP donors. The present study was designed to evaluate nAb titer threshold for clinically effective CCP. Methods We conducted a double-blind, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of nAb titer-defined CCP in adults admitted to an academic referral hospital. Patients positive on a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test and with symptoms for <10 days were eligible. Participants received either CCP with nAb titers [] 1:160-1:640 (standard titer group) or >1:640 (high titer group) in addition to standard of care treatments. Adverse events were contrasted by CCP titer. The primary clinical outcome was time to hospital discharge, with mortality and respiratory support evaluated as secondary outcomes. Findings Between August 28 and December 4, 2020, 316 participants were screened, 55 received CCP, with 41 and 14 receiving standard versus high titer CCP, respectively. Participants were a median of 61 years of age (IQR 52-67), 36% women, 25% Black and 33% Hispanic. Severe adverse events (SAE) ([]grade 3) occurred in 4 (29%) and 23 (56%) of participants in the high versus standard titer groups, respectively by day 28 (Risk Difference -0.28 [95% CI -0.56, 0.01]). There were no observed treatment-related AEs. By day 55, time to hospital discharge was shorter among participants receiving high versus standard titer, accounting for death as a competing event (hazard ratio 1.94 [95% CI 1.05, 3.58], Gray's p=0.02). Interpretation In this phase 2 trial in a high-risk population of patients admitted for Covid-19, we found earlier time to hospital discharge and lower occurrences of life-threatening SAEs among participants receiving CCP with nAb titers >1:640 compared with participants receiving CCP with lower nAb titer CCP. Though limited by a small study size these findings support further study of high-nAb titer CCP defined as >1:640 in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Outcomes of convalescent plasma with defined high- versus lower-neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalized patients: CoronaVirus Inactivating Plasma (CoVIP), double-blind phase 2 study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human metapneumovirus is an emerging human respiratory pathogen first discovered in 2001.

The importance of these accounts appears to have increased given the unprecedented changes with COVID-19 and the dramatic and unpredictable change to the application cycle including the use of virtual interviews, suggesting a perceived need for increased online engagement with applicants. The purpose of this study was to determine the patterns of creation and usage of Twitter and Instagram accounts of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited General Surgery residency programs and their associated surgical departments. METHORDS: A cross-sectional study of the use of Twitter and Instagram by the 332 ACGME-accredited General Surgery residency programs and their associated departments was conducted in February 2021. Twitter and Instagram accounts were identified by accessing program/department websites as well as social media platform and internet searches. Year of creation, number of followers, and number of posts (July 1, 2018-December 31, 2020) were collected. Trends in usage were compared across years stratified by platform and by account owner (department vs. residency). RESULTS: Instagram accounts are more than five-times greater for residencies compared to departments (42% vs 8%, p < 0.001). There was not a significant difference between the number of department and residency Twitter accounts (26% vs 23%, pa?=a?0.37). Significantly more residency Instagram and Twitter accounts were created or first posted in 2020 compared to department accounts (Instagram: 100 vs 7, p < 0.001; Twitter: 31 vs 6, pa?=a?0.001). Over 18% of residency programs had both Twitter and Instagram accounts compared to only 6% of departments (p < 0.001). However, department Twitter and Instagram accounts had significantly higher median total posts from 7/1/2018-12/31/2020 (Twitter: pa?=a?0.0001, Instagram pa?=a?0.004). While the number of Instagram followers and accounts being followed were similar between residencies and departments, department Twitter accounts had a larger median number of followers (1141 vs. 430, p=0.003) and account followings (308 vs. 192, pa?=a?0.001) compared to residency accounts. CONCLUSIONS: The number of residency social media accounts has significantly increased in 2020 compared to account creation of departments, with Instagram account creation exceeding that of Twitter and of departments. The opposite pattern in usage was seen related to number of posts, and with Twitter, followers, and number of followings, with departments outpacing residencies. This significant increase in account creation may have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the change to a virtual interview season, suggesting an unprecedented need for online engagement with applicants. As the increased social media presence will likely persist in future application cycles, further study about the impact of residency social media use on recruitment and applicant decision-making as well as effective strategies, is needed.","output":"Patterns of General Surgery Residency Social Media Use in the Age of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented speed with which COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and approved reflects increasingly nimble trial procedures, but opportunities exist for greater collaboration.

The incidence of CICV is estimated to be around one in 10,000 cases. According to the American Society of Anesthesiology Closed Claims Study, adverse respiratory events are the most common type of injury, with difficult intubation and ventilation contributing to the majority of these cases. The objective of this non-interventional quality improvement project was to evaluate the prior training, exposure, and self-reported confidence in handling the CICV scenario among anesthesia providers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI. Methods An online questionnaire was distributed via email to all residents, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), and attending anesthesiologists in March 2021. The email contained a link to an online questionnaire via Microsoft Forms (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Univariate group comparisons were carried out between the respondents role (attending, CRNA, or resident), as well as between the number of years that the respondents were in practice (< 5 years, 5-10 years, > 10 years). Results Out of the total 170 anesthesia providers, 119 participated in the study where 54 (45%) were attendings, 44 (37%) were residents, and 21 (18%) were CRNAs. The majority (75%) did not know the surgical airway kit location, and 87% had not performed the surgical airway procedure before. The vast majority (96.7%) recommended simulation training compared to online training or lecture series, and just over 50% recommended annual training frequency. When looking at the differences in responses based on years of experience as an anesthesia provider, the majority of those with > 10 years in practice knew how to perform the surgical airway technique while respondents with < 5 years did not know how to perform the technique, and 50% of those with five to 10 years experience knew how to perform the surgical airway procedure for a CICV scenario. Conclusion Although there were many significant differences observed between the various provider roles and years in practice, surprisingly, the responses revealed both a lack of experience and confidence in performing the surgical airway procedure in all provider roles. These findings highlight a need for better emergency airway teaching and training.

CVI is a single measure of the combined variability in BIS and EMG. We investigated whether increases in these variables are associated with intraoperative somatic responses. METHODS This multicenter study included 120 patients undergoing elective, noncardiac surgery from 4 different sites. General anesthesia was maintained using propofol and remifentanil at 2 of the sites and sevoflurane and remifentanil at the 2 other sites. Propofol or sevoflurane was adjusted to maintain BIS between 45 and 60. Clinicians were blinded to CVI (v2.0) at all times, and remifentanil infusions were adjusted at the discretion of the clinician. The times of all intraoperative somatic events, defined as movement, grimacing, or eye opening, were recorded. Offline, the maintenance phase of each case was divided into consecutive, nonoverlapping, 10-minute segments. Segments were identified as containing a somatic event or containing no events. For each segment, mean sBIS, sEMG, and CVI and the heart rate (HR) range and mean arterial blood pressure range were calculated. To quantify how effectively each variable discriminated between somatic event segments and nonevent segments, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each variable. Finally, we observed the time course of sBIS, sEMG, CVI, and the HR range before each somatic event and characterized the earliest time before the somatic event at which each variable was able to discriminate between the somatic events and a specified set of nonevents. RESULTS The analysis included 33 somatic event segments and 829 nonevent segments from 105 surgical cases. The areas under the ROC curve (SE) for sBIS, sEMG, and CVI were 0.83  0.04, 0.92  0.02, and 0.89  0.03, respectively. The areas under the ROC curve for HR range and mean arterial blood pressure range were 0.77  0.03 and 0.68  0.05, respectively. CVI, sBIS, and sEMG all demonstrated higher average values before upcoming somatic events when compared with nonevents. HR range only showed a difference within a few seconds before the somatic event. CONCLUSION sBIS, sEMG, and CVI, measures of electroencephalogram and EMG variability, increased when intraoperative somatic events occurred. sBIS, sEMG, and CVI discriminated between 10-minute segments that contained a somatic event and those segments that did not contain an event better than changes in HR and mean arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, CVI increases before somatic events began earlier than HR changes and may provide caregivers with an early warning of potentially inadequate antinociception.","output":"Increases in electroencephalogram and electromyogram variability are associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative somatic response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Le baluchonnage est un dispositif de rpit nouveau pour la France, permettant aux aidants de se reposer quelques jours, seule parenthse au cours de longues annes daccompagnement dun proche handicap ou en perte dautonomie.

Conceptually, the formation of a public private partnership that included innovative government and academic involvement at all levels of the program was instrumental in promulgating and overseeing the effort. Decades of NIH sponsored research on vaccine backbones, immunogen design and clinical trials operations enabled evaluation of vaccine candidates within months of pathogen discovery. Operation Warp Speed fostered industry participation, permitted accelerated movement from preclinical/early phase to efficacy trials, and developed structured clinical trial testing that allowed independent assessment of, yet reasonable comparison between, each vaccine platform by harmonizing protocols, endpoints, laboratories, and statistical analytical criteria for efficacy. This coordinated effort by the US government, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and academic research institutions resulted in the streamlined, safe and transparent development and deployment of multiple COVID-19 vaccines in under a year.

We use unique data from a large-scale field experiment with 850,000 distributed coupons across about 280 cities, as well as two online follow-up studies. We evaluate how the local severity of the pandemic impacts the effectiveness of O2O coupons and explore the underlying mechanisms of the pandemic's effects on consumer coupon usage decisions. The results show that the coupon claim rate is positively influenced by pandemic severity, and this effect is driven by consumers' perceived deprivation. Conversely, pandemic severity has a negative impact on the coupon redemption rate, and this effect is mediated by consumers' perceived risk. More importantly, for areas in which the pandemic is more severe, both the coupon claim and redemption rates are significantly higher when the coupon is distributed through social sharing (vs. directly from the business), and the coupon claim rate is higher when the claiming procedure involves gamification than when it does not. The paper concludes with theoretical and managerial implications.","output":"How Does Omnichannel Marketing Enable Businesses to Cope with COVID-19?

During the mitigation phase of the pandemic, most documents suggested to consider postponing elective procedures, unless this might have impacted the life expectancy of patients.

This is particularly relevant when considering screening policies and the associated findings. We herein describe a risk-based approach to the management of patients with surgical diseases, which might be useful in order to limit the risks for healthcare workers and patients, while allowing for resuming elective surgical practice safely.","output":"A Risk-Based Screening Approach to Patients Needing Surgery During the De-Escalation Phase of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite its poorly adapted codon usage, HIV-1 replicates and is expressed extremely well in human host cells. HIV-1 has recently been shown to package non-lysyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in addition to the tRNA(Lys) needed for priming reverse transcription and integration of the HIV-1 genome. By comparing the codon usage of HIV-1 genes with that of its human host, we found that tRNAs decoding codons that are highly used by HIV-1 but avoided by its host are overrepresented in HIV-1 virions. In particular, tRNAs decoding A-ending codons, required for the expression of HIV's A-rich genome, are highly enriched. Because the affinity of Gag-Pol for all tRNAs is nonspecific, HIV packaging is most likely passive and reflects the tRNA pool at the time of viral particle formation. Codon usage of HIV-1 early genes is similar to that of highly expressed host genes, but codon usage of HIV-1 late genes was better adapted to the selectively enriched tRNA pool, suggesting that alterations in the tRNA pool are induced late in viral infection. If HIV-1 genes are adapting to an altered tRNA pool, codon adaptation of HIV-1 may be better than previously thought.","output":"HIV-1 Modulates the tRNA Pool to Improve Translation Efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To provide evidence-based recommendations for patients with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), who had their knee surgery postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Cochrane Central databases were systematically reviewed for studies reporting outcomes of home-based treatments for knee OA. Due to between-study differences in treatment strategy and reporting methods the results were not pooled and findings of the current review were presented in a narrative manner. RESULTS: The comprehensive literature search yielded 33 eligible studies that were included in this review. Management is performed at home and consists of exercise, proper nutrition, physical therapy and use of corrective and assistive orthotics. Virtual education on self-management strategies should be part of coping with knee OA. Initiating an exercise programme involving gymnastics, stretching, home cycling and muscle strengthening is highly recommended. Obese patients are encouraged to set weight loss goals and adopt a healthy diet. Potential benefits but weak evidence has been shown for the use of knee braces, sleeves, foot orthotics or cushioned footwear. Walking aids may be prescribed, when considered necessary, along with the provision of instructions for their use. CONCLUSION: When bridging the time to rescheduled surgery, it is essential to use appropriate home-based tools for the management of knee OA if pain is to be reduced and need for analgesics or opioid use is to be diminished while maintaining or even improving the functioning and avoiding further limitation of range of motion and subsequent muscular atrophies. Finally, none of these treatments may completely substitute for the life-changing effect of a total knee arthroplasty in patients with severe knee OA.

The aim of this study was to investigate the technical validity and usability of the Air Next spirometer in pediatric patients. METHODS: Device variability was tested with a calibrated syringe. About 90 subjects, aged 6 to 16, were included in a prospective cohort study. Fifty-eight subjects performed conventional spirometry and subsequent Air Next spirometry. The bias and the limits of agreement between the measurements were calculated. Furthermore, subjects used the device for 28 days at home and completed a subject-satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the study period. RESULTS: Interdevice variability was 2.8% and intradevice variability was 0.9%. The average difference between the Air Next and conventional spirometry was 40 mL for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and 3 mL for forced vital capacity (FVC). The limits of agreement were -270 mL and +352 mL for FEV1 and -403 mL and +397 mL for FVC.

Use of conventional vaccination strategies such as live, attenuated, and subunit has limitations as it does not fully provide protection against many infectious diseases. Hence, there was a need for the development of a new vaccination strategy. Use of nucleic acids-DNA and RNA-has emerged as promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches. Knowledge of mRNA biology, chemistry, and delivery systems in recent years have enabled mRNA to become a promising vaccine candidate. One of the advantages of a mRNA vaccine is that clinical batches can be generated after the availability of a sequence encoding the immunogen. The process is cell-free and scalable. mRNA is a noninfectious, nonintegrating molecule and there is no potential risk of infection or mutagenesis. mRNA is degraded by normal cellular processes, and its in vivo half-life can be regulated by different modifications and delivery methods. The efficacy can be increased by modifications of the nucleosides that can make mRNA more stable and highly translatable. Efficient in vivo delivery can be achieved by formulating mRNA into carrier molecules, allowing rapid uptake and expression in the cytoplasm. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and spread globally, prompting an international effort to accelerate development of a vaccine. The spike (S) glycoprotein mediates host cell attachment and is required for viral entry; it is the primary vaccine target for many candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Development of a lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA vaccine that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein stabilized in its prefusion conformation conferred 95% protection against Covid-19.","output":"mRNA Vaccines to Protect Against Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, hospital-based liaison geriatric units (LGUs) were created in Spanish hospitals with the aim to improve health care coordination between nursing homes (NHs) and hospitals.

Some of them are related to insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) generation, modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the energetic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); they can also regulate the nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB), leading to changes in inflammation production. Selenoproteins are also necessary for the correct synthesis of insulin and thyroid hormones. They are also involved in endocrine central regulation of appetite and energy homeostasis, affecting growth and development. MetS, a complex metabolic disorder, can appear during gestation and lactation in mothers, leading to energetic and metabolic changes in their offspring that, according to the metabolic programming theory, will produce cardiovascular and metabolic diseases later in life. However, there is a gap concerning Se tissue levels and selenoproteins implications in MetS generation, which is even greater during MetS programming. This narrative review also provides an overview of the existing evidence, based on experimental research from our laboratory, which strengthens the fact that maternal MetS leads to changes in Se tissue deposits and antioxidant selenoproteins expression in their offspring. These changes contribute to alterations in tissues oxidative damage, inflammation, energy balance, and tissue function, mainly in the heart. Se imbalance also could modulate appetite and endocrine energy balance, affecting pups growth and development. MetS pups present a profile similar to that of diabetes type 1, which also appeared when dams were exposed to low-Se dietary supply.

METHODS: In the national Veterans Affairs database, we identified patients with urothelial histology, MIBC (T2-4a/N0-3/M0) diagnosed between 2000 to 2018 and treated with definitive CRT. Time to treatment was defined as the number of days between date of diagnosis and start date of CRT. The cohort was stratified into < 90 (early) or  90 days (delayed) groups. Endpoints of locoregional failure (LRF), distant failure (DF), overall survival (OS), and bladder cancer-specific survival (BCS) were evaluated in multivariable Cox and Fine-Gray models. RESULTS: 305 patients with MIBC underwent CRT C 190 (62.3%) received early CRT, 115 (37.7%) received delayed CRT. Multivariable analysis (including success of transurethral resection of bladder tumor and type of chemotherapy) revealed no difference in recurrence between groups C LRF HR 1.12 (95%CI 0.76-1.67, P = 0.56) and DF HR 1.03 (95%CI 0.70-1.53, P = 0.88).

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Preliminary abstract review was conducted by two authors. Following complete abstraction of articles using a standardized template, abstraction notes and determinations were reviewed by all authors; disagreements regarding article inclusion/exclusion were resolved by majority rule. The Social Ecological Model framework was used to complete a narrative review of observational studies to summarize factors associated with disparities; a systematic review was used to evaluate eligible intervention studies. RESULTS: Ninety-five studies were included in the final analysis and summarized qualitatively within two main topic areas: (1) factors associated with documented racial-ethnic disparities in adult vaccination and (2) interventions aimed to reduce disparities or to improve vaccination coverage among racial-ethnic minority groups. Of the 12 included intervention studies, only 3 studies provided direct evidence and were of Level II, fair quality; the remaining 9 studies met the criteria for indirect evidence (Level I or II, fair or poor quality). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable amount of observational research evaluating factors associated with racial and ethnic disparities in adult vaccination is available. However, intervention studies aimed at reducing these disparities are limited, are of poor quality, and insufficiently address known reasons for low vaccination uptake among racial and ethnic minority adults.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Adult Vaccination: A Review of the State of Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective The COVID-19 pandemic led to modify patient healthcare, with a high impact on patients with chronic pain. This comprehensive scoping review aims to map recommendations on the management of chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose a workflow in the management of these patients. Methods The databases searched were PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library e LILACS. The studies were examined by two independent reviewers. The disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion or with a third reviewer. Results We presented the results in the form of a table, a workflow, and a narrative summary. The search resulted in 13 studies selected for full reading, including 1 consensus, 5 guidances, 2 expert panels, 1 joint statement, 2 educational flyers, and 2 free comments. We considered for these studies new technologies, including telemedicine. Each pain service needs to establish a screening model, classifying patients according to corresponding severity. Particular attention should be given to patients who use opioids and are at risk for their misuse. Non-pharmacological approaches and pain education should be maintained, considering the use of telehealth. Conclusions Recommendations for the management of chronic pain during COVID-19 include adjustments to the patient care model. The workflow proposes the use of telemedicine, screening for painful intensity, and the use of color-signaled intervention packages according to severity (green, yellow, and red).","output":"Chronic Pain Management During The Covid-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent times, the issue of plastic recycling has become one of the leading issues of environmental protection and waste management.

Mexico has one of the highest reported COVID-19 case-fatality rates worldwide, although available estimates do not consider serologic assessment of prior exposure nor all SARS-CoV-2-related deaths. We aimed to estimate sex- and age-specific IFRs for SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. METHODS: The total number of people in Mexico with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was derived from National Survey of Health and Nutrition-COVID-19 (ENSANUT 2020 Covid-19)a nationally representative serosurvey conducted from August to November 2020. COVID-19 mortality data matched to ENSANUTs dates were retrieved from the death-certificate registry, which captures the majority of COVID-19 deaths in Mexico, and from the national surveillance system, which covers the subset of COVID-19 deaths that were identified by the health system and were confirmed through a positive polymerase chain reaction test. We analysed differences in IFRs by urbanization and region. RESULTS: The national SARS-CoV-2 IFR was 0.47% (95% CI 0.44, 0.50) using death certificates and 0.30% (95% CI 0.28, 0.33) using surveillance-based deaths. The IFR increased with age, being close to zero at age <30 years, but increasing to 1% at ages 50C59 years in men and 60C69 years in women, and being the highest at 80 years for men (5.88%) and women (6.23%). Across Mexico's nine regions, Mexico City (0.99%) had the highest and the Peninsula (0.26%) the lowest certificate-based IFRs. Metropolitan areas had higher certificate-based IFR (0.63%) than rural areas (0.17%). CONCLUSION: After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall IFR in Mexico was comparable with those of European countries. The IFR in Mexico increased with age and was higher in men than in women. The variations in IFRs across regions and places of residence within the country suggest that structural factors related to population characteristics, pandemic containment and healthcare capabilities could have influenced lethality at the local level.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate after the first epidemic wave in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present as a range of symptoms, from mild to critical; lower pulmonary involvement, including pneumonia, is often associated with severe and critical cases. Understanding the baseline characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness is essential for effectively targeting clinical care and allocating resources. This study aimed to describe baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement. METHODS: US patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement during an inpatient admission from December 1, 2019, to May 20, 2020, were identified using the IBM Explorys(?) electronic health records database. Baseline (up to 12 months prior to first COVID-19 hospitalization) demographics and clinical characteristics and preadmission (14 days to 1 day prior to admission) pulmonary diagnoses were assessed. Patients were stratified by sex, age, race, and geographic region. RESULTS: Overall, 3471 US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement were included. The mean (SD) age was 63.5 (16.3) years; 51.2% of patients were female, 55.0% African American, 81.6% from the South, and 16.8% from the Midwest. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (27.7%), diabetes (17.3%), hyperlipidemia (16.3%), and obesity (9.7%). Cough (27.3%) and dyspnea (15.2%) were the most common preadmission pulmonary symptoms. African American patients were younger (mean [SD], 62.5 [15.4] vs. 67.8 [6.2]) with higher mean (SD) body mass index (33.66 [9.46] vs. 30.42 [7.86]) and prevalence of diabetes (19.8% vs. 16.7%) and lower prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.6% vs. 8.2%) and smoking/tobacco use (28.1% vs. 37.2%) than White patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among US patients primarily from the South and Midwest hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Differences observed between African American and White patients should be considered in the context of the complex factors underlying racial disparities in COVID-19.

We then assessed whether this association is modified by disability status. METHODS We used three waves of cohort data from the Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth. We fitted logistic regression models to account for confounders of the relationship between labour force status (employed, not in the labour force, unemployed and having problems looking for work) at age 21 years and psychological distress at age 22 years. We then estimated whether this association was modified by disability status at age 21 years. RESULTS Being unemployed and having problems looking for work at age 21 years was associated with odds of psychological distress that were 2.48 (95% CI 1.95 to 3.14) times higher than employment. There was little evidence for additive effect measure modification of this association by disability status (2.52, 95% CI -1.21 to 6.25).

The aim of this study was to evaluate EUS-guided sampling of intra-abdominal masses and compare the diagnostic utility of conventional EUS-FNA and ProCore FNB. METHODS EUS-guided biopsy samples (FNA and/or EchoTip ProCore FNB) were retrospectively retrieved over the course of 23 months. Clinical findings, pathology reports, and available histological materials were reviewed. All cell blocks were reviewed, and their cellularity was scored (range, 0-3). RESULTS Fifty-six masses from 58 cases were acquired, and they included 40 pancreatic sites and 16 other intra-abdominal sites. Among the 31 FNB-only cases, 71% were satisfactory, 65% were positive for malignancy at the time of final diagnosis, and their cell blocks were moderately cellular. For the cases with both FNB and FNA performed, more FNB samples than FNA samples were satisfactory (83% vs 76%) and were positive for malignancy (65% vs 48%) at final diagnosis, and the former had more cellular cell blocks (mean score, 1.58 vs 1.29); however, the differences were not statistically significant. Significantly more FNB samples were used for immunostains (48% vs 10%; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS These data show that a wide variety of intra-abdominal masses were amenable to sampling by ProCore FNB. In this subset of cases with prior/concurrent indeterminate FNAs, FNB showed slightly better diagnostic yield, and had more cellular tissue samples and more material for ancillary studies than matched FNAs.","output":"Endoscopic ultrasound-guided FNA and ProCore biopsy in sampling pancreatic and intra-abdominal masses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Annals of Geriatric Medicine and Research held its inaugural international editorial board virtual meeting on September 16, 2021, to brainstorm ideas for sustainable growth.

From the initial discussion points provided by eight editorial board members, including six presenters, email discussions further enriched these ideas to construct the current special article. The key points discussed were: impactful research and impact factors, international and Asian perspectives, and challenges to sustainable growth. The editors noted the existing gap between the impact factor and research impact as a challenge for the growth paths of regional journals. However, they agreed that persevering with impactful research would ultimately translate into parallel and gradual gains in impact, which is, therefore, consistent with the organic growth of the journal. Acknowledging challenges in navigating between unique Asian perspectives and international outlooks, the editors encouraged academic journals to serve as bridges linking international evidence with the richness of local perspectives. For sustainable growth, the editors suggested that journals may be forged into the academic ecosystems of the region, diversify value streams, and establish themselves as reputable brands in disciplines.

Methods A total of 3 microsimulation models were constructed with individual data to evaluate the 3 vaccines. The simulation contains 7 transition states that are related to the natural history of the disease. The model with a daily cycle has a time horizon of 1 year and uses data from 289 days of the pandemic. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system considering direct medical costs. For the model inputs, outpatient and hospital databases were used with information on treated patients stratified by age. Information on mortality was also stratified based on patients' age in the mortality database (SIM). The efficacy of vaccines to reduce the likelihood of patients becoming ill was evaluated independently for each vaccine. Information on the quality of life of patients in outpatient or hospital treatment and the sequelae resulting from the disease were extracted from the literature. The main outcome of the analysis was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results The vaccines showed incremental cost-utility ratios ranging from R$?23 161.3/QALY (Oxford) to R$17 757.85/QALY (CoronaVac). The older the population, the lower was the incremental cost-utility ratio. Given a willingness-to-pay threshold of R$17 586/QALY, all the vaccines were considered cost-effective in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

The NV protease cleaves the polyprotein encoded by open reading frame 1 of the viral genome at five nonhomologous sites, releasing six nonstructural proteins that are essential for viral replication. The structural details of how NV protease recognizes multiple substrates are unclear. In our X-ray structure of an NV protease construct, we observed that the C-terminal tail, representing the native substrate positions P5 to P1, is inserted into the active site cleft of the neighboring protease molecule, providing atomic details of how NV protease recognizes a substrate. The crystallographic structure of NV protease with the C-terminal tail redesigned to mimic P4 to P1 of another substrate site provided further structural details on how the active site accommodates sequence variations in the substrates. Based on these structural analyses, substrate-based aldehyde inhibitors were synthesized and screened for inhibition potency. Crystallographic structures of the protease in complex with each of the three most potent inhibitors were determined. These structures showed concerted conformational changes in the S4 and S2 pockets of the protease to accommodate variations in the P4 and P2 residues of the substrate/inhibitor, which could be a mechanism for how the NV protease recognizes multiple sites in the polyprotein with differential affinities during virus replication. These structures further indicate that the mechanism of inhibition by these inhibitors involves covalent bond formation with the side chain of the conserved cysteine in the active site by nucleophilic addition, and such substrate-based aldehydes could be effective protease inhibitors.","output":"Structural basis of substrate specificity and protease inhibition in Norwalk virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are around 300 night markets in Taiwan, and they have been drawing an increasing number of tourists in recent years. As a result, public awareness over air quality in the night markets has grown tremendously. In response to this, a specific night market in Kaohsiung City was chosen for this study in order to characterize the existing air quality in and around the night markets. In this present study, we employed an Industrial Source Complex Short-Term (ISCST3) air quality model for the simulation of PM2.5 diffusions. The model as a technique can simulate the pollutants emissions, diffusions, transportation, and pollution sources in specific areas and subsequently evaluate the influence between the source and the receiver. Therefore, we compared pollutants emissions data from several air quality monitoring stations with our sampling data of three different sampling sites in Kaohsiung City. The findings of this study showed that the average concentration of PM2.5 was in the range of 29-61 mu g m(-3) during opening hours of the night market, whereas the average concentration of PM2.5 range was between 22-38 mu g m(-3) before the night market opening hours. The concentration of metallic elements (ME) (Mg, Na, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Al, Ba, Cd, Pb and Ca) was determined with the support of Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). During the night market opening hours, the result disclosed that the ME concentrations in PM2.5 was in an increasing order as follows: Na > Fe > Al > Ca. With respect to the concentration of carbonaceous species, our results showed that the highest total carbon (TC) concentration was found to be 6.52 mu g m(-3) during the downwind sampling interval. The highest elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) concentration were found to be 6.53 mu g m(-3) and 2.70 mu g m(-3) of the PM2.5 concentration, respectively. This study's findings have significant consequences for Taiwan policymakers and urban planners, particularly those responsible for coordinating environmental protection and economic development in cities. Therefore, policy actions to abate urban air pollution can be attained on diverse governing echelons, resulting in synergistic effects such as a reduction in climate change impacts.","output":"Assessment of PM2.5 Chemical Composition and Air Quality Monitoring: Implications of Air Pollutants Emissions from a Night Market in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Today, the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 is the leading health issue.

Machine learning approaches were evaluated for the accuracy and interpretability of predictions. The Explainable Boosting Machine approach was selected as the most suitable method. Individual, non-linear shape functions for predictive parameters and parameter interactions are reported. RESULTS: 1039 patients were included in the Explainable Boosting Machine model, 596 patients retrospectively collected, and 443 patients prospectively collected. The model for prediction of general ICU outcome was shown to be more reliable to predict survival. Age, inflammatory and thrombotic activity, and severity of ARDS at ICU admission were shown to be predictive of ICU survival. Patients age, pulmonary dysfunction and transfer from an external institution were predictors for ECMO therapy. The interaction of patient age with D-dimer levels on admission and creatinine levels with SOFA score without GCS were predictors for renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Using Explainable Boosting Machine analysis, we confirmed and weighed previously reported and identified novel predictors for outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Using this strategy, predictive modeling of COVID-19 ICU patient outcomes can be performed overcoming the limitations of linear regression models.

Of the 19 patients under the PD Hub, 11 had a Case Manager, four were engaged with the PD Hub's day services / safe service and one with a PD Hub readiness group. Six of the 50 patients had a documented refusal to engage with the PD Hub.Only 27 of the patients had either received psychological intervention, were on a waiting list, or had a referral in place. 16% of patients refused a psychotherapy referral. Of the 20 patients who received psychological treatment, eight completed a form of psychotherapy (cognitive analytic therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing) and 12 psychological intervention (either structured case management, psychoeducation or emotional coping skills).Only 28 of 50 patients had an extended care plan and 28 had a collaborative risk management plan in place.ConclusionThere was no obvious correlation between previous completion of psychological therapy and degree of polypharmacy. Median admission time was reduced for patients under the PD Hub (six vs 14 days). This was also reduced for patients who accessed psychotherapy or psychotherapeutic interventions (nine vs 10 days).This audit coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent reduced access to the PD Hub and psychotherapy service. There is a need to consider barriers to EUPD patients receiving psychotherapy.EUPD patients may have numerous hospital admissions and frequently present in crisis. Given the iatrogenic harm from prolonged hospital admission, there is a need to consider incorporating a collaborative extended care plan and risk management plan as part of discharge planning, following admission to hospital.","output":"An evaluation of the incorporation of psychological interventions into the care of patients with a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder following admission to the general adult inpatient setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced the modification of surgical practice worldwide. Medical centers have been adapted to provide an efficient arrangement of their economic and human resources. Although neurosurgeons are not in the first line of management and treatment of COVID-19 patients, they take care of patients with neurological pathology and potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here, the authors describe their institutional actions against the pandemic and compare these actions with those in peer-reviewed publications. METHODS The authors conducted a search using the MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases from the beginning of the pandemic until July 11, 2020, using the following terms: \\"Neurosurgery,\\" \\"COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2,\\" \\"reconversion/modification,\\" \\"practice,\\" \\"academy,\\" and \\"teaching.\\" Then, they created operational guidelines tailored for their institution to maximize resource efficiency and minimize risk for the healthcare personnel. RESULTS According to the reviewed literature, the authors defined the following three changes that have had the greatest impact in neurosurgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) changes in clinical practices; 2) changes in the medical care setting, including modifications of perioperative care; and 3) changes in the academic teaching methodology. CONCLUSIONS The Instituto Nacional de Neurologa y Neurociruga \\"Manuel Velasco Surez\\" is one of the major referral centers for treating highly complex neurosurgical pathologies in Mexico. Its clinical and neurosurgical practices have been modified with the implementation of specific interventions against the spread of COVID-19. These practical and simple actions are remarkably relevant in the context of the pandemic and can be adopted and suited by other healthcare centers according to their available resources to better prepare for the next event.","output":"Reconversion of neurosurgical practice in times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a narrative review of the literature and guideline implementation in a Mexican neurosurgical referral center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has been a crisis of global health, whereas the effective vaccines against 2019-nCoV are still under development. Alternatively, utilization of old drugs or available medicine that can suppress the viral activity or replication may provide an urgent solution to suppress the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV. Andrographolide is a highly abundant natural product of the medicinal plant, Andrographis paniculata, which has been clinically used for inflammatory diseases and anti-viral therapy. We herein demonstrate that both andrographolide and its fluorescent derivative, the nitrobenzoxadiazole-conjugated andrographolide (Andro- NBD), suppressed the main protease (Mpro) activities of 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Moreover, Andro-NBD was shown to covalently link its fluorescence to these proteases. Further mass spectrometry (MS) analysis suggests that andrographolide formed a covalent bond with the active site Cys145 of either 2019-nCoV Mpro or SARS-CoV Mpro. Consistently, molecular modeling analysis supported the docking of andrographolide within the catalytic pockets of both viral Mpros. Considering that andrographolide is used in clinical practice with acceptable safety and its diverse pharmacological activities that could be beneficial for attenuating COVID-19 symptoms, extensive investigation of andrographolide on the suppression of 2019-nCoV as well as its application in COVID-19 therapy is suggested.","output":"Andrographolide and its fluorescent derivative inhibit the main proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV through covalent linkage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After more than six months into the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as of August 10, 2020, over 734,664 people had died worldwide. The current study aims to evaluate how mitigating interventions affected the epidemic process in the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US and whether temperature played a role in the epidemic process. METHODS: Publicly available data for the time series of COVID-19 cases and deaths and weather were analyzed at the metropolitan level. The time-varying reproductive numbers (R(t)) based on retrospective moving average were used to explore the trends. Student t-tests were used to compare temperature and peak R(t) cross-sectionally. RESULTS: We found that virus transmissibility, measured by instantaneous reproduction number (R(t)), had declined since the end of March for all areas and almost all of them reached a R(t) of 1 or below after April 15, 2020. The timing of the main decline was concurrent with the implementation of mitigating interventions. However, the R(t)s remained around 1 for most areas since then and there were some small and short rebounds in some areas, suggesting a persistent epidemic in those areas when interventions were relaxed. Cities with warm temperature also tended to have a lower peak R(t) than that of cities with cold temperature. However, they were not statistically significant and large geographic variations existed. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive interventions might have mitigated the current pandemic of COVID-19, while temperature might have weak effects on the virus transmission.

Vaccination strategies based on heterologous prime-boost protocols using Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) as primer and modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain expressing the mycobacterial antigen Ag85A (MVA85A) as booster may increase the protective efficacy of BCG. In addition, vaccination with the recombinant viral vaccine vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-846 (Rv3615c, Mtb10.4, and Rv2660c) can elicit a remarkable T-cell-mediated immune response and provide an effective long-term protection after the BCG challenge. In this study, we used VSV-846 to boost BCG and evaluated its immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. In this prime-boost approach, boosting with VSV-846 significantly enhanced IFN- CD4 T cell responses, which are crucial for anti-TB immune responses. Moreover, VSV-846 boosting significantly reduced pathology compared with mock vaccination, and decreased the bacterial loads in lung tissues compared with BCG or VSV-846 vaccination alone. The analysis of vaccine-induced immunity identified that polyfunctional T cells might contribute to the enhanced protection by VSV-846 boosting.

Given that 20% of patients with ureteral colic require acute surgical intervention, there is a lack of data reviewing the cost-effectiveness of current treatment modalities. We present a costeffectiveness analysis between primary treatment and ureteral stenting in patients with ureteral stones in the emergency setting. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients requiring emergency intervention for a ureteral calculus at a single institution between January and December 2019. All patients underwent ureteral stenting, primary ureteroscopy (URS) or shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). The overall secondary care cost was calculated to include the cost of the procedure, inpatient hospital bed days, emergency room (ER) attendances, additional procedures such as nephrostomy insertion and secondary definitive procedure. RESULTS: A total of 244 patients were included. Ureteral stenting was performed in 152 patients (62.3%) and primary treatment in 92 patients (37.7%), of those, 83 patients (34.0%) underwent primary URS and 9 patients (3.6%) had SWL. Those undergoing ureteral stenting had a significantly higher ER reattendance rate (25.7% vs 10.9%, >p=0.02). The overall secondary care cost was greater in the ureteral stenting group (4485.42 vs 3536.83;>p=0.65). The average cost per patient related to ER reattendances was significantly higher in the ureteral stenting group compared with the primary treatment group (61.05 vs 20.87;>p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlights the potential overall cost-reduction when performing primary treatment in patients presenting with acute ureteral colic, predominantly related to reduced ER attendances. This is particularly relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic where it is crucial to avoid unnecessary attendances to the ER and reduce the backlog of delayed definitive procedures. Both primary URS and SWL in the acute setting should be considered, in concordance with clinical judgement and factors such as patient preference, equipment availability and operator experience.","output":"Is primary ureteroscopy more cost-effective than ureteral stenting for obstructing ureteral calculi?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Auch die Beziehungen zwischen Deutschland und der Tschechischen Republik wur","output":"Berlin und Prag: Europa pragmatisch zusammenhalten;deutsch-tschechische Kooperation in Zeiten der Corona-Krise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to healthcare for women, including disruption of cervical cancer screening services.

Over the years, different therapeutic modalities have been adopted depending on tumor stage and patient characteristics, such as surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy. Recently, with the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), the treatment of metastatic and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has experienced a revolution that has resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival with an enhanced toxicity profile. Despite this paradigm shift, most patients present some kind of resistance to ICI. In this setting, current research is shifting towards the integration of multiple therapies, with RT and ICI being one of the most promising based on the potential immunostimulatory synergy of this combination. This review gives an overview of the evolution and current state of the combination of RT and ICI and provides evidence-based data that can improve patient selection. The combination in lung cancer is a safe therapeutic approach that improves local control and progression-free survival, and it has the potential to unleash abscopal responses.

A \\"safety loop\\" model postulates risk-related decisions are not based on objective and measurable risks but on the subjective perception of those risks. We here illustrate a quantification of the difference between objective and subjective risks. Method: The objective risks (or chances) can be obtained from traditional 2 x 2 tables by calculating the positive (+LR) and negative (-LR) likelihood ratios. The subjective perception of objective risks is calculated from the same 2 x 2 tables by exchanging the X- and Y-axes. The traditional 2 x 2 table starts with the hypothesis, uses a test and a gold standard to confirm or exclude the investigated condition. The 2 x 2 table with inverted axes starts with the communication of a test result and presumes that the communication of bad news (whether right or false) will induce \\"perceived anxiety\\" while good news will induce \\"perceived safety\\". Two different functions (confirmation and exclusion) of both perceptions (perceived anxiety and safety) can be quantified with those calculations. Results: The analysis of six published tests and of one incompletely reported test on COVID-19 polymerase chain reactions (completed by four assumptions on high and low sensitivities and specificities) demonstrated that none of these tests induces \\"perceived safety\\". Eight of the ten tests confirmed the induction of perceived anxiety with +LRs (range 3.1 - 5900). In two of these eight tests a -LR (0.25 and 0.004) excluded the induction of perceived safety.

Our aim was to determine the sensitivity of saliva versus swabs collected by healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients themselves to assess whether saliva detection can be offered as a cost-effective, risk-free method of SARS-CoV-2 detection. Methods: : This study was conducted in a hospital involving outpatients and hospitalized patients. A total of 3018 outpatients (asymptomatic: 2683, symptomatic: 335) were screened. Of these, 200 qRT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited (81 asymptomatic, 119 symptomatic). In addition, 101 SARS-CoV-2-positive hospitalized patients with symptoms were also enrolled in the study. From outpatients, HCWs collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), saliva were obtained. From inpatients, HCWs collected swabs, patient-collected swabs, and saliva were obtained. qRT-PCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by TAQPATH assay to determine the sensitivity of saliva detection. Sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of detecting SARS-CoV-2 were calculated using MedCalc. Results: : Of 3018 outpatient swabs tested by qRT-PCR, 200 were positive (males: 140, females: 60;aged 37.8512.76 years). Of these, saliva was positive in 128 (64%);39 of 81 asymptomatic (47%),89 of 119 symptomatic patients (74.78%). Sensitivity of detection was 60.9% (55.4-66.3%, CI 95%), with a negative predictive value of 36%(32.9-39.2%, CI 95%).Among 101 hospitalized patients (males:65, females: 36;aged 53.4315.58 years), with HCW collected NPS as comparator, sensitivity of saliva was 56.1% (47.5-64.5, CI 95%), specificity 63.5%(50.4-75.3, CI95%) with PPV of 77.2% and NPV of 39.6% and that of self-swab was 52.3%(44-60.5%, CI95%), specificity 56.6% (42.3-70.2%, CI95%) with PPV 77.2% and NPV29.7%. Comparison of positivity with the onset of symptoms revealed highest detection in saliva on day 3 after onset of symptoms. Additionally, only saliva was positive in 13 (12.8%) hospitalized patients. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the use of saliva to detect SARS-COV-2 in symptomatic patients early after the onset of symptoms.

Surgery remains the first-line treatment option; however, medical therapy is essential if surgery is contraindicated or fails to achieve remission or when recurrence occurs after surgical remission. Osilodrostat (Isturisa), a novel steroidogenic inhibitor, is now approved for the treatment of CD in the United States and Cushing syndrome in Europe. Herein, we review pharmacology and data on the efficacy, safety, and clinical use of osilodrostat and provide guidance on its use in treating patients with CD. METHODS: We reviewed the literature and published clinical trial data of osilodrostat use in patients with Cushing syndrome. Detailed information related to the clinical assessment of osilodrostat use, potential drug-to-drug interactions, drug initiation, dose titration, and the monitoring of drug tolerability were discussed. RESULTS: Clinical trial data demonstrated that osilodrostat, by virtue of inhibiting 11-? hydroxylase, potently and rapidly decreased the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and sustained these reductions, with improved glycemia, blood pressure, body weight, and quality of life as well as lessened depression. Osilodrostat may interact with certain drugs, resulting in QT prolongation, which requires careful assessment of concomitant medications and periodic monitoring using electrocardiogram, respectively. The common adverse effects include adrenal insufficiency, hypokalemia, edema, and hyperandrogenic symptoms, which can be minimized using a slower up-titration dosing regimen. CONCLUSION: Osilodrostat is an effective, new treatment option for CD, with positive effects on cardiovascular and quality of life parameters as well as tolerable adverse effects.

To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for the proteins stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain.

Pharmaceutical systems are technically complex and involve extensive interactions between the private and public sectors. For members of public sector pharmaceutical committees, relationships with the private sector can result in conflicts of interest, which may introduce commercial biases into decision-making, potentially compromising public health objectives and health system sustainability. We conducted a descriptive, qualitative study of conflict of interest policies and practices in the public pharmaceutical sector in ten countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region (SEAR) (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste) between September 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: We identified 45 policy and regulatory documents and triangulated documentary data with 21 expert interviews. Key informants articulated very different governance priorities and conflict of interest concerns depending on the features of their countrys pharmaceutical industry, market size, and national economic objectives related to the domestic pharmaceutical industry. Public sector pharmaceutical policies and regulations consistently contained provisions for pharmaceutical committee members to disclose relevant interests, but contained little detail about what should be declared, when, and how often, nor whether disclosures are evaluated and by whom. Processes for preventing or managing conflicts of interest were less well developed than those for disclosure except for a few key procurement processes. Where processes for managing conflicts of interest were specified, the dominant strategy was to recuse committee members with a conflict of interest from relevant work. Policies rarely specified that committee members should divest or otherwise be free from conflicts of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Robust processes for conflict of interest prevention and management could ensure the integrity of decision-making and build public trust in pharmaceutical processes to achieve public health objectives.

Two-piece extended catheters permit remote exit-site locations away from problematic abdominal conditions. OBJECTIVE The effect on clinical outcomes by remotely locating catheter exit sites to the upper abdomen or chest was compared to conventional lower abdominal sites. METHODS In a nonrandomized design, peritoneal access was established with 158 extended catheters and 270 conventional catheters based upon body habitus and special clinical needs. Prospective data collection included patient demographics, infectious and mechanical complications, and catheter survival. RESULTS Kaplan-Meier survival time until first exit-site infection was longer for extended catheters (p = 0.03). Poisson regression showed no difference in exit site, subcutaneous tunnel, and peritonitis infection rates; however, the proportion of catheters lost during peritonitis episodes was significantly greater for extended catheters (p = 0.007) and appeared to be due primarily to coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms. Poisson regression showed interactions of body mass index (BMI) and diabetic status in determining catheter loss from peritonitis for both catheter types (p = 0.02).

We also applied a Kulldorff spatial scan statistic (Bernoulli model) to formally identify clusters of infections (P < 0.05). RESULTS The results reveal considerable geographical variation in local HIV prevalence (range = 6-36%) within this relatively homogenous population and provide clear empirical evidence for the localized clustering of HIV infections. Three high-risk, overlapping spatial clusters [Relative Risk (RR) = 1.34-1.62] were identified by the Kulldorff statistic along the National Road (P < or = 0.01), whereas three low risk clusters (RR = 0.2-0.38) were identified elsewhere in the study area (P < or = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS The findings show the existence of several localized HIV epidemics of varying intensity that are partly contained within geographically defined communities. Despite the overall high prevalence of HIV in many rural South African settings, the results support the need for interventions that target socio-geographic spaces (communities) at greatest risk to supplement measures aimed at the general population.","output":"Localized spatial clustering of HIV infections in a widely disseminated rural South African epidemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emergent coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which has adversely impacted human health and has led to a pandemic. There is an unmet need to develop therapies against SARS-CoV-2 due to its severity and lack of treatment options. A promising approach to combat COVID-19 is through the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by therapeutic antibodies. Previously, we described a strategy to rapidly identify and generate llama nanobodies (VHH) from na?ve and synthetic humanized VHH phage libraries that specifically bind the S1 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and block the interaction to the ACE2 human receptor. In this study, we then used computer-aided designed and constructed multi-specific VHH antibodies fused to human IgG1 Fc domains based on the epitope predictions for leading VHHs. The resulting tri-specific VHH-Fc antibodies show more potent S1 binding, S1/ACE2 blocking, and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization than the bi-specific VHH-Fcs or combination of individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs. Furthermore, protein stability analysis of the VHH-Fcs show favorable developability features, which enable them to be quickly and successfully developed into therapeutics against COVID-19.","output":"Development of humanized tri-specific nanobodies with potent neutralization for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: While it is particularly important that professional programs help teachers become members of a community of practice, especially in crisis situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a lack of research about strategies to effectively encourage the development of a community of practice and to support teachers transformation of their way of teaching. Thus, this paper aims to report on lessons learned from a blended professional development (PD) program for elementary and middle school teachers in Japan focused on computer programming education. In particular, the authors explored how application of the creative learning principles in the blended teacher PD may have helped to nurture a community of practice among teachers in Japan, and how the creative learning principles may be a valuable framework for designing online or blended teacher PD to support teachers transition into emergency remote education. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on the lessons learned from two iterations of blended teacher PD situated within a larger design-based research project on applying creative learning pedagogy in teacher PD. Creative learning is a learning approach focused on engagement in personally meaningful projects by tinkering with materials and learning from peers. A total of 26 teachers and coaches participated, all of whom work in elementary or middle schools across Nagano prefecture in Japan. Participant experiences were evaluated based on a pre-survey and a post-survey conducted before and after the in-person kick-off camp; observation notes taken; a final report submitted by each teacher; a debrief meeting at the end of the program; and semi-structured interviews with three selected participants after the program concluded. For this paper, the authors focus on two participants who fully and actively engaged in the program, and they introduce their stories to highlight the outcomes from the PD. Findings: The results highlight how a blended PD designed to support creative learning of teachers provided teachers with opportunities to gain help from other teachers and cultivate their expertise. The results also illustrated that how a community of practice emerged from the PD program, providing teachers with moral support when they tried new lesson designs. This paper offers several recommendations for designing professional learning experiences for instructional designers and professional developers that incorporate remote learning technologies. Originality/value: While an increased number of studies have shown the values of online and blended communities of practice for teacher PD, there are still limited insights on different strategies to support teachers in transforming their teaching practices. They generally do not provide teachers with opportunities to continue learning with and from one another beyond the program itself. This study examined the teachers experiences in a unique PD that implemented a creative learning approach into a blended learning environment for teachers.","output":"Application of creative learning principles within blended teacher professional development on integration of computer programming education into elementary and middle school classrooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resilient local food systems are a necessary component to keep our communities healthy, especially during times of emergency With a history of supporting local farmers and food access in less-resourced communities, Fresh Approach was in a prime position at the time of shelter-in-place orders to pivot our efforts to emergency food relief in this time of uncertainty By collaborating and mobilizing resources, Fresh Approach was able to strengthen existing connections with small farmers, build new relationships with other food access nonprofits, and support families in need by providing them with farm-fresh, local, and healthy produce We outline how these partnerships and collective efforts have fortified a resilient and transformative food system in our area","output":"Activating the local food system in emergency food response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The flood of the Yangtze River has the characteristics of high peak, large quantity and long duration.

As the pandemic continues to bring health and economic hardship, keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The course of an epidemic may be defined by a series of key factors. In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. The basic reproduction number (R(0)), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection (totally na?ve), determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or, more precisely, the area under the epidemic curve. Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect. For R(0) > 1, the number infected tends to increase, and for R(0) < 1, transmission dies out.

Given the emerging role of the IgA isotype in the COVID-19 diagnostics, we aimed to identify the SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies in a COVID-19 population seronegative for IgM. A total of 30 patients hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) for COVID-19, seronegative for IgM antibodies, have been studied for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. They all had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction result. Assays used were a chemiluminescent assay measuring SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG (S + N) and an ELISA, measuring specific IgG (S1) and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among the 30 patients, eight were positive for IgA, seven were positive for IgG (N + S), and two for IgG (S1), at the first point (5-7 days from the onset of symptoms). The IgA antibodies mean values at the second (9-13 days) and third (21-25 days) time points were even more than twice as high as IgG assays.

Because cystatins added to cell cultures can inhibit polio, herpes simplex and coronavirus replication, which are intracellular processes, the internalization and intracellular regulation of cysteine proteases by cystatin C should be considered. The extension, mechanism and biological importance of this hypothetical process are unknown. We investigated whether internalization of cystatin C occurs in a set of human cell lines.

During cystatin C incubation, intracellular cystatin C increased after 5 min and accumulated for at least 6 h, reaching four to six times the baseline level. Western blotting showed that the internalized inhibitor was not degraded. It was functionally intact and extracts of cells exposed to cystatin C showed a higher capacity to inhibit papain and cathepsin B than control cells (decrease in enzyme activity of 34% and 37%, respectively). The uptake of labelled cystatin C was inhibited by unlabelled inhibitor, suggesting a specific pathway for the internalization.

The success rate and prognostic factors for complete treatment were analysed. MATERIAL/METHODS The medical records of all patients who had undergone curatively intended thermal ablation of bone metastases between September 2001 and February 2012 were retrospectively analysed. The goal was to achieve complete treatment of all bone metastases in patients with oligometastatic disease (group 1) or only of bone metastases that could potentially lead to skeletal-related events in patients with a long life expectancy (group 2). We report the rate of complete treatment according to patient characteristics, primary tumour site, bone metastasis characteristics, radiofrequency ablation/cryotherapy and the treatment group (group 1/group 2). RESULTS Eighty-nine consecutive patients had undergone curatively intended thermal ablation of 122 bone metastases. The median follow-up was 22.8 months [IQR = 12.2-44.4]. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the 1-year complete treatment rate was 67% (95%CI: 50%-76%). In the multivariate analysis the favourable prognostic factors for complete local treatment were oligometastatic status (p = 0.02), metachronous (p = 0.004) and small-sized (p = 0.001) bone metastases, without cortical bone erosion (p = 0.01) or neurological structures in the vicinity (p = 0.002).

We tested whether a simplified version of the guidelines and a simplified version with visual aids would affect comprehension and intention to self-isolate during the containment phase of the pandemic in the UK, in March 2020, compared to the standard guidelines. METHODS: We conducted an online, three-armed parallel randomized controlled trial. Participants were English and over 18. The survey software randomized them into conditions; they were blind to condition. The control group read the 7-page standard guidelines (the current version at the time of the trial). The intervention groups were given either a 3-page simplified version, with a summary box on the front page and numbered bullet points, or the same simplified version with pictograms illustrating the points in the box. Primary outcomes were comprehension of the guidelines, as measured by the number of correct answers given to six questions about the content, and the proportion who answered that they would 'definitely' stay at home for 7 days if symptomatic. FINDINGS: Recruitment was from 13 to 16 March 2020, with 1845 participants randomised and all data analysed. The Control group averaged 4.27 correct answers, the Simplified 4.20, and the Simplified + visual aids 4.13, out of a possible total of 6 correct answers. There were no differences in comprehension in the unadjusted models; however, when the model was adjusted for demographic variables, there was lower comprehension in the simplified + visual aids condition than in the control, (? = - 0.16, p = 0.04998). There were no statistically significant differences in intention to stay home: Control was 85%, Simplified 83%, and Simplified + visual aids condition 84%. CONCLUSION: Simplified guidance did not improve comprehension compared to the standard guidance issued in the containment phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, and simplified guidance with visual aids may even have worsened comprehension. Simplified guidance had no effect on intention to stay home if symptomatic.

To date, the public's attitudes towards AVs were mostly estimated through traditional survey data with high labor costs and a low quantity of samples, which also might be one of the reasons why the influencing factors on the public's attitudes of AVs have not been studied from multiple aspects in a comprehensive way yet. To address the issue, this study aims to propose a method by using large-scale social media data to investigate key factors that affect the public's attitudes and acceptance of AVs. A total of 954,151 Twitter data related to AVs and 53 candidate independent variables from seven categories were extracted using the web scraping method. Then, sentiment analysis was used to measure the public attitudes towards AVs by calculating sentiment scores. Random forests algorithm was employed to preliminarily select candidate independent variables according to their importance, while a linear mixed model was performed to explore the impacting factors considering the unobserved heterogeneities caused by the subjectivity level of tweets. The results showed that the overall attitude of the public on AVs was slightly optimistic. Factors like \\"drunk\\", \\"blind spot\\", and \\"mobility\\" had the largest impacts on public attitudes.

METHODS Baseline knowledge and confidence regarding ERUP were established for 5 robotic teams before completing 2 full-immersion simulations separated by an online self-paced learning module. In each simulation, teams operated on a perfused hydrogel model and were tasked to dissect a retroperitoneal tumor abutting a major vessel. During vascular pedicle ligation, a major vascular bleed and nonrecoverable robotic fault were remotely induced, necessitating ERUP with open conversion. After the simulation, participants completed surgery task load index (cognitive load assessment) and realism surveys. Weighted checklists scored participants' actions during each simulation. Surgical metrics including estimated blood loss, time to control bleeding, and undocking time were recorded. Curriculum retention was assessed by repeating the exercise at 6 months.

Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed, validated and applied in three patients of a family which underwent an ambulatory course of COVID-19 for six months. The virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks. Serum IgA levels to the S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau at approximately six weeks, and stayed elevated over the observation period. Virus-neutralizing activity reached a peak about 4 weeks after disease onset but dropped slowly. The longitudinal associations of virus neutralization and the serological immune response suggest immunity in patients even after a mild clinical course of COVID-19.","output":"Persisting Neutralizing Activity to SARS-CoV-2 over Months in Sera of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To assess feasibility of the harmonic Osteovue blade (HOB) for use in the soft tissue approach for dogs undergoing hemilaminectomy and to compare outcomes between dogs undergoing HOB or traditional approach (TRAD). METHODS A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed using 20 client-owned dogs with thoracolumbar intervertebral disk extrusion requiring hemilaminectomy. Dogs were randomly assigned to HOB or TRAD. Neurologic function and pain scores were assessed pre-operatively. Intraoperative blood loss and surgical approach time as well as postoperative pain and wound healing scores were recorded. Additionally, neurologic recovery and owner perceived quality of life were recorded at day 10 and 30 postoperative. RESULTS There was no significant difference in sex distribution, weight, age, preoperative neurological grade and pain score, and perioperative outcome measures between groups. Intraoperative total blood loss was minimal for HOB and TRAD (median: 0 ml (range 0-9) and 2.2 ml (range 0-6.8), respectively; p = 0.165) and approach times were similar (median: 7 min (range 5-12) and 8 min (range 5-13), respectively; p = 0.315). While changes in wound healing scores were similar, changes in postoperative pain scores and neurological function were significantly improved in the HOB compared to the TRAD group. Postoperative complications in the HOB group consisted of automutilation of part of the incision and development of a small soft, non-painful subcutaneous swelling in 1 dog each. CONCLUSIONS The HOB is a safe and effective tool for the soft tissue approach for routine spinal surgery in dogs and is associated with decreased pain and increased neurological function post-surgery.","output":"Comparison of harmonic blade versus traditional approach in canine patients undergoing spinal decompressive surgery for naturally occurring thoracolumbar disk extrusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-prescription is already used in many countries, improving the standard of patient care. Officially, from 8 January 2020 e-prescribing has been obligated in Poland. Physicians and pharmacists opinions on e-prescribing have been widely researched and reported in the literature. In contrast, patients perception has, to date, received little attention. For this reason, the aim of this study was to find the features and functionalities of e-prescribing that are desired by the public and influence the positive evaluation of this tool, according to patient opinion. In order to obtain data, a questionnaire was completed by 456 randomly selected adults. The obtained results indicated that only eight people (1.8%) did not know what e-prescription is. Of the remaining 448 individuals, 72.1% prefer e-prescription because it is more convenient for them. Most patients (62.1%) also recognize that e-prescribing makes it easier to purchase medications on behalf of another patient. Based on the study, it can be concluded that e-prescription is well evaluated by Polish patients. A large percentage of respondents were positive about obtaining prescriptions for continued treatment, without a personal doctor visit. Therefore, it is reasonable to maintain the possibility of such contact with a physician. The most popular, and preferred, method of receiving e-prescriptions is via SMS.

Few studies have reported data on placental morphology and histology in infected pregnant patients, although not compared with carefully matched controls. The aim of this study is to compare placental morphology and histology of pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 to non-infected controls. METHODS: This is a prospective multicenter case-control study on 64 pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 who delivered at term or late-preterm. Data were collected about pregnancy course, maternal and fetal outcomes, placental biometry and macro- and microscopical morphology. 64 not-infected women were identified as controls, matched by age, body mass index and ethnicity. RESULTS: Cases and controls had similar fetal and maternal outcomes. No significant differences were observed in placental macro- or microscopical morphology between the two groups. In the cases treated with antivirals, chloroquine, LMWH or antibiotics, placentas were heavier but not more efficient than the non-treated, since the fetal/placental weight ratio did not differ. Moreover, delayed villous maturation was more frequent in treated women, although not significantly. The newborns whose mothers received oxygen therapy as treatment had higher levels of umbilical cord pO2 at birth. DISCUSSION: In this prospective case-control study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during the third trimester did not influence placental histological pattern. Pharmacological and oxygen therapy administered to women affected by this viral infection could impact maternal and fetal outcomes and be associated to placental histological alterations.","output":"Placental pathology in COVID-19 affected pregnant women: A prospective case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biomedical waste is a hazard to worldwide communal environmental health.

Plasmalemmal receptor and transducer proteins allow the cell to recognize and respond to various external influences. Membrane-associated proteins anchor cells to their substrata and mediate their integration into tissues. Many properties of a given cell type may be attributed to the protein composition of its plasma membrane. Most cells go to large lengths to control the nature and distribution of polypeptides that populate their plasmalemmas. Cells regulate the expression of genes encoding plasma membrane proteins. Proteins destined for the insertion into the plasma membrane pass through a complex system of processing organelles prior to arriving at their site of ultimate functional residence. Each of these organelles makes a unique contribution to the maturation of these proteins as they transit through them. This chapter discusses the postsynthetic steps involved in the biogenesis of plasma membrane proteins. The chapter discusses some of the events common to all plasmalemmal polypeptides, with special emphasis on those that contribute directly to the character of the cell surface.

The eleven PAEs were detected with the total concentration of 7.44-30.51 mg/m2 in labels and tapes. Diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DIBP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), Bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) had the highest detection frequency in adhesive material samples. The concentrations of PAEs in labeled fruits were higher than that in unlabeled fruits, especially in the peel, indicating PAEs could transfer from labels or tapes to fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the migration behaviors of PAEs from labels or tapes to apples, avocados and celery were investigated. It was found that the PAEs could penetrate to apple and avocado pulp through the peel, resulting in the residue of the PAEs in the whole fruit. Unlike apple peel, the thick avocado peel was more difficultly penetrated by the PAEs. Due to the high lipid content, the PAEs distributed more evenly in avocado pulp than in apple pulp. The migrations up to a maximum of 4.16 mg/kg were found for butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) in avocado peel and up to a maximum of 0.188 mg/kg in avocado pulp. The average migration of the PAEs in celery ranged from 0.3 to 26.1 g/kg in three days and the low migration might result from the rough surface and less contacting area.

Separate pathology records were searched for biopsy-confirmed cases of NSF during the same study periods. The incidences of NSF during the pre-guidelines adoption and transitional period and post-guidelines adoption period were compared by using the paired Z test. RESULTS A total of 52,954 contrast-enhanced MR examinations were performed during the post-guidelines adoption period.

It is \\"a guy we don't know.\\" Relationships between the mysteriousness of the virus and heightened visibility of longstanding inequality in the United States form new contexts for existing social tensions. These dynamics provide a backdrop against which the ongoing commitment to uprisings connected to the Black Lives Matter movement unfold. Here I draw on analysis of 50 semi-structured interviews we conducted from March to August of 2020 demonstrating how understandings of the biology of a virus are woven into perceptions of politics, inequality, and the fractures of a divided nation. To understand social and political responses to the global pandemic it is essential that we continue to investigate xenophobia, inequality, and racism alongside the biological impact of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Connection, Contagion, and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a global pandemic only a few months after it emerged in China.

There is only one documented case of tamsulosin-induced SJS, and no documented case of TEN secondary to tamsulosin use. Our patient was a 26-year-old male who presented to the hospital after a recent history of COVID-19 infection with a diffuse maculo-vesicular rash with bullae, involving the mucosa. The patient had recent use of tamsulosin on the day of presentation and there were bullae and erythematous rashes present in the oral mucosa as well as significant conjunctival erythema with pain on ocular movement on physical examination. His rash progressively worsened, involving greater than 30% of his body. A biopsy was done that showed full-thickness necrosis indicative of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

This qualitative study describes the acceptability of a telemedicine intervention which used photos of surgical incisions taken by community health workers (CHWs) to detect surgical site infections (SSIs) among women after cesarean section in rural Rwanda. Methods: Twenty-five semi-structured interviews (13 patients, 12 CHWs) were conducted in the local dialect (Kinyarwanda) among women who participated in the telemedicine intervention. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and translated into English, and parallel inductive coding processes were done to create English and Kinyarwanda codebooks. Results from the 2 methodologies were merged to create a master codebook for the final coding process. Results: The overwhelming majority of participants reported that this photo-based telemedicine was acceptable, with only 1 patient concerned about the reliability of photos to detect SSIs. Faster healing, improved access to home-based postoperative care, and saving out-of-pocket expenditures were reported perceived advantages of the intervention. Trust in CHWs was reported by all as essential to the acceptance of this intervention. All but 1 of the CHWs believed that it was acceptable to implement this intervention during the COVID-19 period. Conclusion: Photo-based telemedicine procedures were feasible and acceptable by the majority of patients and CHWs, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trust in CHWs was described as a key factor in patients' acceptance of this program. Given this, local CHWs should be involved early in the development and implementation of such interventions.","output":"Acceptability of Telemedicine for Early Surgical Site Infection Diagnosis after Cesarean Section"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatology began with the extension of care to smaller babies born earlier in gestation and now extending into the threat of COVID-1 Extending operations into a new environment places everyone in novel situations Emerging from actual operations within dangerous contexts, HRO extends operations and the organization into uncertain, adverse, and hostile environments The physical actions of care come from motor cognition, the influence of the cerebellum and motor cortex on cognition, and how we learn through physical action to understand events Rather than study the myriad ways a system can fail or how it can reach the final common pathway of failing, we can study and respond to it as a liminal zone It is common to all failures - an exigency of ambiguous information, impending proximal threat, uncertainty, and demand for action Engagement in the liminal zone is the same as engagement for extension, drawing from four domains: categorization, methods of decision making, the significance of the affective processes, and modulation of stress and fear responses Perhaps the purpose of safety, reliability, and resilience is not to safely work in a dangerous context but to support the extension of the organization into uncertainty, a new environment, unpredictable circumstances, or to penetrate threats When a person believes in themselves, they will leave their place of safety and engage the unknown when they know they are supported This is the extension of neonatology [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Neonatology Today is the property of Loma Linda Publishing Company and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"High Reliability Organizing (HRO) is the Extension of Neonatology during Pandemic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Although social determinants of health (SDOH) are important factors in health inequities, they have not been explicitly associated with COVID-19 mortality rates across racial and ethnic groups and rural, suburban, and urban contexts. OBJECTIVES: To explore the spatial and racial disparities in county-level COVID-19 mortality rates during the first year of the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data for all US counties in 50 states and the District of Columbia for the first full year of the COVID-19 pandemic (January 22, 2020, to February 28, 2021). Counties with a high concentration of a single racial and ethnic population and a high level of COVID-19 mortality rate were identified as concentrated longitudinal-impact counties. The SDOH that may be associated with mortality rate across these counties and in urban, suburban, and rural contexts were examined. The 3 largest racial and ethnic groups in the US were selected: Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and non-Hispanic White populations. EXPOSURES: County-level characteristics and community health factors (eg, income inequality, uninsured rate, primary care physicians, preventable hospital stays, severe housing problems rate, and access to broadband internet) associated with COVID-19 mortality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data on county-level COVID-19 mortality rates (deaths per 100 000 population) reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were analyzed. Four indexes were used to measure multiple dimensions of SDOH: socioeconomic advantage index, limited mobility index, urban core opportunity index, and mixed immigrant cohesion and accessibility index. Spatial regression models were used to examine the associations between SDOH and county-level COVID-19 mortality rate. RESULTS: Of the 3142 counties included in the study, 531 were identified as concentrated longitudinal-impact counties. Of these counties, 347 (11.0%) had a large Black or African American population compared with other counties, 198 (6.3%) had a large Hispanic or Latinx population compared with other counties, and 33 (1.1%) had a large non-Hispanic White population compared with other counties. A total of 489 254 COVID-19-related deaths were reported. Most concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a large Black or African American population compared with other counties were spread across urban, suburban, and rural areas and experienced numerous disadvantages, including higher income inequality (297 of 347 [85.6%]) and more preventable hospital stays (281 of 347 [81.0%]). Most concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a large Hispanic or Latinx population compared with other counties were located in urban areas (114 of 198 [57.6%]), and 130 (65.7%) of these counties had a high percentage of people who lacked health insurance. Most concentrated longitudinal-impact counties with a large non-Hispanic White population compared with other counties were in rural areas (23 of 33 [69.7%]), included a large group of older adults (26 of 33 [78.8%]), and had limited access to quality health care (24 of 33 [72.7%]). In urban areas, the mixed immigrant cohesion and accessibility index was inversely associated with COVID-19 mortality (coefficient [SE], C23.38 [6.06]; P < .001), indicating that mortality rates in urban areas were associated with immigrant communities with traditional family structures, multiple accessibility stressors, and housing overcrowding. Higher COVID-19 mortality rates were also associated with preventable hospital stays in rural areas (coefficient [SE], 0.008 [0.002]; P < .001) and higher socioeconomic status vulnerability in suburban areas (coefficient [SE], C21.60 [3.55]; P < .001). Across all community types, places with limited internet access had higher mortality rates, especially in urban areas (coefficient [SE], 5.83 [0.81]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found an association between different SDOH measures and COVID-19 mortality that varied across racial and ethnic groups and community types. Future research is needed that explores the different dimensions and regional patterns of SDOH to address health inequity and guide policies and programs.","output":"Assessment of Structural Barriers and Racial Group Disparities of COVID-19 Mortality With Spatial Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has recently started worldwide. As the vaccine supply will be limited for a considerable period of time in many countries, it is important to devise the effective vaccination strategies that reduce the number of deaths and incidence of infection. One of the characteristics of COVID-19 is that the symptom, severity, and mortality of the disease differ by age. Thus, when the vaccination supply is limited, age-dependent vaccination priority strategy should be implemented to minimize the incidences and mortalities. In this study, we developed an age-structured model for describing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, including vaccination. Using the model and actual epidemiological data in Korea, we estimated the infection probability for each age group under different levels of social distancing implemented in Korea and investigated the effective age-dependent vaccination strategies to reduce the confirmed cases and fatalities of COVID-19. We found that, in a lower level of social distancing, vaccination priority for the age groups with the highest transmission rates will reduce the incidence mostly, but, in higher levels of social distancing, prioritizing vaccination for the elderly age group reduces the infection incidences more effectively. To reduce mortalities, vaccination priority for the elderly age group is the best strategy in all scenarios of levels of social distancing. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of vaccine supply and efficacy on the reduction in incidence and mortality.","output":"Vaccination Prioritization Strategies for COVID-19 in Korea: A Mathematical Modeling Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Growth arrest-specific factor 6 (GAS6) and the Tyro3, AXL, and MERTK (TAM) receptors counterbalance pro-inflammatory responses. AXL is a candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the respiratory system, and the GAS6/AXL axis is targeted in current clinical trials against COVID-19. However, GAS6 and TAMs have not been evaluated in COVID-19 patients at emergency admission. Methods: Plasma GAS6, AXL, and MERTK were analyzed in 132 patients consecutively admitted to the emergency ward during the first peak of COVID-19. Results: GAS6 levels were higher in the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, increasing progressively with the severity of the disease. Patients with initial GAS6 at the highest quartile had the worst outcome, with a 3-month survival of 65%, compared to a 90% survival for the rest. Soluble AXL exhibited higher plasma concentration in deceased patients, without significant differences in MERTK among SARS-CoV-2-positive groups. GAS6 mRNA was mainly expressed in alveolar cells and AXL in airway macrophages. Remarkably, THP-1 human macrophage differentiation neatly induces AXL, and its inhibition (bemcentinib) reduced cytokine production in human macrophages after LPS challenge.

Overall, we identified highly populated and polluted areas, regional air hub areas, race minorities (non-white population), and Hispanic or Latino population with an increased risk of COVID-19-related death during the first phase of the epidemic. The 10 highest COVID-19 mortality risk areas in highly populated counties had on average a lower proportion of white population (48.0%) and higher proportions of black population (18.7%) and other races (33.3%) compared to the national averages of 83.0%, 9.1%, and 7.9%, respectively. The Hispanic and Latino population proportion was higher in these 10 counties (29.3%, compared to the national average of 9.3%).

Avoidance of laparoscopy was recommended, to reduce aerosol generation and risk of virus transmission. Evidence on the safety profile of laparoscopy during the pandemic is lacking. This study compares patient outcomes and risk to staff from laparoscopic and open gastrointestinal operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Single-centre retrospective study of gastrointestinal operations performed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic, comorbidity, perioperative and survival data were collected from electronic medical records and supplemented with patient symptoms reported at telephone follow up. Outcomes assessed were: patient mortality, illness among staff, patient COVID-19 rates, length of hospital stay and postdischarge symptomatology. RESULTS A total of 73 patients with median age of 56 years were included; 55 (75%) and 18 (25%) underwent laparoscopic and open surgery, respectively. All-cause mortality was 5% (4/73), was related to COVID-19 in all cases, with no mortality after laparoscopic surgery. A total of 14 staff members developed COVID-19 symptoms within 2 weeks, with no significant difference between laparoscopic and open surgery (10 vs 4; p=0.331). Median length of stay was shorter in the laparoscopic versus the open group (4.5 vs 9.9 days; p=0.011), and postdischarge symptomatology across 15 symptoms was similar between groups (p=0.135-0.814). CONCLUSIONS With appropriate protective measures, laparoscopic surgery is safe for patients and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We designed and tested a highly scalable virtual training curriculum for novice raters using the Oxford NOTECHS non-technical skills rating system. DESIGN: A three-day training course comprising virtual didactics, virtually facilitated simulations, and independent live observations was implemented. NOTECHS scores were submitted for eleven standardized video simulations and four live operations. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for total NOTECHS scores and subcomponent scores. Raters previously trained in-person with the same standardized videos served as a comparator group for equivalence testing. SETTING: All study activities were conducted in a large academic tertiary referral center in Singapore as part of an ongoing surgical safety initiative. PARTICIPANTS: Seven staff members underwent training (three virtually and four in-person). None had prior surgical experience or non-technical skills assessment training. RESULTS: ICCs for total NOTECHS scores were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.98) for virtually trained raters and 0.83 for those trained in-person (95% CI, 0.68-0.99). Scores were equivalent between groups within a 10% margin. CONCLUSIONS: Non-technical skills assessment can be reliably taught in a highly scalable virtual format.

Based on Baidu location-based service (LBS) big data, using complex networks method and geographic visualization tools, this paper explores the spatial structure evolution of population flow network (PFN) in 368 cities of China under different traffic control situations. Effective distance models and linear regression models were established to analyze how the population flow across cities affects the spread of the epidemic. Our findings show that: (1) the scope of population flow is closely related to the administrative level of the city and the traffic control policies in various cities which adjust with the epidemic situation; The PFN mainly presents the hierarchical structure dominated by the urban hierarchy and the regional isolation structure adjacent to the geographical location.(2) through the analysis network topology structure of PFN, it is found that only the first stage has a large clustering coefficient and a relatively short average path length, which conforms to the characteristics of small world network. The epidemic situation has a great impact on the network topology in other stages, and the network structure tends to be centralized. (3) The overall migration scale of the whole country decreased by 36.85% compared with the same period of last year's lunar calendar, and a further reduction of 78.52% in the nationwide traffic control stage after the festival.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is summarization of the current evidence for accuracy of ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter in detecting intracranial hypertension in pediatric patients. DATA SOURCES Medical subject heading terms were used to search MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for relevant citations. Publications from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2019, were included in the search strategy. STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they involved patients less than 18 years, where ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter was compared to conventional, nonophthalmic tests for intracranial hypertension. Studies were excluded if there was insufficient data to compute a sensitivity/specificity table. Case reports, case series, and manuscripts not published in English were also excluded. DATA EXTRACTION The initial search returned 573 citations. Of these, 57 were selected for review. DATA SYNTHESIS Eleven citations were included in the final meta-analysis. A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was performed, which revealed a pooled sensitivity for ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter of 93% (95% CI, 74-99%), a specificity of 74% (95% CI, 52-88%), and a diagnostic odds ratio of 39.00 (95% CI, 4.16-365.32). The area under the curve of the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.93). Subgroup analyses of the test's performance evaluating new-onset intracranial hypertension and in comparison to invasively measured intracranial pressure were performed. The test performance in these instances was similar to findings in the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS We are unable to identify a threshold value in ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter for the determination of intracranial hypertension in children. Even though the ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter measurement is highly sensitive to the presence of increased intracranial pressure, the test has only moderate specificity. Therefore, other confirmatory methods and further investigation is necessary in the clinical care of children. The technique is likely not sufficiently precise for clinical use in the absence of other confirmatory methods, and further investigation is necessary to determine clinical protocols for its use in children.","output":"Ultrasonographic Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter Measurement to Detect Intracranial Hypertension in Children With Neurological Injury: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 vary considerably between patients.

Numerous ongoing and recently published studies about the disease have emerged. However, the research regarding COVID-19 is largely ongoing and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: A potential way to accelerate COVID-19 research is to use existing information gleaned from research into other viruses that belong to the coronavirus family. Our objective is to develop a natural language processing method for answering factoid questions related to COVID-19 using published articles as knowledge sources. METHODS: Given a question, first, a BM25-based context retriever model is implemented to select the most relevant passages from previously published articles. Second, for each selected context passage, an answer is obtained using a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) question-answering model. Third, an opinion aggregator, which is a combination of a biterm topic model and k-means clustering, is applied to the task of aggregating all answers into several opinions. RESULTS: We applied the proposed pipeline to extract answers, opinions, and the most frequent words related to six questions from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. By showing the longitudinal distributions of the opinions, we uncovered the trends of opinions and popular words in the articles published in the five time periods assessed: before 1990, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2018, and since 2019. The changes in opinions and popular words agree with several distinct characteristics and challenges of COVID-19, including a higher risk for senior people and people with pre-existing medical conditions; high contagion and rapid transmission; and a more urgent need for screening and testing. The opinions and popular words also provide additional insights for the COVID-19-related questions.

Sixty percent of convalescent patients with detectable WA1-specific NAb also showed strong neutralization of the Delta variant, the prevalent strain of the present pandemic. These data show that convalescent patients maintain functional antibody responses for more than one year after infection, suggesting a strong long-lasting response after symptomatic disease that may offer a prolonged protection against re-infection. One patient from this cohort showed strong increase of both Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies at 14 months post-infection indicating SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. These antibodies showed stronger cross-reactivity to a panel of Spike-RBD including Beta, Delta and Mu and neutralization of a panel of Spike variants including Beta and Gamma. This patient provides an example of strong anti-Spike recall immunity able to control infection at an asymptomatic level. Together, the antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients persist over 14 months and continue to maintain cross-reactivity to the current variants of concern and show strong functional properties.","output":"Sequential Analysis of Binding and Neutralizing Antibody in COVID-19 Convalescent Patients at 14 Months After SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND High-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFOT) is a promising first-line therapy for acute respiratory failure. However, its weaning has never been investigated and could lead to unnecessary prolonged intensive-care unit (ICU) stay. The aim of this study is to assess predictors of successful separation from HFOT in critically ill patients. We performed a retrospective monocenter observational study over a 2-year period including all patients treated with HFOT for acute respiratory failure in the ICU. Those who died or were intubated without prior HFOT separation attempt, who were treated with non-invasive ventilation at the time of HFOT separation, or who received HFOT as a preventive treatment during the post-extubation period were excluded. RESULTS From the 190 patients analyzed, 168 (88%) were successfully separated from HFOT at the first attempt. Patients who failed separation from HFOT at the first attempt had longer ICU length of stay than those who succeeded: 10 days (7-12) vs. 5 (4-8), p < 0.0001. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)  40% and a respiratory rate-oxygenation (ROX) index (calculated as the ratio of SpO2/FiO2 to the respiratory rate)  9.2 predicted successful separation from HFOT with sensitivity of 85% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS FiO2  40% and ROX index  9.2 were two predictors of successful separation from HFOT at the bedside.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 55 peripheral hepatic tumors abutting the diaphragm treated by microwave ablation versus a control group of 15 centrally located tumors. Treated tumors were further subdivided according to the use of artificial ascites (fluid vs no fluid) and whether instilled fluid achieved displacement of the liver surface away from the diaphragm (displaced vs nondisplaced). Measurements of tumor size, distance to the diaphragm, ablation zone size, displacement distance, length of the ablation zone along the liver capsule, diaphragm thickness, diaphragmatic hernia, and local tumor progression were made on pre- and postablation CT and MRI. The electronic medical record was reviewed for patient self-reported pain scores and other symptoms. Data were analyzed by use of the Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS There were no cases of diaphragmatic hernia in peripheral or central tumors. Postablation diaphragm thickness was higher in peripheral hepatic tumors than in control tumors. Peripheral tumors had an overall higher incidence of postprocedure shoulder pain (18% vs 0%) and local tumor progression (5.5% vs 0%) compared with control tumors, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.2 and p = 1, respectively).

The Mobility Enhancement Robotic Wheelchair (MEBot) was designed to improve the stability of Electric Powered Wheelchairs (EPW) when driving over these environments. MEBot offers six independently height-adjustable wheels to control attitude of its seat over uneven and angled terrains. Its attitude control application uses an inertial measurement unit to detect seat angles changes to adjust each wheel-height accordingly. MEBot was compared to commercial EPWs in terms of EPW performance (seat angle changes and response time) and participant perception (satisfaction and task-load demand) towards each device. Ten participants drove their own EPW and MEBot for five trials each through driving tasks that replicated outdoor environments. Results showed less change in the pitch angle when driving up and down a 10 slope using MEBot (5.6  1.6, 6.6  0.5) compared to the participants' own EPW (14.6  2.6, 12.1  2.6).

Our work aims to develop a sensitive method (mCoV-MS) which can not only identify known HCoVs accurately, but also have the ability to provide clues for the emerging HCoVs. The method was performed using a MassARRAY matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system. We developed a 17-plex analysis to detect six HCoVs in Panel A and another 17-plex analysis to detect Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus in Panel B. All tested primers and probes for the mCoV-MS method were effective, with no cross-reactivity observed with other common respiratory viruses. To confirm the usefulness of the mCoV-MS method we screened 384 pharyngeal and/or anal swab samples collected from bats/rodents, and 131 nasal and throat swabs from human patients. The results showed good concordance with the results of metagenomic analysis or PCR-sequencing. The validation test showed mCoV-MS method can detect potentially pathogenic CoVs in Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus and provide convincingly phylogenetic evidences about unknown CoVs.

Many studies have revealed various regulators of NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, while it has been recently shown that NLRP3 is implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis. At the same time, probiotics counteract the inflammatory process and modulate cytokine release, thus influencing both innate and adaptive immune systems. Herein, we review the immunomodulatory potential of probiotics on the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms supporting the use of probiotic bacteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection management, presenting evidence from preclinical studies of the last decade: in vivo, ex vivo, and mixed trials. Data show that probiotics intake is related to NLRP3 inflammasome attenuation and lower levels of inflammation markers, highlighting the beneficial effects of probiotics on inflammatory conditions. Currently, none of the ongoing clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of probiotics intake in humans with COVID-19 has been completed. However, evidence from preclinical studies indicates that probiotics may block virus invasion and replication through their metabolites, bacteriocins, and their ability to block Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and by stimulating the immune response through NLRP3 inflammasome regulation. In this review, the beneficial effects of probiotics in the inflammatory process through NLRP3 inflammasome attenuation are presented. Furthermore, probiotics may target SARS-CoV-2 both by blocking virus invasion and replication and by stimulating the immune response through NLRP3 inflammasome regulation.

This cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on Thai new mothers and the variables affecting their mental health. The survey data were collected from 903 Thai mothers with infants aged 0C12 months using an online platform and a face-to-face interview questionnaire survey between 17 July and 17 October 2020, during the first nationwide COVID-19 lockdown period. For the final analysis, there were 862 participants who completed all of the questions. The full exploratory analysis was performed by multivariable linear regression to identify the variables influencing maternal mental health. Our study demonstrated that new mothers reported feeling a high extent to some extent of worry (44.9%), increased appetite (40.4%), becoming easily annoyed or irritable (39.1%), and feeling down (33.5%), whereas 82.7% felt able to cope with the first lockdown situation. Practiced relaxation techniques were associated with positive maternal mental health (adjusted  = 1.05, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.52, p < 0.001). The perceived impact of the COVID-19 lockdown was on the households ability to pay for rent, to make mortgage payments (adjusted  = ?1.59, 95% CI ?2.87 to ?0.36, p = 0.011), the households ability to pay for other essentials, such as utilities and medication (adjusted  = ?1.99, 95% CI ?3.16 to ?0.81, p = 0.001), household crowding after lockdown (adjusted  = ?3.46, 95% CI ?4.86 to ?2.06, p < 0.001), and not going outside or doing outdoor activities (adjusted  = ?2.22, 95% CI ?3.35 to ?1.08, p < 0.001).

METHODS: Data were obtained from the March 2020 Porter Novelli ConsumerStyles survey. This study includes 6463 U.S. adults (&#8805;18 years) who participated in the survey (58.2% response rate). Participants were asked about frequent handwashing and surface disinfection. Participants were also asked six questions to assess disability status and disability type. Prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated; chi-square tests were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1295 (20.3%) of survey participants reported at least one disability and their hygiene-related behavior. Overall, 91.3% of respondents with disabilities reported frequent handwashing; only 72% reported frequent surface disinfection. Those with hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living disabilities (range: 77.9%-90.6%) were significantly less likely than those without any disability (94.0%) to report frequent handwashing.

It has been demonstrated to outperform the more widely used Mayo endoscopic score (MES) in predicting long-term prognosis, including the need for colectomy. Despite its potential benefits, many clinicians still prefer to use MES because its operating characteristics are better defined and its grades are more readily applicable to clinical decision-making. The aims of our study were to quantify the UCEIS cutoff most closely associated with the need for treatment escalation and to perform a validation exercise using MES and clinical, biochemical, and histological measures of disease activity. METHODS Endoscopies performed in UC patients between November 2016 and January 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Agreement between the UCEIS and MES was quantified using Kappa () statistics. A UCEIS cutoff for treatment escalation was calculated using chi-square, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve (AUC) analyses. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to compare linear relationships between UCEIS and clinical (Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI]), biochemical (C-reactive protein [CRP]), and histological (Nancy Histological Index [NHI]) activity. RESULTS Two hundred one (56%) procedures documented both UCEIS and MES, demonstrating substantial agreement ( = 0.713; P < 0.001). Treatment was escalated after 199 (56%) procedures. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of need for treatment escalation showed the highest sensitivity and specificity for UCEIS 4 (0.80 and 0.93, respectively; AUC, 0.93). Of 170 patients with a UCEIS 4, treatment was escalated in 159 (94%), but not for 11 (6%). Of 185 patients with a UCEIS 3, 40 (22%) were escalated, whereas 145 (78%) were not (P < 0.001). UCEIS correlated strongly with NHI (0.723; P < 0.001), moderately with SCCAI (0.671; P < 0.001), and weakly with CRP (0.279; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A UCEIS 4 was significantly associated with treatment escalation. This cutoff could therefore be used to support clinical decision-making based on endoscopic findings. Strong and moderate correlations were found between UCEIS and histological and clinical disease activity, respectively, whereas a weak correlation was found with CRP. 10.1093/ibd/izy325_Video_1 izy325.video1 5849933952001.","output":"Validation and Investigation of the Operating Characteristics of the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The study was to explore the experience of frontline nurses four months after COVID-19 rescue task. BACKGROUND: Frontline medical staff are prone to follow-up mental health problems and different feeling after COVID-19 rescue task.

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the known receptor of SARS-CoV-2 surface spike glycoprotein for entry into human cells. A recent study reported absent to low expression of ACE2 in a variety of human lung epithelial cell samples. Three bioprojects (PRJEB4337, PRJNA270632 and PRJNA280600) invariably found abundant expression of ACE1 (a homolog of ACE2 and also known as ACE) in human lungs compared to very low expression of ACE2. In fact, ACE1 has a wider and more abundant tissue distribution compared to ACE2. Although it is not obvious from the primary sequence alignment of ACE1 and ACE2, comparison of X-ray crystallographic structures show striking similarities in the regions of the peptidase domains (PD) of these proteins, which is known (for ACE2) to interact with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Critical amino acids in ACE2 that mediate interaction with the viral spike protein are present and organized in the same order in the PD of ACE1.

Most conventional protocols rely on highly purified protein reagents that require considerable expertise, time, and infrastructure to produce. In consequence, most proteins are acquired from commercial sources, reagent expense is often high, and accessibility may be hampered by shipping delays, customs barriers, geopolitical constraints, and the need for a constant cold chain. Such limitations to the widespread availability of protein reagents, in turn, limit the expansion and adoption of molecular biology methods in research, education, and technology development and application. Here, we describe protocols for producing a low-resource and locally sustainable reagent delivery system, termed \\"cellular reagents,\\" in which bacteria engineered to overexpress proteins of interest are dried and can then be used directly as reagent packets in numerous molecular biology reactions, without the need for protein purification or a constant cold chain. As an example of their application, we describe the execution of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using cellular reagents, detailing how to replace pure protein reagents with optimal amounts of rehydrated cellular reagents. We additionally describe a do-it-yourself fluorescence visualization device for using these cellular reagents in common molecular biology applications. The methods presented in this article can be used for low-cost, on-site production of commonly used molecular biology reagents (including DNA and RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, and ligases) with minimal instrumentation and expertise, and without the need for protein purification. Consequently, these methods should generally make molecular biology reagents more affordable and accessible. ? 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, a??30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to predict regions of high base pair content across long genomes and to pinpoint hotspots of well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity for stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis suggests varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts, which given the technical difficulty of experimentally separating cellular mixtures of sgRNA from gRNA, is a unique advantage of our in-silico pipeline. The resulting findings provide a useful roadmap for planning focused empirical studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA biology, and a preliminary guide for exploring potential SARS-CoV-2 RNA drug targets.Importance The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is among the largest and most complex viral genomes, and yet its RNA structural features remain relatively unexplored. Since RNA elements guide function in most RNA viruses, and they represent potential drug targets, it is essential to chart the architectural features of SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint regions that merit focused study. Here we show that RNA folding stability of SARS-CoV-2 genome is exceptional among viral genomes and we develop a method to directly compare levels of predicted secondary structure across SARS-CoV-2 domains. Remarkably, we find that coding regions display the highest structural propensity in the genome, forming motifs that differ between the genomic and subgenomic contexts. Our approach provides an attractive strategy to rapidly screen for candidate structured regions based on base pairing potential and provides a readily interpretable roadmap to guide functional studies of RNA viruses and other pharmacologically relevant RNA transcripts.","output":"The global and local distribution of RNA structure throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since epidemiological arguments favouring self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic are widely recommended, the consequences of social isolation/loneliness of older people considered to be at higher risk for severe illness are neglected We identified and described medical, social, psychological, and religious issues, indirectly generated by the COVID-19 lockdown Mortality induced by SARS-CoV-2 and death from other \\"neglected\\" issues were put in balance Arguments for strict lockdown from most European countries are compared with a relaxed approach, as has been applied in Sweden Social isolation affects disproportionally the elderly, transforming it into a public health concern One witnesses openly ageist discourse, while painful decisions to prioritising ventilation for younger patients deepens the sense of hopelessness Fear has led to anxiety disorders and depression Various religious practices provide resources for coping with isolation/overcoming loneliness Higher levels of mortality/morbidity due to \\"COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19\\" polarisation oblige the healthcare community to find ways to provide proper care for its elders","output":"\\"Celebrating old age\\": an obsolete expression during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Early platforms treated minor dermatologic conditions with medications that historically lacked routine monitoring;they have since expanded their scope of practice. We aimed to characterize DTC companies providing dermatologic care, with analysis of the factors that enabled DTC growth, as well as the ethical and practical implications. Through a literature search and Google queries, we identified seven DTC dermatology companies employing variations of a model with three main components: a triage questionnaire, telehealth services (primarily asynchronous), and custom branded drug delivery. Rising healthcare costs, improved technology, and drug patent expirations have enabled DTC growth, with aggressive marketing fueling a growth in customer base. The rise of DTC companies prompts questions about patients acting as consumers in healthcare. While DTC offers greater autonomy for patients to receive care on their terms and convenience, the removal of gate-keepers could have unanticipated negative effects. For instance, DTC may make doctor-patient relationships transactional and raise financial conflicts of interests. Furthermore, there are uncertainties regarding quality of care;studies have reported poor adherence to guidelines, misdiagnosis and barriers to follow-up. DTC solutions bypass traditional healthcare systems, further fragmenting care and creating room for error.

Patients suffering from ME/CFS commonly experience persistent fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, orthostatic intolerance, fever and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recent evidence implicates gut microbiome dysbiosis in ME/CFS. However, most prior studies are limited by small sample size, differences in clinical criteria used to define cases, limited geographic sampling, reliance on bacterial culture or 16S rRNA gene sequencing, or insufficient consideration of confounding factors that may influence microbiome composition. In the present study, we evaluated the fecal microbiome in the largest prospective, case-control study to date (n=106 cases, n=91 healthy controls), involving subjects from geographically diverse communities across the United States. Results: Using shotgun metagenomics and qPCR and rigorous statistical analyses that controlled for important covariates, we identified decreased relative abundance and quantity of Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Eubacterium species and increased bacterial load in feces of subjects with ME/CFS. These bacterial taxa play an important role in the production of butyrate, a multifunctional bacterial metabolite that promotes human health by regulating energy metabolism, inflammation, and intestinal barrier function. Functional metagenomic and qPCR analyses were consistent with a deficient microbial capacity to produce butyrate along the acetyl-CoA pathway in ME/CFS. Metabolomic analyses of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) confirmed that fecal butyrate concentration was significantly reduced in ME/CFS. Further, we found that the degree of deficiency in butyrate-producing bacteria correlated with fatigue symptom severity among ME/CFS subjects. Finally, we provide evidence that IBS comorbidity is an important covariate to consider in studies investigating the microbiome of ME/CFS subjects, as differences in microbiota alpha diversity, some bacterial taxa, and propionate were uniquely associated with self-reported IBS diagnosis. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there is a core deficit in the butyrate-producing capacity of the gut microbiome in ME/CFS subjects compared to healthy controls. The relationships we observed among symptom severity and these gut microbiome disturbances may be suggestive of a pathomechanistic linkage, however, additional research is warranted to establish any causal relationship. These findings provide support for clinical trials that explore the utility of dietary, probiotic and prebiotic interventions to boost colonic butyrate production in ME/CFS.","output":"Deficient butyrate-producing capacity in the gut microbiome of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients is associated with fatigue symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presently coastal areas globally are becoming unviable, with people no longer able to maintain livelihoods and settlements due to, for example, increasing floods, storm surges, coastal erosion, and sea level rise, yet there exist significant policy obstacles and practical and regulatory challenges to community-led and community-wide responses.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Hospitalisation data (2000C2010) for all government-funded hospitals in Hong Kong. POPULATION: Hospitalisation data for the entire Hong Kong population (7.0 million in 2011). METHODS: A decomposition method was used to determine the effects on total hospitalisation days during the period 2000C2010 of the following three factors: (i) hospitalisation rate per person; (ii) the number of visits per patient; and (iii) the mean duration of stay per visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The decomposition method provides empirical measures of how the three factors contributed to the change in total hospitalisation days during the period 2000C2010 and identifies the most effective way to contain increases in hospitalisation days. RESULTS: The results of decomposition analysis show that the decrease in mean duration of stay per visit (reducing from 6.83 to 4.58 days) is the most important factor in the reduction in the total number of hospitalisation days, despite increases in total population size (from 6.7 to 7.0 million), the number of individual hospital admissions (from 583 000 to 664 000) and the number of episodes (from 1.2 to 1.4 million) from 2000 to 2010. Hospitalisation days per person decreased from 1.18 in 2000 to 0.93 in 2010. The decline in the mean duration of stay per visit contributed 200.6% to this reduction but was offset by ?51.1% due to a slight growth in the number of visits per patient and by ?49.4% as a result of changed hospitalisation rates per person.

Materials and Methods: The measurements were conducted during rest and after performing SMWT (Six Minute Walk Test) and SCT (Stair Climb Test) in 26 patients after ischemic stroke (IS) and 26 healthy individuals. Results: In the SMWT, the post-stroke group (SG) walked a shorter distance (p < 0.001), achieving lower mean gait velocity (p < 0.001) and lower maximum gait velocity (p = 0.002). In the SCT, SG achieved a lower mean gait velocity (p < 0.001) and lower maximum gait velocity (p < 0.001) when compared to the control group (CG). In SG, myocardial ischemia in ECG was noted in four patients after SMWT and in three patients following SCT. Both in SG and in CG the increase in SBP (systolic blood pressure) value measured after SMWT and SCT compared to at rest (p < 0.001) was observed. In SG, in the compared ratios rest to SMWT and SCT as well as SMWT to SCT, there was an increase in HR (heart rate) (p < 0.001).

The high number of reported deaths suggests that many patients were not treated promptly or effectively. However, many unexplained deaths were subsequently identified as cases, indicating a few undetected cases, resulting in a higher estimate of FR. Whether the true FR is exceedingly high and what factors determine the detection of cases remain unknown. Estimating the true number of total infected cases (i.e. including undetected cases) can allow an accurate estimation of FR and effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text] ). METHODS: We aimed at quantifying the time-varying FR and [Formula: see text] using the estimated true numbers of cases; and, exploring the relationship between the true case number and test and trace data. After adjusting for reporting delays, we developed a model to estimate the number of undetected cases using reported deaths that were and were not previously detected. The daily FR and [Formula: see text] were calculated using the true number of cases. Afterwards, a logistic regression model was used to assess the impact of daily testing and tracing data on the detection ratio of deaths. RESULTS: The estimated true daily case number at the peak of the outbreak on May 22 was 897, which was 24.3% higher than the reported number, but the difference became less than 4% on June 9 and afterwards. After taking account of undetected cases, our estimated mean FR (4.7%) was still high but the daily rate showed a large decrease from 6.5% on May 19 to 2.8% on June 6. [Formula: see text] reached a maximum value of 6.4 on May 11, compared to 6.0 estimated using the reported case number. The decreasing proportion of undetected cases was found to be associated with the increases in the ratio of the number of tests conducted to reported cases, and the proportion of cases that are contact traced before symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing testing capacity and contact tracing coverage without delays not only improve parameter estimation by reducing hidden cases but may also reduce fatality rates.

Due to the nature of the job, healthcare professionals are at high risk of infection and are facing social stigma as well. In such a scenarios, it has aggravated their mental health and they are applying various measures to cope with such adverse scenario. Therefore, this research is conducted with the objective to evaluate the psychological influence of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare professionals of Yemen and the coping strategies adopted thereof. Methods: A web-based, as well as face-to-face cross-sectional study, was carried out from July 2020 to December 2020 among healthcare professionals currently working in different provinces of Yemen using a standard questionnaire. The generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Brief-COPE scales were applied for evaluation of anxiety, depression, and the coping strategies among them. Results: A total of 197 healthcare professionals (N=197) participated in the study where the majority were male 68.5% (n=135) in gender and physicians 42.13% (n=83) by profession. The prevalence of both anxiety (6.845.67 for male and 7.374.44 for female) and depression (8.066.51 for male and 9.566.46 for female) were found of mild category among the respondents. A significant statistical difference was observed between physician versus nurse regarding anxiety and depression based on the working area (p=0.017). Trained professionals demonstrated less anxiety (6.295.33) and depression (7.906.78) as compared to untrained ones.

Patients admitted in ICU with an acute COVID event present with respiratory dysfunction and are more likely to have critical illness myopathy and neuropathy (CIMN). Physiotherapy services being integral part of non-pharmacological management of any ICU was implemented for patients with COVID 19; a novel viral disease. Objective: This retrospective study was undertaken to explore the physiotherapy practices that could be implemented in patients admitted with COVID 19 in the ICU and its effect on mobility and oxygen requirement as an outcome. Methodology: Following ethical permission of institute, the data was extracted from electronic data record sheet in which daily parameters for physiotherapy intervention were recorded. Data from a single ICU and step down unit (SDU) from 5th June to 5th July 2020 was analysed. Records of patients diagnosed with COVID 19 and admitted in ICU or SDU were studied. Those in the age group of 18 to 90 years, of either gender were included. Demographic characteristics, disease severity, oxygen requirement, mobility status, physiotherapy intervention were studied. Results: 278 record sheets (110 ICU and 168 SDU) were retrospectively analysed for demographics. 44.55% of patients improved with side lying position, 37.27% with prone position and 10.91% with quarter prone position. 4.55% of patient maintained oxygenation in propped up sitting. 2.73% could not be positioned. Chest physiotherapy techniques applied were deep breathing, ACBT, paced breathing and diaphragmatic breathing. Deep intercostal pressure on NIV along with vibrations was given to 12.72% of patients in the ICU. Group therapy sessions were conducted in SDU where 50.59% patients participated. ICU mobility score showed significant improvement on Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test status on day 7 in the ICU (z=-5.99, p=0.00) and SDU (z= 7.676, p=0.00) compared to day 1. Descriptive analysis showed a definitive reduction in oxygen support requirement. Conclusion: Most common form of physiotherapy interventions in patients with Covid 19 were therapeutic positioning, early mobilization and breathing exercises. Physiotherapy intervention appears promising in facilitating early patient ambulation and discharge.

Seasonality of monthly incidences was indicated by year-on-year intra-class correlations (ICCs). Between-region ICCs were used to describe seasonal synchrony of incidences between regions. RESULTS: We found evidence of seasonality in all three infectious diagnoses (p < 0.05). Seasonal synchrony among the three regions was highest for acute respiratory infection (between-region ICC 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87C0.94), followed by herpangina and HFMD (between-region ICC 0.85, 95% CI 0.80C0.90), and acute intestinal infection (between-region ICC 0.69, 95% CI 0.59C0.79).

A major component of such pain is reported as resting or spontaneous pain with no apparent external stimulus. Although experimental animal models can simulate the stimulus-evoked chronic pain that occurs after surgery, there have been no studies of spontaneous chronic pain in such models. Here the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used to reveal resting pain after experimental thoracotomy. Male Sprague Dawley rats received a thoracotomy with 1-hour rib retraction, resulting in evoked tactile hypersensitivity, previously shown to last for at least 9 weeks. Intraperitoneal injections of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) or gabapentin (40 mg/kg) gave equivalent 2- to 3-hour-long relief of tactile hypersensitivity when tested 12 to 14 days postoperatively. In separate experiments, single trial CPP was conducted 1 week before thoracotomy and then 12 days (gabapentin) or 14 days (morphine) after surgery, followed the next day by 1 conditioning session with morphine or gabapentin, both versus saline. The gabapentin-conditioned but not the morphine-conditioned rats showed a significant preference for the analgesia-paired chamber, despite the equivalent effect of the 2 agents in relieving tactile allodynia. These results show that experimental thoracotomy in rats causes spontaneous pain and that some analgesics, such as morphine, that reduce evoked pain do not also relieve resting pain, suggesting that pathophysiological mechanisms differ between these 2 aspects of long-term postoperative pain. Perspective: Spontaneous pain, a hallmark of chronic postoperative pain, is demonstrated here in a rat model of experimental postthoracotomy pain, further validating the use of this model for the development of analgesics to treat such symptoms. Although stimulus-evoked pain was sensitive to systemic morphine, spontaneous pain was not, suggesting different mechanistic underpinnings.","output":"Spontaneous Chronic Pain After Experimental Thoracotomy Revealed by Conditioned Place Preference: Morphine Differentiates Tactile Evoked Pain From Spontaneous Pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advancements of science, antibiotics have emerged as an amazing gift to the human and animal healthcare sectors for the treatment of bacterial infections and other diseases. However, the evolution of new bacterial strains, along with excessive use and reckless consumption of antibiotics have led to the unfolding of antibiotic resistances to an excessive level. Multidrug resistance is a potential threat worldwide, and is escalating at an extremely high rate. Information related to drug resistance, and its regulation and control are still very little. To interpret the onset of antibiotic resistances, investigation on molecular analysis of resistance genes, their distribution and mechanisms are urgently required.

This receptor serves as the entry point for SARS-coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs), including a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Limited availability of these receptors can thwart cellular entry of this virus. METHODS: We tested the effects of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on cellular expression of ACE2 at the protein and RNA levels in human small alveolar epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, we investigated whether combinations of ascorbic acid with other natural compounds can affect ACE2 expression. RESULTS: The results show that ascorbic acid itself has moderate but consistent lowering effects on ACE2 expression at the cellular, protein, and RNA levels. Some natural compounds were effective in lowering ACE2 cellular expression, with the highest inhibitory effects observed for baicalin (75%) and theaflavin (50%). Significantly, combinations of these and other test compounds with ascorbic acid further decreased ACE2 expression. The highest impact of ascorbate on ACE2 expression was noted when combined with theaflavin (decrease from 50% to 87%), zinc (decrease from 22% to 62%), and with 10-undecenoic acid (from 18% to 53%).

METHODS: COVID-19 vaccine willingness was surveyed in a subset of participants from the Tulsa 1000 Study, which is a longitudinal study of psychiatric treatment-seeking and healthy control participants. We identified 45 participants who completed a COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire and reported more than 10 lifetime cannabis uses.

Each sample was directly collected from the rectum of the animal and identified with the ear tag number. Animals were sampled three times, at 5, 15 and 22 weeks of age. After DNA extraction from stool samples, nested PCR was performed to amplify partial 18S-rDNA and 60 kDa glycoprotein genes of Cryptosporidium. The parasite was detected on all farms. One hundred out of 142 calves (70.4%) were found to be parasitized by Cryptosporidium. Amplified fragments were sequenced for Cryptosporidium species identification and revealed the presence of C. parvum (43.8%), C. ryanae (28.5%), and C. bovis (27%). One animal was infected with Cryptosporidium ubiquitum. The prevalence of these species was related to the age of the animal. C. parvum caused 86.7% of Cryptosporidium infections in 5-week-old calves but only 1.7% in 15-week-old animals. The analysis of the results showed that animals could be infected successively by C. parvum, C. ryanae, and C. bovis for the study period. C. parvum gp60 genotyping identifies 6 IIa subtypes of which 74.5% were represented by IIaA15G2R1.

This study aimed to examine the influence of the efficacy of the screening system of COVID-19 placed in the retail banks in India on customer satisfaction mediated by the brand image. The influence will be checked under the moderating effect of the perceived threat of COVID-19 and the perceived health risk of the customers. The data from 224 customers were collected who have visited banks in India since March 2020. The data were analysed through the partial least square method of structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3.2. The findings of the study suggested that the efficacy of the screening system of COVID-19 positively influences the brand image and customer satisfaction. The moderating role of the perceived health risk of the customers and perceived threat of COVID-19 has been confirmed between the screening system of COVID-19 and brand image. Further, brand image has strongly influenced customer satisfaction.

However, this fraction depends heavily on the sampling intensity and the various test criteria used in different jurisdictions, and many sources indicate that a large fraction of cases tend to go undetected. Methods: : Estimates of the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a population can be made by random sampling and pooling of RT-PCR tests. Here I use simulations to explore how experiment sample size and degrees of sample pooling impact precision of prevalence estimates and potential for minimizing the total number of tests required to get individual-level diagnostic results. Results: : Sample pooling can greatly reduce the total number of tests required for prevalence estimation. In low-prevalence populations, it is theoretically possible to pool hundreds of samples with only marginal loss of precision. Even when the true prevalence is as high as 10% it can be appropriate to pool up to 15 samples. Sample pooling can be particularly beneficial when the test has imperfect specificity by providing more accurate estimates of the prevalence than an equal number of individual-level tests.

In that way, predicting disease progression from mild towards moderate, severe and critical condition, would help not only to respond in a timely manner to prevent lethal results, but also to minimize the number of patients in hospitals where this is not necessary. METHODS: We present a methodology for the classification of patients into 4 distinct categories of the clinical condition of COVID-19 disease. Classification of patients is based on the values of blood biomarkers that were assessed by Gradient boosting regressor and which were selected as biomarkers that have the greatest influence in the classification of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: The results show that among several tested algorithms, XGBoost classifier achieved best results with an average accuracy of 94% and an average F1-score of 94.3%. We have also extracted 10 best features from blood analysis that are strongly associated with patient condition and based on those features we can predict the severity of the clinical condition. CONCLUSIONS: The main advantage of our system is that it is a decision tree-based algorithm which is easier to interpret, instead of the use of black box models, which are not appealing in medical practice.","output":"Artificial intelligence approach towards assessment of condition of COVID-19 patients - Identification of predictive biomarkers associated with severity of clinical condition and disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background C Although women account for up to half of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no specific data have been reported in this population Aims ?

We aimed to characterize recent COVID-19-related community practice noninvasive diagnostic imaging professional work declines. METHODS: Using imaging metadata from nine community radiology practices across the United States between January 2019 and May 2020, we mapped work relative value unit (wRVU)-weighted stand-alone noninvasive diagnostic imaging service codes to both modality and body region. Weekly 2020 versus 2019 wRVU changes were analyzed by modality, body region, and site of service. Practice share &#967;2 testing was performed. RESULTS: Aggregate weekly wRVUs ranged from a high of 120,450 (February 2020) to a low of 55,188 (April 2020). During that -52% wRVU nadir, outpatient declines were greatest (-66%). All practices followed similar aggregate trends in the distribution of wRVUs between each 2020 versus 2019 week (P = .96-.98). As a percentage of total all-practice wRVUs, declines in CT (20,046 of 63,992; 31%) and radiography and fluoroscopy (19,196; 30%) were greatest. By body region, declines in abdomen and pelvis (16,203; 25%) and breast (12,032; 19%) imaging were greatest. Mammography (-17%) and abdominal and pelvic CT (-14%) accounted for the largest shares of total all-practice wRVU reductions. Across modality-region groups, declines were far greatest for mammography (-92%). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial COVID-19-related diagnostic imaging work declines were similar across community practices and disproportionately impacted mammography.

In the current study, we first compared protection conferred by vaccination with rLS/ArkSe and rLS/ArkSe.GMCSF. Vaccinated chickens were challenged with virulent Ark, and protection was determined by clinical signs, viral load, and tracheal histomorphometry. Results showed that coexpression of GMCSF and the Se from rLS significantly reduced tracheal viral load and tracheal lesions compared with chickens vaccinated with rLS/ArkSe. In a second experiment, we evaluated enhancement of cross-protection of a Massachusetts (Mass) attenuated vaccine by priming or boosting with rLS/ArkSe.GMCSF. Vaccinated chickens were challenged with Ark, and protection was evaluated. Results show that priming or boosting with the recombinant virus significantly increased cross-protection conferred by Mass against Ark virulent challenge. Greater reductions of viral loads in both trachea and lachrymal fluids were observed in chickens primed with rLS/ArkSe.GMCSF and boosted with Mass. Consistently, Ark Se antibody levels measured with recombinant Ark Se protein-coated ELISA plates 14 days after boost were significantly higher in these chickens. Unexpectedly, the inverse vaccination scheme, that is, priming with Mass and boosting with the recombinant vaccine, proved somewhat less effective. We concluded that a prime and boost strategy by using rLS/ArkSe.GMCSF and the worldwide ubiquitous Mass attenuated vaccine provides enhanced cross-protection. Thus, rLS/GMCSF coexpressing the Se of regionally relevant IBV serotypes could be used in combination with live Mass to protect against regionally circulating IBV variant strains.","output":"Enhanced Protection by Recombinant Newcastle Disease Virus Expressing Infectious Bronchitis Virus Spike Ectodomain and Chicken Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 shares nearly 80% of its&#039;genomic sequence with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both viruses known to cause respiratory symptoms and liver impairment The emergence of pediatric cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIM-TS) has raised concerns over the issue of hepatic damage and liver enzyme elevation in the critically ill pediatric population with COVID-19 Some retrospective cohorts and case series have shown various degrees of ALT/AST elevation in SARS-CoV-2 infections A limited number of liver histopathological studies are available that show focal hepatic periportal necrosis This liver damage was associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and pro-calcitonin Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms include an uncontrolled exacerbated inflammatory response, drug-induced liver injury, direct viral infection and damage to cholangiocytes, hypoxic-ischemic lesions, and micro-thrombosis in the liver Based on the physiopathological characteristics described, our group proposes a clinical protocol for the surveillance, evaluation, management, and follow-up of critically ill pediatric COVID-19 patients with liver damage","output":"COVID-19 and Liver Damage: Narrative Review and Proposed Clinical Protocol for Critically ill Pediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A spreadsheet model of the projectile motion, evaporation and dispersion of respiratory droplets is presented to introduce students to mathematical modeling, co","output":"Spreadsheet Model of COVID-19 Transmission: Evaporation and Dispersion of Respiratory Droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe crisis caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of billions of people across the world.

However, there is scarce knowledge about its RNA-related roles in cell biology. Furthermore, its RNA-binding domain has not been characterized. RESULTS: Here, we reveal that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain, which we postulate to be a novel RNA-binding domain. Using CLIP-seq and SILAC-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, we uncover TRIM25s endogenous RNA targets and protein binding partners. We demonstrate that TRIM25 controls the levels of Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP). Finally, we show that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is important for its ubiquitin ligase activity towards itself (autoubiquitination) and its physiologically relevant target ZAP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that many other proteins with the PRY/SPRY domain could have yet uncharacterized RNA-binding potential.

Methods: The current study uses national data of publicly funded admissions to substance abuse treatment to assess the extent to which OAT is used for cases referred to treatment by the criminal justice system. We explore the relationship between demographics, substance use severity, and access to treatment and OAT receipt.

The advantages of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), gamification, and telerehabilitation have been demonstrated in several medical fields. In this review, we searched the literature for studies using these technologies for orthopedic rehabilitation and analyzed studies' quality, type and field of rehabilitation, patients' characteristics, and outcomes to describe the state of the art of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation for orthopedic rehabilitation. METHODS A comprehensive search on PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Embase databases was conducted. This review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies published between 2015 and 2020 about remote virtual rehabilitations for orthopedic patients were selected. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Cochrane Risk-of-Bias assessment tool were used for quality assessment. RESULTS 24 studies (9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 non-randomized studies) and 2472 patients were included. Studies mainly concern telerehabilitation (56%), and to a lesser extent VR (28%), AR (28%), and gamification (16%). Remote virtual technologies were used following knee and hip arthroplasty. The majority of included patients were between 40 and 60 years old and had a university degree. Remote virtual rehabilitation was not inferior to face-to-face therapy, and physical improvements were demonstrated by increased clinical scores. Orthopedic virtual remote rehabilitation decreased costs related to transports, hospitalizations, and readmissions. CONCLUSION The heterogeneity of included studies prevented a meta-analysis of their results. Age and social context influence adaptability to technology, and this can modify compliance to treatment and outcomes. A good relationship between patient and physiotherapist is essential for treatment compliance and new technologies are useful to maintain clinical interactions remotely. Remote virtual technologies allow the delivery of high-quality care at reduced costs. This is a necessity given the growing demand for orthopedic rehabilitation and increasing costs related to it. Future studies need to develop specific and objective methods to evaluate the clinical quality of new technologies and definitively demonstrate advantages of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation compared to face-to face orthopedic rehabilitation.","output":"Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Gamification, and Telerehabilitation: Psychological Impact on Orthopedic Patients' Rehabilitation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Engaging with nature can profoundly impact psychological and physiological health of persons across the lifespan.

The enzyme that carries out the process of transcription of mRNAs is RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is a multi-subunit enzyme in eukaryotes. This protein biopolymer starts the transcription from specific sites and is positioned by transcription factors, which form a preinitiation complex (PIC) on gene promoters. To recognize and position the RNAPII and the transcription factors on the gene promoters are needed specific DNA sequences in the gene promoters, which are named promoter elements. Those gene promoter elements can vary and therefore several kinds of promoters exist, however, it appears that all promoters can use a similar pathway for PIC formation. Those pathways are discussed in this review.

We report the development of a patient-centred mobile-device solution to support efficient management of the facility, triage of patients and rapid delivery of test results. Methods: The UHC-Corona Web Tool (CWT) was developed as a web-based application useable on each patient's smartphone. It provides, among others, a self-reported medical history including type and duration of symptoms and potential risk contacts and links all retrieved information to the digital patient chart via a QR code. It provides scheduling of outpatient appointments and automated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 test results. Results: The UHC-CWT was launched on April 9 th , 2020. It was used by 28652 patients until August 31 st ,2020. Of those, 15245 (53,2%) consulted the CRRI, representing 43,1% of all CRRI patients during the observed period.There were 8304 (29,0%) specifications concerning travel history and 17145 (59,8%) indications of 1 symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most frequently indicated symptoms were sore throat (60,0%), headache (50,7%), common cold (45,1%) and cough (42,6%) while 11057 (40,2%) patients did not report any symptoms. After implementation of the UHC-CWT, the number of patient contacts per physician rose from 38 to 98,7 per day.

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. METHODS: In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. RESULTS: The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.","output":"COVID-19 identification in chest X-ray images on flat and hierarchical classification scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study of coronavirus OC43 infections has been limited because of the lack of sensitive cell culture systems and serologic assays. To improve this circumstance, we developed an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect serum antibody to OC43. Antigen (100 ng) prepared by polyethylene glycol precipitation provided optimal results without a postcoat procedure. Evaluation of intraplate variation indicated that a > or = 2.5-fold increase in serum titer was significant. Sixteen of 18 (89%) paired serum samples with previously identified, reproducible increases in the level of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody to OC43 also showed significant increases as detected by EIA. Specificity for the EIA was established with paired sera obtained from persons given influenza immunizations or experiencing a respiratory infection. No rise in antibody titers occurred among 33 persons with documented coronavirus 229E infection. EIA was then performed on each of 419 paired serum samples from ambulatory chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and healthy older adults, from asthmatic adults presenting for emergency room treatment, and from persons hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms. Twenty-three antibody rises to OC43 were detected; only nine of these were detected by the HAI test, and the HAI test did not detect any increases in antibody titers that were not detected by EIA.

To determine the similarities and differences in the cytokine and chemokine responses in these two infections, we compared responses in patients with varying severity of COVID-19 and acute dengue at different time points of illness.During early disease, patients who proceeded to develop COVID-19 severe pneumonia (SP) and DHF had significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10 and MIP3 than those who developed mild illness. The lowest levels of IFN in early illness were seen in those who succumbed to their illness due to COVID-19. Levels of serum IL-10 (p=0.0001), IL-6 (p=0.002), MIP-3 (p=0.02) and CD40-L levels (p=0.002) significantly increased from 5-9 day of illness to 10-21 day of illness in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, but not in those with mild illness. In contrast, these cytokine/chemokine levels remained unchanged in those with DHF or dengue fever (DF) during febrile and critical phases. Although IL-10 levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with SP, patients with DHF had 25-fold higher levels, whereas IL-6 levels were 11-fold higher in those with COVID-19 SP. IL-10 and other cytokines were evaluated in a larger cohort of patients during early illness ( 4 days) who proceeded to develop DF (n=71) or DHF (n=64). Of the cytokines evaluated, IL-10 was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in those who went on to develop DHF compared to DF. Low IFN response to the SARS-CoV2 and high levels of immunosuppressive IL-10 in both COVID-19 and dengue during early illness are indicators of an altered antiviral response potentially contributing to disease severity.","output":"Similarities and differences between the cytokine storms in acute dengue and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS We aimed to determine the effectiveness of surveillance using testing for SARS-CoV-2 to identify an outbreak arising from a single case of border control failure in a country that has eliminated community transmission of COVID-19: New Zealand. METHODS A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was seeded with New Zealand population data and relevant parameters sourced from the New Zealand and international literature. RESULTS For what we regard as the most plausible scenario with an effective reproduction number of 2.0, the results suggest that 95% of outbreaks from a single imported case would be detected in the period up to day 36 after introduction. At the time point of detection, there would be a median number of five infected cases in the community (95% range: 1-29). To achieve this level of detection, an ongoing programme of 5,580 tests per day (1,120 tests per million people per day) for the New Zealand population would be required. The vast majority of this testing (96%) would be of symptomatic cases in primary care settings and the rest in hospitals. CONCLUSIONS This model-based analysis suggests that a surveillance system with a very high level of routine testing is probably required to detect an emerging or re-emerging SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within five weeks of a border control failure in a nation that had previously eliminated COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are plausible strategies to enhance testing yield and cost-effectiveness and potential supplementary surveillance systems such as the testing of town/city sewerage systems for the pandemic virus.","output":"Detecting the re-emergent COVID-19 pandemic after elimination: modelling study of combined primary care and hospital surveillance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is minimal information on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in developing countries regarding renal transplant recipients (RTRs).

We studied 15 patients, of which 13 were treated at our hospital and two were treated in OPD. The median age of transplant recipients was 45 (Interquartile range [IQR]: 26C62) years, the majority being males, and recipients presented at a median of 4 (IQR: 0.3C11) years after transplant. The most common comorbidities included hypertension in 14 (94%) and diabetes 3 (20%) patients. The presenting symptoms at presentation were cough (80%), headache (52%), fever (46%), and breathlessness (26%). Clinical severity as per computerized tomography (CT) severity score ranged from mild (20%), moderate (53%), and severe (27%). Strategies to modify immunosuppressants included discontinuation of antimetabolites without changes in calcineurin inhibitors and steroids (100%).

For the first time for an ionic UV filter, ab initio potential energy surfaces are presented to provide new insight into how the photofragment identity maps the relaxation pathways.

One mAb, m301, broadly neutralized the currently circulating ZIKV strains and showed a synergistic effect with another mAb, m302, in neutralizing ZIKV in vitro and in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. Interestingly, epitope mapping and competitive binding studies suggest that m301 and m302 bind adjacent regions of the DIII CCC loop, which represents a recently identified cryptic epitope that is intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation.

RESULTS: In this study, 64.1% of participants were categorized as psychologically fatigued and 35.9% as normal. There was a significant difference between fatigued and normal participants with respect to age, educational level, occupational status, place of residence and number of family members (p < .001). Other differences related to knowledge of COVID-19 were symptoms, treatment, ways of spreading (p < .001), prevention by avoiding crowded places (p = .008) and isolation (p = .002). For attitudinal items, normal participants generally showed more positive attitudes than the fatigued in believing that COVID-19 will finally be controlled, satisfaction with preventive measures taken by the authorities, reporting suspected cases with symptoms and trusting that Turkey can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic (p < .001).

Effective management of pain has an impact on clinical course and often depends on achieving an acceptable balance between opioid efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Common opioid-related adverse events such as nausea and vomiting are associated with an overall lower achievement of effective pain management and patient satisfaction. However, in practice, clinicians employ various strategies to maximize efficacy, minimize these adverse effects, and ensure the careful, judicious, and evidence-based use of opioids for patients who require them. Typical strategies for management and minimization of these types of adverse events include dose reduction, dose titration, opioid rotation, prescription for an antiemetic, and recommending the patient take opioids with food. Overall, the most straightforward approach that clinicians tend to employ that does not require additional visits or adjustment of prescriptions, is to recommend patients take opioids with food. However, given the current climate with opioids, it is critical and imperative that decisions for use of opioids be grounded in a solid and thorough evidence-base. In fact, several opioids are recommended to be taken explicitly with or without food because of interactions with abuse-deterrent technologies that can cause increased adverse events or inadequate analgesia. Therefore, we sought to review, synthesize, and summarize the literature for randomized, controlled trials and other studies to support the hypothesis that taking opioids with food reduces opioid-related events such as nausea and vomiting. Based on the current evidence we surveyed, the recommendation to take opioids with food does not appear to consistently and unequivocally reduce nausea and vomiting and, in many cases, increases the frequency of these adverse events in the studies we examined.","output":"The effects of food on opioid-induced nausea and vomiting and pharmacological parameters: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Physical Chemistry and Chemical Physics Section (PCCP Section) is one of the youngest among the sections of the International Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS)-the year 2021 will only mark three years since its inception [...].","output":"The Physical Chemistry and Chemical Physics (PCCP) Section of the International Journal of Molecular Sciences in Its Publications: The First 300 Thematic Articles in the First 3 Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by surprise and given the scale at which it is impacting individuals, families, communities, and countries globally, the recognition of social workers as frontline actors in response to this pandemic cannot be over-emphasized.

Findings will be used to inform explorative science and larger trials, aiming to develop urgently needed neuroprotective and neurorestorative interventions for NE applicable for use in diverse settings. DISCUSSION: The primary aims of the study are to assess the feasibility of establishing a facility-based cohort of children with NE in Uganda, to enhance our understanding of NE in a low-resource sub-Saharan African setting and provide infrastructure to conduct high-quality research on neuroprotective/ neurorestorative strategies to reduce death and disability from NE. Specific objectives are to establish a NE cohort, in order to 1) investigate the clinical course, aetiology, nature and timing of perinatal brain injury; 2) describe electrographic activity and quantify seizure burden and the relationship with adverse outcomes, and; 3) develop capacity for neonatal brain MRI/S and examine associations with early neurodevelopmental outcomes.","output":"Protocol for the Birth Asphyxia in African Newborns (Baby BRAiN) Study: a Neonatal Encephalopathy Feasibility Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) is dedicated to improving the quality of gastrointestinal endoscopy, including through educational activities such as live endoscopy events (LEEs).

Field research in Antarctica always requires months of planning. Everyone has to go through a rigorous medical evaluation and researchers have to package up their equipment and ship it to designated ports for transport arranged by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The logistics are so complicated that Schofield says he is typically home from the field no more than 3 weeks before it is time to start planning the next season. But in March 2020, with the virus raging, Antarctic researchers knew they were in for more uncertainty and surprises than usual. Program officers at the NSF, which funds most US Antarctic research, were working with international partners to assess fieldwork prospects on the continent during the pandemic. Eventually, they created a three tiered system, says Karla Heidelberg, program director for the NSF's Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems Program in the Office of Polar Programs. While recognizing that sending no one would jeopardize the infrastructure at the various stations, she says that the NSF determined early on that the 2020 to 2021 summer season would be greatly scaled back. The LTER sites and other American research projects in Antarctica look at everything from penguins and seals to phytoplankton and nematodes to atmospheric conditions and glaciers. Polar regions are responding faster than other latitudes to global warming, so they are a focus of climate change research across many disciplines. Instead of close to 10 researchers, this year, just three students tagged seals and collected biometric data that will be used to estimate breeding and survival rates. The McMurdo LTER project did not get to send a single researcher. Despite the frustration and the uncertainty, researchers report that the overall scientific integrity of most studies remains intact, and the impacts are not devastating. Funding agencies and scientists expect they will again have delays and last-minute decisions for the 2021 to 2022 Antarctic summer field season.

Effective methods for inactivating the SARS\\\\CoV in protein solutions are described in this report. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Heat, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, octanoic acid, and solvent/detergent (S/D) methods were tested individually for their ability to inactivate SARS\\\\CoV in protein solutions appropriately mimicking blood\\\\derived products. Treated samples were tested for inactivation in a tissue culture growth assay. RESULTS: Viral inactivation by heat treatment at 60C required 15 to 30 minutes to inactivate the SARS\\\\CoV. UVC efficiently inactivated SARS\\\\CoV in 40 minutes, whereas UVA required the addition of psoralen to enhance inactivation of the virus. The presence of bovine serum albumin limited the ability of UVC and UVA to inactivate SARS\\\\CoV and octanoic acid treatment does not reduce the infectivity of SARS\\\\CoVCspiked protein solutions.

Accelerated deforestation, urbanization, and anthropization hastily lead to overpopulation of the bats in urban areas allowing easy interaction with other animals, expansion, and emergence of new zoonotic disease outbreaks potentially harmful to humans. Therefore, getting new insights in the microbiome of bat guano from different places represents an imperative for the future. Furthermore, the use of novel high-throughput sequencing technologies allows better insight in guano microbiome and potentially indicated that some species could be typical guano-dwelling members. Bats are well known as a natural reservoir of many zoonotic viruses such as Ebola, Nipah, Marburg, lyssaviruses, rabies, henipaviruses, and many coronaviruses which caused a high number of outbreaks including ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, many bacterial and fungal pathogens were identified as common guano residents. Thus, the presence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria as environmental reservoirs of extended spectrum ?-lactamases and carbapenemase-producing strains has been confirmed. Bat guano is the most suitable substrate for fungal reproduction and dissemination, including pathogenic yeasts and keratinophilic and dimorphic human pathogenic fungi known as notorious causative agents of severe endemic mycoses like histoplasmosis and fatal cryptococcosis, especially deadly in immunocompromised individuals.

Little is known about how emergency department (ED) clinicians differ in their attitudes toward risk taking. METHODS: We conducted a cross\\\\sectional survey of practicing ED clinicians (physicians and advanced practice clinicians [APCs]) in Massachusetts using the following 4 existing validated scales: the Risk\\\\Taking Scale (RTS), Stress from Uncertainty Scale (SUS), the Fear of Malpractice Scale (FMS), and the Need for (Cognitive) Closure Scale (NCC). We used Cronbach's  to assess the reliability of each scale and performed multivariable linear regressions to analyze the association between the score for each scale and clinician characteristics. RESULTS: Of 1458 ED clinicians recruited for participation, 1116 (76.5%) responded from 93% of acute care hospitals in Massachusetts. Each of the 4 scales demonstrated high internal consistency reliability with Cronbach's s ranging from 0.76 to 0.92. The 4 scales also were moderately correlated with one another (0.08 to 0.54; all P < 0.05). The multivariable results demonstrated differences between physicians and APCs, with physicians showing a greater tolerance for risk or uncertainty (NCC difference, ?3.58 [95% confidence interval, CI, ?5.26 to ?1.90]; SUS difference, ?3.14 [95% CI: ?4.99 to ?1.29]) and a higher concern about malpractice (FMS difference, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.11C2.17]). Differences were also observed based on clinician age (a proxy for years of experience), with greater age associated with greater tolerance of risk or uncertainty (age older than 50 years compared with age 35 years and younger; NCC difference, ?2.84 [95% CI, ?4.69 to ?1.00]; SUS difference, ?4.71 [95% CI, ?6,74 to ?2.68]) and less concern about malpractice (FMS difference, ?3.19 [95% CI, ?4.31 to ?2.06]). There were no appreciable differences based on sex, and there were no consistent associations between scale scores and the practice and payment characteristics assessed.

Relevant studies were identified through Medline, Cinahl, and PubMed databases. A random-effects model was used in meta-analyses with a 95% confidence interval. Eighty-two studies were included in the systematic review and sixty-seven studies for the meta-analysis. The pooled incidence proportion of COVID-19 among PLHIV was 0.9% (95% CI 0.6%, 1.1%) based on the data from seven cohort studies. Overall, 28.4% were hospitalised, of whom, 2.5% was severe-critical cases and 3.5% needed intensive care. The overall mortality rate was 5.3%.

Attempts to target the kidney Renin Angiotensin System using native ACE2 to treat kidney disease are hampered by its large molecular size, 100 kDa, which precludes its glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular uptake. Here, we show that both urine and kidney lysates are capable of digesting native ACE2 into shorter proteins of ~60C75 kDa and then demonstrate that they are enzymatically very active. We then truncated the native ACE2 by design from the C-terminus to generate two short recombinant (r)ACE2 variants (1-605 and 1-619AA). These two truncates have a molecular size of ~70 kDa, as expected from the amino acid sequence and as shown by Western blot. ACE2 enzyme activity, measured using a specific substrate, was higher than that of the native rACE2 (1-740 AA). When infused to mice with genetic ACE2 deficiency, a single i.v. injection of 1-619 resulted in detectable ACE2 activity in urine, whereas infusion of the native ACE2 did not. Moreover, ACE2 activity was recovered in harvested kidneys from ACE2-deficient mice infused with 1-619, but not in controls (23.1  4.3 RFU/g creatinine/h and 1.96  0.73 RFU/g protein/hr, respectively).

We conclude that our novel short recombinant ACE2 variants undergo glomerular filtration, which is associated with kidney uptake of enzymatically active proteins that can enhance the formation of Ang (1C7) from Ang II.

MethodsDemand for intermediate care was projected using an epidemiological model (for COVID-19 demand) and regressing upon public mobility (for non-COVID-19 demand). These were inputted to a computer simulation model of patient flow from acute discharge readiness to bedded and home-based Discharge to Assess (D2A) intermediate care services. Cost-optimal capacity was defined as that which yielded the lowest total cost of intermediate care provision and corresponding acute discharge delays. ResultsIncreased intermediate care capacity is likely to bring about lower system-level costs, with the additional D2A investment more than offset by substantial reductions in costly acute discharge delays (leading also to improved patient outcome and experience). Results suggest that completely eliminating acute bed blocking is unlikely economical (requiring large amounts of downstream capacity), and that health systems should instead target an appropriate tolerance based upon the specific characteristics of the pathway.

The objective of this study was to determine the potential of thin-section computed tomography (CT) in differentiating bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thin-section CT studies were prospectively examined in hospitalized CAP patients within 2 days of admission, followed by retrospective assessment by two pulmonary radiologists. Thin-section CT findings on the pneumonias caused by each pathogen were examined, and two types of pneumonias were compared. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced. RESULTS: Among 183 CAP episodes (181 patients, 125 men and 56 women, mean age  S.D.: 61.1  19.7) examined by thin-section CT, the etiologies of 125 were confirmed (94 bacterial pneumonia and 31 non-bacterial pneumonia). Centrilobular nodules were specific for non-bacterial pneumonia and airspace nodules were specific for bacterial pneumonia (specificities of 89% and 94%, respectively) when located in the outer lung areas. When centrilobular nodules were the principal finding, they were specific but lacked sensitivity for non-bacterial pneumonia (specificity 98% and sensitivity 23%). To distinguish the two types of pneumonias, centrilobular nodules, airspace nodules and lobular shadows were found to be important by multivariate analyses. ROC curve analysis discriminated bacterial pneumonia from non-bacterial pneumonia among patients without underlying lung diseases, yielding an optimal point with sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 79%, respectively, but was less effective when all patients were analyzed together (70% and 84%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Thin-section CT examination was applied for the differentiation of bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonias. Though showing some potential, this examination at the present time would not be applicable for patients with underlying lung diseases, severe conditions of pneumonia, or immunocompromised conditions.","output":"Differentiation of bacterial and non-bacterial community-acquired pneumonia by thin-section computed tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic.

Generalized restriction of movement, together with unprecedented pressure on Health System, disrupted routine care for non-COVID-19 patients. Telemedicine has been promoted to reduce the risk of infections and to offer medical assistance to the restricted population. This paper is aimed to evaluate the impact of tele-consulting technology in a single bariatric center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our outpatient clinic reorganized the service from on-site to long-distance video consultations. All patients received a satisfaction questionnaire. The main goals were to evaluate patient compliance and to assess patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the 33 booked patients who were offered a teleconsultation, 19 (57.6%) participated in the video-call. No significant differences were found between participants and non-participants in terms of age and gender ratio. Urban area residents were 57.9% of the participants versus 42.8% of the non-participants group. Of the participants, 52.6% completed the survey reporting levels of satisfaction ranging from high to very high. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has been advocated as a useful tool to relieve pressure on the overwhelmed Health Systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, e-health technologies are not yet widely adopted. Our initial experience, also compared with national data relating to the digital divide, suggests that the absence of basic computer skills and the lack of confidence with video-call systems may be patient-specific barriers for the implementation of telemedicine. In this context, telemedicine implementation can run up against various patient-related barriers, and several challenges remain for e-health to be integrated into outpatient practice.","output":"Telemedicine Implementation on a Bariatric Outpatient Clinic During COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: an Unexpected Hill-Start"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Hyper immunoglobulin M (HIGM) syndromes are a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by deficiencies in immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) Patients with HIGM are predisposed to infectious, autoimmune, inflammatory, and malignant complications We describe a case of a 21-year-old male with HIGM presenting with fever and severe oral ulcers Case Description: A 21-year-old male with HIGM due to a CD40L mutation on immunoglobulin therapy was admitted for 4-week history of painful erosive oral lesions, sore throat, and fever He had deep ulcers on his hard palate, tonsils, and tongue that worsened despite treatment with valacyclovir and azithromycin as an outpatient Neutrophil counts were normal Blood and respiratory cultures were negative;one out of two throat fungal cultures showed Candida albicans Biopsy of the ulcers was negative for fungal elements and HSV COVID-19 PCR was negative, but COVID-19 IgM to the receptor-binding domain was positive (1:80) IgG was negative, which was expected with HIGM The patient was treated with acyclovir, fluconazole, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole while undergoing infectious work-up He continued to have fevers with no improvement in stomatitis After adding prednisone, his ulcers and fever quickly resolved Discussion: This remains an unclear case of chronic fevers and severe oral ulcers in a patient with HIGM Candida albicans was unlikely to be the cause Surprisingly, COVID-19 IgM was positive, suggesting that an infection had occurred Mucosal involvement has been increasingly reported with COVID-19, and lesions may be more severe in patients with primary immunodeficiency Steroids may be an effective therapy once other infections are excluded [Formula presented]","output":"Oral Lesions in a Patient with Hyper Immunoglobulin M: Differential Diagnosis and Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case reports in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic and took lives of > 8,35,000 people globally. This single-stranded RNA virus uses Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry into the host cell. Overexpression of ACE2 is mainly observed in hypertensive, diabetic and heart patients that make them prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mitigations strategies were opted globally by the governments to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the implementation of social distancing norms, wearing the facemasks, and spreading awareness using digital platforms. The lack of an approved drug treatment regimen, and non-availability of a vaccine, collectively posed a challenge for mankind to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this scenario, repurposing of existing drugs and old treatment options like convalescent plasma therapy can be one of the potential alternatives to treat the disease. The drug repurposing provides a selection of drugs based on the scientific rationale and with a shorter cycle of clinical trials, while plasma isolated from COVID-19 recovered patients can be a good source of neutralizing antibody to provide passive immunity. In this review, we provide in-depth analysis on these two approaches currently opted all around the world to treat COVID-19 patients. For this, we used Boolean Operators such as AND, OR & NOT to search relevant research articles/reviews from the PUBMED for the repurposed drugs and the convalescent plasma in the COVID-19 treatment. The repurposed drugs like Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Tenofovir, Remdesivir, Ribavirin, Darunavir, Oseltamivir, Arbidol (Umifenovir), Favipiravir, Anakinra, and Baricitinib are already being used in clinical trials to treat the COVID-19 patients.

The patients were randomized to a SC (n = 99) or a CC (n = 90) and were then followed for 2 years. All catheter placements were performed by two designated experienced nephrologists who used a standardized institutional placement protocol. The primary study outcomes were catheter-related complications and catheter survival at 1 and 2 years. ? RESULTS We observed no significant differences in clinical and demographic characteristics between the groups at baseline. The overall incidence of catheter dysfunction was higher in the CC group than in the SC group (17.8% vs 7.1%, p = 0.03), and most of the events occurred 4 weeks or more after the catheters were implanted. Catheter tip migration and omental wrapping were the most common causes of catheter dysfunction. Surgical catheter rescue was more common in patients with CCs than in patients with SCs (9 vs 3 patients respectively, p = 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other catheter-related complications, including dialysate leaks, hernias, and PD-related infections (peritonitis, exit-site, and tunnel infections).

Comorbidities render them vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Although preventative and mitigation strategies are recommended, the effect of these are unknown. A period of potential-high-infectivity results if a health-care-worker (HCWs) or a patient becomes infected. Aim: We describe and analyze early, universal SARS-CoV-2 real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, biomarker monitoring and SARS-CoV-2 preventative strategies, in a single dialysis center, after a positive patient was identified. Methodology: The setting was a single outpatient dialysis center in Johannesburg, South Africa which had already implemented preventative strategies. We describe the management of 57 patients and 11 HCWs, after one of the patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All individuals were subjected to RT-PCR tests and biomarkers (Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio, C-reactive protein, and D-Dimer) within 72 h (initial-tests). Individuals with initial negative RT-PCR and abnormal biomarkers (one or more) were subjected to repeat RT-PCR and biomarkers (retest subgroup) during the second week. Additional stringent measures (awareness of viral transmission, dialysis distancing and screening) were implemented during the period of potential high infectivity. The patient retest subgroup also underwent clustered dialysis until retest results became available. Results: A second positive-patient was identified as a result of early universal RT-PCR tests. In the two positive-patients, biomarker improvement coincided with RT-PCR negative tests. We identified 13 individuals for retesting. None of these retested individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and there was no deterioration in median biomarker values between initial and retests. Collectively, none of the negative individuals developed COVID-19 symptoms during the period potential high infectivity. Conclusion: A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may necessitate additional proactive steps to counteract spread of infection. This includes early universal RT-PCR testing and creating further awareness of the risk of transmission and modifying preventative strategies.

Methods: We use daily COVID-19 reports from Chicago and NYC from 01-Mar2020 to 28- Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severity levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to be time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios, where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021. To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented whenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset threshold. Results: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable accuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality, hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread was under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccination was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimated model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention measures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its potential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in the hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which cases, hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccination beginning strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in each city.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination Delay: A Modelling Study for Chicago and NYC Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current epidemic of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) calls for the development of inhibitors of viral replication.

We identified a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals with characteristics of lysosomotropic agents, meaning that they are lipophilic weak bases capable of penetrating into cells.

These antibodies are specific for numerous viral protein targets, and six of them are able to effectively neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro, including one with a neutralizing titre of 0.075 nM. A phylogenetic analysis of the heavy and light chain sequences reveals that the mAbs share considerable homology. The majority of the heavy chains belong to a single Ig germline V-gene family, while considerably more sequence variation is evident in the light chain sequences. These analyses demonstrate that neutralization ability can be correlated with specific murine V(H)-gene alleles.

Add-on CM was associated with a significant mortality reduction of 58% (HR=0.42, 95%CI: 0.23 to 0.77, p=0.005) and 66% (HR=0.34, 95%CI: 0.15 to 0.76, p=0.009) among all and severe/critical COVID-19 cases with dose-dependent response, after inversely weighted with propensity score calculated by age, gender, history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and disease severity. The result was robust in various stratified, weighted, matched, adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Severe/critical patients received add-on CM had a trend of stabilized D-dimer level after 3-7 days of admission compared to baseline.Interpretation: Add-on semi-individualized CM was associated with reduced mortality demonstrating dose-dependent response, especially among severe/critical COVID-19 patients.

Protecting health is a proper purpose, particularly as minimising the pandemic ameliorates the human rights violations that stem from the COVID-19 response, enables individuals to return to their daily lives and enhances economic activity.

We sought to assess the risk of adverse clinical outcomes among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic period and compare the risks with those undergoing CABG before the pandemic in the year 2019. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the TriNetX Research Network database was performed. Patients undergoing CABG between January 20, 2019, and September 15, 2019, contributed to the 2019 cohort, and those undergoing CABG between January 20, 2020, and September 15, 2020, contributed to the 2020 cohort. Propensity-score matching was performed, and the odds of mortality, acute kidney injury, stroke, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mechanical ventilation occurring by 30 days were evaluated. Results: The number of patients undergoing CABG in 2020 declined by 35.5% from 5534 patients in 2019 to 3569 patients in 2020. After propensity-score matching, 3569 patient pairs were identified in the 2019 and the 2020 cohorts. Compared with those undergoing CABG in 2019, the odds of mortality by 30 days were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.33; P = .80) in those undergoing CABG in 2020. The odds for stroke (odds ratio [OR], 1.201; 95% CI, 0.96-1.39), acute kidney injury (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-1.08), acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.60-2.42), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.94-1.30) were similar between the 2 cohorts. Conclusions: The number of patients undergoing CABG in 2020 has substantially declined compared with 2019. Similar odds of adverse clinical outcomes were seen among patients undergoing CABG in the setting of COVID-19 compared with those in 2019.","output":"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery outcomes in the United States: Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, colleges and universities transitioned in-person instruction to a new modality we refer to as 'emergency remote teaching' (ERT).

METHODS: We performed a multicentre cohort study among hospitalized (>24 hours) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from 22 February to 3 April 2020, at 11 Italian hospitals. Patients were divided into derivation and validation cohorts according to random sorting of hospitals. SRF was assessed from admission to hospital discharge and was defined as: Spo2 <93% with 100% Fio2, respiratory rate >30 breaths/min or respiratory distress. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify predictors of SRF, ?-coefficients were used to develop a risk score. Trial Registration NCT04316949. RESULTS: We analysed 1113 patients (644 derivation, 469 validation cohort). Mean (SD) age was 65.7 (15) years, 704 (63.3%) were male. SRF occurred in 189/644 (29%) and 187/469 (40%) patients in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. At multivariate analysis, risk factors for SRF in the derivation cohort assessed at hospitalization were age &#8805;70 years (OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.66-4.50), obesity (OR 4.62; 95% CI 2.78-7.70), body temperature &#8805;38C (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.30-2.29), respiratory rate &#8805;22 breaths/min (OR 3.75; 95% CI 2.01-7.01), lymphocytes &#8804;900 cells/mm3 (OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.60-4.51), creatinine &#8805;1 mg/dL (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.59-3.56), C-reactive protein &#8805;10 mg/dL (OR 5.91; 95% CI 4.88-7.17) and lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;350 IU/L (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.11-5.11).

Lack of rest leads to decreased concentration. The research topic is important for improving patient safety in hospitals. Assessment and analysis of the level of sleepiness of nurses after 3 consecutive night shifts and its impact on functioning in social life. The study adopted the diagnostic survey method, which was conducted using a survey technique. The questionnaire consisted of 3 parts: personal particulars, the survey and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) version A. After the research, 164 correctly completed questionnaires were obtained. The level of somnolence in individual measurements after a night shift significantly increased among the nurses examined (P < .0001). Respondents who felt a higher level of drowsiness after a night shift thought that their work definitely influenced contact with their friends or family and had difficulty in performing household duties. There is no statistically significant relationship between the level of sleepiness and sociodemographic factors. After each night shift, the level of drowsiness in nurses increases. This may result in reduced alertness and attention levels on subsequent working days. Shift work has negative consequences in the form of depleted personal life. Further research into the effects of insufficient sleep among nurses should be conducted. This may be necessary for patient safety in healthcare centers. The awareness on the subject of healthy sleep among shift nurses should be raised. It is advisable to conduct research in order to assess the effectiveness of various therapies in dealing with sleep disorders among shift nurses.

Methods: The study was conducted in three phases: A survey to investigate if the SmartOptometry App was easy to download, understand and test (phase I), an in-clinic comparison of VA measured in a random testing order with four tools namely COMPlog, Reduced Snellen near vision, Peek Acuity (Distance VA) and SmartOptometry (Near VA) (phase II) and a repeatability study on these 4 tools by measuring VA again (phase III). The study recruited the employees of our institute and adhered to the strict COVID-19 protocols of testing. Results: Phase I Survey (n = 40) showed 90% of participants used android phones, 60% reported that instructions were clear, and all users were able to self-assess their near VA with SmartOptometry App. Phase II (n = 68) revealed that Peek Acuity was comparable to COMPlog VA (P = 0.31), however SmartOptometry was statistically significantly different (within 2 log MAR lines) from Reduced Snellen near vision test, particularly for young (n = 44, P = 0.004) and emmetropic (n = 16, P = 0.04) participants.

The world was slow to react to the developing crisis, but once the contours of the impending calamity became evident, the different state and non-state actors have raced to put their act together. The COVID-19 pandemic has blatantly exposed the shortcomings of our healthcare system and the limitations of medical science, despite considerable advances in recent years. To effectively tackle the current pandemic, almost unprecedented in the modern age, there is an urgent need for a concerted, sustained, and coordinated effort towards the development of new diagnostics, therapeutic and vaccines, and the ramping up of the healthcare infrastructure, especially in the poorer underprivileged nations. Towards this end, researchers around the world are working tirelessly to develop new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 are presently underway in several countries around the world, but a new vaccine is expected only by the end of the year-at the earliest. New drug development against COVID-19 and its approval may take even longer. Under such circumstances, drug repurposing has emerged as a realistic and effective strategy to counter the current menace, and several antiviral and antimalarial medicines are currently in different stages of clinical trials.

METHODS: This quasi experimental study was conducted among 130 Covid-19 positive patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital. Yoga and Naturopathic intervention was given for 60 min a day for two weeks. Hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS) and Corona anxiety scale (CAS) was used to assess the generalized anxiety and depression among the patients. RESULTS: Average age of the patients participated was 44 with the range from 36 to 53 years. Among them 85 were male and 45 were female. Of all 130 patients, 33% had symptoms of borderline depression, 9.2% had severe depression, 40% had borderline anxiety and 12.3% had severe anxiety.

They are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, a reduced quality of life and an increasing reliance on social care. ECOPD are common and are increasing in prevalence. Exacerbations beget exacerbations, with up to a quarter of in-patient episodes ending with readmission to hospital within 30 days. The healthcare costs are immense. Yet despite this, the tools available to diagnose and treat ECOPD are essentially unchanged, with the last new intervention (non-invasive ventilation) introduced over 25 years ago. An ECOPD is an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. This symptom and healthcare utility-based definition does not describe pathology and is unable to differentiate from other causes of an acute deterioration in breathlessness with or without a cough and sputum. There is limited understanding of the host immune response during an acute event and no reliable and readily available means to identify aetiology or direct treatment at the point of care (POC). Corticosteroids, short acting bronchodilators with or without antibiotics have been the mainstay of treatment for over 30 years. This is in stark contrast to many other acute presentations of chronic illness, where specific biomarkers and mechanistic understanding has revolutionised care pathways. So why has progress been so slow in ECOPD? This review examines the history of diagnosing and treating ECOPD. It suggests that to move forward, there needs to be an acceptance that not all exacerbations are alike (just as not all COPD is alike) and that clinical presentation alone cannot identify aetiology or stratify treatment.","output":"Building toolkits for COPD exacerbations: lessons from the past and present"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to major organisational changes in health care settings, especially in psychiatric hospitals.

While they are also applied to tracheostomized patients with spontaneous breathing, their performance in this role has not yet been clarified. We carried out a bench study to investigate the effects of spontaneous breathing parameters and oxygen flow on the humidification performance of 11 HMEs. METHODS We evaluated the humidification provided by 11 HMEs for tracheostomized patients, and also by a system delivering high-flow CPAP, and an oxygen mask with nebulizer heater. Spontaneous breathing was simulated with a mechanical ventilator, lung model, and servo-controlled heated humidifier at tidal volumes of 300, 500, and 700 mL, and breathing frequencies of 10 and 20 breaths/min. Expired gas was warmed to 37C. The high-flow CPAP system was set to deliver 15, 30, and 45 L/min. With the 8 HMEs that were equipped with ports to deliver oxygen, and with the high-flow CPAP system, measurements were taken when delivering 0 and 3 L/min of dry oxygen. After stabilization we measured the absolute humidity (AH) of inspired gas with a hygrometer. RESULTS AH differed among HMEs applied to tracheostomized patients with spontaneous breathing. For all the HMEs, as tidal volume increased, AH decreased. At 20 breaths/min, AH was higher than at 10 breaths/min. For all the HMEs, when oxygen was delivered, AH decreased to below 30 mg/L. With an oxygen mask and high-flow CPAP, at all settings, AH exceeded 30 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS None of the HMEs provided adequate humidification when supplemental oxygen was added.

There is limited study of how doctors' transitions experiences impact wellbeing, particularly socially and culturally. Multiple Multidimensional Transitions (MMT) theory views transitions as dynamic, incorporating multiple contexts and multiple domains. Using MMT as our lens, we report a qualitative analysis of how transitions experienced by doctors during the pandemic impacted on social and cultural aspects of wellbeing. METHODS: Longitudinal narrative inquiry was employed, using interviews and audio\\\\diaries. Data were collected over 6 months in three phases: (i) interviews with doctors from across the career spectrum (n = 98); (ii) longitudinal audio\\\\diaries for 2C4 months (n = 71); (iii) second interviews (n = 83). Data were analysed abductively, narrowing focus to factors important to social and cultural wellbeing. RESULTS: Doctors described experiencing multiple interacting transitions triggered by the pandemic in multiple contexts (workplace, role, homelife and education). Patterns identifiable across the dataset allowed us to explore social and cultural wellbeing crosscutting beyond individual experience. Three critical factors contributed to social and cultural wellbeing both positively and negatively: being heard (e.g., by colleagues asking how they are); being valued (e.g., removal of rest spaces by organisations showing lack of value); and being supported (e.g., through regular briefing by education bodies). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to longitudinally explore the multiple\\\\multidimensional transitions experienced by doctors during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Our data analysis helped us move beyond existing perceptions around wellbeing and articulate multiple factors that contribute to social and cultural wellbeing.

Many results have been described on the status of the immune system of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but there are still aspects that have not been fully characterized. In this study, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical features and clinical laboratory values of patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher state of activation in all T cell subsets, higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-DR and an intriguing abrupt change in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity. These results indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 have a broad perturbation of their immune system, and they will help to understand the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19 as well as could be of special value for physicians to decide which specific therapeutic options are most effective for their patients.","output":"T cell activation, highly armed cytotoxic cells and a sharp shift in monocytes CD300 receptors expression is characteristic of patients with severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The matter of care in this thought piece is the future of the critical interdisciplinary accounting research (IPA) project. On the one hand, the need for critical IPA research is arguably increasing today, not least due to the very serious, complex and wicked global problems C like climate change, decreasing biodiversity, over-population, global inequality and COVID-19. On the other hand, however, critical IPA research faces some severe challenges, such as the dominance of mono-disciplinary normal science, limitations of getting access to organisations, and a certain academic insularity. To discuss possibilities for furthering critical IPA research, we start from approaches to critical performativity and suggest to complement them with ideas from two very different research approaches. First, we suggest that the concept of performative ontology and the related diverse economies approach, introduced by Gibson-Graham (2008), goes a step further than previous conceptualizations of critical performativity in methodological as well as practical terms. Secondly, we argue that employing some of the inherent ideas and learning points of interventionist research in conjunction with performative ontology can inspire new ways of conducting critical IPA research that matters.","output":"The future of critical interdisciplinary accounting research: Performative ontology and critical interventionist research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The second edition of this Special Issue Strategies and Evidence in Health Communication, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health aims primarily to increase international literature evidence and observations in the field regarding: (i) health communication strategies and crisis communication, (ii) health education and health advocacy, and (iii) the fight against the phenomenon of Vaccine Hesitancy (VH) through training and communication activities targeting the general public and health professionals. This Special Issue builds on the premise that, despite the fact that theoretical and experimental research has contributed to an increase in knowledge and evidence about the importance of communication in healthcare, communication professionals in this field still face great challenges when trying to develop messages that effectively change the behavior of large groups of people. The need to relay fast and reliable information to the general public has therefore led public institutions to seek out new and innovative ways of transmitting health-related content. In particular, for some time now, Public Health has also been making use of the Internet and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to reach various population groups and achieve better health conditions for all. This practice, known as Digital Health or E-health, provides healthcare using digital tools (e.g., websites and social media networks) and easy-to-understand language. This is particularly important in the current pandemic context, where Public Health continues to face many problems and difficulties in persuading people to adhere to the guidelines issued for the containment of COVID-19, with particular reference to vaccination programs, hence the importance of acquiring and strengthening communication skills in healthcare, where correct and effective communication is immediately beneficial both to professionals and patients.","output":"Second Edition of Special Issue Strategies and Evidence in Health Communication: Evidence and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After almost 2 years of fighting against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the number of patients enduring persistent symptoms long after acute infection is a matter of concern. This set of symptoms was referred to as long COVID, and it was defined more recently as Post COVID-19 condition by the World health Organization (WHO). Although studies have revealed that long COVID can manifest whatever the severity of inaugural illness, the underlying pathophysiology is still enigmatic. AIM: To conduct a comprehensive review to address the putative pathophysiology underlying the persisting symptoms of long COVID. METHOD: We searched 11 bibliographic databases (Cochrane Library, JBI EBP Database, Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINHAL, Ovid Nursing Database, Journals@Ovid, SciLit, EuropePMC, and CoronaCentral). We selected studies that put forward hypotheses on the pathophysiology, as well as those that encompassed long COVID patients in their research investigation. RESULTS: A total of 98 articles were included in the systematic review, 54 of which exclusively addressed hypotheses on pathophysiology, while 44 involved COVID patients. Studies that included patients displayed heterogeneity with respect to the severity of initial illness, timing of analysis, or presence of a control group. Although long COVID likely results from long-term organ damage due to acute-phase infection, specific mechanisms following the initial illness could contribute to the later symptoms possibly affecting many organs. As such, autonomic nervous system damage could account for many symptoms without clear evidence of organ damage. Immune dysregulation, auto-immunity, endothelial dysfunction, occult viral persistence, as well as coagulation activation are the main underlying pathophysiological mechanisms so far. CONCLUSION: KEY MESSAGES: Long-COVID is a multisystem disease that develops regardless of the initial disease severity. Its clinical spectrum comprises a wide range of symptoms. The mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology are still unclear. Although organ damage from the acute infection phase likely accounts for symptoms, specific long-lasting inflammatory mechanisms have been proposed, as well. Existing studies involving Long-COVID patients are highly heterogeneous, as they include patients with various COVID-19 severity levels and different time frame analysis, as well.","output":"Pathophysiology and mechanism of long COVID: a comprehensive review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study investigated cultural and psychological factors associated with intentions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Participants (n = 704) completed measures of individualism-collectivism, belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19, feelings of powerlessness, and intentions to engage in behaviours that reduce the spread of COVID-19. Results revealed that vertical individualism negatively predicted intentions to engage in social distancing, directly and indirectly through both belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and feelings of powerlessness. Vertical collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions directly. Horizontal collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions indirectly through feelings of powerlessness. Finally, horizontal collectivism positively predicted hygiene-related intentions both directly and indirectly through lower feelings of powerlessness. These findings suggest that promoting collectivism may be a way to increase engagement with efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. They also highlight the importance of examining the interplay between culture and both personal feelings (powerlessness) and information consumption (conspiracy theories) during times of crisis.","output":"Cultural orientation, power, belief in conspiracy theories, and intentions to reduce the spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Health anxiety is one of the most common problems in patients with coronary artery disease. The present study tested whether health anxiety severity could be predicted by spiritual well-being and hope in patients with advanced coronary artery disease.

Patients completed self-report scales, including the Spiritual Well-Being Scale, Adult Hope Scale, and Short Health Anxiety Inventory. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to empirically explore the relations among variables. Results: Results indicated that patients who reported higher levels of hope ( = 0.42, p < 0.01) and spiritual well-being ( = 0.20, p < 0.05) reported lower levels of health anxiety. Agency ( = 0.58, p < 0.01) scores were a significant negative predictor of health anxiety severity. Additionally, religious spirituality scores ( = 0.28, p < 0.01) were shown to significantly negatively predict health anxiety level.

This system, referred to as DP3T, provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures to break its transmission chain. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where the contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user's phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server. Prior to the upload, all data remains exclusively on the user's phone. Other users' apps can use data from the server to locally estimate whether the device's owner was exposed to the virus through close-range physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person who has uploaded their data.

The objective of the CLIVIT Trial was to compare ligatures with vascular clips for hemostasis in elective benign thyroid surgery. METHODS This multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel group superiority trial was conducted in 13 German surgical centers. Patients scheduled for at least subtotal resection bilaterally were intraoperatively randomized. The primary endpoint was resection time. Secondary endpoints were the amount of postoperative bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, wound infection, temporary (reversal within 12 months) and permanent (over 1 year) recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) paralysis, length of hospital stay, and safety. REGISTRATION ISRCTN 96901396. RESULTS Two hundred fifty patients were treated with ligatures and 241 with vascular clips. No differences in patients' baseline and surgical characteristics were observed. No difference was detected for mean resection time (clip 63.5 min  29.6, ligature 66.1 min  29.3, P = 0.258). Postoperative bleeding (mean 86 ml  93), reoperation due to bleeding (clips 4, ligature 2), wound infections (clips 4, ligature 4), postoperative hospital stay (mean 3.0  1.9), and safety data also did not vary significantly. The rates of temporary and permanent RLN paralysis were 6.9 % (34/491) and 2.9 % (14/491), respectively. Not using a surgical drain (123 patients) was not associated with a higher rate of complications. CONCLUSION Vascular clips did not reduce the resection time. However, a 2.9 % rate of permanent RLN paralysis is of concern.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients receiving RTX (n = 11) or BEL (n = 17) treatment and 13 age-/sex-matched controls (non-rheumatic healthcare personnel) were recruited. None of the patients had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies caused by prior exposure to the virus. All the patients and controls received mRNA vaccines and were tested three to four weeks after completion of vaccination. In all the RTX patients, vaccination was started within 5 months from the last infusion, and B-cell depletion was confirmed in all but one of them. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies were analyzed using a diagnostic assay, while T-cell response was evaluated using the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Further, SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were employed to verify the strain-specific neutralizing capacity of the antibodies. RESULTS: Detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were documented in 1 out of the 11 RTX patients and 16 of the 17 BEL patients. The median concentration in the RTX and BEL patients was significantly lower than that in the controls (39.6 AU/ml vs. 1133 AU/ml, p = 0.002). The result of IGRA was positive in 8 of the 11 (72.7%) RTX patients and 16 of the 17 (94.1%) BEL patients, and interferon release in both the RTX and BEL patients was comparable to that in the control participants. CONCLUSION: B-cell-targeted therapies do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, since virus-specific cellular immunity can be induced even in the absence of circulating B cells. An important finding was that lupus patients treated with BEL developed immune responses to SARS-CoV-2; this indicates retention of the immunogenicity of the COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"High T-cell response rate after COVID-19 vaccination in belimumab and rituximab recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article was published ahead of print on the official website of Chinese Journal of Ophthalmology on April 14, 2020.

The objective of this paper is to highlight the social and cultural drivers of antimicrobial use and resistance and targeted interventions for secondary and tertiary care settings in Canada and other OECD countries. This paper is an extension of the synthesis conducted for the Public Health Agency of Canada's 2019 Spotlight Report: Preserving Antibiotics Now and Into the Future. We conducted a systematic review with a few modifications to meet rapid timelines. We conducted a search in Ovid MEDLINE and McMaster University's evidence databases for systematic reviews and then for individual Canadian studies. To cast a wider net, we searched OECD organization websites and screened reference lists from systematic reviews. We synthesized the evidence narratively and categorized the evidence into macro-, meso-, and microlevel. A total of 70 studies were (a) from OCED countries and summarized evidence of potential sociocultural antimicrobial resistance and use barriers or facilitators and/or interventions addressing these challenges; (b) systematic reviews with 50% of included studies that are situated in secondary and tertiary settings; and (c) published in Canada's two official languages, English and French. We found that hospital structures and policies may influence antibiotic utilization and variations in antimicrobial management. Microlevel factors may sway inappropriate prescribing among clinicians. The amount and type of antibiotics used may affect resistance rates.

Understanding how comorbidities affect the severity of influenza can help clinical management. The aim of this study is to offer more information about comorbidities that might be associated with the severity of influenza in children. We used a statewide network in Rhode Island, USA, to extract data for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases among children 19 years old or younger. We identified 1169 lab-confirmed influenza cases. The most common comorbidities were asthma (17.1%), neurodevelopmental disorders (10.3%), gastrointestinal disorders (7.6%), atopic dermatitis (7%), and endocrine and metabolic diseases (6.8%). Interestingly, 80.8% (63 out of 78) of children who had an influenza-related hospital admission had at least one comorbidity, and among hospitalized children with influenza, the most common comorbidities were neurological diseases (28.2%, 22/78), gastrointestinal disorders (25.6%, 20/78), endocrine and metabolic diseases (24.4%, 19/78), and neurodevelopmental disorders (23.1%, 18/78). Children with endocrine or metabolic diseases were 8.23 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital, and children with neurological disorders were 6.35 times more likely to be admitted (OR: 8.23, 95% CI: 4.42C15.32 and OR: 6.35, 95% CI: 3.60C11.24, respectively).

METHODS: We tested the performance of the NetMHCpan4.0 computational neural network in re-identifying 93 T-cell epitopes that had been previously independently mapped using the whole proteome IFN- ELISPOT assays in 6 HLA class I typed Ugandan individuals infected with HIV-1 subtypes A1 and D. To provide a benchmark we compared the predictions for NetMHCpan4.0 to MHCflurry1.2.0 and NetCTL1.2. RESULTS: NetMHCpan4.0 performed best correctly predicting 88 of the 93 experimentally mapped epitopes for a set length of 9-mer and matched HLA class I alleles. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.928. Setting NetMHCpan4.0 to predict 11-14mer length did not improve the prediction (37C79 of 93 peptides) with an inverse correlation between the number of predictions and length set. Late time point peptides were significantly stronger binders than early peptides (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.0000005). MHCflurry1.2.0 similarly predicted all but 2 of the peptides that NetMHCpan4.0 predicted and NetCTL1.2 predicted only 14 of the 93 experimental peptides. CONCLUSION: NetMHCpan4.0 class I epitope predictions covered 95% of the epitope responses identified in six HIV-1 infected individuals, and would have reduced the number of experimental confirmatory tests by > 80%.

Although there has been increasing research interest in AD, its pathogenesis is still not well understood. Although most studies primarily focus on neurons, recent research findings suggest that glial cells (especially microglia and astrocytes) are associated with AD pathogenesis and might provide various possible therapeutic targets. Growing evidence suggests that microglia can provide protection against AD pathogenesis, as microglia with weakened functions and impaired responses to A? proteins are linked with elevated AD risk. Interestingly, numerous findings also suggest that microglial activation can be detrimental to neurons. Indeed, microglia can induce synapse loss via the engulfment of synapses, possibly through a complement-dependent process. Furthermore, they can worsen tau pathology and release inflammatory factors that cause neuronal damage directly or through the activation of neurotoxic astrocytes. Astrocytes play a significant role in various cerebral activities. Their impairment can mediate neurodegeneration and ultimately the retraction of synapses, resulting in AD-related cognitive deficits. Deposition of A? can result in astrocyte reactivity, which can further lead to neurotoxic effects and elevated secretion of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Moreover, glial-induced inflammation in AD can exert both beneficial and harmful effects. Understanding the activities of astrocytes and microglia in the regulation of AD pathogenesis would facilitate the development of novel therapies. In this article, we address the implications of microglia and astrocytes in AD pathogenesis. We also discuss the mechanisms of therapeutic agents that exhibit anti-inflammatory effects against AD.","output":"Glial cells in Alzheimer's disease: From neuropathological changes to therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research article, we introduced an algorithm to evaluate COVID-19 patients admission in hospitals at source shortage period. Many researchers have expressed their conclusions from different perspectives on various factors such as spatial changes, climate risks, preparedness, blood type, age and comorbidities that may be contributing to COVID-19 mortality rate. However, as the number of people coming to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment increases, the mortality rate is likely to increase due to the lack of medical facilities. In order to provide medical assistance in this situation, we need to consider not only the extent of the disease impact, but also other important factors. No method has yet been proposed to calculate the priority of patients taking into account all the factors. We have provided a solution to this in this research article. Based on eight key factors, we provide a way to determine priorities. In order to achieve the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, we studied individuals with different results on all factors. The sigmoid function helps to easily construct factors at different levels. In addition, the Cobweb solution model allows us to see the potential of our proposed algorithm very clearly. Using the method we introduced, it is easier to sort high-risk individuals to low-risk individuals. This will make it easier to deal with problems that arise when the number of patients in hospitals continues to increase. It can reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients.

The alteration of bacterial proteins, enzymatic degradation, and change of membrane permeability towards antimicrobial agents are the key mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Based on the current condition, there is an urgent clinical need to develop new drugs to treat these bacterial infections. In the current study, the binding patterns of selected antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with different multidrug-resistant bacterial strains have been analyzed. Among ten selected AMPs in this study, napin and snakin-1 exhibited the best scores and binding patterns. Napin exhibited strong interactions with penicillin-binding protein 1a of Acinetobacter baumannii (with a binding score of -158.7 kcal/mol and ten hydrogen bonds), with glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (with a binding score of -107.8 kcal/mol and twelve hydrogen bonds), and with streptomycin 3()-adenylyltransferase protein of Salmonella enterica (with a binding score of -84.2 kcal/mol and four hydrogen bonds). Similarly, snakin-1 showed strong interactions with oxygen-insensitive NADPH nitroreductase of Helicobacter pylori (with a binding score of -105.0 kcal/mol and thirteen hydrogen bonds) and with penicillin-binding protein 2a of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (with a binding score of -103.8 kcal/mol and twenty-three hydrogen bonds). The docking results were further validated by molecular dynamics simulations. The results of this computational approach support the evidence of efficiency of these AMPs as potent inhibitors of these specific proteins of bacterial strains.

Asthma and asthma severity (step suggested by GINA) was defined using the diagnostic code and history of asthma medication usage. RESULTS: Among 7590 COVID-19 patients, 218 (2.9%) had underlying asthma. The total medical cost associated with COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma was significantly higher than that of other patients. Mortality rate for COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma (7.8%) was significantly higher than that of other patients (2.8%; p<0.001). However, asthma was not an independent risk factor for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 after adjustment. Asthma medication use and asthma severity also did not affect the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. However, use of oral short-acting (2)-agonists (SABA) was an independent factor to increase the total medical cost burden.

The objective of this study is to compare the outcomes of HF (stage C or D), Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) or Heart Transplant (HTx) patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods Out of 2635 patients followed in our program (HF=2234, LVAD=167, HTx=234), 96 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between March 2020 to January 2021 were included in this study. Hospital length of stay (LOS), requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality rate were compared. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare survival. Results The distribution of COVID among the 96 patients was: HTx = 15.8%, LVAD = 9.6% and HF = 1.9%. Table 1 outlines the clinical characteristics and outcomes of the 3 cohorts. A total of 49 patients were hospitalized: 18 (41.9%) HF, 8 (50%) LVAD, and 23 (62.2%) HTx. Of the hospitalized patients, 5 (27.8%) required ICU care in the HF, 2 (25%) LVAD, and 6 (26.1%) HTx groups. The median ICU LOS was significantly higher in HTx (24 days, p=0.04) when compared to HF (10 days) group. HTx patients had the highest 180-day mortality, followed by LVAD, and then HF patients (18.9%, 12.5% and 11.6%, respectively). All deaths occurred within 50 days from diagnosis. Among LVAD patients, COPD was the highest predictor of mortality (69% prevalence). Conclusion This report is among the first to describe the impact of COVID-19 on a comprehensive advanced heart failure (HF) practice. Our data highlights the risks of morbidity and mortality faced by HF and immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 infection.

The virus further exploits the host cellular machinery to gain access into the cells;its spike protein is cleaved by a host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) shortly after binding ACE2 followed by its proteolytic activation at a furin cleavage site. The virus primarily targets the epithelium of the respiratory tract which is covered by a tightly regulated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that serves as a primary defense mechanism against respiratory pathogens. The volume and viscosity of this fluid layer is regulated and maintained by a coordinated function of different transport pathways in the respiratory epithelium. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 may potentially alter evolutionary conserved second-messenger signaling cascades via activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or by directly modulating G protein signaling. Such signaling may in turn adversely modulate transepithelial transport processes, especially those involving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), thereby shifting the delicate balance between anion secretion and sodium absorption that controls homeostasis of this fluid layer. As a result, activation of the secretory pathways including CFTR-mediated Cl- transport may overwhelm the absorptive pathways such as ENaC-dependent Na+ uptake and initiate a pathophysiological cascade leading to lung edema, one of the most serious and potentially deadly clinical manifestations of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 May Hijack GPCR Signaling Pathways to Compromise Lung Ion and Fluid Transport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) cause significant inpatient morbidity and mortality.

However, the molecular recognition mechanismcritical information for drug and antibody designhas not been fully clarified at the amino acid residue level. Elucidating such a microscopic mechanism in detail requires a more accurate molecular interpretation that includes quantum mechanics to quantitatively evaluate hydrogen bonds, XH/ interactions (X = N, O, and C), and salt bridges. In this study, we applied the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding interactions with not only ACE2 but also the B38 Fab antibody involved in ACE2-inhibitory binding. By analyzing FMO-based interaction energies along a wide range of binding interfaces carefully, we identified amino acid residues critical for molecular recognition between S-protein and ACE2 or B38 Fab antibody. Importantly, hydrophobic residues that are involved in weak interactions such as CHCO hydrogen bond and XH/ interactions, as well as polar residues that construct conspicuous hydrogen bonds, play important roles in molecular recognition and binding ability. Moreover, through these FMO-based analyses, we also clarified novel hot spots and epitopes that had been overlooked in previous studies by structural and molecular mechanical approaches. Altogether, these hot spots/epitopes identified between S-protein and ACE2/B38 Fab antibody may provide useful information for future antibody design, evaluation of the binding property of the SARS-CoV-2 variants including its N501Y, and small or medium drug design against the SARS-CoV-2. Quantum chemical calculations investigated molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins including its N501Y variant for ACE2 and antibody. Hot spot and epitope analyses revealed key residues to design drugs and antibodies against COVID-19.","output":"Molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein: quantum chemical hot spot and epitope analyses? ?

While superficially different, the two legal battles actually raise very similar issues. Both involve exercises of power by the exact same federal agency, utilizing authority it claims was delegated to it under consecutive provisions of the Public Health Service Act of 1944. Both measures were first adopted under the Trump Administration, and later continuedwith some modificationsunder the Biden Administration. The bipartisan nature of the policies suggests that the problems they raise are not limited to one party, nor to one side of the political spectrum. Both policies were open to serious challenge under the constitutional nondelegation doctrine, and under the related major question doctrine. These vulnerabilities eventually led to the judicial invalidation of the eviction moratorium, and may have contributed to the DC Circuits partial invalidation of the Title 42 expulsions. Finally, it is notable that both policies caused great harm, while doing little to stop the spread of the disease;both were enacted by the executive despite skepticism from public health experts. Part I of this article provides an overview of the eviction moratorium and Title 42 policies, and the resulting litigation. In Part II, I explain why both policies violate the constitutional nondelegation principles. Part III shows how, for very similar reasons, both also run afoul of the major question doctrine. Finally, Part IV outlines some lessons that can be gleaned from these cases. Among other things, they strengthen the case for nondeferential judicial review of emergency powers and delegations to supposedly expert executive agencies. They also highlight the need for greater cross-ideological cooperation and dialogue on these issues. Nondelegation and major question limits on emergency powers will be on firmer ground if they enjoy cross-ideological support and cannot be stigmatized as mere partisan tools of one side of the political spectrum.","output":"Nondelegation Limits on COVID Emergency Powers: Lessons from the Eviction Moratorium and Title 42 Cases (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our previous scoping review revealed limitations and inconsistencies in population surveys of chronic respiratory disease. Informed by this review, we piloted a cross-sectional survey of adults in four South/South-East Asian low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) to assess survey feasibility and identify variables that predicted asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We administered relevant translations of the BOLD-1 questionnaire with additional questions from ECRHS-II, performed spirometry and arranged specialist clinical review for a sub-group to confirm the diagnosis. Using random sampling, we piloted a community-based survey at five sites in four LMICs and noted any practical barriers to conducting the survey. Three clinicians independently used information from questionnaires, spirometry and specialist reviews, and reached consensus on a clinical diagnosis. We used lasso regression to identify variables that predicted the clinical diagnoses and attempted to develop an algorithm for detecting asthma and COPD. RESULTS: Of 508 participants, 55.9% reported one or more chronic respiratory symptoms. The prevalence of asthma was 16.3%; COPD 4.5%; and other chronic respiratory disease 3.0%. Based on consensus categorisation (n = 483 complete records), Wheezing in last 12 months and Waking up with a feeling of tightness were the strongest predictors for asthma. For COPD, age and spirometry results were the strongest predictors. Practical challenges included logistics (participant recruitment; researcher safety); misinterpretation of questions due to local dialects; and assuring quality spirometry in the field. CONCLUSION: Detecting asthma in population surveys relies on symptoms and history. In contrast, spirometry and age were the best predictors of COPD. Logistical, language and spirometry-related challenges need to be addressed.","output":"Predictors for detecting chronic respiratory diseases in community surveys: A pilot cross-sectional survey in four South and South East Asian low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The benefits of telemedicine in neurosurgery have been widely studied, especially as its implementation into clinical practice boomed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have investigated telemedicine from the perspective of the patient experience. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient satisfaction scores of telemedicine outpatient clinic visits in neurosurgery in comparison with in-person visits. METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, Press Ganey surveys from 3/1/2019 to 9/15/2020 were evaluated retrospectively from single-institution, academic neurosurgical clinics. Due to the non-normality of our data, stratified Wilcoxon tests were performed with correction for care provider differences. Domain score probability values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Average scores (range 20-100) are documented as mean  standard deviation. RESULTS: The response rates were 20% (97 responders) for telemedicine visits and 19% (589 responders) for in-person visits. Patient overall satisfaction score was slightly higher with telemedicine visits compared to in-person corrected for care provider differences (94.2  12.2 vs 93.1  13.4, p = 0.085). The care provider domain demonstrated no statistically significant difference in telemedicine compared to in-person (94.7  14.4 vs 92.4  16.5, p = 0.096). The access domain (93.7  12.3 vs 93.4  12.4, p = 0.999) and overall domains (94.1  12.1 vs 94.4  13.4, p = 1.000) were not found to be different between visit types. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine appears to be a valuable option for neurosurgical patients and is not significantly different to in-person visits in all domains. This study demonstrates that telemedicine visits result in comparable satisfaction scores by neurosurgical patients, and providers should continue offering this option to their patients as we approach the post-COVID era.","output":"Patient satisfaction scores with telemedicine in the neurosurgical population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines an important area of strategic global human resource management - expatriate managers' compensation in times of global business uncertainty While expatriation has numerous well-documented benefits for multinational corporations (MNCs), it is incredibly costly In consequence, when global business conditions become uncertain, the expatriate program in MNCs is typically one of the first budget centres to be targeted for cost savings The MNC typically radically restructures expatriate remuneration The resultant effect of these actions is a negative impact on the relationship between the expatriate and the MNC, ultimately reducing expatriate performance and thereby abating the many advantages that the expatriate program brings to MNCs Social Exchange Theory and Real Options theory help to provide a theoretical framework to understand how expatriate compensation decisions can help to create a desirable sustainable expatriate program in MNCs","output":"Sustainable expatriate compensation in an uncertain environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is increasingly used in adolescents. The aim was to explore symptoms of depression and anxiety in young adults over 5 years' follow-up after undergoing MBS. METHODS: Beck Depression Inventory-2 and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety in 62 patients 1, 2, and 5 years after having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 13-18 years of age. Mental health, eating-related problems, and weight outcomes were tested for association with suicidal ideation at the 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: At the 5-year follow-up, the mean score for depression was 11.4 ( 12.4), indicating minimal symptoms of depression. The mean score for anxiety was 12.82 ( 11.50), indicating mild anxiety symptoms. Still, several participants reported moderate or severe symptoms of depression (26%) and anxiety (32%). Women reported more symptoms than men (P = 0.03 and 0.04). No significant changes were found in self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety between the 1-year and the 5-year follow-up (P = 0.367 and 0.934). Suicidal ideation was reported by 16% at the 5-year follow-up. Participants reporting suicidal ideation had lost significantly less excess weight than participants without suicidal ideation (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Five years after adolescent MBS, a substantial minority still struggles with mental health issues, and women are more burdened than men. Our results indicate an association between less optimal weight loss and suicidal ideation 5 years after MBS. The findings emphasize the importance of offering long-term follow-up and mental health treatment several years after MBS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, cohort study.

Current platforms available for the distribution of scientific and clinical research data and information include preprint repositories and traditional peer-reviewed journals. In recent times, social media has emerged as a helpful platform to share scientific and medical discoveries. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively analyze activity on social media (specifically, Twitter) and that related to publications in the form of preprint and peer-reviewed journal articles in the context of COVID-19 and gastroenterology during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: COVID-19-related data from Twitter (tweets and user data) and articles published in preprint servers (bioRxiv and medRxiv) as well as in the PubMed database were collected and analyzed during the first 6 months of the pandemic, from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ-specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity. Any relationship between Twitter activity and preprint articles published and that between Twitter activity and PubMed articles published overall, by organ system, and by geographic location were identified using Spearman's rank-order correlation. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7164 journal publications, and 4702 preprint publications were retrieved. Twitter activity (ie, number of tweets) peaked in March 2020, whereas preprint and publication activity (ie, number of articles published) peaked in April 2020. Overall, strong correlations were identified between trends in Twitter activity and preprint and publication activity (P<.001 for both). COVID-19 data across the three platforms mainly concentrated on pulmonology or critical care, but when analyzing the field of gastroenterology specifically, most tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal gastroenterology. Furthermore, there were significant positive associations between trends in Twitter and publication activity for all gastroenterology topics (luminal gastroenterology: P=.009; hepatology and inflammatory bowel disease: P=.006; gastrointestinal endoscopy: P=.007), except pancreatology (P=.20), suggesting that Twitter activity did not correlate with publication activity for this topic. Finally, Twitter activity was the highest in the United States (7331 tweets), whereas PubMed activity was the highest in China (1768 publications). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential of social media as a vehicle for disseminating scientific information during a public health crisis. Sharing and spreading information on COVID-19 in a timely manner during the pandemic has been paramount; this was achieved at a much faster pace on social media, particularly on Twitter. Future investigation could demonstrate how social media can be used to augment and promote scholarly activity, especially as the world begins to increasingly rely on digital or virtual platforms. Scientists and clinicians should consider the use of social media in augmenting public awareness regarding their scholarly pursuits.","output":"Social Media and Research Publication Activity During Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Trend Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic in Spain was a major challenge for universities offering face-to-face education since these were compelled to adjust to online teaching in an extremely brief time span.

First, the CM framework that contains the digital firm, capability pool, and digital certificate issuing units is developed, and then, the private blocktrust peer-to-peer network is proposed and implemented based on Hyperledger fabric. Finlay, the feasibility of the blocktrust is examined under different testing scenarios. The reason for using a private network instead of the public is placing restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and also enjoying a network with fast transaction speed.

Our implementation team began training the interdisciplinary infectious diseases clinical team in VTH after declaration of the pandemic in March 2020. We pivoted from a randomized clinical trial recruitment and supported modifications in clinic processes by introducing patients to VTH through personalized telephone calls and mailed brochures to inform them of telehealth options during the pandemic. Adaptations were made to provider locations, with some providers delivering care remotely from home and others delivering virtual care from the clinic. We also modified the external and internal facilitator roles to allow external facilitators to provide one-on-one training, troubleshooting assistance, and delivery of necessary equipment. Results: Within 6 weeks of the emergency declaration of the pandemic, 100% of providers (n = 27) had conducted at least one appointment, with 24.1% (n = 124) of unique patients using VTH.

Senotherapeutics are divided into senolytics and senomorphics. The senolytics selectively kill senescent cells, while the senomorphics delay or block the onset of senescence. Metformin has been used to treat diabetes for several decades. Recently, it has been proposed that metformin may have anti-aging properties as it prevents DNA damage and inflammation. We evaluated the senomorphic effect of 6 weeks of therapeutic metformin treatment on the biology of human adipose mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The study was combined with a proteome analysis of changes occurring in MSCs intracellular and secretome protein composition in order to identify molecular pathways associated with the observed biological phenomena. The metformin reduced the replicative senescence and cell death phenomena associated with prolonged in vitro cultivation. The continuous metformin supplementation delayed and/or reduced the impairment of MSC functions as evidenced by the presence of three specific pathways in metformin-treated samples: 1) the alpha-adrenergic signaling, which contributes to regulation of MSCs physiological secretory activity, 2) the signaling pathway associated with MSCs detoxification activity, and 3) the aspartate degradation pathway for optimal energy production. The senomorphic function of metformin seemed related to its reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity. In metformin-treated samples, the CEBPA, TP53 and USF1 transcription factors appeared to be involved in the regulation of several factors (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, GLRX, GSTP1) blocking ROS.","output":"Proteomic and Biological Analysis of the Effects of Metformin Senomorphics on the Mesenchymal Stromal Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to review the efficacy, safety, and outcomes of percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) in elderly patients with acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC), high comorbidity, and COVID-19. METHODS: The hospital registry data were examined of patients aged >65 years who were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and who underwent PC treatment in the interventional radiology unit. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19, then underwent PC. The patients comprised 14 (78%) males and 4 (22%) females with an average age of 73.4 years (range, 67-81 years). In 17 (94%) patients, symptoms associated with acute cholecystitis decreased within 48-72 h of the PC treatment and a clinical improvement was determined. The success rate of PC was 100% and no complications. In 3 (16.6%) patients followed up with intubation in intensive care after the procedure, mortality developed due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 15 (83.4%) patients were discharged with an elective cholecystectomy plan. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection can be fatal especially in patients over 65 years of age due to additional comorbidities. PC treatment, which can be performed under local anesthesia as a minimally invasive procedure, is an alternative treatment option in this patient group.

As COVID-19, takes thousands of lives all around the world, it seems that the medicinal resources would not be enough to supply billions of peoples, currently living on the planet earth. Thus, this pandemic and its subsequent impacts on the natural order of our life, would be one of the most important threats against the entire human race. Aims & Objective: Due to this, in this project, we have made attempts to find an operative approach for synthesizing this compound as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which showed it could be effective in inhibiting the newly emerged coronavirus. RESULTS: The designed scheme uses relatively cheap precursors, and contains one pot stages, instead of seven time consuming, and more costly, linear steps. Also, it is tried to use safe and cheap solvents like water, and ethanol, instead of toxic ones like methanol, and pyridine which could cause rejection of the API in the organic volatile impurities (OVI) test of pharmacopeia analysis, as well as increasing the concern of inflammability, explosive, and carcinogenic properties of those common solvents. CONCLUSION: The most important pharmaceutical analytical methods containing OVI test (mainly ethanol (about 171 ppm) much lower than the limits, by gas chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) instrument), Assay content (about 99.6% by potentiometric titration), and related purity analysis (by High performance liquid chromatography-Ultraviolet Detector (HPLC-UV)) (about 99.8%) were performed and described to give a more clear industrial scheme.","output":"An Urgent Industrial Scheme both for Total Synthesis, and for Pharmaceutical Analytical Analysis of Umifenovir as an Anti-Viral API for Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As lockdown measures to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection begin to ease in the UK, it is important to assess the impact of any changes in policy, including school reopening and broader relaxation of physical distancing measures. We aimed to use an individual-based model to predict the impact of two possible strategies for reopening schools to all students in the UK from September, 2020, in combination with different assumptions about relaxation of physical distancing measures and the scale-up of testing. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used Covasim, a stochastic individual-based model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified into household, school, workplace, and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulated six different scenarios, representing the combination of two school reopening strategies (full time and a part-time rota system with 50% of students attending school on alternate weeks) and three testing scenarios (68% contact tracing with no scale-up in testing, 68% contact tracing with sufficient testing to avoid a second COVID-19 wave, and 40% contact tracing with sufficient testing to avoid a second COVID-19 wave). We estimated the number of new infections, cases, and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number (R) under different strategies. In a sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated infectiousness of children and young adults aged younger than 20 years at 50% relative to older ages (20 years and older). FINDINGS: With increased levels of testing (between 59% and 87% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, depending on the scenario), and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented. Assuming 68% of contacts could be traced, we estimate that 75% of individuals with symptomatic infection would need to be tested and positive cases isolated if schools return full-time in September, or 65% if a part-time rota system were used. If only 40% of contacts could be traced, these figures would increase to 87% and 75%, respectively. However, without these levels of testing and contact tracing, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a second wave that would peak in December, 2020, if schools open full-time in September, and in February, 2021, if a part-time rota system were adopted. In either case, the second wave would result in R rising above 1 and a resulting second wave of infections 20C23 times the size of the original COVID-19 wave. When infectiousness of children and young adults was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, we still found that a comprehensive and effective testCtraceCisolate strategy would be required to avoid a second COVID-19 wave. INTERPRETATION: To prevent a second COVID-19 wave, relaxation of physical distancing, including reopening of schools, in the UK must be accompanied by large-scale, population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of diagnosed individuals.

Methods In this retrospective study, we report findings of electrocardiogram (ECG) testing to screen athletes for cardiac abnormalities following COVID-19. Athletes underwent general examinations and ECG screening prior to being medically cleared for a return to sport following COVID-19. Predetermined predictors were grouped into categorical variables including: 1) Sex; 2) Symptom severity; and 3) BMI (normal vs. overweight = > 24 kg?m-2). These were used to examine differences of abnormal rates occurred between different predictor categories. Results Of the 170 athletes screened, 6 (3.5%) presented with abnormal ECG criteria and were referred to cardiology. We found no evidence that symptom severity, sex and BMI category were associated with a higher rate of abnormal ECG (p > 0.05). Greater severity of COVID-19 symptoms were associated with higher percentage of ST depression, T-wave inversion, ST-T changes and presence of fQRS. Loss of smell, loss of taste, headache and sore throat were the most prevalent symptoms with 32.9%, 38.8%, 36.5% and 25.3% of athletes reporting each symptom, respectively.

We therefore sought to determine whether the timing of diagnosis and treatment and the postoperative outcome of patients with testicular torsion had been changed during the COVID pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We considered all patients evaluated in the emergency department (ED) for testicular torsion from February 2018 to August 2019 (pre-COVID period) and from February 2020 to August 2021 (during COVID pandemic). All patients underwent clinical and ultrasound evaluation and subsequently scrotal exploration. Primary outcomes were the time differences from pain onset to ED presentation and from ED presentation to surgical treatment. We also investigated whether the number or orchiectomies required changed during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were divided in two groups: 40 patients in pre-COVID-19 group and 14 in the COVID-19 cohort. Mean time from symptoms onset to ED access was longer during the pandemic (4.2  5.7 versus 39.6  37.3 hours, p = 0.009). Mean time from ED access to surgery was similar (2.9  1.1 versus 4.2  2.3, p = 0.355). In addition, the number of orchiectomies was higher in COVID-19 group (2.5% versus 28.6%, p < 0.01), compared to a lower number of detorsions (97.5% versus 71.4%, p < 0.01). Elapsed time from pain onset to surgery was directly correlated with the increased white blood cell (WBC) count after surgery (r = 0.399, p = 0.002).

It had caused the onset of small disease outbreaks in China, and probably elsewhere as well, which failed to reach epidemic potential. The distant general origin of its zoonosis can be traced back to the ecosystem changes that have decreased biodiversity, greatly facilitating the contacts between humans and the animal reservoirs that carry pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. These reservoirs are the bats. The transition between the limited outbreaks that had occurred through 2019 and the epidemic explosion of December-January was made possible by the great amplification of the general negative conditions that had caused the preceding small outbreaks. In the light of what we have now learned, the explosion was predictable, and could have happened wherever the conditions that had allowed it, could be duplicated. What could not have been predicted was the second transition, from epidemic to pandemic. Research has now revealed that the globalization of the infection appears to have been caused by a mutation in the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2, that has dramatically increased its transmissibility.","output":"History of the COVID-19 pandemic: Origin, explosion, worldwide spreading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the novel beta coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromecoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

This review presents the basic biology of coronaviruses, epidemiology of COVID-19, clinical presentations, investigational therapies and vaccines, infection prevention and control measures and the lessons from the present pandemic. EXPERT OPINION The scale of the outbreak has brought the governments, healthcare professionals and scientists around the world under tremendous pressure to devise control strategies and develop novel prevention measures. While availability of vaccine for COVID-19 may take time, the disease may be contained through hand hygiene, physical distancing, travel restriction and aggressive steps such as 'lockdown'. Clinical trials at different phases are ongoing across different countries to expedite development of effective drugs and vaccine to overcome the pandemic.","output":"Covid-19: A Comprehensive Review of a Formidable Foe and the Road Ahead."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The roles of cytokines and chemokines in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (HCM) and HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis (HTBM) are debatable. In sum, 34 HIV-infected patients without meningitis, 44 HCM patients and 27 HTBM patients were enrolled for study. The concentrations of 22 cytokines/chemokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were assayed in at admission. Principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the role of cytokines/chemokines in HCM and HTBM. We found the levels of Th17, Th1 (IL-12p40, IFN-, TNF and TNF-) and Th2 (IL-2/4/5/6/10) cytokines were elevated in patients with meningitis compared with those in HIV-infected patients without CNS infection. Furthermore, the IL-1Ra, IL-12p40, IL-17 and MCP-1 levels were higher in HCM patients, while the IFN-, RANTES and IP-10 levels were higher in HTBM patients. Elevated CSF concentrations of IL-17a, TNF-, IL-5, IL-12p40 and IL-1R were closely related to meningitis, but elevated IP-10, MCP-1, RANTES, and IFN- levels and CSF WBCs were protective factors against HCM. Our study suggested HIV-infected patients with low CSF WBCs have a high risk of HCM. Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines/chemokines mediate differences in the pathogenesis of HCM and TBM.

The cationic cotton contains polycationic short chains produced by a self-propagation of 2-diehtylaminoehtyl chloride (DEAE-Cl) on the surface of cotton fibers. Then, the fabric (i.e., polyDEAE@cotton) can be readily functionalized with anionic photosensitizers like rose Bengal and sodium 2-anthraquinone sulfate to produce biocidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light exposure and consequently provide the photo-induced biocidal functions. The biocidal properties of the photo-induced fabrics (PIFs) were demonstrated by ROS production measurements, bactericidal performance against bacteria (e.g., E coli and L. innocua), and antiviral results against T7 bacteriophage. The PIFs achieved 99.9999% (6 log) reductions against bacteria and the bacteriophage within 60 min of daylight exposure. Moreover, the PIFs showcase excellent washability and photostability, making them ideal materials for reusable face masks and protective suits with improved biological protections compared with traditional PPE. This work demonstrated that the cationized cotton could serve as a platform for different functionalization applications, and the resulting fiber materials could inspire the development of reusable and sustainable PPE with significant bioprotective properties to fight the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the spread of other contagious diseases.","output":"Daylight-Induced Antibacterial and Antiviral Cotton Cloth for Offensive Personal Protection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the status and change in electricity access, sources, and reliability at primary health centers (PHCs) in India; and to understand the effect of regular electricity supply on health services provision and on workforce availability and retention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the lastest two rounds of district-level household survey (DLHS) in India, conducted in 2007C2008 and 2012C2013. RESULTS: Data of 8619 PHCs from DLHS-3 and 8540 PHCs from DLHS-4 were analyzed. The proportion of PHCs with access to electricity increased from 87% to 91%. However, regular electricity supply was available at only 50% of PHCs in 2012C2013, which was an increase from 36% such PHCs in 2007C2008. PHCs with regular electricity supply provided services to 50% more beneficiaries (deliveries and vaccination) than PHCs without regular or no electricity (P  0.001). Increased access to regular electricity was associated with improved availability and retention of health staff (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Government policies should aim to ensure access to regular electricity-supply-beyond just connection from grid-at all GPHCFs, including health sub-centers, PHCs, and community health centers. Indicators on electricity access at GPHCFs could be standardized and integrated into regular health and facility-related surveys as well as in the existing dashboards for real-time data collection. Health policy interventions should be informed by regular data collection and analysis. Improving access to regular electricity supply at GPHCFs can contribute to achieve the goals of National Health Policy of India. This will also help to advance universal health coverage in the country.

The symptoms improved after administration of antibiotics (sulbactam sodium/ampicillin sodium), steroids (dexamethasone), and favipiravir. The patient developed a high fever on the sixth day of hospitalization, and pneumonia was identified on CT. Various culture tests, including tuberculosis, were negative. Thus, remdesivir was administered for COVID-19-induced pneumonia. The patient gradually recovered, was transferred to another hospital, and was discharged on the 35th day of hospitalization. Six previous case reports of COVID-19-induced acute epiglottitis suggested that acute epiglottitis preceded the onset of pneumonia.

Outcomes of various breast augmentation approaches in Asia have not been comprehensively studied. In the past, the inframammary approach to breast augmentation was not popular because of conspicuous scarring. In this article, the authors review academic articles related to the use of an inframammary incision for breast augmentation in Asian women and present our recommendations for the available techniques. METHODS A literature search was performed for articles published after 2015 on Asian women with augmentation mammoplasty describing techniques, incision sites, outcomes, and complications. The search was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. We also included our own technique to demonstrate the outcome of augmentation mammoplasty through inframammary incision. RESULTS Eight articles satisfied our inclusion criteria. Evidence indicates that with proper preoperative design and surgical techniques, scarring resulting from the inframammary approach is not inferior to that resulting from the transaxillary approach in Asian patients. Long-term satisfaction with the inframammary approach to breast augmentation is high in Asian patients.Eight articles reported the outcomes of 1168 women receiving breast augmentation. Inframammary incisions were used in 45.29% of patients (529 patients).

Additional relevant studies were identified by searching the reference lists of included articles. RESULTS Eleven published studies have evaluated the effectiveness of portable HEPA purifiers in eliminating airborne SARS-CoV-2 with relevantly sized surrogate particles. Ten studies evaluated aerosols and submicron particles similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 virions. In all studies, portable HEPA purifiers were able to significantly reduce airborne SARS-CoV-2-surrogate particles. The addition of portable HEPA purifiers augmented other decontamination strategies such as ventilation. CONCLUSION Experimental studies provide evidence for portable HEPA purifiers' potential to eliminate airborne SARS-CoV-2 and augment primary decontamination strategies such as ventilation. Based on filtration rates, additional air exchanges provided by portable HEPA purifiers may be calculated and room shutdown times potentially reduced after aerosol-generating procedures.","output":"Portable HEPA Purifiers to Eliminate Airborne SARS-CoV-2: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The PEPaNIC randomised controlled trial, which recruited 1440 critically ill infants and children in 2012-15, showed that withholding parenteral nutrition for 1 week (late-parenteral nutrition), compared with early supplementation within 24 h of admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (early-parenteral nutrition), prevented infections, accelerated recovery, and improved neurocognitive development assessed 2 years later. Because several neurocognitive domains can only be thoroughly assessed from age 4 years onwards, we aimed to determine the effect of late-parenteral nutrition versus early-parenteral nutrition on physical, neurocognitive, and emotional and behavioural development 4 years after randomisation. METHODS This is a preplanned, blinded, 4-year follow-up study of participants included in the PEPaNIC trial (done at University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium; Erasmus Medical Centre Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands; and Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, AB, Canada) and of matched healthy children. Studied outcomes were anthropometrics; health status; parent-reported or caregiver-reported executive functions, and emotional and behavioural problems; and clinical tests for intelligence, visual-motor integration, alertness, motor coordination, and memory. Through multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses, after imputation for missing values (30%) and adjustment for risk factors, we investigated the effect of early-parenteral nutrition versus late-parenteral nutrition. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01536275. FINDINGS Between March 8, 2016, and Nov 8, 2019, 684 children from the original PEPaNIC trial (356 from the late-parenteral nutrition group and 328 from the early-parenteral nutrition group) were assessed for neurocognitive development at 4-years follow-up. Compared with the control group (369 healthy children), children who had critical illness had lower height (-estimate -211 [95% CI -315 to -106]; p<00001) and head circumference (-042 [-067 to -018]; p=0.00077); and worse health status (eg, hospital admission odds ratio 427 [95% CI 312 to 584]; p<00001), neurocognitive (eg, parent-reported or caregiver-reported total executive functioning -estimate 357 [95% CI 195 to 518], p<00001; total intelligence quotient -735 [-931 to -539], p<00001), and parent-reported or caregiver-reported emotional and behavioural developmental outcomes (internalising 273 [119 to 428], p=000055; externalising 163 [019 to 308], p=0027; and total behavioural problems 295 [144 to 446], p=000013), adjusted for risk factors. Outcomes were never worse in the late-parenteral nutrition group compared with the early-parenteral nutrition group, but patients in the late-parenteral nutrition group had fewer parent-reported or caregiver-reported internalising (-estimate -188 [95% CI -369 to -007]; p=0042), externalising (-173 [-343 to -003]; p=0046), and total emotional and behavioural problems (-244 [-422 to -067]; p=00070) than patients who had received early-parenteral nutrition, after adjusting for risk factors, and were no longer different from healthy controls for these outcomes. INTERPRETATION Omitting early parenteral nutrition use for critically ill children did not adversely affect long-term outcomes 4 years after randomisation and protected against emotional and behavioural problems, further supporting the deimplementation of early parenteral nutrition.

However, investigation in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) is limited and the mechanisms by which inflammation occurs have not been well elucidated. Marine long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs) have anti-inflammatory actions and may reduce scWAT inflammation. METHODS: Subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) biopsies were collected from individuals living with obesity (n=45) and normal weight individuals (n=39) prior to and following a 12-week intervention with either 3 g/day of a fish oil concentrate (providing 1.1 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + 0.8 g docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) or 3 g/day of corn oil. ScWAT fatty acid, oxylipin, and transcriptome profiles were assessed by gas chromatography, ultra-pure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR, respectively. FINDINGS: Obesity was associated with greater scWAT inflammation demonstrated by lower concentrations of specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and hydroxy-DHA metabolites and an altered transcriptome with differential expression of genes involved in LC n-3 PUFA activation, oxylipin synthesis, inflammation, and immune response. Intervention with LC n-3 PUFAs increased their respective metabolites including the SPM precursor 14-hydroxy-DHA in normal weight individuals and decreased arachidonic acid derived metabolites and expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory response with a greater effect in normal weight individuals. INTERPRETATION: Downregulated expression of genes responsible for fatty acid activation and metabolism may contribute to an inflammatory oxylipin profile and limit the effects of LC n-3 PUFAs in obesity. There may be a need for personalised LC n-3 PUFA supplementation based on obesity status.

The virus-encoded non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) is a bi-functional enzyme consisting of an exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain and plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Here, we report the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN domain bound to its co-factor nsp10 and show that, compared to the SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14-full-length complex, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN retains an integral exoribonuclease fold and preserves an active configuration in the catalytic center. Analysis of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN interface reveals a footprint in nsp10 extensively overlapping with that observed in the nsp10/nsp16 structure. A marked difference in the co-factor when engaging nsp14 and nsp16 lies in helix-1, which is further experimentally ascertained to be involved in nsp14-binding but not in nsp16-engagement. Finally, we also show that nsp10/nsp14-ExoN is enzymatically active despite the absence of nsp14-MTase domain.

We investigate, evaluate, and quantify such bias for these trials at our institution. METHODS Demographic, clinical, imaging, and angiographic data were prospectively collected on a consecutive cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were enrolled in formal trials of endovascular stroke therapy (EST) or received EST in clinical practice outside of a randomized trial for acute cerebral ischemia at a single tertiary referral center from September 2004 to December 2012. RESULTS Among patients considered appropriate for EST in practice, 47% were eligible for trials, with rates for individual trials ranging from 17% to 70%. Compared with trial ineligible patients treated with EST, trial eligible patients were younger (67 vs. 74 years; p<0.05), more often treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (53% vs. 34%; p<0.01), and had shorter last known well to puncture times (328 vs. 367 min; p<0.05). Focusing on the largest trial with a non-interventional control arm, compared with trial eligible patients treated with EST outside the trial, enrolled patients presented later (274 vs. 163 min; p<0.001), had higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (20 vs. 17; p<0.05), and larger strokes (diffusion weighted imaging volumes 49 vs. 18; p<0.001).

Following initial infection of airway epithelia, SARS-CoV-2 invades a wide range of cells in multiple organs, including pancreatic islet cells. Diabetes is now recognized as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalisation and death. Additionally, COVID-19 is associated with higher risk of new-onset diabetes and metabolic complications of diabetes. One mechanism by which these deleterious outcomes may occur is via destruction of insulin-producing islet ? cells, either directly by SARS-CoV-2 entry into ? cells or indirectly due to inflammation and fibrosis in the surrounding microenvironment. While the canonical pathway of viral entry via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been established as a major route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung, it may not be solely responsible for viral entry into the endocrine pancreas. This is likely due to divergent expression of viral entry factors amongst different tissues. For example, expression of ACE2 has not been unequivocally demonstrated in ? cells. Thus, it is important to understand how other proteins known to be highly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, with the view that these could be targeted to prevent demise of the ? cell in COVID-19. To that end, this review discusses alternate receptors of SARS-CoV-2 (CD147 and GRP78), as well as mediators (furin, TMPRSS2, cathepsin L, ADAM17, neuropilin-1 and heparan sulphate) that may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into pancreatic islets independent of or in conjunction with ACE2.","output":"Going viral in the islet: mediators of SARS-CoV-2 entry beyond ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare deep-rooted racial and gender disparities in the United States.

METHODS Ninety-six patients diagnosed with Covid-19 were included in our study. Demographic features (Age, gender, co-morbidities), symptoms, thorax CT findings, Covid-19 PCR results and laboratory findings were recorded. The clinical features of the patients were analysed and kidney function values before Covid-19 diagnosis were compared with kidney function values after Covid-19 diagnosis. RESULTS Most presenting symptom was fever (51%). Most accompanying co-morbidity was hypertension (56%). According to laboratory findings; ferritin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels were statistically significantly higher in ARDS group than severe pneumonia and pneumonia group (P = .002, P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Also lymphocyte levels were statistically significantly lower in ARDS group than severe pneumonia and pneumonia group (P = .042).

The virus genome analysis during disease spread reveals about its evolution and transmission. We did whole genome sequencing of 225 clinical strains from the state of Odisha in eastern India using ARTIC protocol-based amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of all five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C in the population. The analyses revealed two major routes for the introduction of the disease in India i.e. Europe and South-east Asia followed by local transmission. Interestingly, 19B clade was found to be much more prevalent in our sequenced genomes (17%) as compared to other genomes reported so far from India. The haplogroup analysis for clades showed evolution of 19A and 19B in parallel whereas the 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. Majority of the 19A and 19B clades were present in cases that migrated from Gujarat state in India suggesting it to be one of the major initial points of disease transmission in India during month of March and April. We found that with the time 20A and 20B clades evolved drastically that originated from central Europe. At the same time, it has been observed that 20A and 20B clades depicted selection of four common mutations i.e. 241 C>T (5UTR), P323L in RdRP, F942F in NSP3 and D614G in the spike protein. We found an increase in the concordance of G614 mutation evolution with the viral load in clinical samples as evident from decreased Ct value of spike and Orf1ab gene in qPCR. Molecular modelling and docking analysis identified that D614G mutation enhanced interaction of spike with TMPRSS2 protease, which could impact the shedding of S1 domain and infectivity of the virus in host cells.","output":"SARS-CoV2 genome analysis of Indian isolates and molecular modelling of D614G mutated spike protein with TMPRSS2 depicted its enhanced interaction and virus infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since this time a concerted global effort of research and observational data gathering has meant that a great deal has been learnt about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with lymphoid malignancies. Approximately one-third of patients with lymphoid malignancies who acquire COVID-19 and have it severely enough to require hospital assessment will die from this infection. Major risk factors for a poor outcome are age and co-morbidities, but when these are taken into account lymphoma patients have a slightly greater than 2-fold increased risk compared to the general population. Notably, despite early concerns regarding the particular vulnerability of lymphoma patients due to the immunosuppressive effects of therapy, active treatment, including B-cell depleting agents such as rituximab, do not appear to be associated with an increased risk of a poorer outcome. Indeed, some treatments such as ibrutinib may be beneficial due to their modulation of the potential fatal hyperinflammatory phase of infection. There are risks associated with hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, but the collective experience is that these can be minimized by preventive strategies and that the majority of transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection will survive. Many questions remain including those regarding the outcome of COVID-19 infection in the rarer lymphoid malignancies and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in lymphoma patients.

We addressed this gap by conducting an online survey of members of IPV and sexual assault workforce using a broad, web-based recruitment strategy. In total, 352 staff from 24 states participated. We collaborated with practitioner networks and anti-violence coalitions to develop the brief survey, which included questions about work and health, safety planning, and stress. We used chi-square, t-test, and ANOVA analysis techniques to analyze differences within position and demographic variables. For qualitative data, we used thematic analysis to analyze responses from four open-ended questions. The sample was majority female-identified (93.7%) and essential workers in dual IPV and sexual assault programs (80.7%). Findings demonstrated that since the pandemic began, IPV and sexual assault staff are experiencing more personal and professional stressors, perceive a decrease in client safety, and lack resources needed to help survivors and themselves. Common problems included a lack of food or supplies at home and work and housing and financial support for survivors. There was a 51% increase in the use of video conference for work, which contributed to workforce strain. Reductions in overall service capacity and a shift to remote service provision have implications for both survivors and staff. These findings suggest a critical need for additional training, infrastructure, and support for the IPV and sexual assault workforce.

Human interaction with autonomous systems is broadly studied, but research has hitherto under-explored interactions that occur while the system is actively learning, and can noticeably change its behaviour in minutes. In this pilot study, we investigate how the interaction between a human and a continually learning prediction agent develops as the agent develops competency. Additionally, we compare two different agent architectures to assess how representational choices in agent design affect the human-agent interaction. We develop a virtual reality environment and a time-based prediction task wherein learned predictions from a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm augment human predictions. We assess how a participant's performance and behaviour in this task differs across agent types, using both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our findings suggest that human trust of the system may be influenced by early interactions with the agent, and that trust in turn affects strategic behaviour, but limitations of the pilot study rule out any conclusive statement. We identify trust as a key feature of interaction to focus on when considering RL-based technologies, and make several recommendations for modification to this study in preparation for a larger-scale investigation.

Evidence on cost-effectiveness, which can help inform use of limited resources, is scarce in this area and therefore the purpose of this systematic review is to critically appraise and consolidate the current evidence on economic evaluations of ABI rehabilitation interventions. Methods: Systematic review methodology will be applied to identify, select and extract data from published economic evaluation studies (trial-based, non-trial based, simulation-based, decision model and trial-based model economic evaluations) of ABI treatment interventions in adults. A systematic literature search will be conducted on the following electronic databases: EMBASE, Econlit, CINAHL, Medline, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database and PsyclNFO. This review will only include cost-effectiveness analysis studies (e.g., cost per life year gained), cost-benefit and cost minimisation analyses in which the designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCT studies, cost-utility analyses (e.g., cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained or cost per disability-adjusted life year averted), cohort studies, and modelling studies. Only studies that were published in the english language, associated with adults who have an ABI will be included. There will be no restrictions on perspective, sample size, country, follow-up duration or setting. The search strategy terms will include the following: acquired brain injury, brain*; cost*; or cost-benefit analysis*. Following data extraction, a narrative summary and tables will be used to summarize the characteristics and results of included studies.

This paper takes an alternative view: if not unpredictable, the crisis unfolding in the United Kingdom (UK) is not unprecedented. Rather, it is foretold in accounts of successive animal health crises. Social studies of biosecurity and animal disease management provide an anticipatory logic - a mirror to the unfolding human catastrophe of Covid-19, providing few surprises. And yet, these accounts appear to be routinely ignored in the narrative of Covid-19. Do social studies of animal disease really have no value when it comes to guiding and assessing responses to Covid-19? To answer this question, we describe the narrative arc of the UK's approach to managing Covid-19. We then overlay findings from social studies of animal disease to reveal the warnings they provided for a pandemic like Covid-19. We conclude by reflecting on the reasons why these studies have been paid minimal attention and the extent to which the failure to learn from these lessons of animal health management signals a failure of the One Health agenda.","output":"Missed Opportunities?

Furthermore, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients including watery diarrhea, vomitingparticularly in childrennausea, and abdominal pain. Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents significant similarities to those of some immune-mediated diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases or rheumatoid arthritis, leading to the hypothesis that targeted therapies used for the treatment of immune-mediated disease could be effective to treat (and possibly prevent) the main complications of COVID-19. In this review, we synthesize the present and future impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gastrointestinal system and on gastroenterology practice, hypothesizing a potential role of the gut-lung axis and perhaps of the gut and lung microbiota into the interindividual differential susceptibility to COVID-19 19 disease.

Fast induction of anesthesia, maintenance of healthy vital rates, and predictable recoveries are priorities. From September 2010 to May 2012, we investigated these attributes in captive and wild grizzly bears anesthetized with a combination of a reversible 2 agonist (dexmedetomidine [dexM], the dextrorotatory enantiomer of medetomidine) and a nonreversible N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) agonist and tranquilizer (tiletamine and zolazepam [TZ], respectively). A smaller-than-expected dose of the combination (1.23 mg tiletamine, 1.23 mg zolazepam, and 6.04 g dexmedetomidine per kg bear) produced reliable, fast ataxia (3.7  0.5 min, x?SE) and workable anesthesia (8.1  0.6 min) in captive adult grizzly bears. For wild bears darted from a helicopter, a dose of 2.06 mg tiletamine, 2.06 mg zolazepam, and 10.1 g dexmedetomidine/kg produced ataxia in 2.5  0.3 min and anesthesia in 5.5  1.0 min. Contrary to published accounts of bear anesthesia with medetomidine, tiletamine, and zolazepam, this combination did not cause hypoxemia or hypoventilation, although mild bradycardia (<50 beats per min) occurred in most bears during the active season. With captive bears, effective dose rates during hibernation were approximately half those during the active season. The time to first signs of recovery after the initial injection of dexMTZ was influenced by heart rate (P<0.001) and drug dose (P<0.001). Intravenous (IV) injection of the reversal agent, atipamezole, significantly decreased recovery time (i.e., standing on all four feet and reacting to the surrounding environment) relative to intramuscular injection. Recovery times (25  8 min) following IV injections of the recommended dose of atipamezole (10 g/g of dexmedetomidine) and half that dose (5 g/g) did not differ. However, we recommend use of the full dose based on the appearance of a more complete recovery.

The spreading pandemic within a few months covered all continents and had a significant impact on the socio-economic situation of all countries. We studied the time of the 20% drop in stock market indices. This is a value that is taken as a sign of a crisis. In order to assess the probability of indices value decrease, we use the KaplanCMeiers estimator.

The intensity and risk of the decline of stock indices varied from continent to continent. The obtained results show that the intensity is highest in the fourth and eighth week after the peak and is the highest on European exchanges and then American and Asian exchanges (including Australia). The risk of falling the stock indices prices is the highest in America, followed by Europe, Asia and Australia, and lowest in Africa.

We investigated the relationship between Ang (1C7) level and disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19). METHODS: This cohort study was carried out at Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran from September 2020 to October 2020. To do so, the Ang (1C7) levels of 331 hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients with and without underlying disease were measured by ELISA kit. The need for oxygen, intubation, and mechanical ventilation were recorded for all the patients. RESULTS: Results showed a significant inverse relationship between the levels of Ang 1C7 and the severity of the disease (needed oxygen, intubation, and mechanical ventilation). According to the results, median (interquartile range) of Ang (1C7) levels was significantly lower in patients who needed oxygen versus those who needed no oxygen (44.50 (91) vs. 82.25 (68), p = 0.002), patients who needed intubation and mechanical ventilation versus those who did not (9.80 (62) vs. 68.70 (102), p < 0.000) and patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) than people hospitalized in other wards.

Presently, CO(2) and H(2)S content in gas fields accounts for up to 90% and 15%, respectively. Apart from fulfilling the market demand, CO(2) and H(2)S removal from natural gas is critical due to their corrosive natures, the low heating value of natural gas and the greenhouse gas effect. To date, several gas fields have remained unexplored due to limited technologies to monetize the highly sour natural gas. A variety of conventional technologies have been implemented to purify natural gas such as absorption, adsorption and membrane and cryogenic separation. The application of these technologies in natural gas upgrading are also presented. Among these commercial technologies, cryogenic technology has advanced rapidly in gas separation and proven ideally suitable for bulk CO(2) removal due to its independence from absorbents or adsorbents, which require a larger footprint, weight and energy. Present work comprehensively reviews the mechanisms and potential of the advanced nonconventional cryogenic separation technologies for processing of natural gas streams with high CO(2) and H(2)S content.

METHODS: Two hundred thirty-nine patients with 273 nodules were enrolled in this retrospective study. Each nodule was categorized according to the CEUS LI-RADS version 2017 and CECT/MRI LI-RADS version 2017. The diagnostic performance of CEUS and CECT/MRI was compared. The reference standard was histopathology diagnosis. Inter-modality agreement was assessed with Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: The inter-modality agreement for CEUS LI-RADS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS was fair with a kappa value of 0.319 (p < 0.001). The positive predictive values (PPVs) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in LR-5, LR-4, and LR-3 were 98.3%, 60.0%, and 25.0% in CEUS, and 95.9%, 65.7%, and 48.1% in CECT/MRI, respectively. The sensitivities and specificities of LR-5 for diagnosing HCC were 75.6% and 93.8% in CEUS, and 83.6% and 83.3% in CECT/MRI, respectively. The positive predictive values of non-HCC malignancy in CEUS LR-M and CECT/MRI LR-M were 33.9% and 93.3%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosing non-HCC malignancy were 90.9%, 84.5%, and 85.0% in CEUS LR-M and 63.6%, 99.6%, and 96.7% in CECT/MRI LR-M, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The inter-modality agreement of the LI-RADS category between CEUS and CECT/MRI is fair. The positive predictive values of HCCs in LR-5 of the CEUS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS are comparable.

However, in the setting of the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, alternative care models should be explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home immunotherapy self-administration (HITSA) in a highly idealized circumstance for provision of maintenance AIT in a shelter-in-place or other scenarios of unforeseen reduction in nonessential medical services. METHODS: Markov modeling was used to compare in-office clinic AIT in selected patients using cohort analysis and microsimulation from the societal and health care perspectives. RESULTS: Assuming similar SRIT rates, HITSA was found to be a cost-effective option with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $44,554/quality-adjusted life-year when considering both incremental epinephrine autoinjector costs and coronavirus disease 2019 risks. Excluding epinephrine autoinjector costs, HISTA dominated other options. However, outside of pandemic considerations, HITSA was not cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $198,877,286) at annual epinephrine autoinjector costs above $287. As the incremental HITSA SRIT rate increased above 15%, clinic AIT was the most cost-effective strategy. Excluding both pandemic risks and risk of motor vehicle accident fatality from round-trip clinic transit, clinic AIT dominated other strategies. Clinic AIT was the more cost-effective option at very high fatality relative risk for HITSA or at very low annual risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Under idealized assumptions HITSA can be a safe and cost-effective option during a global pandemic in appropriately selected patients provided home rates of SRIT remain stable.","output":"Health and Economic Outcomes of Home Maintenance Allergen Immunotherapy in Select Patients with High Health Literacy during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis During Exceptional Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this rapid review is to provide an update on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments, our patients, and our new way of working.

Demographic details and insurance payer were captured for telemedicine visits and compared to in-person encounters. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate the association of demographic, socioeconomic factors and visit type. RESULTS: A total of 712 patients (32.3%) engaged in 1,085 telemedicine visits. Telemedicine represented 80% and 66% of all encounters during April and May, respectively and averaged 11.8% between June and November. Use was similar across age groups, gender, race and insurance payer status between telemedicine versus in-person encounters.

Two Korean cohorts were analysed, and subgroup GWAS was conducted for appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) and skeletal muscle index. The effects of significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene expression were also investigated using multiple expression quantitative trait loci datasets, differentially expressed gene analysis, and gene ontology analyses. Novel genetic biomarkers were identified for LBM (rs1187118; rs3768582) and ASM (rs6772958). Their related genes, including RPS10, NUDT3, NCF2, SMG7, and ARPC5, were differently expressed in skeletal muscle tissue, while GPD1L was not. Furthermore, the 'mRNA destabilisation' biological process was enriched for sarcopenia. Our study identified RPS10, NUDT3, and GPD1L as significant genetic biomarkers for sarcopenia.

We report here that mice defective in both the granule exocytosis and death receptor pathways of cytotoxicity display increased susceptibility to JEV. The two cell contact-dependent cytotoxic effector mechanisms act redundantly within the CNS to reduce disease severity. We also demonstrate that IFN- is critical in recovery from primary infection with JEV by a mechanism involving suppression of virus growth in the CNS, and that T cells are the main source of the cytokine that promotes viral clearance from the brain. Finally, we show by in vivo depletion of NK cells that this innate immune cell population is dispensable for control of JEV infection in the periphery and in the CNS. Accordingly, cell contact-dependent cytolytic and IFN--dependent noncytolytic clearance of virus mediated by T cells trafficking into the CNS help in recovery from lethal infection in a mouse model of Japanese encephalitis.","output":"Cytolytic effector pathways and IFN- help protect against Japanese encephalitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preventive isolation measures taken by most states in relation to the pandemic by Covid-19, forced educational institutions to suspend face-to-face classes and replace them with virtual classes, without the actors involved necessarily being prepared.

These five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological roles in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. Of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline is negligible in many plant-source foods. Consumption of 30 g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also provide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological, muscular, cartilage, neurological, and cardiovascular health. The present review provides the public with the much-needed knowledge of nutritionally and physiologically significant amino acids, dipeptides and creatine in animal-source foods (including beef). Dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and ageing-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis, improving skin and bone health, ameliorating neurological abnormalities, and promoting well being in infants, children and adults. Furthermore, these nutrients may promote the immunological defense of humans against infections by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (including coronavirus) through enhancing the metabolism and functions of monocytes, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system.

To reach this goal, the manufacturing and logistic processes should be affordable to all countries, irrespectively of economical and climatic conditions. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are bacterial-derived vesicles that can be engineered to incorporate heterologous antigens. Given the inherent adjuvanticity, such modified OMVs can be used as vaccine to induce potent immune responses against the associated protein. Here we show that OMVs engineered to incorporate peptides derived from the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 elicit an effective immune response in immunized mice, resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies. The immunity induced by the vaccine is sufficient to protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing both virus replication in the lungs and the pathology associated with virus infection. Furthermore, we show that OMVs can be effectively decorated with RBM peptides derived from a different genetic variant of SARS-CoV-2, inducing a similarly potent neutralization activity in vaccinated mice. Altogether, given the convenience associated with ease of engineering, production and distribution, our results demonstrate that OMV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be a crucial addition to the vaccines currently available.","output":"Immunogenicity and pre-clinical efficacy of an OMV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Canadian nurses are at the forefront of patient care delivery. Although the use of digital health technologies for care delivery is gaining momentum in Canada, nurses are encouraged to integrate virtual care into their practice. In early 2020, more Canadian nurses delivered care virtually compared with 3 years ago. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to uncover the professional characteristics of Canadian nurses accessing virtual care in 2020, understand how these characteristics differ across types of technologies, investigate whether the nurses accessing virtual care possess the skills and knowledge needed to use these technologies, and determine the important drivers of the uptake of virtual care observed in 2020. METHODS: We used data from the 2017 and 2020 National Survey of Canadian Nurses. This survey collected data on the use of digital health technologies in nursing practice. It concerned regulated nursing professionals working in different health care settings and from different domains of nursing practice. We combined the chi-square independence test and logistic regression analysis to uncover the most relevant drivers of virtual care uptake by nurses in 2020. RESULTS: In early 2020, before the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses who delivered care virtually were predominantly nurse practitioners (135/159, 84.9%) and more likely to work in a primary or community care setting (202/367, 55%) and in an urban setting (194/313, 61.9%). Factors such as nursing designation (P<.001), perceived quality of care at the health facility where the nurses practiced (P<.001), and the type of patient recordCkeeping system they had access to (P=.04) had a statistically significant effect on the probability of nurses to deliver care virtually in early 2020. Furthermore, nurses perception of the quality of care they delivered through virtual technologies was statistically associated with their perception of the skills ((2)(4)=308.7; P<.001) and knowledge ((2)(4)=283.4; P<.001) to use these technologies. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the critical importance of nursing designation, geographic location, and type of patient recordCkeeping system in predicting virtual care integration in nursing practice. The findings related to geographic location can be used by decision-makers for better allocation of digital health resources among care settings in rural and urban areas. Similarly, the disparities observed across nursing designations have some implications for the digital training of nurses at all levels of practice. Finally, the association between electronic medical record use and uptake of virtual care could accelerate the implementation of more modernized record-keeping systems in care settings. Hence, this could advance interoperability and improve health care delivery.","output":"Uncovering Important Drivers of the Increase in the Use of Virtual Care Technologies in Nursing Care: Quantitative Analysis From the 2020 National Survey of Canadian Nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, spreading to the rest of the globe, becoming a pandemic. Some studies have shown an association between pregnancy status and severe COVID-19 cytokine storm, some, in contrast. OBJECTIVE The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between pregnancy status and the clinical COVID -19 severity characterized by cytokine storm through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting pregnancy status and comparing theCOVID-19 severity cytokine storm outcome were included. The COVID-19 severity characterized by cytokine storm was described using parameters such as; Intensive Care Unit Admission, Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, Mechanical Ventilation, Hospital Admission, Pro and Inflammatory cytokine levels, consolidation on chest CT scan, pulmonary infiltration, extreme fevers as characteristic of cytokine storm, syndromic severity, higher neutrophil count indicative of cytokine storm and severe COVI-19 presentation. RESULTS A total of 17 articles detailing 840332 COVID-19 women were included. This meta-analysis revealed a correlation between positive pregnancy status and severe COVID-19 cytokine storm (random effect model, OR=2.47; 95% CI: 1.63-3.73; P<.001), with a cumulative incidence of 6432 (14.1%) and 24352 (3.1%) among pregnant and non-pregnant women with COVI-19 respectively. Heterogeneity analysis shifted from: (random effect model, OR=2.47; 95% CI: 1.63-3.73; P<.001) to (fixed effect model, OR= 7.41; 95% CI: 7.02-7.83; P<.001) revealing a correlation between severe pregnancy status and COVID-19 with cytokine storm. A funnel plot was used to evaluate publication bias and revealed considerable heterogeneity between all the pooled studies (I2 = 98 %; P<.001). Furthermore, this updated analysis showed substantially low heterogeneity (I2 = 29 %; P = 0.19 ;), while a funnel plot revealed no publication bias. Further to this, the sub-analysis between Single Centre and Multiple Centre studies demonstrated seemingly the same as heterogeneity (I2 = 72 and (I2 = 98), respectively. Sensitivity analysis on each sub-group revealed that pregnancy was significantly related to severe COVID-19 with cytokine storm from single Centre studies, (fixed effect model, OR= 3.97; 95% CI: 2.26-6.95; P< .001) with very low heterogeneity (I2 = 2 %; P = 0.42).

OBJECTIVES: Prior to a pilot study exploring the potential for electronic patient-reported symptom monitoring, the content of an online intervention was developed via Delphi methodology. DESIGN AND SETTING: A Delphi process was conducted aiming to obtain consensus amongst the clinicians and patients from 4 hospitals on the key aspects to monitor during follow-up after ovarian cancer treatment, and how to monitor them in an online intervention. A two round Delphi was conducted. Consensus was defined as at least 70% agreement. RESULTS: Out of 43 participants, 30 (18 patients, 12 healthcare professionals) completed round 1 and 19 (11 patients, 8 healthcare professionals) completed round 2. Consensus was reached on the key symptoms to monitor, and the importance of monitoring both duration and frequency of symptoms. Opportunity for review of psychological wellbeing and holistic needs were considered important by both groups. The frequency of online questionnaire completion, timeframe for patients to reflect on (e.g. during the past X weeks), and the choice of PROMs items to monitor symptoms did not reach the consensus threshold. CONCLUSION: It is crucial that any intervention and the selection of PROMs is fully described to ensure transparency about the development and decisions taken.

Healthcare professionals' attitudes toward psychological support were analyzed. The levels of anxiety, depression, psychological stress, and professional quality of life (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and compassion fatigue) and attitudes toward psychological support were measured among 627 Italian healthcare workers (mean age = 40.55 years; SD = 11.49; range: 27-72).

In this study we compare in a porcine model the anastomoses created using the LigaSure(?) device with those created with a stapler after section and closure of a rectal stump. METHODS Thirty pigs underwent laparoscopic colorectal anastomosis. In group A (n = 15), the division of the intestine and distal stump closure were done with a 10-mm LigaSure Atlas(?) device. In group B, these steps were carried out using an endoscopic stapler. Subsequently, the colorectal anastomosis was performed using circular stapling in both groups. The 4-week follow-up included health status, weight gain, blood tests, X-rays, and colonoscopy. Anastomotic tissue was processed to study the mechanical tensile strength and histopathology. RESULTS There was no difference in the rate of conversion to open surgery or in average operating time between the groups. In the sealing device group, there was a significantly higher rate of failure in rectal stump closure (p = 0.042). There was one death in group B due to anastomotic leak. There was no difference in adhesion formation or stenosis. Mid-section anastomosis area was 89.7 mm(2) in group A compared with 100 mm(2) in group B (p = 0.52). In tensile strength studies, the maximum load resisted by the sample was 13.8  4.9 N (group A) versus 15.7  4.4 N (group B) (p = 0.17). There was no difference between the groups in degree of reepithelialization, number of inflammatory cells, or the presence of microabscesses. CONCLUSIONS Division and sealing of the rectal stump with the LigaSure(?) device is feasible in the proposed experimental model, but it is less reliable than conventional closure with a stapler, since it has a significantly greater failure rate.

OBJECTIVE: This studys aim is to assess the use of digital technology in prosthetics and orthotics, and whether its use can help overcome challenges posed by the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey of working prosthetists, orthotists, and lower limb patients was conducted between June and July 2020 and divided into three sections: lower limb amputees, prosthetist and orthotist (P&O) currently using digital technologies in their practice, and P&O not using any digital technology. Input was sought from industry and academia experts for the development of the survey. Descriptive analyses were performed for both qualitative (open-ended questions) and quantitative data. RESULTS: In total, 113 individuals responded to the web-based survey. There were 83 surveys included in the analysis (patients: n=13, 15%; prosthetists and orthotists: n=70, 85%). There were 30 surveys excluded because less than 10% of the questions were answered. Out of 70 P&Os, 31 (44%) used digital technologies. Three dimensional scanning and digital imaging were the leading technologies being used (27/31, 88%), primarily for footwear (18/31, 58%), ankle-foot orthoses, and transtibial and transfemoral sockets (14/31, 45%). Digital technology enables safer care during COVID-19 with 24 out of 31 (77%) respondents stating it improves patient outcomes. Singapore was significantly less certain that the industry's future is digital (P=.04). The use of virtual care was reported by the P&O to be beneficial for consultations, education, patient monitoring, or triaging purposes. However, the technology could not overcome inherent barriers such as the lack of details normally obtained during a physical assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Digital technology is transforming health care. The current pandemic highlights its usefulness in providing safer care, but digital technology must be implemented thoughtfully and designed to address issues that are barriers to current adoption. Technology advancements using virtual platforms, digitalization methods, and improved connectivity will continue to change the future of health care delivery.

This review provides an overview of all aspects of PO screening that need to be considered when introducing this methodology. PO screening for CCHD is effective, simple, quick, reliable, cost-effective and does not lead to extra burden for parents and caregivers. Test accuracy can be influenced by targets definition, gestational age, timing of screening and antenatal detection of CCHD. Early screening can lead to more false positive screenings, but has the potential to detect significant pathology earlier. There is no apparent difference in accuracy between screening with post-ductal measurements only, compared with screening using pre-ductal and post-ductal measurements. However, adding pre-ductal measurements identifies cases of CCHD which would have been missed by post-ductal screening. Screening at higher altitudes leads to more false positives. Important non-cardiac pathology is found in 35-74% of false positives in large studies. Screening is feasible in neonatal intensive care units and out-of-hospital births. Training caregivers, simplifying the algorithm and using computer-based interpretation tools can improve the quality of the screening. Caregivers need to consider all aspects of screening to enable them to choose an optimal protocol for implementation of CCHD screening in their specific setting.","output":"Aspects of pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects: when, how and why?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endothelium has a rich vesicular network that allows the exchange of macromolecules between blood and parenchymal cells. This feature of endothelial cells, along with their polarized secretory machinery, makes them the second major contributor, after platelets, to the particulate secretome in circulation.

Cargo molecules carried by EVs were shown to contribute to the physiological functions of endothelium and may support the plasticity and adaptation of endothelial cells in a paracrine manner. Endothelium-derived vesicles can also contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease or can serve as prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, endothelium-derived EVs can be used as therapeutic tools to target endothelium for drug delivery or target stromal cells via the endothelial cells. In this review we revisit the recent evidence on the heterogeneity and plasticity of endothelial cells and their EVs.

The field is in need of technology that helps bridge the macroscopic and microscopic regimes. To solve this problem, we developed a fiducial marker (FM) simultaneously compatible with 2-color near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700 and 800 nm), autoradiography, and conventional hematoxylin-eosin (HE) histology. METHODS The FM was constructed from an optimized concentration of commercially available human serum albumin, 700- and 800-nm NIR fluorophores, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and glutaraldehyde. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells coexpressing the sodium iodide symporter and green fluorescent protein were labeled with 700-nm fluorophore and (99m)Tc-pertechnatate and then administered intratracheally into CD-1 mice. After in vivo SPECT imaging and ex vivo SPECT and NIR fluorescence imaging of the lungs, 30-m frozen sections were prepared and processed for 800-nm NIR fluorophore costaining, autoradiography, and HE staining on the same slide using the FMs to coregister all datasets. RESULTS Optimized FMs, composed of 100 M unlabeled human serum albumin, 1 M NIR fluorescent human serum albumin, 15% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), were prepared within 15 min, displayed homogeneity and stability, and were visible by all imaging modalities, including HE staining. Using these FMs, tissue displaying high signal by SPECT could be dissected and analyzed on the same slide and at the microscopic level for 700-nm NIR fluorescence, 800-nm NIR fluorescence, autoradiography, and HE histopathologic staining.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of a cohort of Brazilian hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 and assess their mortality rate and risk factors for death. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 741 Brazilian hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 from FebCDec/2020, of 52 dialysis centers of the country. We analyzed comorbid conditions, sociodemographic factors, and dialysis-related parameters. To detect risk factors for mortality in hemodialysis patients, we performed multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Survival was analyzed by KaplanCMeier. RESULTS: From 9877 hemodialysis patients, 741 were diagnosed with COVID-19. Mean age was 57  16 years, 61% were male, and 51% white. The most frequent symptoms were fever (54.1%), cough (50.9%), and dyspnea (37.2%); 14.2% were asymptomatic. There were 139 deaths (18.8%), with 66% within the diseases first 15 days. 333 patients (44.9%) required hospitalization, and 211 (28.5%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. The cumulative probability of survival at 90 days of diagnosis was 79% (95% CI 76C82%). In the fully adjusted multivariate model, the risk factors significantly associated with death were diabetes mellitus (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05C2.19, P = 0.026), use of a central venous catheter (CVC) (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.22C2.64, P = 0.003), age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01C1.04, P < 0.001), and origin from the North vs. Southeast region (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.01C6.68, P = 0.047).

We aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of a major care home outbreak in Denmark. Methods After a staff member had been tested positive on 16 November 2020, a bundle approach programme was initiated including frequent surveillance screenings of residents and staff, isolation and cohorting procedures. This approach also involved limiting the number of visitors and enhancing the use of personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Available positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic relationships between the outbreak and local circulating strains were reconstructed. Results In all, 50% (56/114) of residents and 26% (49/190) of staff members became infected during the 46-day outbreak period. Altogether 16% of the infected residents died within 30 days after becoming infected. A total of 44% (46/105) of the samples with SARS-CoV-2 were sequenced. and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a dominant outbreak lineage belonging to Global Lineage B.1.1.29 containing the mutation I233V in the S gene. The outbreak lineage was detected in the community 28 days before its introduction into the care home. Conclusions Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to care homes is associated with severe outbreaks.

METHODS A randomized, double-blind, active-comparator study of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled (HbA1c 6.5-8.5%) by metformin monotherapy. Patients received vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or glimepiride (up to 6 mg/day) added to metformin. RESULTS In all, 3118 patients were randomized (vildagliptin, n = 1562; glimepiride, n = 1556). From similar baseline values (7.3%), after 2 years adjusted mean (s.e.) change in HbA1c was comparable between vildagliptin and glimepiride treatment: -0.1% (0.0%) and -0.1% (0.0%), respectively. The primary objective of non-inferiority was met. A similar proportion of patients reached HbA1c <7% (36.9 and 38.3%, respectively), but with vildagliptin more patients reached this target without hypoglycaemia (36.0% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.004).

In this paper, research on the spatial differentiation of the structure and homogeneity of the system in which SARS-CoV-2 occurs, as well as spatial concentration of people infected was undertaken. The phenomena were investigated in a period of two infection waves in Germany: in spring and autumn 2020.

The potentials model made it possible to distinguish core regions with a high level of the growth of new infections, along with areas of their impact, and regions with a low level of generation of new infections. The entropy showed the spatial distribution of differentiation of the studied system and the change of these characteristics between spring and autumn. The concentration method allowed for spatial and numerical demonstration of the concentration of infected population in a given area.

BACKGROUND: For every individual in the United States who died of a firearm injury in 2017, three survived, living with the burden of their injury. Current firearm research largely focuses on mortality and short-term health outcomes, while neglecting the long-term consequences. METHODS: We contacted adult patients with a moderate-to-severe injury from a firearm or motor vehicle crash (MVC) treated at 3 level I trauma centers in Boston between 2015 and 2018. Patients were contacted 6 to 12 months postinjury to measure: presence of daily pain; screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); new functional limitations; return to work; and physical and mental health-related quality of life. We matched each firearm injury patient to MVC patients using Coarsened Exact Matching. Adjusted Generalized Linear Models were used to compare matched patients. RESULTS: Of 177 eligible firearm injury survivors, 100 were successfully contacted and 63 completed the study. Among them, 67.7% reported daily pain, 53.2% screened positive for PTSD, 38.7% reported a new functional limitation in an activity of daily living, and 59.1% have not returned to work.

TB detection involves extraction of complex TB manifestation features such as lung cavity, air space consolidation, endobronchial spread, and pleural effusions from chest x-rays (CXRs). Deep learning based approach named convolutional neural network (CNN) has the ability to learn complex features from CXR images. The main problem is that CNN does not consider uncertainty to classify CXRs using softmax layer. It lacks in presenting the true probability of CXRs by differentiating confusing cases during TB detection. This paper presents the solution for TB identification by using Bayesian-based convolutional neural network (B-CNN). It deals with the uncertain cases that have low discernibility among the TB and non-TB manifested CXRs. The proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN is evaluated on two TB benchmark datasets, i.e., Montgomery and Shenzhen. For training and testing of proposed scheme we have utilized Google Colab platform which provides NVidia Tesla K80 with 12 GB of VRAM, single core of 2.3 GHz Xeon Processor, 12 GB RAM and 320 GB of disk. B-CNN achieves 96.42% and 86.46% accuracy on both dataset, respectively as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning and CNN approaches. Moreover, B-CNN validates its results by filtering the CXRs as confusion cases where the variance of B-CNN predicted outputs is more than a certain threshold.

The aim of this paper is to determine which of the two types of fears exist in certain psychological groups, and which of the fears strongly influence the decision to travel. Design/methodology/approach: The VALS 2 method and standardized questionnaire were used for the segmentation of the tourist market or for the determination of the psychographic profiles of the consumers, and three additional questions were joined to it as they were vital for the research of the type of fear and its impact on the decision for traveling. When the reliability of the questionnaire and the validity of the sample were determined, the data were further processed using a computer program package IMB AMOS SPSS 21.00, and then, based on the theoretical suppositions and hypotheses, the SEM structural model was created. Findings: The paper indicates the existence of established types of fears in humans, when it comes to pandemics and similar crisis situations. People are most afraid of infection during travel, and lack of funds and job loss during the critical period of the pandemic. The research conducted confirms that all groups of people, who are determined by the psychological technique VALS 2, react with a certain dose of fear and make decisions under the pressure of fears. Research limitations/implications: The research had limitations in terms of contact with people and conducting live surveys. The measures during the pandemic, which were carried out by the state, included social distance and limited movement of people. Practical implications: The work can contribute to the community, along with similar research. The results of the research will be available, and it will be possible to see the behavior of people during crisis situations, and the impact of fears on making decisions, both travel decisions and decisions related to other areas of life. Originality/value: The paper provides research results on a large sample of respondents, and can serve as a basis for further research in the field of tourism, psychology and similar fields.

Given the widespread use of ACEi/ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs is urgently needed. This prospective meta-analysis aims to pool data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety and efficacy of ACEi/ARB therapy in adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RCTs will be eligible if they compare patients with COVID-19 randomised to ACEi/ARB continuation or commencement versuss no ACEi/ARB therapy; study duration 14 days; recruitment completed between March 2020 and May 2021. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes will include mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care or cardiovascular events at short-term follow-up (30 days) and all-cause mortality at longer-term follow-up (>1 month). Prespecified subgroup analyses will assess the effect of sex; age; comorbidities; smoking status; ethnicity; country of origin on all-cause mortality. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov has been performed, which will be followed by a formal search of trial registers, preprint servers, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify RCTs that meet inclusion criteria. To date, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov identified 21 potentially eligible trials for this meta-analysis.

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) could prevent SARS CoV-2 in healthcare workers(HCW) at high-risk of exposure. MethodThis voluntary observational study for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 was conducted at a tertiary care center, from 12th June to 12th October 2020(total 16 weeks). All consented asymptomatic HCWs of CIMS hospital were administered 400 mg HCQ twice a day on day one followed by 400 mg once weekly to be taken with meals up to 16 weeks. Data collected included OPD registration, risk assessment, medical and family history (related to COVID), physical examination and vitals, pulse oximetry, ECG (pre and post HCQ), drug adherence, side effects, adverse drug reactions. ResultThe study enrolled 927 full-time, hospital-based HCWs ((including doctors, nurses, paramedical, lab technicians, sanitary workers and others), of whom 731(78.85%) initially started HCQ while 196 (21.14%) did not volunteer. The median age and weight of the study population was 27.5 years and 69.5 kg respectively. No major associated co-morbidities were present in these HCWs. There was an increased trend towards non adherence to HCQ with each proceeding week more so after week 11. Of the 731 HCWs taking HCQ a total of 167(22.8%) tested COVID positive at different intervals of time as against 30 HCW (15.3%) out of 196 not taking HCQ. The rate of COVID-19 positive was statistically significantly higher in the HCWs taking HCQ (p=0.0220; 95% CI: 1.14% to 12.94%), as compared to those not on HCQ. Thus HCQ was not prophylactically effective against COVID 19 infection. No participants in this study experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events. No significant difference in the median of ECG changes in QTc between pre and post HCQ administration of 46 HCWs was observed. ConclusionsThis clinical study did not detect a reduction in SARS CoV-2 transmission with prophylactic administration of 400 mg/HCQ in HCWs. All participants who did contract SARSCoV-2 were either asymptomatic or had mild disease courses with full recoveries. All adverse events were self-limiting and no serious cardiovascular events were reported with use of HCQ.

Long defects are commonly repaired with gastric pull-up or colonic interposition; however, jejunal interposition offers several potential advantages in children. One historical concern with jejunal interposition has been the risk of flap infarction following transposition. The use of neck and intrathoracic vessels to \\"supercharge\\" the jejunum has been reported in adults. This study reports outcomes of supercharged jejunal interposition in pediatric and young adult patients with long esophageal defects. METHODS The authors reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent supercharged jejunal interposition for esophageal reconstruction at their institution from 2013 to 2017. The authors collected data pertaining to patient characteristics, operative technique, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS Twenty patients, 10 female and 10 male, aged 1.4 to 23.8 years, underwent esophageal reconstruction with supercharged jejunal interposition and were followed for a median of 1.4 years. Seventeen patients had a primary diagnosis of long-gap esophageal atresia, and three required reconstruction following caustic ingestion. Eighty percent of patients had undergone prior attempts at surgical reconstruction. Postoperatively, all conduits demonstrated coordinated peristalsis, and no flap losses were noted. Major complications occurred in seven patients, stricture dilation was performed in four patients, and there was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS Jejunal interposition with supercharging can be safely performed for management of long esophageal gaps in the pediatric setting; it is useful where the stomach or colon has been used previously or is unavailable.

Previous academic education and training may help novice future nurses feel more confident about their tasks and responsibilities as well as improve patient outcomes, resource management, and staff safety.","output":"Experiences of nursing students as healthcare aid during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: A phemonenological research study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the new strain of the coronavirus. There is limited data on pathogenesis and the cellular responses of COVID-19. In this study, it is aimed to determine the variation of metabolites between healthy control and COVID-19 via the untargeted metabolomics method. Serum samples were obtained from 44 COVID-19 patients and 41 healthy controls. Untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed by LC/Q-TOF/MS method. Data acquisition, classification, and identification were achieved by the METLIN database and XCMS. Significant differences were determined between patients and healthy controls in terms of purine, glutamine, leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and glutathione metabolisms. Down regulations were determined in R-S lactoglutathione and glutamine. Up-regulations were detected in hypoxanthine, inosine, and LTD4. Identified metabolites indicate roles for purine, glutamine, LTD4, and glutathione metabolisms in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19. The use of selective leukotriene D4 receptor antagonists, targeting purinergic signaling as a therapeutic approach and glutamine supplementation may decrease the severity and mortality of COVID-19.

Few data are available on the duration and prognostic factors of the disease. We aimed to study the recovery time among a Tunisian cohort of COVID-19 confirmed patients and identify the prognostic factors. METHODS: A retrospective, nationwide study was conducted from March 2 to May 8, 2020, recruiting all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, by RT-PCR methods, in Tunisia. Data were collected via phone call interview. Kaplan-Meir Methods and Cox proportional hazards regression models were, respectively, used to study the recovery time and estimate its prognostic factors. RESULTS: One thousand and thirty patients with COVID-19 (aged 43.2  18.2 years, 526 female (51.1%)) were enrolled. Among them 141 (14.8%) were healthcare professionals. Out of 173 patients (17.8%) admitted to the hospital, 47 were admitted in an intensive care unit. Among 827 patients who didn't require specialized care, 55.5% were self-isolated at home, while the rest were in specialized centers. Six hundred and two patients were symptomatic. A total of 634 (61.6%) patients have recovered and 45 (4.4%) patients died. The median duration of illness was estimated to be 31 days (95% CI: [29-32]).

EVD, an emerging infectious disease, can create fear and panic among patients, contacts and relatives, which could be a risk factor for psychological distress. Psychological distress among this subgroup could have public health implication for control of EVD, because of potential effects on patient management and contact tracing. We determined the Prevalence, pattern and factors associated with psychological distress among survivors and contacts of EVD and their relatives. METHODS: In a descriptive cross sectional study, we used General Health Questionnaire to assess psychological distress and Oslo Social Support Scale to assess social support among 117 participants who survived EVD, listed as EVD contacts or their relatives at Ebola Emergency Operation Center in Lagos, Nigeria. Factors associated with psychological distress were determined using chi square/odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: The mean age and standard deviation of participants was 34 +/ - 9.6 years. Of 117 participants, 78 (66.7 %) were females, 77 (65.8 %) had a tertiary education and 45 (38.5 %) were health workers. Most frequently occurring psychological distress were inability to concentrate (37.6 %) and loss of sleep over worry (33.3 %). Losing a relation to EVD outbreak (OR = 6.0, 95 % CI, 1.2C32.9) was significantly associated with feeling unhappy or depressed while being a health worker was protective (OR = 0.4, 95 % CI, 0.2C0.9). Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) showed losing a relation (AOR = 5.7, 95 % CI, 1.2C28.0) was a predictor of feeling unhappy or depressed, loss of a relation (AOR = 10.1, 95 % CI, 1.7C60.7) was a predictor of inability to concentrate. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors and contacts of EVD and their relations develop psychological distress. Development of psychological distress could be predicted by loss of family member. It is recommended that psychiatrists and other mental health specialists be part of case management teams. The clinical teams managing EVD patients should be trained on recognition of common psychological distress among patients.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional role of circular RNA ITCH (circ-ITCH) in OSCC and the underlying mechanisms. Methods RT-qPCR analysis was applied to detect the expression levels of circ-ITCH in OSCC tissues and cell lines. MTT assay and flow cytometer analysis were used to evaluate the effects of circ-ITCH overexpression on the proliferation and apoptosis of OSCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay were applied to determine the binding relation between circ-ITCH and miR-421 as well as PDCD4 mRNA and miR-421. Results Our results showed that circ-ITCH expression was remarkably decreased in OSCC tissues and cell lines. Low circ-ITCH expression was strongly associated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC patients. Moreover, functional assays demonstrated that circ-ITCH overexpression significantly inhibited OSCC cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Our data further uncovered that circ-ITCH could bind directly to miR-421 and block its repression on PDCD4 in OSCC. MiR-421 expression was significantly increased in OSCC tissues and was inversely correlated with circ-ITCH expression. Notably, miR-421 restoration blocked the tumor-suppressive role of circ-ITCH in OSCC cells. Conclusion In conclusion, our study reveals that circ-ITCH serves as a tumor suppressor in OSCC partly by regulating miR-421/PDCD4 axis.","output":"Circular RNA ITCH Suppresses Cell Proliferation but Induces Apoptosis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Regulating miR-421/PDCD4 Axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A heterohybridoma was produced by the fusion of sensitized peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with a previously derived heteromyeloma, generated by the fusion of bovine PBLs with murine myeloma cells.

This study aims to describe the clinical course of COVID-19 in children with kidney disease taking immunosuppressive medication and to assess disease severity. METHODS: Cross-sectional study hosted by the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network and supported by the European, Asian and International paediatric nephrology societies. Anonymised data were submitted online for any child (age <20 years) with COVID-19 taking immunosuppressive medication for a kidney condition. Study recruited for 16 weeks from 15 March 2020 to 05 July 2020. The primary outcome was severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: 113 children were reported in this study from 30 different countries. Median age: 13 years (49% male). Main underlying reasons for immunosuppressive therapy: kidney transplant (47%), nephrotic syndrome (27%), systemic lupus erythematosus (10%). Immunosuppressive medications used include: glucocorticoids (76%), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (54%), tacrolimus/ciclosporine A (58%), rituximab/ofatumumab (11%). 78% required no respiratory support during COVID-19 illness, 5% required bi-level positive airway pressure or ventilation. Four children died; all deaths reported were from low-income countries with associated comorbidities. There was no significant difference in severity of COVID-19 based on gender, dialysis status, underlying kidney condition, and type or number of immunosuppressive medications. CONCLUSIONS: This global study shows most children with a kidney disease taking immunosuppressive medication have mild disease with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cellular entry usually requires fusion of the viral envelope with host plasma membranes. Such entry mechanism is often preceded by primingand/or activationsteps requiring limited proteolysis of the viral surface glycoprotein to expose a fusiogenic domain for efficient membrane juxtapositions. The 9-membered family of Proprotein Convertases related to Subtilisin/Kexin (PCSK) serine proteases (PC1, PC2, Furin, PC4, PC5, PACE4, PC7, SKI-1/S1P and PCSK9) participate in post-translational cleavages and/or regulation of multiple secretory proteins. The type-I membrane-bound Furin and SKI-1/S1P are the major convertases responsible for the processing of surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses. Stefan Kunz has considerably contributed to define the role of SKI-1/S1P in the activation of arenaviruses causing hemorrhagic fever. Furin was recently implicated in the activation of the spike S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and Furin-inhibitors are being tested as antivirals in COVID-19. Other members of the PCSK-family are also implicated in some viral infections such as PCSK9 in Dengue.

The aim of this review is a teaching approach devoted to hemophilia treaters in under-development countries. AREAS COVERED Current major challenges include the absence of the following therapeutic tools for all people with hemophilia (PWH) worldwide: hematological prophylaxis; well-coordinated multidisciplinary teams in specialized centers; joint aspiration of acute hemarthrosis; point-of-care ultrasonography (POC-US); exercise; treatment of synovitis by means of radiosynovectomy; treatment of mild hemophilic arthropathy with analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, and rehabilitation medicine; intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, and mesenchymal stem cells; and treatment of severe hemophilic arthropathy by surgical treatment. The future scenario in under-development countries should include all the aforementioned treatment tools plus the possibility of performing total joint arthroplasty in PWH with inhibitors; concomitant use of bypassing agents with emicizumab for PWH with inhibitors undergoing orthopedic surgery; and telemedicine. EXPERT OPINION Primary hematological prophylaxis is now the gold standard for the management of hemophilia. Acute hemarthrosis needs intense hematological management and articular aspiration; the articular situation should be scrutinized by POC-US. Synovitis can be controlled by radiosynovectomy.

The agencies that fund university research developed institutional rules, norms, and procedures that created unintended consequences when they interacted with those of American higher education. The project system for funding, justified by peer-review and coupled with rapidly increasing R&D budgets, created incentives for universities to expand their research programs massively, which led to unsustainable growth in the demand for federal research money. That system produced spectacular successes but also created the unintended longer-term problem that demand for science funding has grown more quickly than government funding ever could.

The frequency of seroma increases further among obese patients, who have achieved massive weight loss after bariatric surgery. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of fibrin glues with a low concentration of thrombin in reducing seroma formation after a lipo-abdominoplasty. METHODS Thirty patients, that had achieved a significant weight loss after an intervention of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), underwent a circular lipo-abdominoplasty at our bariatric surgery department. Patients were divided into two groups of 15 subjects each: group A underwent traditional surgery; in group B, we applied a slow-clotting variant of fibrin glue (ARTISS, Baxter) under the abdominal flap. All subjects were evaluated clinically using an ultrasound device on postoperative day 15. We considered positive for seroma, those cases with a liquid collection greater than 20 cc. RESULTS The groups were homogeneous for age, BMI, male/female ratio, and diabetic or smoker patients. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in group A than in group B. We found eight cases of serum collection >20 cc in group A and only one case in group B. Hematoma, umbilicus necrosis, and surgical site infection occurred in both groups, but overall complication rate was lower in group B. CONCLUSIONS The use of a fibrin glue with a low concentration of thrombin could be useful during wound closure and may decrease seroma formation in postbariatric patients undergoing lipo-abdominoplasty.","output":"The use of a fibrin glue with a low concentration of thrombin decreases seroma formation in postbariatric patients undergoing circular abdominoplasty."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: NICE published eligibility criteria for Total Hip Replacement (THR) vs Hemiarthroplasty for intracapsular hip fractures.

Whilst the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir has been previously linked to prolongation of the QT(c) interval on the ECG and risk of torsades de pointes arrhythmia, less is known in this regard about atazanavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Unwanted abnormalities of drug-induced QT(c) prolongation by diverse drugs are commonly mediated by a single cardiac anti-target, the hERG potassium channel. This computational modeling study was undertaken in order to explore the ability of these five drugs to interact with known determinants of drug binding to the hERG channel pore. Methods: Atazanavir, remdesivir, ritonavir, lopinavir and favipiravir were docked to in silico models of the pore domain of hERG, derived from cryo-EM structures of hERG and the closely related EAG channel. Results: Atazanavir was readily accommodated in the open hERG channel pore in proximity to the S6 Y652 and F656 residues, consistent with published experimental data implicating these aromatic residues in atazanavir binding to the channel. Lopinavir, ritonavir, and remdesivir were also accommodated in the open channel, making contacts in a model-dependent fashion with S6 aromatic residues and with residues at the base of the selectivity filter/pore helix. The ability of remdesivir (at 30 M) to inhibit the channel was confirmed using patch-clamp recording. None of these four drugs could be accommodated in the closed channel structure. Favipiravir, a much smaller molecule, was able to fit within the closed channel and could adopt multiple binding poses in the open channel, but with few simultaneous interactions with key binding residues. Only favipiravir and remdesivir showed the potential to interact with lateral pockets below the selectivity filter of the channel. Conclusions: All the antiviral drugs studied here can, in principle, interact with components of the hERG potassium channel canonical binding site, but are likely to differ in their ability to access lateral binding pockets. Favipiravir's small size and relatively paucity of simultaneous interactions may confer reduced hERG liability compared to the other drugs. Experimental structure-function studies are now warranted to validate these observations.","output":"In silico Exploration of Interactions Between Potential COVID-19 Antiviral Treatments and the Pore of the hERG Potassium ChannelA Drug Antitarget"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has rapidly become a major health emergency worldwide. The characteristic, outcome, and risk factor of COVID-19 in patients with decompensated cirrhosis remain unclear.Methods: Medical records were collected from 23 Chinese hospitals. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis and age- and sex-matched non-liver disease patients were enrolled with 1:4 ratio using stratified sampling.Results: There were more comorbidities with higher Chalson Complication Index (p < 0.001), higher proportion of patients having gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice, ascites, and diarrhea among those patients (p < 0.05) and in decompensated cirrhosis patients. Mortality (p < 0.05) and the proportion of severe ill (p < 0.001) were significantly high among those patients. Patients in severe ill subgroup had higher mortality (p < 0.001), MELD, and CRUB65 score but lower lymphocytes count.

Consequently, adherence and psychosocial issues are becoming increasingly important because non-adherence to treatment recommendations worsens morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to identify factors modifying adherence to medication in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD). Methods: This cross-sectional study included 451 outpatients (female 47.9%, average age  SD: 37.9  12 years) from the ACHD department, who completed a questionnaire assessing medication non-adherence and individual barriers to treatment. Further assessments included psychological well-being (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale; HADS), childhood traumatization, sociodemographic, and clinical data. Binary logistic regression analysis calculated the impact of these factors on drug adherence. Results: Of the 451 patients 162 participants (35.9%) reported to be non-adherent. In univariate analysis non-adherence to treatment was associated with smoking (P = < 0.001) and internet addiction (P = 0.005). Further factors negatively influencing adherence were the presence of depressive symptoms (P = 0.002), anxiety (P = 0.004), and childhood traumatization (p = 0.002). Factors positively associated with adherence were older age (P = 0.003) and more advanced heart disease as indicated by NYHA class (P = 0.01), elevated NT-proBNP (P = 0.02), device therapy (P = 0.002) and intermittent arrhythmias (P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis especially psychopathological factors such as depression (P = 0.009), anxiety (P = 0.032) and childhood traumatization (P = 0.006) predicted non-adherence. Conclusion: Adherence is a critical issue in the long-term management of ACHD. Identifying modifiable factors that worsen adherence offers the opportunity for targeted interventions. Depressive symptoms, anxiety, and adverse childhood experiences are amenable to psychosocial interventions, as well as cigarette smoking. Our study suggests that a multimodal and interdisciplinary treatment concept for the long-term management of adults with congenital heart disease could be beneficial. Whether it will further improve morbidity and mortality, should be assessed in prospective interventions.","output":"Factors That Influence Adherence to Medication in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronaviruses are important animal and human pathogens Towards the end of 2019, the novel coro-navirus identified in Wuhan, China, presented as a cluster of symptoms of pneumonia Its quick spread resulted in a global pandemic This research documents detailed ethnopharmacological information on the medicinal plant species used by herbalists against coronavirus disease Methods: The study was conducted in Sal & eacute;Prefecture, from March 1st, 2020 to May 31st, 2020 Semi-structured face to face interviews were held with 30 herbalists and collected;socio-demographic characteristics, the names of local species, and traditional remedies being used The data were analyzed through the use reports (UR) and medicinal use value (MUV) Results: In total, 20 plant species from 20 genera and 14 families had been most frequently used by herbalists from Sal & eacute;Prefecture for the prevention and treatment of COVID 19 The most mentioned plant was Eucalyptus globulus Labill , followed by Azadirachta indica A Juss, and Ziziphus lotus (L ) Lam Moreover, the most commonly used plant parts for herbal preparations were leaves (28 43%) and seeds (17 5%), and the majority of remedies were prepared through infusion Conclusions: The present study is the first contribution to the ethnopharmacological profile of this Prefecture It is recommended that the constituents of indigenous species be studied to determine the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action However, attention must be paid to the conservation of medicinal species, comprehensively documenting traditional medicinal knowledge as well as conducting phytochemical validation of reported plants","output":"COVID-19, prevention and treatment with herbal medicine in the herbal markets of Sal & eacute;Prefecture, North-Western Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BNT162b2 has proven to be highly effective, but there is a paucity of data regarding immunogenicity factors and comparison between response to vaccination and natural infection.

This has led to considering new and unusual targets for SARS CoV-2. 2-O-Methyltransferase (nsp16) is a key and attractive target in the SARS CoV-2 life cycle since it is responsible for the viral RNA protection via a cap formation process. In this study, we propose a new potential inhibitor for SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase (nsp16). A fragment library was screened against the co-crystal structure of the SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase complexed with Sinefungin (nsp16-PDB ID: 6WKQ), and consequently the best proposed fragments were linked via a de novo approach to build molecule AP-20. Molecule AP-20 displayed a superior docking score to Sinefungin and reproduced the key interactions in the binding site of 2-O-methyltransferase. Three molecular dynamic simulations of the 2-O-methyltransferase apo structure and its complexed forms with AP-20 and Sinefungin were performed for 150 nano-seconds to provide insights on the dynamic nature of such setups and to assess the stability of the proposed AP-20/enzyme complex. AP-20/enzyme complex demonstrated better stability for the ligand-enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin in a respective setup. Furthermore, MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations showed a better profile for AP-20/enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin/enzyme complex emphasizing the potential inhibitory effect of AP-20 on SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase. We endorse our designed molecule AP-20 to be further explored via experimental evaluations to confront the spread of the emerging COVID-19. Also, in silico ADME profiling has ascribed to AP-20 an excellent safety and metabolic stability profile. ? 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","output":"In silico identification of potential SARS COV-2 2- O -methyltransferase inhibitor: Fragment-based screening approach and MM-PBSA calculations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND As of October 2021, 47 (80%) of the 59 countries, identified at highest risk for Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus (MNT), had been validated for elimination. We assessed sustainability of MNT elimination (MNTE) in 28 countries that were validated during 2011?2020. METHODS We assessed the attainment of the following MNTE sustainability indicators: 1)  90% coverage with three doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine (DTP3) among infants < 1 year, 2)  80% coverage with at least two doses of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (TTCV2 +) among pregnant women, 3)  80% protection at birth (PAB), 4)  70% skilled birth attendance (SBA), and 4)  80% first (ANC1) and fourth antenatal care (ANC4) visits. We assessed the introduction of TTCV booster doses. Data sources included the 2020 WHO /UNICEF Joint Reporting Forms, and the latest Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) or Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) for each country, if available. We reviewed literature and used DHS/MICS data to identify barriers to sustaining MNTE. RESULTS Of 28 assessed countries, 7 (25%) reported  90% DTP3 coverage, 4 of 26 (16%) reported  80% TTCV2 + coverage, and 23 of 27 (85%) reported  80% PAB coverage. Based on DHS/MICS in 15 of the 28 countries, 10 (67%) achieved  70% SBA delivery, 13 (87%) achieved  80% ANC1 visit coverage, and 3 (20%)  80% ANC4 visit coverage. We observed sub-optimal coverage in many countries at the subnational level. The first, second and third booster doses of TTCV respectively have been introduced in 6 (21%), 5 (18%), and 1 (4%) of 28 countries. Only three countries conducted post-MNTE validation assessments. Barriers to MNTE sustainability included: competing program priorities, limited resources to introduce TTCV booster doses and implement corrective immunization in high-risk districts and socio-economic factors. CONCLUSIONS Despite good performance of MNTE indicators in several countries, MNTE sustainability appears threatened in some countries. Integration and coordination of MNTE activities with other immunization activities in the context of the Immunization Agenda 2030 lifecourse vaccination strategy such as providing tetanus booster doses in school-based vaccination platforms, during measles second dose and HPV vaccination, and integrating MNTE post-validation assessments with immunization program reviews will ensure MNTE is sustained.","output":"Sustaining Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE) in countries that have been validated for elimination - progress and challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The goal of this study was to empirically examine the degree to which alcohol use and drinking motives changed during the first month of the pandemic and to examine individual differences associated with such changes. Methods: A U.S. nationwide survey of 500 adults was conducted; data from 201 individuals (Mage=38.98, SD=12.04, 52.2% female, 76.1% White) who endorsed current alcohol use were included in this study. Results: Paired-samples t-tests indicated that there was a significant decrease in drinking quantity [t(199)=3.74, p<.001], but no change in drinking frequency [t(198)=0.19, p=.849] overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. There were significant decreases in enhancement [t(201)=4.55, p<.001], social [t(201)=9.39, p<.001] and conformity [t(201)=3.58, p<.001] motives, but a significant increase in coping motives [t(201)=-3.71, p<.001].

Various clinical trials of vaccines and drugs are being conducted worldwide; nevertheless, as of today, no effective drug exists for COVID-19. The identification of key genes and pathways in this disease may lead to finding potential drug targets and biomarkers. Here, we applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis and LIME as an explainable artificial intelligence algorithm to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes in bronchial epithelium cells (primary human lung epithelium (NHBE) and transformed lung alveolar (A549) cells) during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

The novel hub gene signature that was detected in our study, including PGLYRP4 and HEPHL1, may shed light on the pathogenesis of COVID-19, holding promise for future prognostic and therapeutic approaches. The enrichment analysis of hub genes showed that the most relevant biological process and KEGG pathways were the type I interferon signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and defense response to virus categories, all of which play significant roles in restricting viral infection. Moreover, according to the drugCtarget network, we identified 17 novel FDA-approved candidate drugs, which could potentially be used to treat COVID-19 patients through the regulation of four hub genes of the co-expression network.

This dreadful situation clearly demands an efficient strategy to quickly identify drugs for the successful treatment of COVID-19. Hence, drug repurposing is an effective approach for the rapid discovery of frontline arsenals to fight against COVID-19. Successful application of this approach has resulted in the repurposing of some clinically approved drugs as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. Several of these drugs are either antimalarials, antivirals, antibiotics or corticosteroids and they have been repurposed based on their potential to negate virus or reduce lung inflammation. Large numbers of clinical trials have been registered to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical safety of these drugs. Till date, a few clinical studies are complete and the results are primary. WHO also conducted an international, multi-country, open-label, randomized trials-a solidarity trial for four antiviral drugs. However, solidarity trials have few limitations like no placebos were used, additionally any drug may show effectiveness for a particular population in a region which may get neglected in solidarity trial analysis.

A Facebook advertisement campaign was used to disseminate the link to an online Qualtrics survey between March 20C30, 2020. Two supplementary male-only and racial minority- targeted advertisements were created on the sixth and tenth day of recruitment, respectively, to address issues of disproportionate female- and White-oriented gender- and ethnic-skewing observed in the advertisements reach and response trends. RESULTS: In total, 6602 participant responses were recorded with representation from all U.S. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The advertisements cumulatively reached 236,017 individuals and resulted in 9609 clicks (4.07% reach). Total cost of the advertisement was $906, resulting in costs of $0.09 per click and $0.18 per full response (completed surveys). Implementation of the male-only advertisement improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from approximately 20 to 40%. CONCLUSIONS: The social media advertisement campaign was an effective and efficient strategy to collect large scale, nationwide data on COVID-19 within a short time period. Although the proportion of men who completed the survey was lower than those who didnt, interventions to increase male responses and enhance representativeness were successful. These findings can inform future research on the use of social media recruitment for the rapid collection of survey data related to rapidly evolving health crises, such as COVID-19.","output":"Social media as a recruitment platform for a nationwide online survey of COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices in the United States: methodology and feasibility analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleosides are fundamental building blocks of DNA and RNA in all life forms and viruses. In addition, natural nucleosides and their analogs are critical in prebiotic chemistry, innate immunity, signaling, antiviral drug discovery and artificial synthesis of DNA / RNA sequences. Combined with the fact that quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) have been widely performed to understand their antiviral activity, nucleoside analogs could be used to benchmark generative molecular design. Here, we undertake the first generative design of nucleoside analogs using an approach that we refer to as the Conditional Randomized Transformer (CRT). We also benchmark our model against five previously published molecular generative models. We demonstrate that AI-generated molecules include nucleoside analogs that are of significance in a wide range of areas including prebiotic chemistry, antiviral drug discovery and synthesis of oligonucleotides. Our results show that CRT explores distinct molecular spaces and chemical transformations, some of which are similar to those undertaken by nature and medicinal chemists. Finally, we demonstrate the potential application of the CRT model in the generative design of molecules conditioned on Remdesivir and Molnupiravir as well as other nucleoside analogs with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.

However, the studies published to date have several methodological limitations and are mainly from China. We set out to synthesize evidence on smoking and COVID-19 relationship drawn on cohort studies only which are published in non-Chinese population settings. METHOD: A systematic literature search was undertaken drawn on predefined eligibility criteria and a comprehensive search strategy following the PRISMA guideline between January 2020 and August 2020, excluding preprints and gray literature. Three specific outcomes were examined: smoking history, SARS-CoV2 infection, and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Of an eligible 40 full-text studies, 7 cohort studies outside of China were finally included in this literature review through independent reviewing. Four studies were from the UK, 2 from the United States, and 1 from Turkey. The sample size ranged from 200 to more than 5000 participants. The findings broadly point to 1 direction, a higher smoking prevalence and an increased risk of smoking history on both SARS-CoV2 infection and on COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSION: A smoking history (either current or past) seems to negatively impact both SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 severity. However, such an observation strengthens the argument to continue smoking cessation efforts both for individuals and for the general population health and well-being.","output":"Smoking and COVID-19: A Literature Review of Cohort Studies in Non-Chinese Population Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through this article, the author also to encourage every person in the world will recognize music and dance as a good alternative through this article.

But currently, there are no recognized standard biomarkers to assess SCI levels alone, and SCI is typically measured by combining biomarkers of acute inflammation and infection, e.g., CRP, IL-6, and TNF. In this review, we highlight 10 properties and characteristics that are shared by the blood protein soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and SCI, supporting the argument that suPAR is a biomarker of SCI: (1) Expression and release of suPAR is upregulated by immune activation; (2) uPAR and suPAR exert pro-inflammatory functions; (3) suPAR is associated with the amount of circulating immune cells; (4) Blood suPAR levels correlate with the levels of established inflammatory biomarkers; (5) suPAR is minimally affected by acute changes and short-term influences, in contrast to many currently used markers of systemic inflammation; (6) Like SCI, suPAR is non-specifically associated with multiple diseases; (7) suPAR and SCI both predict morbidity and mortality; (8) suPAR and SCI share the same risk factors; (9) suPAR is associated with risk factors and outcomes of inflammation above and beyond other inflammatory biomarkers; (10) The suPAR level can be reduced by anti-inflammatory interventions and treatment of disease. Assessing SCI has the potential to inform risk for morbidity and mortality. Blood suPAR is a newer biomarker which may, in fact, be a biomarker of SCI since it is stably associated with inflammation and immune activation; shares the same risk factors as many age-related diseases; is both elevated by and predicts age-related diseases. There is strong evidence that suPAR is a prognostic marker of adverse events, morbidity, and mortality. It is associated with immune activity and prognosis across diverse conditions, including kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders. Thus, we think it likely represents a common underlying disease-process shared by many diseases; that is, SCI. We review the supporting literature and propose a research agenda that can help test the hypothesis that suPAR indexes SCI, with the potential of becoming the new gold standard for measuring SCI.","output":"Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (suPAR) as a Biomarker of Systemic Chronic Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of COVID-19.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center case series of the seven maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients infected with COVID-19 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 13 January to 7 April 2020 and a proactive search of potential cases by chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Results: Of 202 HD patients, 7 (3.5%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Five were diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because of compatible symptoms, while two were diagnosed by RT-PCR as a result of screening 197 HD patients without respiratory symptoms by chest CT. Thirteen of 197 patients had positive chest CT features and, of these, 2 (15%) were confirmed to have COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients, the most common features at admission were fatigue, fever and diarrhea [5/7 (71%) had all these]. Common laboratory features included lymphocytopenia [6/7 (86%)], elevated lactate dehydrogenase [3/4 (75%)], D-dimer [5/6 (83%)], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [4/4 (100%)] and procalcitonin [5/5 (100%)]. Chest CT showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Four of seven (57%) received oxygen therapy, one (14%) received noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, five (71%) received antiviral and antibacterial drugs, three (43%) recieved glucocorticoid therapy and one (14%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. As the last follow-up, four of the seven patients (57%) had been discharged and three patients were dead. Conclusions: Chest CT may identify COVID-19 patients without clear symptoms, but the specificity is low.

Risk constellations and rates of seroconversion for health care workers during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still largely unclear. METHODS: Health care personnel (n=300) on different organizational units in the LMU Munich University Hospital were included and followed in this prospective longitudinal study in the period of March 24 until July 7, 2020. Participants were monitored in intervals of two to six weeks using different antibody assays for serological testing and questionnaires to evaluate risk contacts. In a subgroup of infected participants, we obtained nasopharyngeal swabs to perform whole genome sequencing for outbreak characterization. RESULTS: Health care workers involved in patient care on dedicated COVID-19 wards or on regular non-COVID-19 wards showed a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion compared to staff in the emergency department and non-frontline personnel. The landscape of risk contacts in these units was dynamic, with a decrease of unprotected risk contacts in the emergency department and an increase on non-COVID-19 wards. Both, the intensity and number of risk contacts, were associated with higher rates of seroconversion. On regular wards, staff infections tended to occur in clusters, while infections on COVID-19 wards were less frequent and apparently independent of each other.

We sought to characterize the changes in testing accessibility at UCCs between March and August 2020 on the basis of testing availability (including rapid antigen testing), wait time for test results, cost of visits, and cost of tests. METHODS: Data were collected using a secret shopper methodology. Researchers contacted 250 UCCs in 10 states. Investigators used a standardized script to survey centers on their COVID-19 testing availability and policies. UCCs were initially contacted in March and re-called in August. T-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to identify differences between March and August data and differences by center classification. RESULTS: Our results indicate that both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect COVID-19 genetic material and rapid antigen COVID-19 tests have increased in availability. However, wait times for PCR test results have significantly increased to an average of 5.79 days. Additionally, a high proportion of UCCs continue to charge for tests and visits and no significant decrease was found in the proportion of UCCs that charge for COVID-19 testing from March to August. Further, no state reported a majority of UCCs with rapid testing available, indicating an overall lack of rapid testing.

As a federal government, the US maintains an often complex web of state and national authorities and responsibilities. The federal government assumed responsibility for the ordering, payment and procurement of COVID vaccine from manufacturers. In designing the subsequent steps in their COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration plan, the Trump administration decided to rely on the states themselves to determine how best to implement guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This strategy resulted in 50 different plans and 50 different systems for the dissemination of vaccine doses, all at the level of each individual state. State health departments were neither financed, experienced nor uniformly possessed the expertise to develop and implement such plans. A national strategy for the distribution, and the workforce for the provision, of vaccine beyond the state level, similar to that which occurred in Israel, would have provided for greater efficiency and coordination across the country. The US public health infrastructure was ill-prepared and ill-staffed to take on the responsibility to deliver > 450 million doses of vaccine in an expeditious fashion, even if supply of vaccine was available.

Veterans with serious mental illness were identified with ICD-10 diagnostic codes from electronic health records of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Receipt of a VHA COVID-19 vaccine from December 1, 2020, through June 1, 2021, was documented by using procedure codes. Treatment effects estimation with inverse-probability weighting was used to estimate the effects of serious mental illness on COVID-19 vaccine uptake. RESULTS Patients with serious mental illness and patients without serious mental illness were equally likely to receive a vaccination (48% and 46%, respectively; average effect of serious mental illness=-0.4%, 95% confidence interval=-0.8% to 0.1%).

This pilot study intends to evaluate the relationship between motivation and meaningful learning for university students through mAR, as well as the effects and implications of its use how supporting teaching activities in an Industrial Design and Technical Drawing course. A quantitative method research approach was applied to collect, process, and analyze the research data of the students perception under the health restrictions caused by the current pandemic, using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS).

However, because of resource constraints few ocmprehensive aetiological studies have conducted in sub-Saharan Africa which have included a broad range of microbiological investigations. We undertook a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to a government hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, to determine possible bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic and viral causes of diarrhoca; to consider which may be treatable; and to relate microbiological findings to clinical outcome. METHODS: Stool specimens from 75 consecutive HIV-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhoca admitted to a Nairobi hospital were subjected to microbiological investigation and results were compared with clinical findings and outcome. Stool samples were cultured for bacteria and mycobacteria and underwent light and electron microscopy; lawns of Escherichica coli were probed for pathogenic types and aliquots were tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin. Blood cultures for mycobacteria and other bacterial pathogens were performed as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (52%) patients yielded putative pathogens, the most common being Cryptosporidium sp. (17%), Salmonella typhimurium (13%), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%). Of 41 patients investigated for pathogenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli and diffusely adherent E. coli were each found in four patients. Thirty-one (41%) patients died. Detection of cryptosporidium cysts was the single most significant predictor of death (X(2) = 5.2, P<0.05). Many patients did not improve (21; 285) or self-discharged whilst still sick (5; 7%) but five (7%) were diagnosed ante mortem with tuberculosis and treated and a further 13 (17%) showed improvement by time of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea in Nairobi have a poor outcome overall, and even with extensive investigation a putative pathogen was identified in only just over half the patients. The most important step is to exclude tuberculosis: and the most useful investigation appears to be Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Other potentially treatable Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, S. typhimurium, Shigella sp. and adherent E. coli were, however, common but require culture facilities which are not widely accessible for definitive identification.

Drawing on a survey of 166 Egyptian agri-food SMEs, this study investigates differences in- and determinants of COVID-19 business risk perception among these enterprises. The empirical results showed that risk perception was highly asymmetric across geographical regions. Enterprises with longer cash flow coverage periods and higher values of total assets perceived significantly lower risk levels, as cash and assets functioned as a buffer against the impact of COVID-19. The findings of the study imply that the \\"just-in-time\\" approach and the absence of a proactive and preventative stance to risk management reduced the resilience of agri-food SMEs to the risks presented by the pandemic. Generally, enterprises that operate both in domestic and export markets perceived lower COVID-19 risks. Finally, the main export destination to which the surveyed enterprises export was a significant determinant of their risk perception. These findings could be useful to managers of agri-food businesses in terms of better understanding of risks and promotion of risk management practices. More so, they can help design effective policy interventions to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on Egyptian agri-food SMEs and build up their resilience to future pandemics and shocks.","output":"Risk perception and determinants in small- and medium-sized agri-food enterprises amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unscrupulous promoters of tax avoidance schemes are continuing to target healthcare workers, including agency nurses and those who have returned to help the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The direct action of SARS-CoV-2 in lung cells and the dysregulated immuno-coagulative pathways activated in ARDS influence pulmonary involvement in severe COVID, that might be modulated by disease duration and individual factors. In this study we assessed the proportions of different lung pathology patterns in severe COVID-19 patients along the disease evolution and individual characteristics. METHODS: We analysed lung tissue from 41 COVID-19 patients that died in the period MarchCJune 2020 and were submitted to a minimally invasive autopsy. Eight pulmonary regions were sampled. Pulmonary pathologists analysed the H&E stained slides, performing semiquantitative scores on the following parameters: exudative, intermediate or advanced DAD, bronchopneumonia, alveolar haemorrhage, infarct (%), arteriolar (number) or capillary thrombosis (yes/no). Histopathological data were correlated with demographic-clinical variables and periods of symptoms-hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients age varied from 22 to 88 years (18f/23 m), with hospital admission varying from 0 to 40 days. All patients had different proportions of DAD in their biopsies. Ninety percent of the patients presented pulmonary microthrombosis. The proportion of exudative DAD was higher in the period 0C8 days of hospital admission till death, whereas advanced DAD was higher after 17 days of hospital admission. In the group of patients that died within eight days of hospital admission, elderly patients had less proportion of the exudative pattern and increased proportions of the intermediate patterns. Obese patients had lower proportion of advanced DAD pattern in their biopsies, and lower than patients with overweight. Clustering analysis showed that patterns of vascular lesions (microthrombosis, infarction) clustered together, but not the other patterns. The vascular pattern was not influenced by demographic or clinical parameters, including time of disease progression. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 present different proportions of DAD patterns over time, with advanced DAD being more prevalent after 17 days, which seems to be influenced by age and weight. Vascular involvement is present in a large proportion of patients, occurs early in disease progression, and does not change over time.","output":"Tracking the time course of pathological patterns of lung injury in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe inflammatory syndrome called COVID-19 that primarily affects the lungs leading, in many cases, to bilateral pneumonia, severe dyspnea and in ~5% of the cases, death. The mechanisms through which this occurs are still being elucidated. A strong relationship between COVID-19 progression and autoimmune disorder pathogenesis has been identified as an exacerbated interferon immune response or an inflammatory condition mediated by an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, among other. DNA methylation is known to regulate immune response processes, thus COVID-19 progression might be also conditioned by DNA methylation changes not studied in depth, yet. Thus, here an epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis combined with DNA genotyping for 101 and 473 SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive lab tested individuals, respectively, from two different clinical centers is presented in order to evaluate the implications of the epigenetic regulation in the course of COVID-19 disease. The results reveal the existence of an epigenome regulation of functional pathways associated with the COVID-19 progression, such as innate interferon responses, hyperactivation of B and T lymphocytes, phagocytosis and innate C-type lectin DC-SIGN. These DNA methylation changes were found to be regulated by genetic loci associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and autoimmune disease. In mild COVID-19 patients hypomethylation of CpGs regulating genes within the AKT signaling pathway, and the hypermethylation of a group of CpGs related to environmental traits regulating IL-6 expression via the transcription factor CEBP, discriminate these individuals from those who develop the most critical outcomes of the disease. Thus, the analysis points out to an environmental contribution that mediated by DNA methylation changes in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, might be playing a role in triggering the cytokine storm described in the most severe cases. In addition, important differences were found in terms of epigenetic regulation between severe and mild cases when compared with systemic autoimmune diseases.","output":"Whole-Blood Methylation Analysis Reveals Respiratory Environmental Functional Pathways Involved in Severity Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic was first recognized at the end of 2019 and has caused one of the most serious global public health crises in the last years. In this paper, we review current literature on the effect of weather (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, etc.) and climate (temperature as an essential climate variable, solar radiation in the ultraviolet, sunshine duration) variables on SARS-CoV-2 and discuss their impact to the COVID-19 pandemic; the review also refers to respective effect of urban parameters and air pollution. Most studies suggest that a negative correlation exists between ambient temperature and humidity on the one hand and the number of COVID-19 cases on the other, while there have been studies which support the absence of any correlation or even a positive one. The urban environment and specifically the air ventilation rate, as well as air pollution, can probably affect, also, the transmission dynamics and the case fatality rate of COVID-19. Due to the inherent limitations in previously published studies, it remains unclear if the magnitude of the effect of temperature or humidity on COVID-19 is confounded by the public health measures implemented widely during the first pandemic wave. The effect of weather and climate variables, as suggested previously for other viruses, cannot be excluded, however, under the conditions of the first pandemic wave, it might be difficult to be uncovered. The increase in the number of cases observed during summertime in the Northern hemisphere, and especially in countries with high average ambient temperatures, demonstrates that weather and climate variables, in the absence of public health interventions, cannot mitigate the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks.","output":"A review of the impact of weather and climate variables to COVID-19: In the absence of public health measures high temperatures cannot probably mitigate outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the application of a huge range of human factors (HF) principles in a growing range of care contexts, there is much more that could be done to realize this expertise for patient benefit, staff wellbeing and organizational performance.

To explore these factors, we conducted a prospective mixed-methods study to assess the relationship between telemedicine utilization and socio-demographic factors among patients seeking eye care. We also assessed patient satisfaction with eye care using a health disparities lens. Methods : We conducted phone interviews with a stratified random sample of 1,720 patients who had a visit scheduled at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan from 4/30/20-5/25/20 to ascertain patient perception of care received during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participant data was stratified by visit type and then analyzed by demographic variables. A Chi-square test was used to assess for association between categorical variables. Associations between visit type were determined using a multinomial logistic regression model. Open ended questions were stratified by race and analyzed using grounded theory to identify whether themes varied through a disparities lens. Results : Non-white patients had lower odds of having an in-person visit (p<0.02). Older patients had lower odds of having a video visit (p=0.007) and higher odds of having an inperson visit (p=0.023) compared to younger patients. The mean neighborhood median household income varied significantly (p<0.0001) by race with Blacks having the lowest estimated mean. Access to broadband signal with faster download speeds compared to slower was associated with lower odds of an in-person visit (p=0.022). No differences between races were identified in patient satisfaction or perception of care. Conclusions : Disparities existed in how patients accessed eye care during the COVID-19 pandemic with non-white patients less likely to access care. Coupled with other barriers such as lower income, which, on a population level, may limit access to broadband internet, reimbursing telemedicine solely through broadband internet connection may further exacerbate disparities in access to eye care.

METHODS One hundred and fifty-two children of 1-10 years of age, who received general anesthesia for adenotonsillectomy were enrolled to the study. In all participants, the transverse diameter of the subglottis was measured with ultrasound during apnea. An endotracheal tube was chosen with the outer diameter matched to the measured subglottic airway diameter. An age-based (Motoyama-Khine) and height-based (Broselow) endotracheal tube size was calculated. If there was resistance to passage of the tube into the trachea or an airway pressure >25 cmH2 0 was required to detect an audible leak, the endotracheal tube was replaced with internal diameter of 0.5 mm smaller. If there was an audible leak at airway pressure <10 cmH2 O, or peak pressure >25 cmH2 0 or a cuff pressure > 25 cmH2 O was required to seal, the tube was changed to the 0.5 mm larger internal diameter. Best-fit tube internal diameter was the resultant tube internal diameter that met the previously stated conditions. The need for endotracheal tube replacement and peak airway pressure were recorded. RESULTS The internal diameter of ultrasound determined tube was the same as best-fit tube in 88% of children. Endotracheal tube was replaced in 15 patients with a one size larger, and in three patients with one size smaller tube. Using Bland-Altman analysis, a better agreement was observed with ultrasound measurement rather than height-based estimation and age-based formulas.

Among adults aged 25C64 years, it increased after 2006. The median age at death from PE decreased from 73 years to 68 years (2000C18). The prevalence of cancer, respiratory diseases, and infections as a contributing cause of PE-related death increased in all age categories from 2000 to 2018. The annual age-standardised PE-related mortality was consistently higher by up to 50% in Black individuals than in White individuals; these rates were approximately 50% higher in White individuals than in those of other races. In Canada, the annual age-standardised mortality rate from PE as the underlying cause of death decreased from 47 deaths per 100 000 population (44C50) in 2000 to 26 deaths per 100 000 population (24C28) in 2017; this decline slowed after 2006 across age groups and sexes. INTERPRETATION: After 2006, the initially decreasing PE-related mortality rates in North America progressively reached a plateau in Canada, while a rebound increase was observed among young and middle-aged adults in the USA. These findings parallel recent upward trends in mortality from other cardiovascular diseases and might reflect increasing inequalities in the exposure to risk factors and access to health care.

It spread globally at a rapid rate and killed innumerable people. The SARS-CoV-2 infection, also called coronavirus disease 2019, was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. The increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 related deaths is due to a number of reasons. A few antiviral, antimicrobial, and immune-based drugs have been repurposed for treatment as well as improvement of patient prognosis. These drugs are currently being studied in clinical trials conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other global health organizations to identify the agents that produce maximum positive patient outcomes and reduction in mortality rate. The aim of this article is to discuss the safety and efficacy of the repurposed drugs in SARS-CoV-2 infection based on currently available clinical evidence and to emphasize the importance of caution required whilst employing the international therapeutic guidelines. Also highlighted in this article are certain specific comorbid conditions, that either involve treatment with the repurposed drugs or have a direct impact of the virus in patients owing to their vulnerability.","output":"Perspectives on Repurposed Drugs Based on Globally Accepted Therapeutic Guidelines to Combat SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The role of intensified lung physiotherapy bundle after cardiac surgery was investigated. METHODS: A before- and after-surgery comparison was conducted between the study from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 (control group), when traditional lung physiotherapy bundle was used, and from January 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021 (study group), when the intensified bundle was used. The baseline data, clinical features, incidence of postoperative pneumonia, and prognoses of all the enrolled cardiac surgery patients were analyzed. RESULTS: In accordance with the study criteria, 358 patients were enrolled. The incidence rate of postoperative pneumonia was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (14.2 vs. 22.7%, P = 0.037), as was in-hospital mortality (1.5 vs. 5.2%, P = 0.043). Patients receiving the intensified lung physiotherapy bundle had much shorter mechanical ventilation time (92 vs. 144 h, P < 0.0001), much shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay (5 vs. 7 days, P < 0.001), and much shorter hospital stay (17 vs. 18.5 days, P = 0.022). The intensified lung physiotherapy bundle was an independent protective factor enabling the reduced occurrence of pneumonia (P = 0.007). On univariate analysis, this bundle significantly improved in-hospital mortality (P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Our intensified lung physiotherapy bundle potentially reduces the rate of postoperative pneumonia after cardiac surgery.

Here we compare results from two surveys of principal investigators, conducted between April 2020 and January 2021, along with analyses of large-scale publication data. We find that there has been a clear sign of recovery in some regards, as scientists' time spent on their work has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, the latest data also reveals a new dimension in which the pandemic is affecting the scientific workforce: the rate of initiating new research projects. Except for the small fraction of scientists who directly engaged in COVID-related research, most scientists started significantly fewer new research projects in 2020. This decline is most pronounced amongst the same demographic groups of scientists who reported the largest initial disruptions: female scientists and those with young children. Yet in sharp contrast to the earlier phase of the pandemic, when there were large disparities across scientific fields, this loss of new projects appears remarkably homogeneous across fields. Analyses of large-scale publication data reveal a global decline in the rate of new collaborations, especially in non-COVID-related preprints, which is consistent with the reported decline in new projects. Overall, these findings highlight that, while the end of the pandemic may appear in sight in some countries, its large and unequal impact on the scientific workforce may be enduring, which may have broad implications for inequality and the long-term vitality of science.","output":"Loss of New Ideas: Potentially Long-lasting Effects of the Pandemic on Scientists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case series examines patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were discharged from the hospital and had recurrent positive reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results.","output":"Recurrent Positive Reverse TranscriptaseCPolymerase Chain Reaction Results for Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Patients Discharged From a Hospital in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During these first months of 2020, the world is experiencing the most ruthless health crisis in modern history.

It has continued to spread across the world after its first outbreak in China in 2019. On 11 March 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic given its global public health and economic impacts. OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) on lifestyle, public health measures practiced by society and their impact to contain COVID-19 transmission in the Afar community, Afar Region, Ethiopia. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from May to July, 2020, on purposively selected districts and the Peasant Association (PA). Simple random sampling was applied to select households and study participants. Structured and semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information from study participants. The collected data were entered into Microsoft Excel and transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Both descriptive and analytical analysis was provided and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the total (266) study participants, most of them had no formal education (61.7%) and were aged from 35C40 (34.2%).

The digitization of healthcare, constant updates to online medical repositories, and increasing availability of biomedical datasets make it challenging to effectively analyze the data. This creates additional workload for medical professionals who are heavily dependent on medical data to complete their research and consult their patients. This paper aims to show how different text highlighting techniques can capture relevant medical context. This would reduce the doctors' cognitive load and response time to patients by facilitating them in making faster decisions, thus improving the overall quality of online medical services. Three different word-level text highlighting methodologies are implemented and evaluated. The first method uses Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores directly to highlight important parts of the text. The second method is a combination of TF-IDF scores, Word2Vec and the application of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations to classification models. The third method uses neural networks directly to make predictions on whether or not a word should be highlighted.

Reproductive coercion and abuse includes any form of behaviour that intentionally controls another person's reproductive choices. The aim of this qualitative evidence synthesis is to explore women's experiences of reproductive coercion and abuse globally, to broaden understanding of the different ways reproductive coercion and abuse is perpetrated, perceived and experienced across settings and socio-cultural contexts. METHOD We searched Medline, CINAHL and Embase for eligible studies from inception to 25th February 2021. Primary studies with a qualitative study design that focused on the experiences and perceptions of women who have encountered reproductive coercion and abuse were eligible for inclusion. Titles and abstracts, and full texts were screened by independent reviewers. We extracted data from included studies using a form designed for this synthesis and assessed methodological limitations using CASP. We used Thomas and Harden's thematic analysis approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence, and the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess confidence in review findings. RESULTS We included 33 studies from twelve countries in South Asia, the Asia Pacific, North America, South America, Africa and Europe. Most studies used in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to discuss women's experiences of reproductive coercion and abuse. Reproductive coercion and abuse manifested in a range of behaviours including control of pregnancy outcome, pregnancy pressure or contraceptive sabotage. There were a range of reasons cited for reproductive coercion and abuse, including control of women, rigid gender roles, social inequalities and family pressure. Women's different responses to reproductive coercion and abuse included using covert contraception and feelings of distress, anger and trauma. Across contexts, perpetration and experiences of reproductive coercion and abuse were influenced by different factors including son preferences and social exclusion. CONCLUSIONS We reflect on the importance of socio-cultural factors in understanding the phenomenon of reproductive coercion and abuse and how it affects women, as well as how the mechanisms of power and control at both individual and societal levels work to perpetuate the incidence of reproductive coercion and abuse against women.","output":"Women's perceptions and experiences of reproductive coercion and abuse: a qualitative evidence synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dans le contexte de pandmie de 2020, lventualit de contamination transfusionnelle par le SARS-CoV-2 se pose.

The virulence mechanisms associated with Staphylococcus aureus biofilms are becoming better understood. Human neutrophils are critical for the innate immune response to S. aureus infection. Here we describe two virulence strategies that converge to promote the ability of S. aureus biofilms to evade killing by neutrophils. Specifically, we show that while neutrophils exposed to S. aureus biofilms produce extracellular traps (NETs) and phagocytose bacteria, both mechanisms are inefficient in clearance of the biofilm biomass. This is attributed to the leukocidin LukAB, which promotes S. aureus survival during phagocytosis. We also show that the persistence of biofilm bacteria trapped in NETs is facilitated by S. aureus nuclease (Nuc)-mediated degradation of NET DNA. This study describes key aspects of the interaction between primary human neutrophils and S. aureus biofilms and provides insight for how S. aureus evades the neutrophil response to cause persistent infections.","output":"Leukocidins and the nuclease Nuc prevent neutrophil mediated killing of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) was the U.S. epicenter of the Spring 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. We present seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates of seropositivity immediately after the first wave. METHODS: From a serosurvey of adult NYC residents (May 13-July 21, 2020), we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stratified by participant demographics, symptom history, health status, and employment industry. We used multivariable regression models to assess associations between participant characteristics and seropositivity. RESULTS: Seroprevalence among 45,367 participants was 23.6% (95% CI, 23.2%-24.0%). High seroprevalence (>30%) was observed among Black and Hispanic individuals, people from high poverty neighborhoods, and people in health care or essential worker industry sectors. COVID-19 symptom history was associated with seropositivity (adjusted relative risk=2.76; 95% CI, 2.65-2.88). Other risk factors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residential area, employment sector, working outside the home, contact with a COVID-19 case, obesity, and increasing numbers of household members. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a large serosurvey in a single U.S. jurisdiction, we estimate that just under one-quarter of NYC adults were infected in the first few months of the COVID-19 epidemic.

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) in their 'Facing the Future: Standards for children in emergency care settings', a guideline for the future of paediatric emergency departments, highlights the importance of robust ambulatory care. Ambulatory care and in particular ambulatory antibiotics has been a feature of acute paediatric care for well over a decade for patients who require intravenous (IV) antibiotics but are medically fit for discharge. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate patient and parental experiences of ambulatory antibiotics directly from a paediatric emergency department (PED) and to improve this service. Methods This study was a qualitative analysis of patient and parental experience over a four-month period from May-August 2020. Data were collected from surveys distributed at the time of the second dose of antibiotics to all patients ambulating on IV antibiotics. Parameters were surveyed in a graded scale (poor, fair, good, excellent) for overall satisfaction and communication along with yes/no and free-text answers exploring other aspects of the ambulating process. Results 38 patients were eligible for inclusion in this study, 28 of whom (74%) completed the survey. The number of patients was limited by changes in practice and health-seeking behaviours for children with infections during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall satisfaction was rated as 'excellent' by 75% of participants and 'good' by 25%. 96% of patients felt they fully understood the reason for ambulatory antibiotics and 100% of participants preferred ambulatory care to admission. The information given to patients and their families was rated as excellent by 71% of participants and good by 29%. Free text thematic analysis of responses related to communication highlighted recurrent comments around improving communication including the information given regarding the decision to ambulate, the practicalities of the ambulating process and the diagnosis. Other strong emerging themes included improving advice around cannula care and safety net advice. The survey feedback has resulted in us implementing varies changes to improve the service, including an information leaflet on the ambulatory process including day to day practicalities of the process, how to care for the cannula and safety net advice regarding when to return. In addition, the PED team have been educated to provide clear communication explaining the decision to ambulate, the diagnosis and to be aware to cannulate the non dominant hand for comfort if possible. Conclusions This study should encourage paediatric emergency departments nationwide to utilise the resource of ambulatory antibiotics directly, to avoid admission and better utilise our finite healthcare resources. Overall the experience of ambulatory antibiotics for certain conditions was very positive, a statement best demonstrated by 100% of participants preferring ambulatory care to hospital admission.

Knowledge about COVID-19 in CVID patients is sparse. We, here, synthesize current research addressing the level of threat COVID-19 poses to CVID patients and the best-known treatments. METHOD: Review of 14 publications. RESULTS: The number of CVID patients with moderate to severe (~29%) and critical infection courses (~10%), and the number of fatal cases (~13%), are increased compared to the general picture of COVID-19 infection. However, this might be an overestimate. Systematic cohort-wide studies are lacking, and asymptomatic or mild cases among CVID patients occur that can easily remain unnoticed. Regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy was administered in almost all patients, potentially explaining why the numbers of critical and fatal cases were not higher. In addition, the application of convalescent plasma was demonstrated to have positive effects. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 poses an elevated threat to CVID patients. However, only systematic studies can provide robust information on the extent of this threat.

A protocol that limits the resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) to events that are more likely to result in a positive outcome can lower hospital burdens and reduce emergency medical services resources and infection risk, although it would come at the cost of lives lost that could otherwise be saved. Our primary objective was to evaluate candidate OHCA CSC protocols involving known predictors of survival and identify the protocol that results in the smallest resource burden, as measured by the number of hospitalizations required per favorable OHCA outcome achieved. Our secondary objective was to describe the effects of the CSC protocols in terms of health outcomes and other measures of resource burden. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) database. Non-traumatic OHCA events from 2018 were included (na?=a?79,533). Candidate CSC protocols involving combinations of known predictors of good survival for OHCA were applied to the existing dataset to measure the resulting numbers of resuscitation attempts, transportations to hospital, hospital admissions, and favorable neurological outcomes. These outcomes were also assessed under Standard Care, defined as no CSC protocol applied to the data. RESULTS: The CSC protocol with the smallest number of hospitalizations per survivor with a favorable neurological outcome was that an OHCA resuscitation should only be attempted if the arrest was witnessed by emergency medical services or the first monitored rhythm was shockable (number of hospitalizations: 2.26 [95% CI: 2.21-2.31] vs. 3.46 [95% CI: 3.39-3.53] under Standard Care). This rule resulted in significant reductions in resource utilization (46.1% of hospitalizations and 29.2% of resuscitation attempts compared to Standard Care) while still preserving 70.5% of the favorable neurological outcomes under Standard Care. For every favorable neurological outcome lost under this CSC protocol, 6.3 hospital beds were made free that could be used to treat other patients. CONCLUSION: In a pandemic scenario, pre-hospital CSC protocols that might not otherwise be considered have the potential to greatly improve overall survival, and this study provides an evidence-based approach towards selecting such a protocol. As this study was performed using data generated before the COVID-19 pandemic, future studies incorporating pandemic-era data will further help develop evidence-based CSC protocols.","output":"Evidence-based crisis standards of care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chapter 10 covers the administrative and legal aspects of biosecurity, which include international treaties, laws, statutes, regulations, and government directives aimed at reducing the threat due to the biological agents and enabling enforcers to deal with those that use them with ill intentions.

We demonstrate that heterogeneity in human-human interactions give rise to non-linear infection networks that gain complexity with time. Consequently, targeted vaccination strategies are challenged as such effects are not accurately captured by epidemiological models assuming homogeneous mixing. With vaccines being prepared for global deployment determining optimality for swiftly reaching population level immunity in heterogeneous local communities world-wide is critical. We introduce a model that predicts the effect of vaccination into an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak using precision simulation of human-human interaction and infection networks. We show that simulations incorporating non-linear network complexity and local heterogeneity can enable governance with performance-quantified vaccination strategies. Vaccinating highly interactive people diminishes the risk for an infection wave, while vaccinating the elderly reduces fatalities at low population level immunity. Interestingly, a combined strategy is not better due to non-linear effects. While risk groups should be vaccinated first to minimize fatalities, significant optimality branching is observed with increasing population level immunity. Importantly, we demonstrate that regardless of immunization strategy non-pharmaceutical interventions are required to prevent ICU overload and breakdown of healthcare systems.

However, the response of CH4 and VSC emissions to lake eutrophication and algae growth as well as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the emissions of CH4 and VSCs from four regions of Lake Taihu with different eutrophic levels were investigated in four months (i.e., March, May, August and December). The CH4 emissions ranged from 20.4 to 126.9 mg m-2 d-1 in the investigated sites and increased with eutrophic levels and temperature. H2S and CS2 were the dominant volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) emitted from the lake. The CH4 oxidation potential of water ranged from 2.1 to 14.9 g h-1 L-1, which had positive correlations with trophic level index and the environmental variables except for the NH4+-N concentration. Eutrophic levels could increase the abundances of bacteria and methanotrophs in lake water. -Proteobacteria methanotroph Methylocystis was more abundant than -Proteobacteria methanotrophs in March and May, while the latter was more abundant in August and November. The relative abundance of Cyanobacteria, including Microcystis, A. granulata var. angustissima and Cyanobium had significantly positive correlations with temperature, turbidity, SO42--S, and total sulfur. Partial least squares path modelling revealed that the algal growth could promote VSC emissions, which had a positive correlation with CH4 oxidation potential, likely due to the positive correlation between the CH4 and VSC emissions from lakes.

Molecular modeling revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein might bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) through a cryptic epitope homologous to snake toxins, substrates well documented and known for their affinity to the nAChRs.

The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the outbreak (June-July 2020). Method: Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19, behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing. Results: Overall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70% reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and/or anxiety. Conclusion: These results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis.

The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was compared between close contacts of COVID-19 cases with Alpha and Delta variants during June 2021 to August 2021. In index cases, Spike gene target failure (TaqPath) was used as a proxy of Alpha variant and the L452R mutation (TaqMan) for Delta variant. Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (RR). We compared close contacts of index cases with Alpha (n = 2139) and Delta variants (n = 5439). Delta variant was more transmissible overall (relative risk [RR] 1.32, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.53), and in non-household contacts (RR 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35 to 2.16), but not in household contacts (RR 1.10, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.34; P(interaction) < 0.001). Delta variant excess transmission was observed when the index cases were 12 to 39 years old (RR 1.51, 95% CI = 1.27 to 1.79) and the close contacts were 18 to 39 years old (RR 1.62, 95% CI = 1.29 to 2.03), but not among those younger or older than such ages. Differences in transmissibility between variants disappeared with vaccination of the index case (RR 0.68, 95% CI = 0.46 to 1.02), but not with vaccination of the close contact. This report shows that the Delta variant is more transmissible than Alpha variant mainly among young adults. Vaccination of the index cases reduced the excess transmission, which reinforces the recommendation of vaccination to reduce transmission of the Delta variant. IMPORTANCE The higher transmissibility of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the Alpha variant has been reported. We compared the transmission of the Alpha and Delta variants by characteristics and COVID-19 vaccination status of index cases and their close contacts. Interestingly, the Delta variant showed increased transmissibility when the index case was an adolescent or young adult and when the close contact was a young adult; however, in index cases and close contacts of other age groups, transmission did not differ between variants. This may explain the increased proportion of young people who have been infected in the surges due to the Delta variant. The Delta variant was more transmissible than the Alpha variant when the index cases were unvaccinated against COVID-19, and their vaccination equaled the transmissibility of both variants, which suggests a higher impact of vaccination in controlling transmission of the Delta variant.","output":"Differences in Transmission between SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with beta cell dysfunction and progression of glycemic and cardiometabolic variables in an established cohort.

According to the data, different cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) are involved in both term and preterm parturition. These cytokines could trigger expression of different substances such as prostaglandins (PGs), their receptors, and PGs synthetizing molecules with already proven roles in parturition. Moreover, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- knocked?-out mice have delayed parturition and lower levels of PGs compared to the wild types. The earlier?-mentioned cytokines are able to induce matrix metalloproteinases and are also involved in parturition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified cases of acute thrombosis following PED placement in 100 consecutive procedures performed at our institution from a prospectively maintained clinical database. Angiographic findings were analyzed for early signs of acute thrombus formation. We also evaluated the efficacy of treatment of this complication with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab), as well as the results of pre-procedure platelet inhibition testing. RESULTS Acute thrombus formation was encountered in five patients following PED placement (5%). Early angiographic signs were present in all cases and included progressive stagnation of blood flow in covered side branches, occlusion of covered side branches, excessive stagnation of blood flow in the target aneurysm, as well as occlusion of the target aneurysm. These sequelae completely resolved following abciximab treatment in all five cases, with no permanent neurological morbidity or mortality. Four of the five patients had a pre-procedure P2Y12 value >200 (range 201-227).

The aim of this bench study was: (1) to investigate the technical aspects that can influence the setting of the ventilator during mouthpiece ventilation and (2) to provide a practical setting strategy to avoid the alarm activation. METHODS Eight life-support ventilators able to deliver volume controlled ventilation were tested in a bench study using a single-limb non-vented circuit configuration connected to a standard mouthpiece. Disconnection and apnea alarm were turned off or set at the least sensitive setting. The backup frequency was set at the lowest available level. Different tidal volumes (VT) (from 500 to 1,200 mL) were tested with the rectangular and descending flow shape. For each VT, we reported the maximum set inspiratory time (TI) that allowed preventing activation of the low-pressure alarm. The presence of auto-triggering was also surveyed. RESULTS We found that a correct combination of VT and TI avoided the activation of disconnection and low-pressure alarms in all but 3 ventilators. One ventilator did not allow mouthpiece ventilation independently from the settings used. The inability to turn off the apnea alarm in two other ventilators led to the alarm going off in any tested conditions after 120 s without triggered breaths. Auto-triggering was seldom found and easily worked out, except for in one ventilator. CONCLUSIONS An appropriate alarm setting and combination of VT and TI would allow the majority of the tested ventilators to be used for mouthpiece ventilation without alarm activation.","output":"Ventilator Settings to Avoid Nuisance Alarms During Mouthpiece Ventilation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for significant lung disease in adults. Despite mild manifestations in most children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is well described in older children with cardiac manifestations. However, MIS-C-related cardiac manifestations are not as well described in younger children. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of MIS-C patients under the age of 5 years admitted between May and November 2020 to a single centre. Included cases fulfilled the case definition of MIS-C according to Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health criteria with laboratory, electrocardiogram, or echocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease. Collected data included patients demographics, laboratory results, echocardiographic findings, management, and outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 16 MIS-C cases under 5 years of age, 10 (62.5%) had cardiac manifestations with a median age of 12 months, 9 (90%) were previously healthy. Cardiac manifestations included coronary arterial aneurysms or ectasia in five (50%) cases, two (20%) with isolated myopericarditis, coronary ectasia with myocarditis in two (20%), and supraventricular tachycardia in one (10%). Intravenous immunoglobulins were given in all cases with coronary involvement or myocarditis. The median duration of hospitalisation was 7 (6C14) days; two (20%) cases with cardiac disease were mechanically ventilated and mortality in MIS-C cases below 5 years was 12.5%. Normalisation of systolic function occurred in half of the affected cases within 1 week and reached 100% by 30 days of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 has a high possibility of serious associated cardiac manifestations in children under the age of 5 years with mortality and/or long-term morbidities such as coronary aneurysms even in previously healthy children.","output":"Cardiac implications of multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 in children under the age of 5 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report our initial experience with weekly tele-video virtual on treatment visits (vOTVs), describe the logistics of implementation, report results of patient and physician surveys, and discuss barriers, limitations, and benefits of vOTVs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Virtual OTVs were piloted at two centers, and within one week expanded to 4 additional centers. Patients participating in vOTVs were surveyed about their satisfaction with vOTVs, quality of vOTVs, and confidence in their physicians ability to manage their care through vOTVs, as well as their support of, and preferences related to vOTVs. Participating physicians were also surveyed about their comfort and satisfaction with vOTVs. Medical Directors at non-participating centers within our network were surveyed regarding their reasoning for not using vOTVs. RESULTS: In week 1, 72 of 81 patients between 2 pilot centers were seen using vOTVs. In week 2, 189 of 211 patients were seen using vOTVs at 6 centers. Patient satisfaction and confidence in their physicians ability to address their concerns through the vOTV was high at 4.75 on a 5-point scale. Patients were overall very supportive (4.67) and found the quality of the visits to be as good as, or better, than their prior in person weekly OTV (3.75). Physicians participating in the vOTVs felt very comfortable in their ability to manage patients though this platform (5.0), and on average did not report any difference in terms of efficiency of visits (3.0).

The aim of this study was to review the experience of a single centre with paediatric orthopaedic traumas and determine the relationship between the severity and the variations in the incidence of traumas in relation to the seasons and temperatures during the study period. MATERIALS AND METHODS A single institutional review of the historical data of all patients aged 0-16 years who presented for orthopaedic trauma between January 2018 and December 2020 in the emergency department of Level 1 tertiary orthopaedic trauma centre was conducted. 65,182 paediatric orthopaedic trauma cases had been retrieved from the hospital data base during the 3 -year study period. We classified the traumas according to the variants of the patients' and by holidays, seasons, school days and weekends, months and in which part of the body it occurred. RESULTS After excluding the summer vacation, 77% of paediatric orthopaedic trauma patients attended to the hospital on weekdays and 23% on weekends. While it was observed that hot weather had a statistically positive effect on trauma attendance, rainy weather had an negative effect (p < 0.05). Trauma attendances were found to be statistically higher in summer months, except for injuries that may occur with indoor activities such as metacarpal fracture, phalanx fracture and pulled elbow (p < 0.05).

However, in recent months multiple monoclonal antibody therapeutics to treat COVID-19 have been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Despite these authorizations and promising clinical trial efficacy results, monoclonal antibody therapies are currently underutilized as a treatment for COVID-19 across the U.S. Many barriers exist when deploying a new infused therapeutic during an ongoing pandemic with limited resources and staffing, and it is critical to better understand the process and site requirements of incorporating monoclonal antibody infusions into pandemic response activities. Methods: We examined the monoclonal antibody infusion site process components, resources, and requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from three initial infusion sites at medical centers in the U.S. supported by the National Disaster Medical System. A descriptive analysis was conducted using process assessment metrics to inform recommendations to strengthen monoclonal antibody infusion site implementation. Results: The monoclonal antibody infusion sites varied in physical environment and staffing models due to state polices, infection control mechanisms, and underlying medical system structure, but exhibited a common process workflow. Sites operationalized an infusion process staffing model with at least two nurses per ten infusion patients. Monoclonal antibody implementation success factors included tailoring the infusion process to the patient community, strong engagement with local medical providers, batch preparing the therapy before patient arrival, placing the infusion center in proximity to emergency services, and creating procedures resilient to EUA changes. Infusion process challenges stemmed from confirming patient SARS-CoV-2 positivity, strained staff, scheduling needs, and coordination with the pharmacy for therapy preparation. Conclusions: Infusion site processes are most effective when integrated into the pre-existing pandemic response ecosystems and can be implemented with limited staff and physical resources. As the pandemic and policy tools such as EUAs evolve, monoclonal antibody infusion processes must also remain adaptable, as practice changes directly affect resources, staffing, timing, and workflows. Future use may be aided by incorporating innovative emergency deployment techniques, such as vehicle and home-based therapy administration, and by developing drug delivery mechanisms that alleviate the need for observed intravenous infusions by medically-accredited staff.","output":"Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody infusion sites at three medical centers in the United States: Strengths and challenges assessment to inform COVID-19 pandemic and future public health emergency use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the essential oils (EOs) obtained from three endemic Prangos species from Turkey (P. heyniae, P. meliocarpoides var. meliocarpoides, and P. uechtritzii) were studied for their chemical composition and biological activities. -Bisabolenal (12.2%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.9%) were the principal components of P. heyniae EO, while P. meliocarpoides EO contained sabinene (16.7%) and p-cymene (13.2%), and P. uechtritzii EO contained p-cymene (24.6%) and caryophyllene oxide (19.6%), as the most abundant components.

We previously identified proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) as a crucial host determinant of ILTV infection. The present study revealed accelerated spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. This phenomenon was independent of either viral replication or the proliferation of infected cells and could not be compromised by neutralizing antibody. Neither extracellular vesicles nor the direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections between adjacent cells contributed to the enhanced spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. Further genome-wide transcriptional profile analyses in combination with functional validation identified fatty acid metabolism as an essential molecular event during modulation of the intercellular spread and subsequent cytopathic effect of ILTV by Src. Overall, these data suggest that Src controls the cell-to-cell spread of ILTV in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner, which determines the virus's cytopathic effect.","output":"Host Src controls gallid alpha herpesvirus 1 intercellular spread in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent article showed that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients quarantined in isolation facilities instead of in their homes help control the spread of the virus.

Aim The aim was to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian pregnant women, especially regarding concerns and birth expectations. Methods A cross-sectional online survey of pregnant women in Italy was conducted. Responses were analysed for all women and segregated into two groups depending on previous experience of pregnancy loss. Analysis of open text responses examined expectations and concerns before and after the onset of the pandemic. Findings Two hundred pregnant women responded to the first wave of the survey. Most (n = 157, 78.5%) had other children and 100 (50.0%) had a previous history of perinatal loss. Joy was the most prevalent emotion expressed before COVID-19 (126, 63.0% before vs 34, 17.0% after; p < 0.05); fear was the most prevalent after (15, 7.5% before vs 98, 49.0% after; p < 0.05).

As of 1st May 2020, the Italian health authorities reported 28,238 deaths nationally. To control the epidemic, the Italian government implemented a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school and university closures, social distancing and full lockdown involving banning of public gatherings and non essential movement. In this report, we model the effect of NPIs on transmission using data on average mobility. We estimate that the average reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) is currently below one for all Italian regions, and significantly so for the majority of the regions. Despite the large number of deaths, the proportion of population that has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (the attack rate) is far from the herd immunity threshold in all Italian regions, with the highest attack rate observed in Lombardy (13.18% [10.66%-16.70%]). Italy is set to relax the currently implemented NPIs from 4th May 2020. Given the control achieved by NPIs, we consider three scenarios for the next 8 weeks: a scenario in which mobility remains the same as during the lockdown, a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 20%, and a scenario in which mobility returns to pre-lockdown levels by 40%. The scenarios explored assume that mobility is scaled evenly across all dimensions, that behaviour stays the same as before NPIs were implemented, that no pharmaceutical interventions are introduced, and it does not include transmission reduction from contact tracing, testing and the isolation of confirmed or suspected cases. New interventions, such as enhanced testing and contact tracing are going to be introduced and will likely contribute to reductions in transmission; therefore our estimates should be viewed as pessimistic projections. We find that, in the absence of additional interventions, even a 20% return to pre-lockdown mobility could lead to a resurgence in the number of deaths far greater than experienced in the current wave in several regions. Future increases in the number of deaths will lag behind the increase in transmission intensity and so a second wave will not be immediately apparent from just monitoring of the daily number of deaths. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 transmission as well as mobility should be closely monitored in the next weeks and months. To compensate for the increase in mobility that will occur due to the relaxation of the currently implemented NPIs, adherence to the recommended social distancing measures alongside enhanced community surveillance including swab testing, contact tracing and the early isolation of infections are of paramount importance to reduce the risk of resurgence in transmission.","output":"A sub-national analysis of the rate of transmission of COVID-19 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study is to apply simple ODE models in the area of modeling the spread of emerging infectious diseases and show the importance of model selection in estimating parameters, the basic reproduction number, turning point, and final size.

Bioinformatic analyses showed that each deduced protein sequence contained endonuclease NS domains and signal peptides.

RNAi efficiency was investigated in 2-d-old fifth-instar larvae (high expression of dsRNase2) and 2-d-old pupae (low expression of dsRNase2) by feeding or injecting dsRNA targeting a marker gene that encodes the lethal giant larvae protein (OfLgl). Our results showed that OfLgl only partially silenced the expression of OfLgl in pupae, but not in larvae, suggesting that OfdsRNase2 could contribute to lower RNAi efficiency in larval stages. This hypothesis was supported by our RNAi-of-RNAi experiment using a tissue culture technique where the silencing efficiency against the reporter gene, OfHex1, was significantly improved after knockdown of OfdsRNase2. When double luciferase assays were performed to evaluate the role of the four dsRNases in vitro, only OfdsRNase2 expressed in S2 cells significantly affected RNAi efficiency by degrading dsRNA.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a PE intervention conducted on the beach on childrens skill- and health-related outcomes, as a possible alternative PE intervention that could be also applied during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved 106 primary school children, randomly assigned to the traditional indoor (TI) intervention or to the experimental outdoor (EO) intervention. The intervention period lasted 4 months and consisted of two 1-h sessions per week. Intervention was conducted just before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Childrens anthropometric parameters (height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and abdominal circumference), fitness parameter (VO(2peak)), health parameters (resting heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure), gross motor coordination, and physical activity level were assessed before and after intervention. Both groups significantly improved fitness and motor coordination but worsened some anthropometric parameters (weight, abdominal circumference) after the intervention period. The EO group showed a higher increase of gross motor coordination than the TI group. Results of this study demonstrated that children benefited from a well-structured PE intervention conducted in the natural environment of the beach improving physical fitness and gross motor coordination. Therefore, planning outdoor PE interventions could be an alternative and safe way to encourage and implement physical activity at school during the particular period of COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Physical Education on the Beach: An Alternative Way to Improve Primary School Childrens Skill- and Health-Related Outcomes during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 through direct transmission (person-to-person) has been the focus of most studies on the dynamics of COVID-19. The efficacy of social distancing and mask usage at reducing the risk of direct transmission of COVID-19 has been studied by many researchers. Little or no attention is given to indirect transmission of the virus through shared items, commonly touch surfaces and door handles. The impact of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and in the environment, on the dynamics of COVID-19 remain largely unknown. Also, the current increase in the number of cases despite the strict non-pharmaceutical interventions suggests a need to study the indirect transmission of COVID-19 while incorporating testing of infected individuals as a preventive measure. Assessing the impact of indirect transmission of the virus may improve our understanding of the overall dynamics of COVID-19. We developed a novel deterministic susceptible-exposedinfected- removed-virus-death compartmental model to study the impact of indirect transmission pathway on the spread of COVID-19, the sources of infection, and prevention/control. We fitted the model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases at episode date in Toronto, Canada using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization algorithm. We studied the effect of indirect transmission on the epidemic peak, peak time, epidemic final size and the effective reproduction number, based on different initial conditions and at different stages. Our findings revealed an increase in cases with indirect transmission. Our work highlights the importance of implementing additional preventive and control measures involving cleaning of surfaces, fumigation, and disinfection to lower the spread of COVID-19, especially in public areas like the grocery stores, malls and so on. We conclude that indirect transmission of SARS-CoV- 2 has a significant effect on the dynamics of COVID-19, and there is need to consider this transmission route for effective mitigation, prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Modeling the potential impact of indirect transmission on COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of scientific literacy is a crucial aim of science education across the globe and research suggests that this can be realized through student exploration of socioscientific issues.

This research explores teachers perspectives on addressing the COVID-19 crisis as socioscientific issues in secondary science education. This qualitative study surveyed 266 Irish secondary school science teachers about their experiences during the COVID-19 crisis. Thematic analysis was used to identify the reasons why teachers did and did not address the COVID-19 crisis as SSI. These findings were triangulated with findings from follow-up interviews. The majority of teachers in this study addressed the COVID-19 crisis as SSI. The COVID-19 crisis was explored within the curriculum, through project work and research, and through classroom discussion. Teachers described four barriers to exploring the COVID-19 crisis with their students: The COVID-19 crisis was not part of the curriculum; The lack of F2F contact made judging students reactions challenging; There was already too much focus on the COVID-19 crisis in everyday life and concerns over student wellbeing while discussing the sensitive topic of the COVID-19 crisis.

This form of crowdfunding is growing in popularity, and its visibility is increasing as campaigns are commonly shared via social networking. A number of ethical issues have been raised about medical crowdfunding, one of which is that it introduces a number of privacy concerns. While campaigners are encouraged to share very personal details to encourage donations, the sharing of such details may result in privacy losses for the beneficiary. Here, we explore the ways in which privacy can be threatened through the practice of medical crowdfunding by exploring campaigns (n=100) for children with defined health needs scraped from the GoFundMe platform. We found specific privacy concerns related to the disclosure of private details about the beneficiary, the inclusion of images and the nature of the relationship between campaigner, funding recipient and beneficiary. For example, it was found that identifying personal and medical details about the beneficiary, including symptoms (n=52) and treatment history (n=43), were often mentioned by campaigners. While the privacy concerns identified are problematic, they are also difficult to remedy given the strong financial incentive to crowdfund. However, crowdfunding platforms can enhance privacy protections by, for example, requiring those campaigning on behalf of child beneficiaries to ensure consent has been obtained from their guardians and providing additional guidelines for the inclusion of personal information in campaigns made on behalf of those not able to give their consent to the campaign.","output":"Is there room for privacy in medical crowdfunding?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This note considers the problem of conducting statistical inference on the share of individuals in some subgroup of a population that experience some event.

We assessed whether adding azithromycin to standard of care, which included hydroxychloroquine, would improve clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised clinical trial at 57 centres in Brazil. We enrolled patients admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and at least one additional severity criteria as follows: use of oxygen supplementation of more than 4 L/min flow; use of high-flow nasal cannula; use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation; or use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg via oral, nasogastric, or intravenous administration once daily for 10 days) plus standard of care or to standard of care without macrolides. All patients received hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 10 days) because that was part of standard of care treatment in Brazil for patients with severe COVID-19. The primary outcome, assessed by an independent adjudication committee masked to treatment allocation, was clinical status at day 15 after randomisation, assessed by a six-point ordinal scale, with levels ranging from 1 to 6 and higher scores indicating a worse condition (with odds ratio [OR] greater than 100 favouring the control group). The primary outcome was assessed in all patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by molecular or serological testing before randomisation (ie, modified ITT [mITT] population). Safety was assessed in all patients according to which treatment they received, regardless of original group assignment. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04321278. FINDINGS: 447 patients were enrolled from March 28 to May 19, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed in 397 patients who constituted the mITT population, of whom 214 were assigned to the azithromycin group and 183 to the control group. In the mITT population, the primary endpoint was not significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (OR 136 [95% CI 094-197], p=011). Rates of adverse events, including clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitated cardiac arrest, acute kidney failure, and corrected QT interval prolongation, were not significantly different between groups. INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe COVID-19, adding azithromycin to standard of care treatment (which included hydroxychloroquine) did not improve clinical outcomes. Our findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine in patients with severe COVID-19.

It is known that other infectious diseases can affect the heart inducing myocarditis. As a new entity, it was unknown if SARS-COV2 could provoke that cardiovascular manifestation. This national registry was created to describe COVID19 cardiac affection and its severity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multicenter registry was conducted, including 28 centers in Spain. Patients with COVID19 diagnosis presenting an acute cardiovascular event between March 1st and May 30th were included. Eighty-two patients were included. Of them, 9 (14,1%, excluding missing data) presented with acute myocarditis; the rest were diagnosed of acute myocardial infarction or stress cardiomyopathy. Baseline characteristics of these patients are summarised in Table 1. The 83,3% of patients with myocarditis presented with heart failure and 25% simulating an acute coronary syndrome. According to severity, 5 patients (62,5%) were admitted in the Intensive Care Unit, requiring orotracheal intubation 4 patients (57,1%). Left ventricle was affected in 66,7% of patients, whereas the remaining 33,3% presented biventricular failure. Mean left ventricle ejection fraction was 46% [30,0%-52%]. One patient developed refractory cardiogenic shock requiring implantation of both intra-aortic balloon pump and VA- ECMO. Three patients died during hospitalization. Cardiac magnetic resonance was conducted in 2 patients (28,6%), showing oedema and subepicardial enhacement in postero-lateral segments. Cardiac biopsy was performed in one patient showing significant lymphoid infiltration and intersticial oedema. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID 19 who develop acute myocarditis usually present with heart failure secondary to ventricular failure.

Covariates evaluated included demographics, symptoms on admission, vital signs, medications, comorbidities, census tract data and social history. Univariable analysis was performed and variables with an alpha of 0.05 or less were included in multivariable regression modeling to identify factors associated with mechanical ventilation.

Inspired by the significant progress in automatic image captioning, various deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to generate radiology reports for medical images. Despite promising results, previous works overlook the uncertainties of their models and are thus unable to provide clinicians with the reliability/confidence of the generated radiology reports to assist their decision-making. In this paper, we propose a novel method to explicitly quantify both the visual uncertainty and the textual uncertainty for DL-based radiology report generation. Such multi-modal uncertainties can sufficiently capture the model confidence degree at both the report level and the sentence level, and thus they are further leveraged to weight the losses for more comprehensive model optimization. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method for model uncertainty characterization and estimation can produce more reliable confidence scores for radiology report generation, and the modified loss function, which takes into account the uncertainties, leads to better model performance on two public radiology report datasets. In addition, the quality of the automatically generated reports was manually evaluated by human raters and the results also indicate that the proposed uncertainties can reflect the variance of clinical diagnosis.","output":"Trust It or Not: Confidence-Guided Automatic Radiology Report Generation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo determine absolute and relative risks of either symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection for late cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.

The main cellular sources of lung NO production are the vascular endothelium and the airway epithelia (Bohle et al. 2000; German et al. 2000; Ide et al. 1999). Local NO production contributes to regulation of pulmonary perfusion depending on alveolar ventilation to assure optimized ventilation/perfusion distribution (Grimminger et al. 1995). NO-synthase activity is regulated on transcriptional and post-translational redox-based modulation level. The common signaling pathway of endogenous vasodilators, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and natriuretic peptides, engage cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP). These second messengers are mainly produced by activation of adenylate- and guanylate-cyclases, both membrane-bound and soluble (Beavo 1995). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) represent a superfamily of enzymes, with PDE1 through PDE11 being currently known, that inactivate cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, with different tissue distribution and substrate specificities (Ahn et al. 1991; Von Euler and Liljestrand. 1946). Because of stabilization of these second messengers, PDE inhibitors differentially regulate levels of cAMP and/or cGMP, depending on their selectivity profile. Recently, direct activators and stimulators of the sGC have been suggested as new therapeutic tools for the treatment of lung vascular disorders that might have even higher potency than PDE inhibitors or exogenously applied NO.","output":"Modulating cGMP to Treat Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. COVID-2019 was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-CoV. But the infection rate of COVID-2019 is much higher than SARS-CoV. The biophysical and structural evidence showed that the COVID-2019 binds ACE2 with 10~20 times affinity than SARS-CoV. TMPRSS2 cleaves ACE2 and facilitates the entry of the virus into host cells. The presence of SLC6A19 may block the access of TMPRSS2 to the cutting site on ACE2 and weaken the entry of COVID-2019 into host cells. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 expression in the nasal, mouth, lung, and colon tissues. We find that the number of ACE2-expressing cells in the nasal and mouth tissues is comparable to the number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung and colon tissues. We also find that ACE2 tends to be co-expressed with TMPRSS2 and not co-expressed with SLC6A19 in the nasal and mouth tissues. With the results, we infer that nasal and mouth tissues may be the first host cells of COVID-2019 infection. In our previous report in medRxiv and a recurrent report in New England Journal of Medicine, the COVID-2019 load tends to be higher in the nasal-swabs than in throat-swabs.

DESIGN Prospective cohort survey study, 30 April - 18 May 2020. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS Staff (scientists and non-scientists) and students at five medical research institutes in Sydney, New South Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self-assessed overall and task-specific productivity, and mental health. RESULTS The proportions of non-scientists and scientists who wore pyjamas during the day were similar (3% v 11%; P = 0.31). Wearing pyjamas was not associated with differences in self-evaluated productivity, but was significantly associated with more frequent reporting of poorer mental health than non-pyjama wearers while working from home (59% v 26%; P < 0.001). Having children in the home were significantly associated with changes in productivity. Larger proportions of people with toddlers reported reduced overall productivity (63% v 32%; P = 0.008), and reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (50% v 17%; P = 0.023) and data analysis (63% v 23%; P = 0.002). People with primary school children more frequently reported reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (42% v 16%; P = 0.026) and generating new ideas (43% v 19%; P = 0.030). On a positive note, the presence of children in the home was not associated with changes in mental health during the pandemic. In contrast to established researchers, early career researchers frequently reported reduced productivity while working at home. CONCLUSIONS Our findings are probably applicable to scientists in other countries.

Conflict-affected countries are disproportionately affected from economic and food security perspectives. In this regard, the Palestinian territories (namely West Bank and Gaza Strip), which face a number of issues such as Israeli military and economic control, overcrowded cities and refugee camps (especially in Gaza Strip), rising poverty and food insecurity, are an especially interesting case study. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the selection and intake of foods and drinks, as well as consumer behavior and attitude toward food in the Palestinian territories. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws upon an online survey in the Palestinian territories administered in Arabic through the Survey Monkey platform from September 15 to October 10, 2020, with 322 adults. The survey findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics and several nonparametric tests. Particularly, the U-Mann Whitney test was used in dichotomous, categorical independent variables (e.g. gender), while the KruskalCWallis test was run to analyze multi-choice responses (e.g. occupation). Findings: The results reveal that food attitudes and consumer behavior towards food have been widely affected. First, they reveal that Palestinians try to have healthier diets but ate more between meals (e.g. snacks). Second, the pandemic transformed respondents' shopping behavior and induced panic buying, negatively affecting food affordability due to increased prices of some foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables). Some food behaviors were shaped by negative psychological determinants (e.g. depression and anxiety). The pandemic effects are moderated by different sociodemographics (age, education and income). COVID-19 negatively affected food security but also opened a window of opportunity to trigger the transition towards more sustainable diets. Originality/value: The paper results show that the eventual effects of COVID-19 will most likely vary from country to country, based not only on the epidemiological circumstances but also, among other factors, on the baseline socioeconomic situation and shock resilience. The findings contribute to the clarification and critical analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on food behaviors in the Palestinian territories, which would have several policy implications. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Food attitudes and consumer behavior towards food in conflict-affected zones during the COVID-19 pandemic: case of the Palestinian territories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses have caused three major epidemics since 2003, including the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

In particular, structural analysis predicts that one of the changes in the Spike S1 subunit, which contains the receptor-binding domain, may affect proteins flexibility and binding to the host cell receptor.

It is argued that competition between organs for limited resources is an important mesoscale morphogenetic mechanism that produces fitness-enhancing correlated growth. At the genetic level, the growth of individual characters appears independent, or \\"modular,\\" because patterns of expression and transcription are often highly localized, mutations have trait-specific effects, and gene complexes can be co-opted as a unit to produce novel traits. However, body parts are known to interact over the course of ontogeny, and these reciprocal exchanges can be an important determinant of developmental outcomes. Genetic mechanisms underlie cell and tissue behaviors that allow organs to communicate with one another, but they also create evolutionarily adaptive competitive dynamics that are driven by physiological and biophysical processes. Advances in the understanding of competitive and closely related coordinative interactions across scales will complement existing research programs that emphasize the role of cellular mechanisms in morphogenesis.

Several recent reports have demonstrated that frozen foods are serving as carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and transmitting the virus from one place to another without any human-to-human contact. This finding highlights significant difficulties facing efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 and reveal a transmission mechanism that may have substantially worsened the global pandemic. Traditional food cold chain management practices do not include specific procedures related to SARS-CoV-2-related environmental control and information warnings; therefore, such procedures are urgently needed to allow food to be safely transported without transmitting SARS-CoV-2. In this study, a conjoint analysis of COVID-19 and food cold chain systems was performed, and the results of this analysis were used to develop an improved food cold chain management system utilizing internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technology. First, 45 COVID-19-related food cold chain incidents in China, primarily involving frozen meat and frozen aquatic products, were summarized. Critical food cold chain control points related to COVID-19 were analyzed, including temperature and cold chain requirements. A conceptual system structure to improve food cold chain management, including information sensing, chain linking and credible tracing, was proposed. Finally, a prototype system, which consisted of cold chain environment monitoring equipment, a cold chain blockchain platform, and a food chain management system, was developed. The system includes: 1) a defining characteristic of the newly developed food cold chain system presented here is the use of IoT technology to enhance real-time environmental information sensing capacity; 2) a hybrid data storage mechanism consisting of off-chain and on-chain systems was applied to enhance data security, and smart contracts were used to establish warning levels for food cold chain incidents; and 3) a hypothetical food cold chain failure scenario demonstration in which information collection, intelligent decision making, and cold chain tracing were integrated and automatically generated for decision-making. By integrating existing technologies and approaches, our study provides a novel solution to improve traditional food cold chain management and thus meet the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although our system has been shown to be effective, subsequent studies are still required to develop precise risk evaluation models for SARs-CoV-2 in food cold chains and more precisely control the entire process. By ensuring food safety and reliable traceability, our system could also contribute to the formulation of appropriate mechanisms for international cooperation and minimize the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on international food commerce.","output":"Food cold chain management improvement: A conjoint analysis on COVID-19 and food cold chain systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two large wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), covering around 2.7 million inhabitants, which represents around 85% of the metropolitan area of Barcelona, were sampled before, during, and after the implementation of a complete lockdown. Five one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope (E), and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41 days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology (WBE) to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures, and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and undiagnosed cases. For the latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0 to 6.5% was figured. On the other hand, proportions of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population were determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs. At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures. IMPORTANCE Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among the population, including not only symptomatic patients but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population. In the specific case of Barcelona, wastewater surveillance anticipated by several weeks not only the original COVID-19 pandemic wave but also the onset of the second wave. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus. Health authorities profited from WBE to complement other inputs and adopt rapid and adequate measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. For example, sentinel surveillance of specific sewers helped to locate COVID-19 hot spots and to conduct massive numbers of RT-PCR tests among the population.","output":"Time Evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wastewater during the First Pandemic Wave of COVID-19 in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic prompted governments to impose unprecedented sanitary measures, such as social distancing, curfews, and lockdowns. In France and other countries, the first COVID-19 lockdown raised concerns about an increased risk of child abuse. Abusive head trauma (AHT) is one of the most serious forms of child abuse in children aged 0C24 months and constitutes the leading cause of death in children under 2 years of age. Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is present in 89% of cases of AHT and constitutes one of the most specific, objective clinical presentations in the diagnosis of child abuse. In a French nationwide study, we sought to evaluate the potential impact of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of hospital admissions for child abuse with SDH, relative to the two previous years. We conducted a nationwide, retrospective study of data in the French national hospital discharge summary database by applying the International Classification of Diseases (10th Revision) codes for SDH and for child abuse. After including children aged up to 24 months with a diagnosis of child abuse and/or SDH following hospital admission anywhere in France between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020, we compared the incidence of child abuse, the incidence of SDH + child abuse, and the demographic data for 2020 with the corresponding values for 2018 and 2019. There were no significant differences in the number of hospital admissions due to child abuse or SDH + child abuse between 2020 and the 2018/2019 control years. The incidence of SDH + child abuse was higher among boys than among girls. There were significantly fewer hospital admissions in May 2020 (p = 0.01) and significantly more in December 2020 (p = 0.03), relative to the same months in the two preceding years.

Electrographic changes, evaluated from ECGs acquired at admission and at 7 days after starting COVID-19 therapy, were analysed. We also compared 45 patients without CV involvement with 15 patients with new onset of cardiac adverse events during hospitalization. RESULTS: ECGs under treatment showed a lower heart rate (HR) (69.45a??a??8.06 vs 80.1a??a??25.1 beats/min, Pa??=a??0,001) and a longer QRS (102.46a??a??15.08 vs 96.75a??a??17.14, Pa??=a??0.000) and QT corrected (QTc) interval (452.15a??a??37.55 vs 419.9a??a??33.41, Pa??=a??0,000) duration than ECGs before therapy. Fifteen patients (25%) showed clinical CV involvement. Within this group, female sex, lower ejection fraction (EF), low serum haemoglobin, high Troponin I levels (TnI), low lymphocytes count, high serum IL-6 levels, or use of Tocilizumab (TCZ) were more represented. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted for SARS-CoV2 infection and treated with anti-COVID-19 drug therapy develop ECG changes such as reduction in HR and increase in QRS duration and QTc interval. One in four patients developed CV events. Gender, EF, heamoglobin values, TnI, lymphocytes count, IL-6 and use of TCZ can be considered as predisposing factors for CV involvement.","output":"Electrocardiographic modifications and cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients: results from an Italian cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to global concerns over coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-associated allergic reactions; the Hong Kong Institute of Allergy (HKIA) formulated an initial set of consensus statements (CS) on COVID-19 Vaccine Allergy Safety (VAS) in early 2021. Following accumulation of both local and international experience on and COVID-19 VAS, the HKIA task force reformed to update the Hong Kong consensus on COVID-19 VAS.

Few non-governmental organizations support GoN to promote an OH approach. The major bottlenecks in implementing OH in Nepal include poor organizational structure to support OH, absence of a legal framework to implement OH, poor coordination among different governmental agencies, insufficient technical expertise, poor data sharing mechanism across sectors, limited budget and poor understanding at political level. We encourage GoN to address these gaps and prioritize the health problems where OH approach would give the best outcome.

Through actions such as underwriting, pricing, and so forth, it differentiates, or discriminates, among insureds. Actuaries have responsibility for pricing insurance risk transfers and are intimately involved in other aspects of company actions and so have a keen interest in whether or not discrimination is appropriate from both company and societal viewpoints. This article reviews social and economic principles that can be used to assess the appropriateness of insurance discrimination. Discrimination issues vary by the line of insurance business and by the country and legal jurisdiction. This article examines social and economic principles from the vantage of a specific line of business and jurisdiction;these vantage points provide insights into principles. To sharpen understanding of the social and economic principles, this article also describes discrimination considerations for prohibitions based on diagnosis of COVID-19, the pandemic that swept the globe in 2020. Insurance discrimination issues have been an important topic for the insurance industry for decades and are evolving in part due to insurers extensive use of Big Data;that is, the increasing capacity and computational abilities of computers, availability of new and innovative sources of data, and advanced algorithms that can detect patterns in insurance activities that were previously unknown. On the one hand, the fundamental issues of insurance discrimination have not changed with Big Data;one can think of credit-based insurance scoring and price optimization as simply forerunners of this movement. On the other hand, issues regarding privacy and use of algorithmic proxies take on increased importance as insurers extensive use of data and computational abilities evolve. ? 2021 The Author(s).

Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from 2019C2020 within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation. Eligible patients included those with chronic low back pain and a SPADE (sleep disturbance, pain interference with activities, anxiety, depression, and low energy/fatigue) cluster score  55 based on the relevant scales from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System instrument with 29 items (PROMIS-29). Patients were randomized to the eHealth treatment group, which received a tailored HRQOL report and interpretation guide, or to a wait-list control group. The primary outcome was change in the SPADE cluster score, including its five component scales, over 3 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in low back pain intensity and back-related disability. Treatment effects were measured using the standardized mean difference (SMD) in change scores between groups. The eHealth intervention was also assessed by a survey of the experimental treatment group 1 month following randomization. Results: A total of 102 patients were randomized, including 52 in the eHealth treatment group and 50 in the wait-list control group, and 100 (98%) completed the trial. A majority of patients agreed that the HRQOL report was easy to understand (86%), provided new information (79%), and took actions to read or learn more about self-management approaches to improve their HRQOL (77%). Although the eHealth intervention met the criteria for a small treatment effect in improving the overall SPADE cluster score (SMD = 0.24; p= 0.23) and anxiety (SMD = 0.24; p = 0.23), and for a small-to-medium treatment effect in improving depression (SMD = 0.37; p = 0.06) and back-related disability (SMD = 0.36; p = 0.07), none of these results achieved statistical significance because of limited sample size.

During COVID-19, a lower plasmatic L-arginine level was observed compared to healthy donors, which correlated with MDSC frequency. Additionally, activated GPIIb/IIIa complex (PAC-1) expression was higher on platelets from severe COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls and inversely correlated with L-arginine plasmatic concentration. Notably, MDSC were able to induce PAC-1 expression in vitro by reducing L-arginine concentration, indicating a direct role of PMN-MDSC in platelet activation. Accordingly, we found a positive correlation between ex vivo platelet PAC-1 expression and PMN-MDSC frequency.

Table 1. COVID-19 Attribution Definitions Table 2. Description of 3,140 COVID 19 Infections in Employees from 3/2020 to 4/2021 Methods We prospectively tracked and traced COVID-19 infections among employees across our health system and university. Each employee with a confirmed positive test and 3 presumed positive cases were interviewed with a standard contact tracing template that included descriptive variables such as high-risk behaviors and contacts, dates worked while infectious, and initial symptoms. Using this information, the most likely location of infection acquisition was adjudicated (Table 1). We compared behavior frequency between community and unknown, likely community and community and unknown cases using descriptive statistics. Table 3. Risk Factors for Community, Likely Community, and Unknown Cases Number of SARS-CoV-2 cases among employees between 3/2020 and 4/2021 by month and stratified according to clinical employee working in the healthcare system, non-clinical employee employed by the healthcare system, and university employee Results From 3/2020 to 4/2021 we identified 3,140 COVID-19 infections in 3,119 employees out of a total of 34,562 employees (9.0%) (Figure 1). Of those 3,119 employees 1,685 (54.0%) were clinical employees working in the health system, 916 (29.4%) were non-clinical employees working in the health system, and 518 (16.6%) were university employees. Descriptive characteristics for the COVID-19 infections and adjudications are outlined in Table 2. Severe disease among employees was significantly less frequent compared to patients in the health system (15.3% vs 2.2%, p< 0.01). The frequency of travel within 14 days, masked gatherings and unmasked gatherings/activities was not significantly different between the community and unknown, likely community groups or the community and unknown groups (Table 3). Conclusion The majority of COVID-19 infections were linked to acquisition in the community, and few were attributed to workplace exposures. Employees with unknown sources of COVID-19 participated in higher-risk activities at approximately the same frequency as employees with community sources of COVID-19. The most frequently reported initial symptoms were mild and non-specific and rarely included fever. Despite a comprehensive testing and benefit program, a large proportion of COVID-positive employees worked with symptoms, highlighting ongoing challenges with presenteeism in healthcare.

The viral spike protein (SARS-S) mediates host cell entry and is a potential target for antiviral intervention. Activation of SARS-S by host cell proteases is essential for SARS-CoV infectivity but remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed the role of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), in SARS-S activation. We found that HAT activates SARS-S in the context of surrogate systems and authentic SARS-CoV infection and is coexpressed with the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in bronchial epithelial cells and pneumocytes. HAT cleaved SARS-S at R667, as determined by mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, and activated SARS-S for cell-cell fusion in cis and trans, while the related pulmonary protease TMPRSS2 cleaved SARS-S at multiple sites and activated SARS-S only in trans. However, TMPRSS2 but not HAT expression rendered SARS-S-driven virus-cell fusion independent of cathepsin activity, indicating that HAT and TMPRSS2 activate SARS-S differentially. Collectively, our results show that HAT cleaves and activates SARS-S and might support viral spread in patients.","output":"Cleavage and activation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein by human airway trypsin-like protease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To calculate how the likelihood of obtaining measurable benefit from hip or knee arthroplasty varies with preoperative patient-reported scores. METHODS: Existing UK data from 222,933 knee and 209,760 hip arthroplasty patients were used to model an individual's probability of gaining meaningful improvement after surgery based on their preoperative Oxford Knee or Hip Score (OKS/OHS). A clinically meaningful improvement after arthroplasty was defined as &#8805; 8 point improvement in OHS, and &#8805; 7 in OKS. RESULTS: The upper preoperative score threshold, above which patients are unlikely to achieve any meaningful improvement from surgery, is 41 for knees and 40 for hips. At lower scores, the probability of improvement increased towards a maximum of 88% (knee) and 95% for (hips). CONCLUSION: By our definition of meaningful improvement, patients with preoperative scores above 41 (OKS) and 40 (OHS) should not be routinely referred to secondary care for possible arthroplasty. Using lower thresholds would incrementally increase the probability of meaningful benefit for those referred but will exclude some patients with potential to benefit. The findings are useful to support the complex shared decision-making process in primary care for referral to secondary care; and in secondary care for experienced clinicians counselling patients considering knee or hip arthroplasty, but should not be used in isolation.

Numerical simulations indicate that during a disease outbreak individuals with the same infection status show the property of clustering and, in particular, individuals rapid movements lead to an increase in the average reproduction number [Formula: see text] , the final size and the peak value of the outbreak. It is interesting that a high level of aggregation the individuals movement results in low new infections and a small final size of the infected population. Further, we obtained that either high diffusion rate of the pathogen or frequent environmental clearance lead to a decline in the total number of infected individuals, indicating the need for control measures such as improving air circulation or environmental hygiene. We found that the level of spatial heterogeneity when implementing control greatly affects the control efficacy, and in particular, an uniform isolation strategy leads to low a final size and small peak, compared with local measures, indicating that a large-scale isolation strategy with frequent clearance of the environment is beneficial for disease control.","output":"Coupling the Macroscale to the Microscale in a Spatiotemporal Context to Examine Effects of Spatial Diffusion on Disease Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper outlines the role of Lombardy's regional influenza reference laboratory (Northern Italy) in the surveillance of influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 circulation by analyzing 631 consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) collected from ILI outpatients by sentinel physicians during the 2019-2020 season.

It is assumed that biologically active substances, the activation of which is caused by a virus, play a certain role in the development of SNMP, namely the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cytokines, activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), etc. An increase in cytokines that are released into the urine and / or expressed in the bladder and the presence of SNMP in patients with coronavirus infection have been called de novo urinary symptoms or COVID-19 associated cystitis (CAC) in the literature. Urinary symptoms de novo or associated cystitis COVID-19 (CAC) develops against the background of a complete lack of data for the presence of a bacterial pathogen in the urine.

Compared to the age-matched NCs, both young and old male and female non-comorbid COVID-19 patients had lower lymphocyte counts and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration, and only young male and female patients had lower neutrophil counts. Compared to young patients, both old males and females had significantly higher plasma ALT and AST concentrations. Compared to young and old females, age-matched males had higher plasma ALT and AST concentrations, but only young males had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration. Compared to females, old males, but not young males, showed higher incidence of critical illness. Compared to young patients, old females had more leukocyte and neutrophil counts above the normal upper limit and B cell count below the normal lower limit (NLL), while old males had more lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell counts below the NLL. No sex or age associations with B cell and NK cell counts were observed. However, there were age-dependent decreases in CD8+ T-cell counts in both male and female COVID-19 patients.

Utilizing CO(2) per capita emissions; GDP per capita, a proxy for economic growth; capital stock (CAPSTK), proxy for capital investment in Nigeria and control of corruption and regulatory quality (COC and RGQ) which represent the effective environmental regulations and laws put in place for the control and prevention of environmental degradation, the study found a significant cointegration between CO(2) emissions and economic growth (lnGDP) in Nigeria. Furthermore, an N-shaped nexus exists between CO(2) emissions and economic growth in the long-run and short-run instead of the inverted U-shape curve postulated by the EKC hypothesis. This was confirmed by both ARDL and quartile regression results. Similarly, InCAPSTK contributed significantly to the growth of CO(2) emissions in Nigeria both in the long run and short run; although, the short run did so at 10% significant level. Contrary to expectations, control of corruption (COC) contributes significantly to CO(2) emissions in the long run, but when it interacts with income (InGDP [Formula: see text] COC), it significantly contributes to the reduction of CO(2) emissions. More so, regulatory quality (RGQ) had no significant impact on CO(2) emissions in Nigeria either in the long run or short run, even when it interacts with InGDP. This finding is further supported by the quartile regression outcomes and Granger causality. The study therefore concludes that CO(2) emissionsCeconomic growth nexus in Nigeria assumes an N-shape both in the long run and short run.

Several types of diagnostic tests including RT-PCR-based assays and antigen detection by lateral flow assays, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, have been developed and deployed in a short time. METHODS: Here, we describe an immunoaffinity purification approach followed a by high resolution mass spectrometry-based targeted qualitative assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen from nasopharyngeal swab samples. Based on our discovery experiments using purified virus, recombinant viral protein and nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 positive patients, nucleocapsid protein was selected as a target antigen. We then developed an automated antibody capture-based workflow coupled to targeted high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) - parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. An ensemble machine learning-based model for determining COVID-19 positive samples was developed using fragment ion intensities from the PRM data. FINDINGS: The optimized targeted assay, which was used to analyze 88 positive and 88 negative nasopharyngeal swab samples for validation, resulted in 98% (95% CI = 0.922C0.997) (86/88) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI = 0.958C1.000) (88/88) specificity using RT-PCR-based molecular testing as the reference method.

Acceptance of vaccination was motivated by confidence in the accuracy of the governments response to COVID-19 and the fact that relatives had been diagnosed with or died from COVID-19. Reluctance was based on fear of vaccine quality and side effects, and insufficient clinical trials. Finally, refusal to be vaccinated was justified by reasons such as the unreliability of clinical trials and insufficient data regarding the vaccines adverse effects.

BACKGROUND Fatigue is a long-lasting distressing symptom. It is a multidimensional symptom consisting of several factors, including physiological, psychological, social and environmental. It is vital to examine and understand the perception of fatigue among post-COVID-19 participants. DESIGN A descriptive phenomenological design. METHODS The study sample consisted of 14 post-COVID-19 participants that were recruited using criterion sampling. The fatigue levels of the participants were determined using the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), and those with a fatigue score above 12 were interviewed. All the interviews were conducted with a smartphone due to the COVID-19. The COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research (COREQ) checklist was used. RESULTS The age of the participants varied from 24 to 67 years, with the majority of the participants being female (n = 8). The COVID-19 duration ranged from one to 11 months, and the CFS scores varied between 14 and 33. Four themes emerged following the qualitative data analysis: a new symptom beyond fatigue, fatigue increases dependency in daily life, fatigue impedes sociability and a way to hold on to life's regular rhythms. CONCLUSIONS This study concluded that fatigue in post-COVID-19 participants is a new experience that is difficult to define and manage and overwhelmingly affects the physical and social aspects of life. Participants look for new ways to live with fatigue and turn to traditional methods and psychosocial strategies. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This study revealed the miscellaneous aspects of fatigue in post-COVID-19 participants. Nurses should evaluate fatigue with a holistic approach that includes its physical, social, emotional and spiritual aspects. Nurses can play an active role in the management of fatigue, which is a very common symptom in the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"'The body seems to have no life': The experiences and perceptions of fatigue among patients after COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD) has become one of the most pervasive causes of hepatic pathology. Because of its marked association with metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease, NAFLD has gained substantial focus recently. Its prevalence and incidence are on the rise in Pakistan. However, due to its indolent and mostly asymptomatic course, NAFLD is often overlooked. This reckless behavior towards a potentially deadly disease is influenced most notably by disinformation or flawed perception, although there are a number of other complex socioeconomic components to this as well. With respect to NAFLD, the gap between disease understanding and steps for management is growing in the Pakistani society. With this study, we hoped and aimed to evaluate just how far and wide these shortcomings were found and how was NAFLD perceived in the local populace via a self-administered survey. Methods This was a cross-sectional observational cohort study undertaken at the Department of Gastroenterology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, and Medical Unit II, Dow University of Health Sciences, Ojha Campus, Karachi, Pakistan. All patients 18 years with a diagnosis of NAFLD were included in the study. NAFLD was diagnosed on the basis of sonographic evidence. All ultrasounds were done by a senior expert radiologist with at least 10 years of postgraduate experience. Ultrasounds were performed twice in all patients to rule out human error and bias. Perceptions regarding the knowledge of NAFLD were assessed using a self-administered survey questionnaire. Results The female-to-male ratio in our cohort was 3:1. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) recorded were 39.85  9.79 years and 31.21  3.6 kg/m(2), respectively. Sixty participants (26.4%) knew about their disease (NAFLD) while only 36 (15.9%) knew what NAFLD was and only 33 (14.5%) participants knew about the cardiovascular risk associated with it. Nearly two-thirds of the patients considered themselves overweight, while 180 (79.3%) of them were willing to lose weight. However, just about half of the cohort admitted the need for improved eating habits and increased physical activity/exercise in their daily lives. Fifty-seven (25.1%) patients admitted to using alternative or quack medications and only 45 (19.8%) patients considered them harmful. Conclusions Patients harboring NAFLD have little to no knowledge about the disease and its nature or the fact that they are suffering from it despite being diagnosed clinically. Furthermore, while the general populace is willing to accept being overweight and having unhealthy eating habits, their willingness in initiating real-life practical steps to manage NAFLD is lacking.","output":"Perception of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Real-Life Experience From Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Boolean networks (BNs) provide an effective modelling tool for various phenomena from science and engineering.

Post-SARS, Canadian occupational health and infection control researchers got together to study how to better protect health workers, and found that training was indeed perceived as key to a positive safety culture. This led to developing information and communication technology (ICT) tools. The research conducted also showed the need for better workplace inspections, so a workplace audit tool was also developed to supplement worker questionnaires and the ICT. When invited to join Ecuadorean colleagues to promote occupational health and infection control, these tools were collectively adapted and improved, including face-to-face as well as on-line problem-based learning scenarios. The South African government then invited the team to work with local colleagues to improve occupational health and infection control, resulting in an improved web-based health information system to track incidents, exposures, and occupational injury and diseases. As the H1N1 pandemic struck, the online infection control course was adapted and translated into Spanish, as was a novel skill-building learning tool that permits health workers to practice selecting personal protective equipment. This tool was originally developed in collaboration with the countries from the Caribbean region and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Research from these experiences led to strengthened focus on building capacity of health and safety committees, and new modules are thus being created, informed by that work. The products developed have been widely heralded as innovative and interactive, leading to their inclusion into toolkits used internationally. The tools used in Canada were substantially improved from the collaborative adaptation process for South and Central America and South Africa.

Current periodontal treatment is limited by its dependency on patients learning and maintaining good dental habits, and repeated visits to oral health physicians. Vitamin Cs role in collagen synthesis and immune function makes it important in wound healing and possibly periodontal healing. Therefore, if some patients are deficient, this may worsen patient outcomes. Methods: Patients were invited to participate following assessment and treatment at the Westmead Centre of Oral Health Periodontic Clinic, regardless of current disease stage or treatment. Adults were eligible if they gave informed consent and had current periodontal disease. Study involvement consisted of periodontal assessment and care followed by an interview and measurement of serum vitamin C and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: A total of 6 out of 20 patients had vitamin C levels less than the institutional normal range, of whom 2 had levels <11.4 mol/L and one <28 mol/L. Low vitamin C was associated with higher periodontal disease stage (p = 0.03). Elevated CRP was found in 2/3 of people with low vitamin C and CRP was negatively correlated with vitamin C (p < 0.01). Vitamin C did not correlate with patient-reported fruit or vegetable consumption, but high processed meat intake was associated with lower vitamin C. Conclusion: Although a small study, this rate of vitamin C deficiency in the periodontal clinic is clinically important and correlations with disease severity and CRP suggests biological importance.

We sought to define the etiology, clinical presentation, time course and outcomes of children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with cutaneous manifestations shortly after the first pandemic peak of COVID-19 in Spain. METHODS Prospective, observational study in children <15 years of age evaluated for skin lesions in the ED of three pediatric hospitals. Children underwent a comprehensive work-up including SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and PCR, and serology and PCR tests for other viruses and bacteria. A one-month follow-up visit was conducted. RESULTS From April 14 through May 8, 2020 we enrolled 62 children. Of those 34 had acro-ischemic skin lesions and 28 a variety of skin rashes. Overall 40% of children had mild systemic symptoms. Children with chilblains were older, had pain more frequently and more prolonged duration of skin lesions, while those with non-specific rashes had fever more frequently. Lesions were resolved in 75% of children at follow-up. Five patients demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and none tested positive by PCR. Three additional patients tested positive by PCR for rhinovirus, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS The number of ED visits for chilblains, which are rare in pediatrics, was high soon after the first peak of COVID-19 in Spain.

The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors into clinical practice offered patients prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival times. However, the results demonstrate that the benefits do not apply to all patients. Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody against the PD-1 protein expressed mainly on T lymphocytes and is widely used in cancer therapy in different settings. Tumor cells often express the PD-L1 molecule and can effectively block the action of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. A body of knowledge regarding the high expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells highlights that it does not always correlate with the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 therapy. The side effects of the therapy also constitute a significant issue. These side effects can occur at any time during anti-PD-1 treatment and lead to discontinuation and even the death of the patient. In these situations, it is possible to delay the dosage. Nevertheless, unfortunately, it is not possible to reduce the dose of anti-PD-1 antibody, which would undoubtedly minimize side effects, leaving the patient's immune system active. In our preliminary study, we analyzed the effect of different concentrations of nivolumab on the functioning of T lymphocytes.

Results: Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected. Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance. All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened. Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care. During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld. All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged. Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities. All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19.

We present interim safety and immunogenicity results of the first-in-human study of the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine with two different adjuvant formulations. METHODS: This phase 1-2, randomised, double-blind study is being done in healthy, SARS-CoV-2-seronegative adults in ten clinical research centres in the USA. Participants were stratified by age (18-49 years and &#8805;50 years) and randomly assigned using an interactive response technology system with block randomisation (blocks of varying size) to receive one dose (on day 1) or two doses (on days 1 and 22) of placebo or candidate vaccine, containing low-dose (effective dose 13 g) or high-dose (26 g) antigen with adjuvant AF03 (Sanofi Pasteur) or AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline) or unadjuvanted high-dose antigen (18-49 years only). Primary endpoints were safety, assessed up to day 43, and immunogenicity, measured as SARS-C0V-2 neutralising antibodies (geometric mean titres), assessed on days 1, 22, and 36 serum samples. Safety was assessed according to treatment received in the safety analysis set, which included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose. Neutralising antibody titres were assessed in the per-protocol analysis set for immunogenicity, which included participants who received at least one dose, met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, had no protocol deviation, had negative results in the neutralisation test at baseline, and had at least one valid post-dose serology sample. This planned interim analysis reports data up to 43 days after the first vaccination; participants in the trial will be followed up for 12 months after the last study injection. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04537208, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Sept 3 and Sept 29, 2020, 441 individuals (299 aged 18-49 years and 142 aged &#8805;50 years) were randomly assigned to one of the 11 treatment groups. The interim safety analyses included 439 (>99%) of 441 randomly assigned participants (299 aged 18-49 years and 140 aged &#8805;50 years). Neutralising antibody titres were analysed in 326 (74%) of 441 participants (235 [79%] of 299 aged 18-49 years and 91 [64%] of 142 aged &#8805;50 years). There were no vaccine-related unsolicited immediate adverse events, serious adverse events, medically attended adverse events classified as severe, or adverse events of special interest. Among all study participants, solicited local and systemic reactions of any grade after two vaccine doses were reported in 81% (95% CI 61-93; 21 of 26) of participants in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 93% (84-97; 74 of 80) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 89% (70-98; 23 of 26) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 95% (88-99; 81 of 85) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, 29% (10-56; five of 17) in the unadjuvanted high-dose group, and 21% (8-40; six of 29) in the placebo group. A single vaccine dose did not generate neutralising antibody titres above placebo levels in any group at days 22 or 36. Among participants aged 18-49 years, neutralising antibody titres after two vaccine doses were 131 (95% CI 640-269) in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 205 (131-321) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 432 (206-904) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 751 (505-1120) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, 500 (not calculated) in the unadjuvanted high-dose group, and 500 (not calculated) in the placebo group. Among participants aged 50 years or older, neutralising antibody titres after two vaccine doses were 862 (190-390) in the low-dose plus AF03 group, 129 (709-234) in the low-dose plus AS03 group, 123 (435-350) in the high-dose plus AF03 group, 523 (253-1080) in the high-dose plus AS03 group, and 500 (not calculated) in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: The lower than expected immune responses, especially in the older age groups, and the high reactogenicity after dose two were probably due to higher than anticipated host-cell protein content and lower than planned antigen doses in the formulations tested, which was discovered during characterisation studies on the final bulk drug substance. Further development of the AS03-adjuvanted candidate vaccine will focus on identifying the optimal antigen formulation and dose.

Methamphetamine is a major drug that is used among hill tribes living in the border areas of Thailand and Myanmar. This study aimed to understand the drivers, facilitators, sources and outcomes of the stigma surrounding drug use, including the expectations among Akha and Lau hill tribe people who use methamphetamine in Thailand. METHODS: Qualitative data were used to elicit information from key informants and members of the hill tribes who used methamphetamine. The questionnaire was developed from a literature review and tested for validity before use. In-depth interviews were used to confidentially gather information from the participants in private rooms in villages. Each interview lasted 45 min, and a thematic analysis was conducted to examine the findings. RESULTS: A total of 46 participants were recruited to provide information; 95.7% were male, and 50.0% were aged 15C34 years. The majority were married (47.8%), 76.1% were Christian, and 45.7% graduated high school. Six drivers of stigma were detected: being poor, illiterate, unemployed, working aged, female, and married. Culture and tribe acted as facilitators of the stigma attached to methamphetamine use. Four sources of stigma were found: self, family members, peers, and community members. Three outcomes of stigma were determined: poor physical health, mental health, and relationships with others. There were four levels of expectations: no expectations, expectations for themselves, expectations for their family members, and expectations for their community members. CONCLUSIONS: Many personal traits, people living nearby, and socioeconomic factors, including culture and tribes, act as drivers, facilitators, and sources of stigma among hill tribe people who use methamphetamine.

We evaluated the vaginal distribution and retention of starch-based pellets in sheep as live animal model by gamma scintigraphy (using Indium-111 DTPA as radiolabel) and in women via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, using a gadolinium chelate as contrast agent). A conventional cream formulation was used as reference in both studies. METHOD Cream and pellets were administered to sheep (n=6) in a two period-two treatment study and to healthy female volunteers (n=6) via a randomized crossover trial. Pellets (filled into hard gelatin capsule) and cetomacrogol cream, both labeled with Indium-111 DTPA (for gamma scintigraphy) or with gadolinium chelate (for MRI) were evaluated for their intravaginal distribution and retention over a 24h period. Spreading in the vagina was assessed based on the part of the vagina covered with formulation (expressed in relation to the total vaginal length). Vaginal retention of the formulation was quantified based on the radioactivity remaining in the vaginal area (sheep study), or qualitatively evaluated (women study). RESULTS Both trials indicated a rapid distribution of the cream within the vagina as complete coverage of the vaginal mucosa was seen 1h after dose administration. Clearance of the cream was rapid: about 10% activity remained in the vaginal area of the sheep 12h post-administration, while after 8h only a thin layer of cream was detected on the vaginal mucosa of women. After disintegration of the hard gelatin capsule, the pellet formulation gradually distributed over the entire vaginal mucosa. Residence time of the pellets in the vagina was longer compared to the semi-solid formulation: after 24h 23  7% radioactivity was detected in the vaginal area of the sheep, while in women the pellet formulation was still detected throughout the vagina.

Propofol at clinically used concentrations modestly inhibits the intact (wild-type) IKs channels and is therefore unlikely to appreciably prolong QT interval in electrocardiogram during anesthesia. However, little information is available concerning the inhibitory effect of propofol on IKs channel associated with its gene variants implicated in QT prolongation. The KCNE1 single nucleotide polymorphism leading to D85N is associated with drug-induced QT prolongation and therefore regarded as a clinically important genetic variant. This study examined whether KCNE1-D85N affects the sensitivity of IKs to inhibition by propofol. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Whole-cell patch-clamp and immunostaining experiments were conducted in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and/or mouse cardiomyocyte-derived HL-1 cells, transfected with wild-type KCNQ1, wild-type or variant KCNE1 cDNAs. KEY RESULTS Propofol inhibited KCNQ1/KCNE1-D85N current more potently than KCNQ1/KCNE1 current in HEK293 cells and HL-1 cells. Immunostaining experiments in HEK293 cells revealed that pretreatment with propofol (10 M) did not appreciably affect cell membrane expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 proteins in KCNQ1/KCNE1 and KCNQ1/KCNE1-D85N channels. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS The KCNE1 polymorphism D85N significantly elevates the sensitivity of IKs to inhibition by propofol. This study detects a functionally important role of KCNE1-D85N polymorphism in conferring genetic susceptibility to propofol-induced QT prolongation and further suggests the possibility that the inhibitory action of anesthetics on ionic currents becomes exaggerated in patients carrying variants in genes encoding ion channels.","output":"Elevation of propofol sensitivity of cardiac IKs channel by KCNE1 polymorphism D85N."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study evaluated the role of having plants at home during the confinement period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that deprived people of freely visiting open green spaces Preferences concerning the quantity of the desired vegetation as well as the ways in which the COVID-19 crisis affected the change of perceptions with regard to having plants at home were also evaluated A questionnaire, which was filled by 4205 participants, provided an undistracted evaluation of the impact of indoor and outdoor plants on their emotional welfare considering behavioural, social, and demographic variables The emotional state of the respondents was neutral and a significant proportion expressed positive emotions Having indoor plants was correlated with more positive emotions, and confined inhabitants allocated more time for plant maintenance By contrast, negative emotions prevailed in respondents who related to a positive COVID-19 case, which was more frequent in females and young participants living in small houses that received low levels of natural light and had few or no plants A few indoor plants placed in strategic positions were also preferred compared with a high number of plants By contrast, an increased amount of vegetation accompanied by living walls was preferred for outdoor settings Living walls were considered as advantageous for increasing indoor vegetation, but they were also associated with technical and economical hurdles ? 2020 Elsevier GmbH","output":"Particularities of having plants at home during the confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented impacts (e.g., labor shortage, suspension and cancellation of projects, and disrupted supply and logistics) on the US construction industry.

However, assessing the impacts of COVID-19 on the construction industry is challenging due to the broad influence of the pandemic and the dynamic nature of the industry. The Purdue Index for Construction (Pi-C), which was developed as an indicator based on five dimensions and corresponding metrics to measure the health status of the construction industry, offers an opportunity to understand the impact of the pandemic. In this context, this paper presents a study to reveal the relationship between COVID-19 and the health status of the industry as measured through Pi-C and predict the future trend of the construction industry. This study achieves the objective via the three steps. First, the relationship between the pandemic and Pi-C metrics is identified using the Granger causality test and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. Second, multivariable prediction models are developed based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - a deep learning algorithm - to predict Pi-C metrics in the future. Third, forecasted Pi-C metrics are integrated into the existing Pi-C structure to analyze the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and predict its trends in 2021-2022. The results revealed that the impacts of the pandemic were conspicuous in two Pi-C dimensions (economy and stability), whereas no significant impacts were observed in the remaining Pi-C dimension (social).

METHODS: We used a model to manage the PWEs during the outbreak. Questionnaire survey and hospital data were used to explore whether PWEs under our management were affected by the virus. RESULTS: A total of 118 (78.7%) PWEs completed the survey. During the model period, 22.9% (27/118) of the respondents reported antiepileptic drug (AEDs) discontinuity, including six (22.2%) PWEs who failed to purchase AEDs. Of the patients, 40.7% (22/54) failed to attend ordinary clinic, which was higher than that during the period before model (7.9%, 5/63). The common causes were movement limits (77.3%) and appointment failure (54.5%). A shift from ordinary clinic toward remote consultation was observed. Of the PWEs, 15.7% (13/83) referred to online pharmacy. 87.5% (14/16) of emergencies related to epilepsy were timely treated. 48.3%of PWEs thought that the epidemic had an impact on accessing medical services. Hospital data indicated that a decline in ordinary clinic visit, inpatient, surgery, and emergency attendance was observed in January and February 2020 and an increase in March 2020, as the epidemic mitigated.

Engineering of these molecules would be enhanced by a better understanding of AMP sequence-activity relationships to improve efficacy in vivo and limit effects of off-target activity. Towards this goal, we experimentally evaluated 210 natural and variant class IIa bacteriocins for antimicrobial activity against six strains of enterococci. Inhibitory activity was ridge regressed to AMP sequence to predict performance, achieving an area under the curve of 0.70 and demonstrating the potential of statistical models for identifying and designing AMPs. Active AMPs were individually produced and evaluated against eight enterococci strains and four Listeria strains to elucidate trends in susceptibility. It was determined that the mannose phosphotransferase system sequence is informative of susceptibility to class IIa bacteriocins, yet other factors, such as membrane composition, also contribute strongly to susceptibility. A broadly potent bacteriocin variant (lactocin DT1) from a Lactobacillus ruminis genome was identified as the only variant with inhibitory activity towards all tested strains, while a novel enterocin variant (DT2) from an E. faecium genome demonstrated specificity towards Listeria strains. Eight AMPs were evaluated for proteolytic stability to trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin, and three C-terminal disulfide-containing variants, including divercin V41, were identified as compelling for future in vivo studies given high potency and proteolytic stability.Importance Class IIa bacteriocin antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), an alternative to traditional small-molecule antibiotics, are capable of selective activity towards various Gram-positive bacteria, limiting negative side effects associated with broad-spectrum activity. This selective activity is achieved through targeting of the mannose phosphotransferase system (manPTS) of a subset of Gram-positive bacteria, although factors affecting this mechanism are not entirely understood. Peptides identified from genomic data, as well as variants of previously characterized AMPs, can offer insight into how peptide sequence affects activity and selectivity. The experimental methods presented here identify promising potent and selective bacteriocins for further evaluation, highlight the potential of simple computational modeling for prediction of AMP performance, and demonstrate that factors beyond manPTS sequence affect bacterial susceptibility to class IIa bacteriocins.","output":"Mining and statistical modeling of natural and variant class IIa bacteriocins elucidates activity and selectivity profiles across species."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have been introduced to \\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\\" disease with high mortality and transmission rate caused by a novel human coronavirus, in December 2019 and the microbiological diagnosis of the infection has been in the center of the focus to control the pandemic. It is necessary to understand the dynamics of the virus which was classified among the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronaviruses and named as SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to manage testing in the right strategy and for interpretation of the results. However, much remains unclear about the virus and the immune response. SARS-CoV-2, which is an enveloped, RNA virus has been shown to attach to the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 with spike (S) protein and membrane fusion is provided by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of the host cell. The most commonly used and reliable test for diagnosis of COVID-19 is reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed by using nasopharyngeal swabs or other respiratory tract specimens. Viral RNA is usually detected two three days before the onset of symptoms and in the first week from upper respiratory tract samples. If possible, the lower respiratory tract specimens are preferable in the second week, especially if former PCR is negative and pneumonia has developed. The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests has been reported around 55-75%. Negative RT-PCR test result does not exclude COVID-19 or SARSCoV-2 infection. It should also be noted that viral RNA positivity is not an evidence of active or infectious virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be also detected indirectly by testing the host specific immune response to the virus. There is an increasing interest in the use of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests both for the diagnosis and public health surveillance. However, the antibody tests should not be used as the sole test for diagnosis and case management. Antibody tests are valuable tools in seroepidemiological studies. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies have been shown to be detectable as early as 5th-14th days after the onset of symptoms and most of them become positive on the 21st day. False positivity has been reported more frequently with IgM and IgA tests due to low specificity. It was shown that clinical sensitivity of the diagnostic approach increases when RNA and total antibody tests were integrated as co-tests, especially after the second week of the disease. Specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values are needed to be evaluated with large and standard studies targeting populations with different prevalences. It is also necessary to create evidence with larger seroconversion studies. In this review article, the information and data obtained until today about SARS-CoV-2 and its microbiological diagnosis have been discussed.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemisinde SARS-CoV-2 ve Mikrobiyolojik Tani Dinamikler./ [SARS-CoV-2 and Microbiological Diagnostic Dynamics in COVID-19 Pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic presents healthcare organizations with substantial challenges.

Abstract Introduction: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to a radical reorganization of healthcare resources. Surgical Departments need to adapt to this change. Patients and methods: We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area, between the 1st and 31st of March 2020. Results: Patients: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgery patients was 7% (mean age 59.5 years). All survived. Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2+ cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents). Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation. Conclusions: The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia, should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.","output":"Impacto de la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2 sobre la actividad y profesionales de un Servicio de Ciruga General y del Aparato Digestivo en un hospital terciario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Data of COVID-19 in newborns and children are limited, and clinical manifestations are nonspecific and might delay the diagnosis, which might lead to severe complications. In this clinical case, we will describe new-onset diabetes with consciousness impairment as an atypical revealing way of COVID-19. CASE: A 3-year-old child presented to the Emergency Department with loss of consciousness (without fever), lethargy, and stupor. Clinical assessment on admission found an unconscious child with a pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale of 10/15 with no localizing signs or meningeal syndrome, polypneic of 35 breaths/min, pulse oximetry of 90%, with signs of overall dehydration: skin folds, sunken eyes, tachycardia of 160 beats/minute, and recoloring time superior at 3 seconds. Laboratory findings showed hyperleukocytosis of 16000/mm(3), lymphopenia of 450/mm(3), glycemia of 5 g/L with a correct ionogram : corrected natremia of 139 mmol/L, serum potassium of 4.5 mmol/L, glycosuria of 3+, ketonuria of 2+, and HbA1c of 10%, and COVID-19 RT-PCR came back positive.

Among COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been recognized as a risk factor for severe disease. Patients with T2DM may experience diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic (HHS) if infected with the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Regular blood analysis including arterial blood gas is essential in monitoring the care of patients with T2DM infected with COVID-19. We report five cases of DKA in patients with underlying T2DM that presented with severe COVID-19 infection. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 may cause acute metabolic dysregulations in patients with T2DM. It is important to monitor basic metabolic panel (BMP) and arterial blood gases (ABGs) in patients with COVID-19 since metabolic complications can develop unexpectedly.

A homology model was built for TMPRSS2 and the standard inhibitors nafamostat and camostat were docked on the model. Ligand-based screening, flexible ligand docking and induced-fit docking followed by free binding energy calculations were carried out as part of the screening technique to generate hits. Eventually, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was done for all the hits, and the results were compared with that of the standard inhibitors to validate our claims. From our computational study, we determined that streptomycin, doxorubicin and tetrahydrofolic acid are potential inhibitors of TMPRSS2. By analysing the MD simulation results, we also propose that streptomycin had the highest potential to inhibit TMPRSS2 among the three molecules. The three molecules we identified are most likely to show the efficacy when tested in vitro by prevention of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. These molecules can be taken further for clinical trials, and we expect fast processing since they are already approved by FDA and EMA for other diseases.

Dentists are uniquely positioned to discuss vaccination programs with their patients. The goal of this project was to assess the readiness of dentists in the state of Indiana in being able to administer vaccines. METHODS: An 18-question online survey was sent to licensed dentists in the state of Indiana. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests, followed by multivariable analyses using ordinal logistic regression were conducted to assess providers comfort levels and willingness to administer vaccines in both children and adults, by provider characteristics (practice type, location, and years in practice). RESULTS: A total of 569 completed surveys were included for data analyses. Most dentists (58%) responded positively when asked if they would consider offering vaccinations in their office, if allowed by state legislation. In general, dentists working in academic settings and federally qualified health centers were more agreeable to offering vaccination in their practice. The level of agreement with Dentists should be allowed to administer HPV, Influenza, Hep A and COVID 19 vaccines for both children and adults decreased with increased years of practice. More than half of the respondents (55%) agreed that dental providers were competent to administer vaccines and needed no further training.

We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who developed severe ITP associated with fatal hemorrhage. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old-female with history of treated breast and renal cancers presented to the emergency department with cough and fever for 10 days. Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was administered supplemental oxygen and empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. Her respiratory status rapidly declined necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation and admission to the ICU on Day 1 for severe ARDS. IV Remdesivir, Dexamethasone 6 mg IV daily, convalescent plasma and IV unfractionated heparin infusion were administered. Platelets were 219 x 109/L, fibrinogen 980 and D-dimer level 11.2. On Day 18 platelets fell to < 2 x 109/L, without evidence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. Coagulation and liver function tests, and autoimmune disease markers were normal. Heparin was discontinued. Anti-platelet factor 4 heparin antibodies and platelet autoantibodies were not detected. ITP secondary to COVID-19 was considered and methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV and IV immune globulin (IVIG) daily for 5 days and platelet transfusions to keep platelets >5 x 109/L were administered with improvement in platelets to >150 x 109/L on Day 23. On Day 25, platelets decreased to < 2 x 109/L, with melena and leg petechiae requiring red cell and platelet transfusions. She was re-treated with IVIG for 5 days, dexamethasone 40 mg IV daily and Romiplostim 2mcg/kg subcutaneous weekly with rise in platelets to >150 x 109/L on Day 31. She remained ventilator dependent and underwent tracheostomy on Day 32. Platelet counts remained >200 x 109/L and Romiplostim was discontinued on Day 73. On Day 85, platelets again fell to < 5 x 109/L, associated with massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage and fatal hemorrhagic shock. DISCUSSION: We believe that severe ITP with multiple relapses associated with COVID-19 was the most likely cause of the significant drop in platelet count that caused significant bleeding and death in our patient. We also observed a delayed onset in the clinical presentation of ITP and symptomatic COVID, unlike previous reports. The initial episode of severe thrombocytopenia was responsive to glucocorticoids and IVIG and later required higher doses of steroids and Romiplostim but recurred upon discontinuation of therapy. Fatal hemorrhage due to COVID-19-associated ITP is rare. A review of 45 cases of ITP in COVID-19 patients reported the majority of cases (75%) occurring in moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Severe life-threatening bleeding was uncommon with one death attributed to intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be aware of ITP as a severe complication of COVID-19 that should be diagnosed and treated promptly to avoid fatal bleeding complications, as was observed in our patient.

Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been evident that adequate testing is an essential step in limiting and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present an accurate, inexpensive, scalable, portable, and rapid detection kit to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in biological samples that could even be translated for population testing. We have demonstrated that our method can reliably identify viral load and could be used to reach those fractions of the population with limited access to more sophisticated and expensive tests. PROCEDURES: The proposed SARS-CoV-2 detection kit is based on the combination of a SARS-CoV-2-targeted antibody (CR3022) that targets spike protein S1 domain on the viral surface. This antibody was radiolabeled with a long-lived isotope (Iodine-125) to allow us to detect bound antibody in samples with SARS-CoV-2. We used a series of in vitro assays to determine sensitivity and specificity and facilitate automation of the testing kit. Bound antibody was extracted from saliva samples via a centrifugation step and a semi-permeable membrane. Our kit was further validated using SARS-CoV-2 virions. RESULTS: We were able to accomplish radiosynthesis of [(125)I]I-CR3022 reliably without loss of binding. The SARS-CoV-2-sensing antibody was shown to maintain its spike S1 affinity and to bind to as low as 2.5C5 ng of spike protein. We then used beads-bound spike S1 to develop a separation kit which proved to be both easy to use and inexpensive. The kit made it possible to extract bound antibody from the saliva-like sample. We were able to validate the separation kit using intact SARS-CoV-2 virions and showed that our kit can detect a viral concentration as low as 19,700 PFU/mL (~ 9.22%TBF) and as high as 1,970,000 PFU/mL (45.04%TBF). CONCLUSION: Here we report the development and validation of a SARS-CoV-2 detection system based on the combination of a specific radiolabeled antibody and a separation membrane. We demonstrate our system to be comparable to other SARS-CoV-2 detection kits already approved by the FDA and believe this technology could be easily deployed to countries with limited resources for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Furthermore, workflows could be easily adapted to target other antigens and therefore other types of diseases.","output":"Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a radiolabeled antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a concern in medical care for children who have high burden of infectious diseases. We investigated the prevalence of bacterial species and their susceptibility to antimicrobials of 1019 clinical isolates from pediatric patients in a tertiary-care hospital in Yangon, Myanmar for one-year period (2020). The most frequently recovered species was Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, all of which accounted for 43% of clinical isolates, while 25% of isolates comprised non-fermenter, including Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter sp. Phenotypically determined ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase)-positive rates in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter sp. were 82%, 88%, and 65%, respectively. High rates of multiple drug resistance were noted for E. coli (84%), K. pneumoniae (81%), and Acinetobacter sp. (65%), associated with carbapenem resistance in 48%, 42%, and 59% of isolates, respectively. In contrast, S. aureus isolates exhibited low resistance rates (<30%) to most of antimicrobials, with 22% being resistant to oxacillin/cefoxitin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was found in most of bacterial species with different prevalence rates.

It is considered the supreme crisis of the present era and one of the most crucial hazards threatening worldwide health. Therefore, the early detection of COVID-19 is essential. The common way to detect COVID-19 is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, although it has several drawbacks. Computed tomography (CT) scans can enable the early detection of suspected patients, however, the overlap between patterns of COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia makes it difficult for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 accurately. On the other hand, deep learning (DL) techniques and especially the convolutional neural network (CNN) can classify COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. In addition, DL techniques that use CT images can deliver an accurate diagnosis faster than the RT-PCR test, which consequently saves time for disease control and provides an efficient computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. The shortage of publicly available datasets of CT images, makes the CAD systems design a challenging task. The CAD systems in the literature are based on either individual CNN or two-fused CNNs; one used for segmentation and the other for classification and diagnosis. In this article, a novel CAD system is proposed for diagnosing COVID-19 based on the fusion of multiple CNNs. First, an end-to-end classification is performed. Afterward, the deep features are extracted from each network individually and classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Next, principal component analysis is applied to each deep feature set, extracted from each network. Such feature sets are then used to train an SVM classifier individually. Afterward, a selected number of principal components from each deep feature set are fused and compared with the fusion of the deep features extracted from each CNN. The results show that the proposed system is effective and capable of detecting COVID-19 and distinguishing it from non-COVID-19 cases with an accuracy of 94.7%, AUC of 0.98 (98%), sensitivity 95.6%, and specificity of 93.7%. Moreover, the results show that the system is efficient, as fusing a selected number of principal components has reduced the computational cost of the final model by almost 32%.","output":"MULTI-DEEP: A novel CAD system for coronavirus (COVID-19) diagnosis from CT images using multiple convolution neural networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The volatility analysis of stock returns data is paramount in financial studies. We investigate the dynamics of volatility and randomness of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX-100) and obtain insights into the behavior of investors during and before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19 pandemic). The paper aims to present the volatility estimations and quantification of the randomness of PSX-100. The methodology includes two approaches: (i) the implementation of EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, and TGARCH models to estimate the volatilities;and (ii) analysis of randomness in volatilities series, return series, and PSX-100 closing prices for pre-pandemic and pandemic period by using Shannons, Tsallis, approximate and sample entropies. Volatility modeling suggests the existence of the leverage effect in both the underlying periods of study. The results obtained using GARCH modeling reveal that the stock market volatility has increased during the pandemic period. However, information-theoretic results based on Shannon and Tsallis entropies do not suggest notable variation in the estimated volatilities series and closing prices. We have examined regularity and randomness based on the approximate entropy and sample entropy. We have noticed both entropies are extremely sensitive to choices of the parameters.","output":"Information-Theoretic Measures and Modeling Stock Market Volatility: A Comparative Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Research predominantly suggests that nurses are at high risk of developing psychopathology. The empirical data show that the occurrence rate of problem-related sleep quality among clinical nurses is high. Therefore, this study was conducted to address the lack of information on the relationship between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and insomnia. METHODS: A convenience sample of nurses (n = 680) completed an online survey that included the Insomnia severity index, the COVID-19-related psychological distress scale, the general health questionnaire, neuroticism, dysfunctional beliefs, attitudes about sleep scale, and difficulties in emotion regulation scale. RESULTS: The results showed that 35.8% (n = 253) of nurses were classified as individuals with moderate to severe clinical insomnia. The results showed that the psychological distress generated by COVID-19 predicted insomnia ( = .47, SE = 0.02, P < .001, t = 13.27, 95% CI 0.31C0.46). Additionally, the association is mediated by psychopathology vulnerabilities, emotion dysregulation, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and neuroticism. Moreover, female nurses exhibited higher levels of insomnia (Cohens d = .37), neuroticism (Cohens d = 30), psychopathology vulnerability (Cohens d = .26), and COVID-19-related psychological distress (Cohens d = .23). CONCLUSION: The present studys findings help to explain how pandemic consequences can be associated with insomnia. Additionally, the findings make a significant contribution to better understanding the role of neuroticism, emotion dysregulation, beliefs, and psychopathology vulnerability in the development of insomnia among nurses. The findings suggest the potential influence of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and transdiagnostic integrated therapies that could be incorporated into therapeutic programs designed to develop as a way of inhibiting or preventing insomnia among clinical nurses.

BACKGROUND: Vaccination against COVID\\\\19 is an important way to protect patients with chronic diseases, but the vaccination acceptance varies across diseases and populations. A better understanding of this condition will lead to tailored intervention strategies and high vaccination rates. DESIGN: Cross\\\\sectional study. METHODS: Data were collected between March 2021 and May 2021 in China. A self\\\\compiled questionnaire was used in the survey. Two independent\\\\samples t\\\\tests/one\\\\way analysis of variance or U test/H test was used to measure the differences between groups. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify the influencing factors. The study adhered to the EQUATOR checklist, STROBE. RESULTS: A total of 998 patients participated in the study. Score rates of attitudes, knowledge and vaccination willingness were 69.9%, 68.4% and 70.6% respectively. Age, vaccination status of family members, education levels, vaccine side effects and economic level were positive factors that could influence patients vaccination acceptances, while time of illness, type of disease and political affiliations were negative predictors. The top reasons for willingness toward vaccination were supporting national strategies, belief on the vaccines and fearing of contracting COVID\\\\19, while physical reasons, side effects and having a wait\\\\and\\\\see attitude were unwillingness factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients attitudes, knowledge and vaccination willingness were medium. Nurses should pay attention to patients who are from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, under 30 or over 70 years old, have no political affiliations, have damage to vital organs, have a long course of illness, family members have not received COVID\\\\19 vaccines and had no side effects after receiving other vaccines.

They determine their value within a health system so to promote equitable, quality care with available healthcare resources. Many HTA agencies have some mechanism for involving patients in their processes, but there is great variability and an absence of comprehensive, robust practices for involvement. The accelerating pace of medical innovation creates a need to improve the depth and breadth of patient involvement in the HTA process. MAIN BODY: In this Call to action, we present ideas from three HTA expert commentaries calling for collaborative learning and to share innovative ideas for changes in HTA. We also draw on examples of HTA agencies creatively pursuing this goal. We propose a Call to action for HTA stakeholders to undertake serious dialogue with patient advocates aimed at creating shared goals. HTA agencies can use these goals to ensure meaningful patient involvement at every step of the HTA process. Five elements are explored. In Recognizing the value of shared purpose, we highlight examples of HTA agencies that have patients working in partnership with medical practitioners and HTA staff. Results include improved processes that instil confidence. Committing to patient involvement as part of HTA culture highlights several initiatives aimed at changes in HTA organisational culture to be more inclusive of patients. In Aligning patient and HTA goals we cite work in Belgium and New Zealand which places a greater emphasis on quality of life rather than life expectancy and cost-effectiveness. By Integrating patient involvement at every step of the HTA process patients can make vital contributions at every stage of the HTA process. We provide two examples of where HTA agencies have successfully involved patients early in the process in order to broaden the scope of evaluations. Developing a common language and working together can support transformative dialogue through unified language. CONCLUSION: The authors of this commentary ask that agencies and stakeholders involved in HTA take up this call to work together for visionary and transformative elevation of the voice of patients in HTA worldwide.","output":"Patients and public are important stakeholders in health technology assessment but the level of involvement is low C a call to action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The presence of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) causes great impairment in social and professional activities as well as in the quality of life (QOL) and increases level of parental stress. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the QOL, self-competence, and self-liking among the caregivers of ADHD and non-ADHD children. METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 216 caregivers. They were divided into two groups: caregivers of children with ADHD and caregivers of children without ADHD. SETTING: This study was conducted in the Elsinbellawin City at Dakahlia Governorate in Egypt. Tools used were socio-demographic data sheet and WHO Quality of Life Scale-Brief (WHOQOL-Brief) and self-liking/self-competence scale. RESULTS: Our results showed that all QOL dimensions of the caregivers of ADHD children were markedly deteriorated, if compared to those of non-ADHD children, and two thirds of caregivers of ADHD children suffered from poor level quality of life (QOL). Caregivers of non-ADHD children had fair level of self-competence but a good level of self-liking.

The \\"shock and kill\\" strategy was confirmed to reactivate HIV-1 latent reservoirs by latency-reversing agents (LRAs) for accelerated HIV-1 clearance. However, a single LRA might be insufficient to induce HIV-1 reactivation from latency due to the complexity of the multiple signaling regulatory pathways that establish the HIV-1 latent reservoir. Therefore, combinations of LRAs or dual-mechanism LRAs are urgently needed to purge the latent reservoirs. We demonstrate here for the first time that a dual-target inhibitor with a specific suppressive effect on both BRD4 and TIP60, CPI-637, could reactivate latent HIV-1 in vitro by permitting Tat to bind positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and assembling Tat-super-elongation complex (SEC) formation. In addition, CPI-637-mediated TIP60 downregulation further stimulated BRD4 dissociation from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, allowing Tat to more effectively bind P-TEFb compared to BRD4 inhibition alone. Much more importantly, CPI-637 exerted a potent synergistic effect but alleviated global T cell activation and blocked viral spread to uninfected bystander CD4+ T cells with minimal cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that CPI-637 opens up the prospect of novel dual-target inhibitors for antagonizing HIV-1 latency and deserves further investigation for development as a promising LRA with a \\"shock and kill\\" strategy.","output":"CPI-637 as a Potential Bifunctional Latency-Reversing Agent That Targets Both the BRD4 and TIP60 Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In the current situation, clinical patient data are often siloed in multiple hospital information systems.

The specific surface area, phase composition, microstructure, binding and photocatalytic activity of BiVO4@ACF pose great dependence on solvent nature and chelating agents utilized for synthesis. The photocatalytic and antibacterial potential of this composite was evaluated and optimized by using a model pollutant, Reactive Rhodamine Blue (RhB) and pathogenic microbes (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). The composite possesses enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity and was reutilized for three rounds of respective reaction without any loss of activity and structure as evident from SEM and XRD results. The photocatalytic mechanism of photodegradation of dye and bactericidal properties of samples under visible light irradiation was determined by scavenger and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.

We investigated the associations between social isolation, cognitive preoccupation, worries, and anxiety, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress as well as use of, and attitude towards, mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected as part of the Mental Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16 to 25 years (N=666;Mage 213) (assessment period: 07.05.-16.05.2020). Outcomes: Overall, 38% of youth met criteria for moderate psychological distress and 30% felt often or very often socially isolated, even after most restrictive infection control measures had been lifted. Social isolation, COVID-19-related worries and anxiety, and objective risk indicators were associated with psychological distress, with evidence of dose-response relationships for some of these associations. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of social isolation increased (reporting never as reference group: occasionally: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 43 C 191, p<0001;often: aOR 222, CI 98 C 502, p<0001;very often: aOR 423, CI 141 C 1268, p<0001). There was evidence that psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with a positive attitude towards using digital interventions, whereas high levels of psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with actual use.Interpretation: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with poor mental health in youth.

However, no studies have examined whether MRI-assessed LC integrity is related to arousal responses to acute stress in either younger or older adults, despite the LCs documented role in promoting physiological arousal as part of the acute stress response. In this study, 102 younger and 51 older adults completed an acute stress induction task while we assessed multiple measures of physiological arousal (heart rate, breathing rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, sympathetic tone, and heart rate variability, HRV). We used turbo spin echo MRI scans to quantify LC MRI contrast as a measure of LC integrity. Using univariate and multivariate approaches, we assessed how LC MRI contrast was associated with arousal at rest and during acute stress reactivity and recovery. We found that in older adults, having higher caudal LC MRI contrast was associated with greater stress-related increases in systolic blood pressure and decreases in HRV, as well as lower HRV during recovery from acute stress. These results suggest that having higher caudal LC integrity in older adulthood is associated with more pronounced physiological responses to acute stress.

Samples were tested with multiplexed-PCR, using an automated system for nine respiratory viruses, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Clinical characteristics and distribution of respiratory viruses in patients with and without acute chest syndrome (ACS) were evaluated. RESULTS: A respiratory virus was detected in 47 (78%) patients. Nine (15%) patients had ACS; a respiratory virus was detected in all of them. The demographic characteristics of patients with and without ACS were similar. HRV was the most common virus, detected in 29 of 47 (62%) patients. Logistic regression showed no association between ACS and detection of HRV, hCoV, hBoV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens. Co-infection with at least one additional respiratory virus was seen in 14 (30%) infected patients, and was not significantly higher in patients with ACS (P=0.10). Co-infections with more than two respiratory viruses were seen in seven patients, all in patients without ACS. Bacterial pathogens were not detected.

Here, we present LineageOT, a unified framework for lineage tracing and trajectory inference. Specifically, we leverage mathematical tools from graphical models and optimal transport to reconstruct developmental trajectories from time courses with snapshots of both cell states and lineages. We find that lineage data helps disentangle complex state transitions with increased accuracy using fewer measured time points.

However, the outcomes of recovered patients have not been well defined. METHODS: This is a prospective observational follow-up study of survivors with COVID-19 from a designated tertiary center in Hefei, China. We examined chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, pulmonary function, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: Among 81 enrolled patients, 62 (77%) patients and 61 (75%) patients, respectively, completed 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Abnormal CT findings were still present in 73% of patients at 1 month and 54% at 3 months, whereas chest CT scan scores improved progressively at 1-month (5.0  5.1) and 3-month follow up (3.0  4.5) compared with that during hospitalization (11  6.8). Mild restrictive pulmonary impairment was detected in 11% and 10% of patients at 1-month and 3-month follow up, respectively. The 6MWD was 523  77 m in male patients and 484  58 m in female patients, which was significantly lower than in healthy controls (606  68 m, 568  78 m, p < 0.001). SF-36 scores were significantly impaired in the domains of role physical (RP), role emotional (RE), and social functioning (SF) compared with the normal age-matched population. RP was improved at 3-month compared with 1-month follow up in the 41C64 years group (p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis showed that older age (over 40 years) and steroid administration during hospitalization were independently associated with worse chest CT scores at 3-month follow up. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 months, chest CT abnormalities were present in one half of COVID-19 survivors and worse chest CT scores were independently associated with older age and steroid administration during hospitalization. Residual pulmonary function impairments were modest, whereas exercise capacity and SF-36 scores were significantly lower than the general population.

Ethiopia is off-track on sustainable development targets in under-five mortality since 2020. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate time to death and its associated factors among under-five children in Ethiopia. Methods Nationally representative demographic and health survey data were used for this study. A total of 5772 under-five children were included. Data were analyzed using R software. Semi-parametric nested shared frailty survival analysis was employed to identify factors affecting under-five mortality. Adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with 95% Confidence interval (CI) was reported and log-likelihood was used for model comparison. Statistical significance was declared at P-value < 0.05. Results The weighted incidence of under-five death before celebrating the first fifth year was 5.76% (95% CI: 5.17 C 6.40). Female sex and under-five children living in urban areas were high probability of survival than their counterparts. After controlling cluster and region level frailty, multiple births (AHR = 7.03, 95% CI: 4.4011.24), breastfed within one hour after birth (AHR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.280.61), preceding birth interval 18C23 months (AHR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.12 -2.36), and under-five children younger than 18 months (AHR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.93 -3.86), and teenage pregnancy (AHR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.012.87) were statistically significant factors for time to under-five death. Conclusion Even though Ethiopia has a significant decline under-five death, still a significant number of under-five children were dying. Early initiation of breastfeeding, preceding birth interval and teenage pregnancy were the preventable factors of under-five mortality.

METHODS A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using GP consultation data routinely collected from 2008 to 2017 in Victoria, Australia. Post-vaccination GP consultation rates were monitored, over a 22-week surveillance period each year that aligned with each year's influenza vaccination season, using the Observed minus Expected (O-E) and the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) CUSUM charts. Days 1-7 post-vaccination were considered as the risk period. The LLR CUSUM was designed to detect both a 50% and two-fold rise in the odds of the baseline post-vaccination GP consultation rates. RESULTS Over the 10-year study period, more than 1.5 million seasonal influenza vaccines doses were administered to 295,091 persons. Overall, 1.29% had a GP consultation within one week of vaccination, but 98.53% of the consultations occurred in days 1-3 post-vaccination. The LLR CUSUM chart detected significant increases in the weekly rates of post-vaccination GP consultation in 2010 in children aged under ten years and in 2015 in adults aged 19-64 years. These increases were aligned by week, but one week earlier and by age category, with the historical adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) signals occurring in 2010 and 2015. However, in the absence of historical AEFI signals, increased rates of post-vaccination GP consultations were identified in three of the eight influenza vaccination years.

Individual statistics were pair-wise linked in terms of their common features, and an integrative epidemic network was formulated. RESULTS: The study of associations between important SARS characteristics considerably enhanced the mainstream epidemic analysis and improved the understanding of the relationships between the observed epidemic determinants. The response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors was simulated, target areas were detected, critical time and relevant factors were determined. CONCLUSION: It was shown that by properly accounting for links between different SARS statistics, a data-based analysis can efficiently reveal systematic associations between epidemic determinants. The analysis can predict the temporal trend of the epidemic given its spatial pattern, to estimate spatial exposure given temporal evolution, and to infer the driving forces of SARS transmission given the spatial exposure distribution.","output":"Data-driven exploration of spatial pattern-time process-driving forces associations of SARS epidemic in Beijing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phytosulfokines (PSKs) are secreted, sulfated peptide hormones derived from larger prepropeptide precursors. Proteolytic processing of one of the precursors, AtPSK4, was demonstrated by cleavage of a preproAtPSK4Cmyc transgene product to AtPSK4Cmyc. Cleavage of proAtPSK4 was induced by placing root explants in tissue culture. The processing of proAtPSK4 was dependent on AtSBT1.1, a subtilisin-like serine protease, encoded by one of 56 subtilase genes in Arabidopsis. The gene encoding AtSBT1.1 was up-regulated following the transfer of root explants to tissue culture, suggesting that activation of the proteolytic machinery that cleaves proAtPSK4 is dependent on AtSBT1.1 expression. We also demonstrated that a fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site in proAtPSK4 is cleaved in vitro by affinity-purified AtSBT1.1.

Many detection methods have been developed so far, but they are still unable to meet the practical requirements. In this paper, we present a deep convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory (C-BiLSTM) model with boundary regression for cough detection, where cough and non-cough parts need to be classified and located. We added convolutional layers before the LSTM to enhance the cough features and preserve the temporal information of the audio data. Considering the importance of the cough event integrity for subsequent analysis, the novel model includes an embedded boundary regression on the last feature map for both higher detection accuracy and more accurate boundaries. We delicately designed, collected and labelled a realistic audio dataset containing recordings of patients with respiratory diseases, named the Corp Dataset. 168 h of recordings with 9969 coughs from 42 different patients are included. The dataset is published online on the MARI Lab website (https://mari.tongji.edu.cn/info/1012/1030.htm). The results show that the system achieves a sensitivity of 84.13%, a specificity of 99.82% and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.89, which is significantly superior to other related models. With the proposed method, all the criteria on cough detection significantly increased. The open source Corp Dataset provides useful material and a benchmark for researchers investigating cough detection.

For more than a decade, neurologists have recognized the benefits of telemedicine in the acute management of stroke patients. However, as the use of telemedicine was restricted until the COVID-19 pandemic, the view of Brazilian neurologists about telemedicine is unknown. METHODS: All neurologists registered at the Brazilian Academy of Neurology were invited by e-mail to participate in a survey about personal perceptions on telemedicine use. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two neurologists from all regions of Brazil answered the online questionnaire. The survey showed that 18.5% of participants worked with telemedicine before the pandemic, while 63.6% reported working with telemedicine during the pandemic. The main telemedicine modalities used during the pandemic were teleorientation and teleconsultation. DISCUSSION: According to our data, the COVID-19 pandemic deeply influenced the behavior of Brazilian neurologists, who developed a more favorable view about telemedicine and actively searched for information about telemedicine. As there is a need for more training in this area in Brazil, universities and medical societies must strive to improve telemedicine education.

Study Design and Methods APPEX-19 is a multicenter randomized clinical trial that randomized non-intubated adults with COVID-19 on <6 L/minute supplemental oxygen to receive a smartphone-guided self-prone positioning intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was the composite of respiratory deterioration (an increase in supplemental oxygen requirement) or intensive care unit transfer. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, we calculated the posterior probability of superiority within each treatment arm (superiority threshold 95%). Results The trial was stopped early for slow enrollment. A total of 293 participants were included in the modified intention to treat analysis (159 self-prone positioning intervention and 134 usual care). Among participants who self-reported body positioning (n=139; 70 intervention; 69 usual care), 71.4% in the intervention arm and 59.4% in the usual care arm attempted prone positioning.

The relationship between paranasal sinus computed tomography (PNS CT) and sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups were selected for the study, the COVID-19 and the control groups. The control group consisted of 40 patients who applied to our clinic with headache and therefore underwent PNS CT. The other group consisted of 40 patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed with sudden loss of smell with the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test. Clinical and demographic characteristics, tomography results, and olfactory test scores of patients with COVID-19 loss of smell and control group patients were recorded. The relationship between CT changes in the olfactory cleft and the degree of loss of smell was evaluated. The \\"Opacification in the olfactory cleft\\" was accepted as a positive CT finding. RESULTS: Comparison of patients with COVID-19 who had a loss of smell and the control group indicated that a significant difference was observed in terms of CT findings (P = .022). When we evaluated the paranasal CTs obtained from our patients with loss of smell, the CT of 13 patients showed pathological findings (P < .05). As the COVID-19 progressed (pneumonia and respiratory failure), the degree of loss of smell increased (P < .05). A statistically significant relationship was found between the CCCRC score and the presence of PNS CT findings (P = .0012). CONCLUSION: The PNS CT findings are significant in patients with COVID-19 with a loss of smell and were significantly associated with the degree of loss of smell. In patients with olfactory loss due to COVID-19, PNS CT can help in diagnosis.

However, the isolated effect of MAP on rScO2 is uncertain. The aim of the present study was in a randomized, blinded design to elucidate the effect of 2 distinct levels of MAP on rScO2 values during CPB.We hypothesized that a higher MAP would be reflected in higher rScO2 values, lower frequency of patients with desaturation, and a less pronounced cerebral desaturation load. METHODS This is a substudy of the Perfusion Pressure Cerebral Infarct trial, in which we investigated the impact of MAP levels during CPB on ischemic brain injury after cardiac surgery. Deviation in rScO2 was a predefined outcome in the Perfusion Pressure Cerebral Infarct trial. Patients were randomized to low MAP (LMAP; 40-50 mm Hg) or high MAP (HMAP; 70-80 mm Hg) during CPB. CPB pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L/min/m, and MAP levels were targeted using norepinephrine. Intraoperatively, NIRS monitoring was performed in a blinded fashion, with sensors placed on the left and right side of the patient's forehead. NIRS recordings were extracted for offline analysis as the mean value of left and right signal during prespecified periods. Mean rScO2 during CPB was defined as the primary outcome in the present study. RESULTS The average MAP level during CPB was 67 mm Hg  SD 5.0 in the HMAP group (n = 88) and 45 mm Hg  SD 4.4 in the LMAP group (n = 88). Mean rScO2 was significantly lower in the HMAP group during CPB (mean difference, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-6.1; P = .010). There was no difference in rScO2 values at specified time points during the intraoperative period between the 2 groups. Significantly more patients experienced desaturation below 10% and 20% relative to rScO2 baseline in the HMAP group (P = .013 and P = .009, respectively), and the cerebral desaturation load below 10% relative to rScO2 baseline was more pronounced in the HMAP group (P = .042). CONCLUSIONS In a randomized blinded study, we observed that a higher MAP induced by vasopressors, with a fixed CPB pump flow, leads to lower mean rScO2 and more frequent and pronounced cerebral desaturation during CPB. The mechanism behind these observations is not clear. We cannot exclude extracranial contamination of the NIRS signal as a possible explanation. However, we cannot recommend increasing MAP by vasoconstrictors during cerebral desaturation because this is not supported by the findings of the present study.","output":"Impact of 2 Distinct Levels of Mean Arterial Pressure on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy During Cardiac Surgery: Secondary Outcome From a Randomized Clinical Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in nursing facilities can easily lead to a high rate of infection and fatality.

Understanding the precise cross-talk between virus and host is vital for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics. In the present study, we identified the nucleoprotein (NP) of H7N9 IAV as a positive regulator of RIG-I like receptor (RLR)-mediated signaling. Based on a loss-of-function strategy, we replaced H1N1 (mouse-adapted PR8 strain) NP with H7N9 NP, by using reverse genetics, and found that the replication and pathogenicity of rPR8-H7N9NP were significantly attenuated in cells and mice. Biochemical and cellular analyses revealed that H7N9 NP specifically interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) after viral infection. Subsequently, we identified a PxxQxS motif in the H7N9 NP protein that may be a determinant for the NP and TRAF3 interaction. Furthermore, H7N9 NP stabilized TRAF3 expression via competitively binding to TRAF3 with cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2), leading to the inhibition of the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3. Taken together, these data uncover a novel mechanism by which the NP protein of H7N9 IAV positively regulates TRAF3-mediated type I interferon signaling. Our findings provide insights into virus and host survival strategies that involve a specific viral protein that modulates an appropriate immune response in hosts.IMPORTANCE The NS1, PB2, PA-X, and PB1-F2 proteins of influenza A virus (IAV) are known to employ various strategies to counteract and evade host defenses. However, the viral components responsible for the activation of innate immune signaling remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the NP protein of H7N9 IAV specifically associates with and stabilizes the important adaptor molecule TRAF3, which potentiates RLR-mediated type I interferon induction. Moreover, we reveal that this H7N9 protein prevents the interaction between TRAF3 and cIAP2 that mediates Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 for degradation. The current study reveals a novel mechanism by which H7N9 NP upregulates TRAF3-mediated type I interferon production, leading to attenuation of viral replication and pathogenicity in cells and mice.

DESIGN: Mixed-methods investigation comprising a national online longitudinal survey and embedded qualitative study. SETTING: UK online survey and interviews with community-dwelling individuals in the East of England. PARTICIPANTS: People in the UK with RMDs were invited to participate in an online survey. A subsection of respondents were invited to participate in the embedded qualitative study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The online survey, completed fortnightly over 10 weeks from April 2020 to August 2020, investigated changes in symptoms, social isolation and loneliness, resilience and optimism. Qualitative interviews were undertaken assessing participant's perspectives on changes in symptoms, exercising, managing instrumental tasks such a shopping, medication and treatment regimens and how they experienced changes in their social networks. RESULTS: 703 people with RMDs completed the online survey. These people frequently reported a deterioration in symptoms as a result of COVID-19 pandemic social restrictions (52% reported increase vs 6% reported a decrease). This was significantly worse for those aged 18-60 years compared with older participants (p=0.017). The qualitative findings from 26 individuals with RMDs suggest that the greatest change in daily life was experienced by those in employment. Although some retired people reported reduced opportunity for exercise outside their homes, they did not face the many competing demands experienced by employed people and people with children at home. CONCLUSIONS: People with RMDs reported a deterioration in symptoms when COVID-19 pandemic social restriction measures were enforced. This was worse for working-aged people. Consideration of this at-risk group, specifically for the promotion of physical activity, changing home-working practices and awareness of healthcare provision is important, as social restrictions continue in the UK.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic social restriction measures on people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in the UK: a mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality around the world.

For college students, web-based physical education is a challenge, as these course are normally offered outdoors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use data from a web-based survey to evaluate the relationship between the mental health status of college students and their sports-related lifestyles. Problems related to web-based physical education were also examined. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted by snowball sampling from May 8 to 11, 2020. Demographic data, mental health status, and sports-related lifestyles of college students in Wuhan as well as issues related to web-based physical education were collected. Mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: The study included 1607 respondents from 267 cities. The average scores of the DASS-21 subscales (2.46 for depression, 1.48 for anxiety, and 2.59 for stress) were significantly lower in our study than in a previous study (P<.05). Lower DASS-21 scores were significantly correlated with regular exercise, maintaining exercise habits during the outbreak of COVID-19, exercising more than 1 to 2 times a week, exercise duration >1 hour, and >2000 pedometer steps (all P<.05). None of the three forms of web-based physical education was preferred by more than 50% of respondents. Frequent technical problems were confronted by 1087/1607 students (67.6%). Shape-up exercises (846/1607, 52.6%), a designed combination of exercises (710/1607, 44.2%), and Chinese kung fu (559/1607, 34.8%) were suggested sports for web-based physical education. CONCLUSIONS: Mental status was significantly correlated with regular exercise and sufficient exercise duration. Professional physical guidance is needed for college students in selected sports. Exercises not meeting students' preferences, frequent technical problems, and the distant interaction involved in web-based physical education were the main problems that should be solved in future.","output":"Association of Web-Based Physical Education With Mental Health of College Students in Wuhan During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after penetrating skull base injury is relatively rare compared with close head injuries involving skull base fractures. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 65-year-old man who had presented with epistaxis and serous rhinorrhea. When he had fallen to the ground near his bee boxes, a garden pole had poked into his right nostril. He had instantly removed the pole from his nostril himself. However, immediately after removal of the pole, he had developed nasal bleeding and serous rhinorrhea. He then drove to our emergency room. Computed tomography showed pneumocephalus with a minor cerebral contusion in the left frontal lobe and a penetrating injury in the left anterior skull base. His CSF leakage had not resolve spontaneously within 1 week after the injury with strict bed rest. We repaired the CSF leakage using a fat (adipose tissue)-on-fascia autograft plug and caulked the defect in the anterior skull base with the fat-on-fascia graft (FFG) plug through the left nostril with endoscopic guidance. The CSF rhinorrhea was successfully controlled. Intranasal local application of fluorescein aided in the detection of the direction of flow of the CSF leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Endonasal endoscopic caulking of a skull base defect using an FFG plug can be useful to treat CSF leakage due to the localized skull base defect, especially in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. It is simple, inexpensive, and timesaving. It requires no special skills nor sophisticated instruments that can cause aerosolization, reducing the risk of infection during the surgery.","output":"Traumatic Nonmissile Penetrating Transnasal Anterior Skull Base Fracture and Brain Injury with Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak: Intraoperative Leak Detection and an Effective Reconstruction Procedure for a Localized Skull Base Defect Especially After Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In previous work, we designed peptides that showed potent inhibition of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections in chicken embryos. In this study, we demonstrate that peptides modified with cholesterol or 3 U of polyethylene glycol (PEG3) conjugated to the peptides' N termini showed even more promising antiviral activities when tested in animal models. Both cholesterol- and cholesterol-PEG3-tagged peptides were able to protect chicken embryos from infection with different serotypes of NDV and IBV when administered 12 h prior to virus inoculation. In comparison, the untagged peptides required intervention closer to the time of viral inoculation to achieve a similar level of protection. Intramuscular injection of cholesterol-tagged peptide at 1.6 mg/kg 1 day before virus infection and then three times at 3-day intervals after viral inoculation protected 70% of the chickens from NDV infection. We further demonstrate that the cholesterol-tagged peptide has an in vivo half-life greater than that of untagged peptides. It also has the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the avian central nervous system (CNS). Finally, we show that the cholesterol-tagged peptide could play a role before the viral fusion peptide's insertion into the host cell and thereby target an earlier stage of fusion glycoprotein activation.

The scope and diversity of these unwanted events highlight the need to evaluate the resilience of a system to a specific disruptive circumstance. The broad scope and generic form of the previous studies limit their usefulness as a practical tool for analyzing the factors affecting system performance. To overcome this problem, we are only focusing on the behavior of systems that produce, distribute, and deliver food, energy, and water (FEW) during and after the occurrence of a sudden shortage of labor. Resilience metrics are first developed to measure the resilience of the FEW systems. Next, the performance levels of the FEW systems are clearly defined based on the FEW demands that are not served. Third, the labor intensity of FEW productions is calculated to assess the impact of a sudden labor shortage. This study recognizes the complex interdependencies among the FEW systems and, thus, aims to examine their resilience as a single system. Last, the labor shortage in the USA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is chosen as a use case to measure the system performance and role of adjustments on the FEW systems. The results show that a labor shortage can significantly impact the FEW system performance, possibly due to the high energy dependency of food and water systems and the high cost of storing energy. Also, the current food system has shown more resilience to a sudden labor shortage compared to the energy and water systems because of the availability of various food alternatives to meet the demand for each food category.","output":"Resilience of food, energy, and water systems to a sudden labor shortage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Work-related musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is a highly prevalent condition and one of the main contributors to disability and loss of work capacity. Current approaches to the management and prevention of work-related MSK pain do not consistently integrate current evidence-based knowledge and seem to be outdated. The Prevent4Work (P4W) Project aims to collect and spread evidence-based information to improve the management and prevention of work-related MSK pain. P4W will longitudinally investigate (1) risk factors associated with the prevalence of work-related MSK pain, (2) predictive factors for new events of work-related MSK pain in the short term and (3) the modification of pain beliefs after participating in evidence-based e-learning courses. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This project employs a mixed-methods design with international cohorts of workers from Spain, Italy and Denmark. All participants will be assessed using self-reported variables at baseline (ie, cross-sectional design) with follow-up after 3 and 6 months (ie, prospectiveCpredictive design). Throughout the first phase (0C3 months), all participants will be offered to self-enrol in e-learning courses on work-related MSK pain. Changes in pain beliefs (if any) will be assessed. The dataset will include sociodemographic characteristics, physical and psychological job demands, lifestyle-related factors, MSK pain history and pain beliefs. At baseline, all participants will additionally complete the P4W questionnaire developed to detect populations at high risk of suffering work-related MSK pain. Descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression, and analysis of variance will be used to identify the significant factors that influence the history of work-related MSK pain, evaluate the short-term prediction capacity of the P4W questionnaire, and investigate whether workers participation in e-learning courses will modify their pain beliefs.

Hazard ratios (HRs) for recurrent stroke were calculated using the Cox model. RESULTS In PRoFESS, the 2.5-year recurrent stroke risk in patients receiving ASA+ER-DP was 8.2% in those with headache within 7 days of starting treatment and 9.4% in those without [HR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.98; P = 0.03].

No such difference was observed in clopidogrel-treated patients. In ESPS2, risk of recurrent stroke was 6.2% in patients who discontinued ASA+ER-DP due to headache by day 90 versus 9.8% in patients who did not (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.31-1.27; P = 0.19) and 7.3% in patients who discontinued ER-DP due to headache by day 90 versus 13.2% in those who did not (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27-1.04; P = 0.06).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and characterize breakthrough infections in our patient population. Methods This was a retrospective review of all consecutive COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, from December 17, 2020 to June 7, 2021. Centers for Disease Control (CDC)'s breakthrough infection definition (detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in a respiratory sample 14 days after completion all recommended doses of COVID-19 vaccine) was used to identify cases. Vaccination status was extracted from the electronic medical records using Epic? SlicerDicer. Results A total of 228,674 patients, including healthcare workers (HCW), were fully vaccinated in our healthcare system. We evaluate 299 patients for breakthrough infection but only 179 (0.08%) patients met the definition;108 (60%) were female with median age of 59, 60 (33%) were HCW, and 11 (6%) were immunocompromised. The majority (92%) were asymptomatic (62 or 35%) or had mild/moderate illness (102 or 57%);14 (8%) had severe or critical illness. The status of one patient was unknown.

However, the mechanistic details of how XRN1 facilitates influenza A virus replication remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that XRN1 and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV are directly associated and colocalize in the PBs. Moreover, XRN1 downregulation impaired viral replication while the viral titers were significantly increased in cells overexpressing XRN1, which suggest that XRN1 is a positive regulator in IAV life cycle. We further demonstrated that the IAV growth curve could be suppressed by adenosine 3,5-bisphosphate (pAp) treatment, an inhibitor of XRN1. In virus-infected XRN1 knockout cells, the phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor 3 (p-IRF3) protein, interferon beta (IFN-) mRNA, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were significantly increased, resulting in the enhancement of the host innate immune response and suppression of viral protein production.

All loops were rated by ten observers with different subspeciality backgrounds for four times by each observer (400 loops overall) in a random sequence using a web-based rating tool. We analyzed inter- and intraobserver variability for specific pathologies and a semiquantitative LUS score. Interobserver agreement for both, identification of specific pathologies and assignment of LUS scores was fair to moderate (e.g., LUS score 1 Fleiss' &#954; = 0.27; subpleural consolidations Fleiss' &#954; = 0.59).

The implementation of remote provision of health care needs to be informed by vulnerable populations, such as people living with dementia. AIM: To understand the remote healthcare experiences of patients living with dementia and their family carers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative interviews with community-based patients living with dementia and their carers were carried out between MayCAugust 2020, while the COVID-19 pandemic was ongoing in England. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely by telephone or video call with 30 patients living with dementia and 31 carers. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three main themes were derived relating to: proactive care at the onset of COVID-19 restrictions; avoidance of healthcare settings and services; and difficulties with remote healthcare encounters. People living with dementia and their carers felt check-up calls were reassuring but limited in scope and content. Some avoided healthcare services, wishing to minimise COVID-19 risk or reduce NHS burden, or encountering technological barriers. Difficulties in remote consultations included lack of prompts to remember problems, dealing with new emerging difficulties, rescheduling/missed calls, and inclusion of the voice of the person with dementia. CONCLUSION: While remote consultations could be effective, proactive calls could be more structured around needs. Consideration should be given to replace non-verbal prompts to describe problems, particularly for new health concerns. In continuing remote consultations, it is important to facilitate engagement with patients living with dementia and their carers to ensure good practice.","output":"Remote primary care consultations for people living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences of people living with dementia and their carers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) pose a unique challenge for clinicians in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to preterm infants increased susceptibility to infections (Maitre NL and Williams JV, Res Rep Neonatol. 6:41C49, 2016). RVIs often present with nonspecific symptoms and currently lack effective treatments (Baraldi et al., Ital J Pediatr. 40:65, 2014). Death due to viral bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing nations and industrialized nations alike, and patients with bronchiolitis frequently require intensive care and use of mechanical ventilation (Thompson et al., JAMA 289:179C186, 2003). Infants who acquire RVI during their birth hospitalizations have significantly longer length of stay and are more likely to develop chronic respiratory disease, particularly bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Bennett et al., J Pediatr 161:814C818, 2012). Furthermore, infants with RVIs are often placed on empiric antibiotic therapy, which can frustrate antimicrobial stewardship efforts (Bennett et al., J Pediatr 161:814C818, 2012; Cantey et al., Lancet Infect Dis 2016;16:1178C1184). RVIs are also associated with increased costs to both health systems and families due to increased care and lost productivity. In 2016, Zinna et al.

We aim to examine the differential importation risks with departure origins and post-arrival controls. METHODS: We developed a Bayesian framework to model disease progress of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of travel measures and inferred the origin-specific disease prevalence among inbound travellers, using data on passengers arriving in Hong Kong and laboratory-confirmed imported cases. We estimated the origin-specific risks of releasing infectious travellers under different control strategies and traveller volumes. We also estimated the risk of having released infectious travellers when a resurgence occurs in departure locations with no imported cases during a certain period. FINDINGS: Under the then strict controls of 14-day quarantine and testing on day 12, the Philippines imposed the greatest importation risk among the studied countries/regions (95.8% of releasing at least one infectious traveller, 95% credible interval (CrI), 94.8-96.6%). This was higher than that from low prevalence countries/regions (e.g., 23.4%, 95% CrI, 21.6-25.3% for Taiwan) if controls relaxed (i.e., 7-day quarantine and test on day 5). Increased traveller volumes and resurgence in departure locations with low prevalence under relaxed controls did not impose a greater importation risk than high prevalence locations under stricter controls. INTERPRETATION: Moderate relaxation of control measures for travellers arriving from low prevalence locations did not impose higher risks of community outbreaks than strict controls on travellers from high prevalence locations.

Through an online questionnaire reaching ferret caretakers from pet owner, laboratory, zoo, rescue, and working (e.g., pest control) sectors, we describe how ferrets are housed, the enrichment they receive, enrichment types that ferrets most enjoy and those which may be harmful or problematic. Of 754 responses, 82.4% were from pet owners. Most ferrets were housed with at least one other ferret, and the type of housing varied across sectors from single-level cages to free-ranging housing. Environmental enrichments most commonly reported were hammocks, tunnels and human interaction, with ferrets reported to most enjoy digging, tunnels, human interaction and exploration. Scent trails were also reported to be among the most enjoyable enrichments but were rarely provided, suggesting that they could be used more. Problematic enrichment included rubber items, such as Kongs?, which could be chewed and swallowed, narrow tunnels trapping ferrets, and fabrics catching claws. These items should therefore be avoided. Our results suggest that all sectors have room to improve both housing and enrichment to better ferret welfare.Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are kept and used in multiple sectors of society, but little is known about how they are housed and what environmental enrichment (EE) they may benefit from. We aimed to help guide caretakers about what housing and EE can be provided for ferrets. Through an online questionnaire of ferret caretakers, including pet, laboratory, zoological collection, rescue and working animal sectors internationally, we described ferret housing, opportunities for exploration, EE provision and caretaker opinions on ferrets preferred EE types, and problematic EE. In total, 754 valid responses from 17 countries were analysed, with most (82.4%) coming from pet owners. Most ferrets were housed socially, with housing varying across sectors from single-level cages to free-range housing in a room or outdoor enclosure;pet owners mostly used multi-level cages. The most commonly reported EE included hammocks, tunnels and tactile interaction with caretakers. Respondents reported that ferrets particularly enjoyed digging substrates, tunnels, human interaction and exploration. The most frequently reported problems were that ingestion of unsuitable chew toys and rubber items could cause internal blockages, narrow tunnels could trap ferrets, and certain fabrics that could catch claws. This suggests a need for increased awareness of the risks of these EE types and for more commercially available safety-tested ferret EE. Scent trails were relatively rarely provided but were reported to be enjoyed and harmless, so we recommend that these should be provided more commonly. Our results suggest that there is scope to improve ferret housing and EE provision to benefit ferret welfare across all sectors.","output":"Housing and Environmental Enrichment of the Domestic Ferret: A Multi-Sector Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Given the importance of evidence-based decision-making, this study aimed to evaluate epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as associate factors of mortality among admitted COVID-19 cases Methods: This multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases who were hospitalized in 19 public hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU), Tehran, Iran, between February 19 and May 12, 2020 Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the infected cases were compared between the deceased and survivors after discharge Case fatality rates (CFRs) were calculated across all study variables Single and multiple logistic regressions were used to explore the risk factors associated with COIVD-19 mortality Results: Out of the 16035 cases that referred to the hospitals affiliated to SBMU, 16016 patients (99 93% of Confirmed and 99 83% of suspected cases) were hospitalized 1612 patients died with median hospitalization days of 5 (interquartile range (IQR): 2-9) and 3 (1-7) for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases, respectively The highest death rate was observed among ages&gt;65 (63 4% of confirmed cases, 62 3% of suspected cases) and intensive care unit (ICU)/critical care unit (CCU) patients (62 7% of confirmed cases, 52 2% of suspected cases) Total case fatality rate (CFR) was 10 05% (13 52% and 6 37% among confirmed and suspected cases, respectively) The highest total CFR was observed in patients with age&gt;65 years (25 32%), underlying comorbidities (25 55%), and ICU/CCU patients (41 7%) The highest CFR was reported for patients who had diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (38 46%) as underlying non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and patients with cancer (35 79%) Conclusion: This study showed a high CFR among suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases, and highlighted the main associated risk factors including age, sex, underlying NCDs, and ICU/CCU admission affecting survival of COVID-19 patients","output":"Baseline Characteristics and Associated Factors of Mortality in COVID-19 Patients;an Analysis of 16000 Cases in Tehran, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A lite version of the EQ-5D-5L valuation protocol, which requires a smaller sample by collecting more data from each participant, was proposed and used to develop an EQ-5D-5L value set for Uganda. METHODS: Adult respondents from the general Ugandan population were quota sampled based on age and sex. Eligible participants were asked to complete 20 composite time trade-off tasks in the tablet-assisted personal interviews using the offline EuroQol Portable Valuation Technology software under routine quality control. No discrete choice experiment task was administered. The composite time trade-off data were modelled using four additive and two multiplicative regression models. Model performance was evaluated based on face validity, prediction accuracy in cross-validation and in predicting mild health states. The final value set was generated using the best-performing model. RESULTS: A representative sample (N = 545) participated in this study. Responses to composite time trade-off tasks from 492 participants were included in the primary analysis. All models showed face validity and generated comparable prediction accuracy. The Tobit model with constrained intercepts and corrected for heteroscedasticity was considered the preferred model for the value set on the basis of better performance. The value set ranges from ? 1.116 (state 55555) to 1 (state 11111) with pain/discomfort as the most important dimension.

With the relentless threat of the corona virus (Covid-19) lurking over South Africa and the ongoing search for a vaccine postulating that underlying health risks including diabetes and obesity may be an impediment in the fight of this pandemic, good nutrition is now essential. There is, therefore, a need to provide insight on food consumption and purchasing behaviours in South Africa with particular reference to the youth. Food vendors provide convenient access to affordable meals for university students. Whether the food provided is balanced or not is unknown. This study was, therefore, carried out to examine the nutritional value of the foods sold to university students by food vendors that were contracted to the four campuses of the Durban University of Technology (DUT). Utilising the qualitative approach, technical information was sourced using an observation technique and a structured menu recording sheet. Thus, data was collected by weighing the cooked and pre-cooked items individually to provide accurate nutrient assessment using an electronic food scale. Whilst this study only focused on the macronutrients, it was found that the nutritional value of foods served by these vendors was not balanced due to the fact that the top 15 meals contained more than the World Health Organisations (WHO) recommended fat 15-30% contributing to energy. Furthermore, the contribution of carbohydrates (CHO) was less than the recommended percentage of 55-75%. Notably, the students who consumed two or three of the top 15 meals in a day exceeded the recommended intake of fat and energy for that day revealing a high probability that university students can be overweight. This study recommends a menu improvement and a strong collaboration between the food vendors and the universitys Department of Food and Nutrition to develop healthier menu options and assist students in making informed decisions regarding their health and consumption behaviours.

Although various amino acids have been shown to contribute to cancer initiation and progression, little is known about the effects of histidine, a dietary essential amino acid that is partially taken up via histidine/large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1), on cancer cells. In this study, we evaluated the effects of histidine on HCC cells and sensitivity to sorafenib. Remarkably, we found that exogenous histidine treatment induced a reduction in the expression of tumor markers related to glycolysis (GLUT1 and HK2), inflammation (STAT3), angiogenesis (VEGFB and VEGFC), and stem cells (CD133). In addition, LAT1 expression was downregulated in HCC tumor regions with high expression of GLUT1, CD133, and pSTAT3, which are known to induce sorafenib resistance.

AIM: We aim to provide information on the effects of three decontamination procedures on porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)-contaminated masks and respirators, presenting a stable model for infectious coronavirus decontamination of these typically single-use-only products. METHODS: Surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirator coupons and straps were inoculated with infectious PRCV and submitted to three decontamination treatments, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, vaporized H2O2, and dry heat treatment. Viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured in swine testicle cells. FINDINGS: UV irradiation, vaporized H2O2 and dry heat reduced infectious PRCV by more than three orders of magnitude on mask and respirator coupons and rendered it undetectable in all decontamination assays. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of stable disinfection of face masks and filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with an infectious SARS-CoV-2 surrogate using UV irradiation, vaporized H2O2 and dry heat treatment. The three methods permit demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude of an infectious coronavirus in line with the United States Food and Drug Administration policy regarding face masks and respirators.

Correspondingly, monumental human and financial resources have been invested in biomedical research, with a mission to decode the mechanisms of ageing and how these contribute to age-related disease. Multiple hallmarks of ageing have been identified that are common across taxa, highlighting their fundamental importance. These include dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism and telomeres biology, epigenetic modifications, cell-matrix interactions, proteostasis, dysregulated nutrient sensing, stem cell exhaustion, inflammageing and immuno-senescence. While our understanding of the molecular basis of ageing is improving, it remains a complex and multifactorial process that remains to be fully understood. A key aspect of the shortfall in our understanding of the ageing process lies in translating data from standard animal models to humans. Consequently, we suggest that a 'biomimetic' and comparative approach, integrating knowledge from species in the wild, as opposed to inbred genetically homogenous laboratory animals, can provide powerful insights into human ageing processes. Here we discuss some particularities and comparative patterns among several species from the animal kingdom, endowed with longevity or short lifespans and unique metabolic profiles that could be potentially exploited to the understanding of ageing and age-related diseases. Based upon lessons from nature, we also highlight several avenues for renewed focus in the pathophysiology of ageing and age-related disease (i.e. diet-microbiome-health axis, oxidative protein damage, adaptive homoeostasis and planetary health).

Taking a reverse translational approach and by combining in situ hybridization, primary cell isolation, immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and LC-MS/MS we studied lung and kidney ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in diabetic mice mimicking host factors linked to severe COVID-19. In healthy young mice, neither the ACE inhibitor ramipril nor the AT1 receptor blocker telmisartan affected lung or kidney ACE2 or TMPRSS2, except for a small increase in kidney ACE2 protein with ramipril. In contrast, mice with comorbid diabetes (aging, high fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetes) had heightened lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels and increased lung ACE2 activity. None of these parameters were affected by RAS blockade. ACE2 was similarly upregulated in the kidneys of mice with comorbid diabetes compared to aged controls, whereas TMPRSS2 (primarily distal nephron) was highest in telmisartan-treated animals.

With this threat, the expectation of future outbreak, and the shortage of anti-viral drugs, scientists were challenged to develop novel antivirals. The objective of this study is to develop novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds with dual activity by targeting valuable less-mutated enzymes. Here, we have mapped the binding affinity of >500,000 compounds for potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), papain protease (PLpro) and human furin protease. The enzyme inhibition activity of most promising hits was screened and tested in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate incubated with Vero cells. Computational modelling and toxicity of the compounds were validated. The results revealed that 16 compounds showed potential binding activity against Mpro, two of them showed binding affinity against PLpro and furin protease. Respectively, compounds 7 and 13 showed inhibition activity against Mpro at IC50 0.45 and 0.11 M, against PLpro at IC50 0.085 and 0.063 M, and against furin protease at IC50 0.29 M. Computational modelling validated the binding affinity against all proteases. Compounds 7 and 13 showed significant inhibition activity against the virus at IC50 0.77 and 0.11 M, respectively. Both compounds showed no toxicity on mammalian cells. The data obtained indicated that compounds 7 and 13 exhibited potent dual inhibition activity against SARS-CoV-2. The dual activity of both compounds can be of great promise not only during the current pandemic but also for future outbreaks since the compounds' targets are of limited mutation and critical importance to the viral infection.","output":"Promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs by effective dual targeting against the viral and host proteases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 30 January 2020. A lockdown from 24 March was partially relaxed on 10 May. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R 0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods: Office for National Statistics data on deaths in England and Wales is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R 0 and forecasts for cases and deaths. Results: The UK initial log growth rate is r = 0.254 with s.e. 0.004. R 0 = 6.94 with 95% CI (6.52, 7.39). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced throughout to 5% of their previous values, peaks of around 90,000 severely and 25,000 critically ill patients, and 44,000 cumulative deaths are expected by 16 June. With transmission rising from 5% in mid-April to reach 30%, 50,000 deaths and 475,000 active cases are expected in mid-June. Had such a lockdown begun on 17 March, around 30,000 (28,000, 32,000) fewer cumulative deaths would be expected by 9 June.

Fifty-three patients were treated by PD (prescribed Kt/V = 0.40/session), with a flexible catheter, tidal modality, using a cycler and lactate as a buffer. The mean age was 64.8  13.4 years, model of end stage liver disease (MELD) was 31  6, 58.5% were in the intensive care unit, 58.5% needed intravenous inotropic agents including terlipressin, 69.5% were on mechanical ventilation, alcoholic liver disease was the main cause of cirrhosis and the main dialysis indications were uremia and hypervolemia. Blood urea and creatinine levels stabilized after four sessions at around 50 and 2.5 mg/dL, respectively. Negative fluid balance (FB) and ultrafiltration (UF) increased progressively and stabilized around 3.0 L and ?2.7 L/day, respectively. Weekly-delivered Kt/V was 2.7  0.37, and 71.7% of patients died. Five factors met the criteria for inclusion in the multivariable analysis. Logistic regression identified as risk factors associated with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in ACLD patients: MELD (OR = 1.14, CI 95% = 1.09C2.16, p = 0.001), nephrotoxic AKI (OR = 0.79, CI 95% = 0.61C0.93, p = 0.02), mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.49, CI 95% = 1.14C2.97, p < 0.001), and positive fluid balance (FB) after two PD sessions (OR = 1.08, CI 95% = 1.03C1.91, p = 0.007).

In conclusion, our study suggests that careful prescription may contribute to providing adequate treatment for most Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) patients without contraindications for PD use, allowing adequate metabolic and fluid control, with no increase in the number of infectious or mechanical complications. MELD, mechanical complications and FB were factors associated with mortality, while nephrotoxic AKI was a protective factor.

Methods Between April 16 and 30, 2020 we conducted a prospective, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in HCWs in Southern Switzerland. Participants were hospital personnel with varying COVID-19 exposure risk depending on job function and working site. They provided personal information (including age, sex, occupation, and medical history) and self-reported COVID-19 symptoms. Odds ratio (OR) of seropositivity to IgG antibodies was estimated by univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. Findings Among 4726 participants, IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 9.6% of the HCWs. Seropositivity was higher among HCWs working on COVID-19 wards (14.1% (11.9C16.5)) compared to other hospital areas at medium (10.7% (7.6C14.6)) or low risk exposure (7.3% (6.4C8.3)). OR for high vs. medium wards risk exposure was 1.42 (0.91C2.22), P = 0.119, and 1.98 (1.55C2.53), P<0.001 for high vs. low wards risk exposure. The same was for true for doctors and nurses (10.1% (9.0C11.3)) compared to other employees at medium (7.1% (4.8C10.0)) or low risk exposure (6.6% (5.0C8.4)). OR for high vs. medium profession risk exposure was 1.37 (0.89C2.11), P = 0.149, and 1.75 (1.28C2.40), P = 0.001 for high vs. low profession risk exposure. Moreover, seropositivity was higher among HCWs who had household exposure to COVID-19 cases compared to those without (18.7% (15.3C22.5) vs. 7.7% (6.9C8.6), OR 2.80 (2.14C3.67), P<0.001). Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detectable in up to 10% of HCWs from acute care hospitals in a region with high incidence of COVID-19 in the weeks preceding the study. HCWs with exposure to COVID-19 patients have only a slightly higher absolute risk of seropositivity compared to those without, suggesting that the use of PPE and other measures aiming at reducing nosocomial viral transmission are effective. Household contact with known COVID-19 cases represents the highest risk of seropositivity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS We previously conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis in patients with treatment-naive metastatic NSCLC and a PD-L1 expression of  50% receiving first-line pembrolizumab. Here, we report the results of the irAE analysis and the potential correlation between irAEs and clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 1010 patients were included in this analysis; after a 6-week landmark selection, 877 (86.8%) patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Any grade irAEs (P < .0001), grade 3/4 irAEs (P = .0025), leading to discontinuation irAEs (P = .0144), multiple-site and single-site irAEs (P < .0001), cutaneous irAEs (P = .0001), endocrine irAEs (P = .0227), pulmonary irAEs (P = .0479), and rheumatologic irAEs (P = .0018) were significantly related to a higher objective response rate.

In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19. The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui'an People's Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization. Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine. The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared. RESULTS: Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment. But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group. Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent. Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group. The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects. In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.","output":"Clinical efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing, rapidly spreading pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2) Among all the infected countries around the globe as of now (June 15, 2020), the total confirmed positive cases reported are 7,805,148, with the death of 431,192 At present, no specialized treatments evolved to cure COVID-19 Its treatment is symptomatic Though huge efforts are being made to produce potential therapies to scuffle COVID-19, no drug has been discovered so far","output":"Targeting natural products for the treatment of COVID-19 - an updated review.

In Italy, like in other countries, reptiles have become popular pet animals, but epidemiological data about RAS are not collected. To fill this gap, surveys to estimate the presence and frequency of RAS and human exposure were carried out in Piedmont, a Northern-Italian region. Two studies were conducted among patients with sporadic salmonellosis (i.e., not linked to foodborne outbreaks): the first, restricted to a big city hospital, showed a prevalence of RAS of 7%, and the second, extending to the population affected by sporadic salmonellosis across all the region, showed a prevalence of 3%. In addition, an ocular survey taken in public places displaying reptiles detailed possible exposure through direct and indirect contact and a questionnaire survey that collected data from the general population, including reptile owners, revealed that preventive measures are not always known or applied. These results confirmed that RAS in Italy is present and constitutes a proportion of the human salmonellosis cases in line with the percentages reported in other countries. People should be more informed about RAS and the related preventive measures. ABSTRACT: Reptile-associated salmonellosis (RAS), Salmonella infection in humans, is acquired through contact with reptiles. Reptiles have become popular pet animals, and RAS is likely to be an underestimated but growing problem. No epidemiological data about RAS are routinely collected in Italy. In order to estimate the occurrence of RAS in the Italian human population and to investigate the exposure, two epidemiological studies on patients with sporadic salmonellosis were carried out in the Piedmont region, along with an evaluation of human exposure in public places displaying reptiles and with a survey on people awareness. RAS appeared make up 7% of sporadic salmonellosis in the first study and 3% in the second, more extensive study. A prevalence of 11.7% and 5.7%, respectively, were calculated for the age range of 0C21 years. It was observed that in public places displaying reptiles, it was possible to easily come into contact with the animals and their environment. Some knowledge about RAS emerged from the interviews with the general population, but preventive measures are not completely applied by reptile owners. In conclusion, RAS in Italy is present and constitutes a proportion of the human salmonellosis cases in line with the percentages reported in other countries. Exposure to reptiles should always be considered as a risk factor, and people should be more informed about RAS and the related preventive measures.","output":"Surveys on Exposure to Reptile-Associated Salmonellosis (RAS) in the Piedmont RegionItaly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sub-health status (SHS) is an intermediate status between health and disease.

Many countries have enforced 2 - 4 weeks' lockdown and are extending the period depending on their current disease scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of estimated communicability of COVID-19 prompted such decision. But the idea that, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the infection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time (following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was proposed by Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community Size (CCS). Methods: We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease dynamics. Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to extinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of lockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the given country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have identified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops below CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it is introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We have calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown days. Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19.

ANOVA repeated measure, independent t-test and logistic regression were done. A P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.93  17.92 years. Regarding gender, there were 91 females (42.3%) and 124 males (57.7%). The mean hospital stay, the temperature at admission, and onset of symptoms were 4.91  3.68 days, 37.40  0.96C and 5.88  4.80 days, respectively. Close contact with suspected people was found in 10.2% of patients. Additionally, 44 patients (20.5%) were smokers. Shortness of breath and cough were found in 62.8% and 49.3% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities of patients. Regarding lung involvement, 33 patients (33%) were normal, most of the patients (n = 71) had 5%-25% involvement in their lung and a minority of patients (n = 13) had a severe condition of 50%-75% lung involvement. The association between smoking and mortality was tested using chi-square showing no significant difference (X2 :2.959, P = .085). There was no significant difference between AST, ALT, ALP, total, direct Bilirubin, lung involvement and suffering from fever (P > .05). High Spo2 can increase the chance of recovery by 24% with each unit reduction. Kidney involvement increases the chance of death by about 80% (95% CI: 0.104-0.013). The odds ratio of spo2 for recovery of COVID-19 was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.014-1.528; P = .037). Kaletra with odds ratio of 31.960 had the most highest effect on recovery following COVID-19 (P = .043). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 involves different organs of the body with different severity. In the meantime, smoking was not a risk factor for the virus or associated with severe manifestations of the disease. Patients with high creatinine and CPK, pulmonary involvement above 25%, and hypoxemia had a higher mortality rate. Increase of Spo2 by 1% can improve the patients by 24%. The results indicated that Kaletra had the most highest effect on improvement following COVID-19.","output":"Evaluation of epidemiology, clinical features, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in West Azerbaijan Province"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although human antibodies elicited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein are profoundly boosted upon infection, little is known about the function of N-reactive antibodies.

This mirrors the well-studied exponential decline of both thymus volume and T-cell production, which halve every 16 years. COVID-19 can therefore be added to the list of other diseases with this property, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MERS-CoV, West Nile virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and certain cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and brain cancers. In addition, the incidence of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 are both higher in men, consistent with the degree to which thymic involution (and the decrease in T-cell production with age) is more severe in men compared to women. Since these properties are shared with some non-contagious diseases, we hypothesized that the age dependence does not come from social-mixing patterns, i.e. that the probability of hospitalization given infection rises exponentially, doubling every 16 years. A Bayesian analysis of daily hospitalizations, incorporating contact matrices, found that this relationship holds for every age group except for the under 20s. While older adults have fewer contacts than young adults, our analysis suggests that there is an approximate cancellation between the effects of fewer contacts for the elderly and higher infectiousness due to a higher probability of developing severe disease. Our model fitting suggests under 20s have 49-75% additional immune protection beyond that predicted by strong thymus function alone, consistent with increased juvenile cross-immunity from other viruses. We found no evidence for differences between age groups in susceptibility to infection or infectiousness to others (given disease state), i.e. the only important factor in the age dependence of hospitalization rates is the probability of hospitalization given infection. These findings suggest the existence of a T-cell exhaustion threshold, proportional to thymic output and that clonal expansion of peripheral T-cells does not affect disease risk. The strikingly simple inverse relationship between risk and thymic T-cell output adds to the evidence that thymic involution is an important factor in the decline of the immune system with age and may also be an important clue in understanding disease progression, not just for COVID-19 but other diseases as well.","output":"COVID-19 hospitalization rates rise exponentially with age, inversely

Little is known regarding children's perceptions and experiences of caregiver stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine how children and adolescents identify and experience caregiver stress during the early COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed 105 de-identified helpline text and online chat transcripts from children under age 18 who submitted inquiries to the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline from March to June of 2020, with COVID-19 as a presenting issue. Inductive, thematic analysis was used to identify how child helpline users: 1) perceived and experienced drivers of caregiver stress and 2) used words to describe manifestations of caregiver stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Children experienced multiple drivers of caregiver stress during COVID-19, including intrapersonal (e.g. caregiver health concerns), interpersonal (e.g. parental discord, perceived dislike of child), and extrapersonal (e.g. financial insecurity, sheltering in place) stressors. Regardless of the driver, caregivers' stress was internalized by children. Anger, control, and blame were most commonly used to label manifestations of caregiver stress, which were often externalizing behaviors, including yelling, name calling, and blaming of others. CONCLUSION: In text and online chat inquiries to a national child helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic, children described multiple drivers of caregiver stress, often feeling as though they were to blame.

However, characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with stroke are not well known. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of risk factors, stroke characteristics, and short-term outcomes in a large health system in New York City. We included consecutively admitted patients with acute cerebrovascular events from March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Data were stratified by COVID-19 status, and demographic variables, medical comorbidities, stroke characteristics, imaging results, and in-hospital outcomes were examined. Among COVID-19-positive patients, we also summarized laboratory test results. RESULTS: Of 277 patients with stroke, 105 (38.0%) were COVID-19-positive. Compared with COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a cryptogenic (51.8% versus 22.3%, P<0.0001) stroke cause and were more likely to suffer ischemic stroke in the temporal (P=0.02), parietal (P=0.002), occipital (P=0.002), and cerebellar (P=0.028) regions. In COVID-19-positive patients, mean coagulation markers were slightly elevated (prothrombin time 15.43.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 38.624.5 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.41.3).

To mimic the feature of T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the complex of major histocompatibility class I and peptide on the cell surface derived from the processed intracellular antigen, we used NY-ESO-1, a cancer-testis antigen, to develop a TCR-like fully human IgG1 antibody and its derivative, CAR-T cells, for cancer immunotherapy. METHODS: Human single-chain variable antibody fragment (scFv) phage library (~10(11)) was screened against HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 (peptide 157C165) complex to obtain target-specific antibodies. The specificity and affinity of those antibodies were characterized by flow cytometry, ELISA, biolayer interferometry, and confocal imaging. The biological functions of CAR-T cells were evaluated against target tumor cells in vitro. In vivo antitumor activity was investigated in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model and primary melanoma tumor model in immunocompromised mice. RESULTS: Monoclonal antibody 2D2 identified from phage-displayed library specifically bound to NY-ESO-1(157-165) in the context of human leukocyte antigen HLA-A*02:01 but not to non-A2 or NY-ESO-1 negative cells. The second-generation CAR-T cells engineered from 2D2 specifically recognized and eliminated A2+/NY-ESO-1+tumor cells in vitro, inhibited tumor growth, and prolonged the overall survival of mice in TNBC and primary melanoma tumor model in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the specificity of the antibody identified from human scFv phage library and demonstrated the potential antitumor activity by TCR-like CAR-T cells both in vitro and in vivo, warranting further preclinical and clinical evaluation of the TCR-like antibody in patients.

Female rats were maintained on HFD or chow for 10 weeks, at which point animals received either RYGB or SHAM surgery followed by a gel-based diet and then powdered chow. Upon recovery, half of the rats that were previously on HFD were switched permanently to chow, and the other rats were maintained on their presurgical diets (n = 5C9/diet condition  surgery group for behavioral testing). The rats were then trained and tested in a gustometer. There was a significant interaction between diet condition and surgery on NaCl threshold that was attributable to a lower value in RYGB vs. SHAM rats in the HFD condition, but this failed to survive a Bonferroni correction.

We believe this is a neglected topic and such a complex field of study that we cannot come up with solutions easily or quickly. Therefore, this study is the starting point of a discussion about the ethics of and the need for policies around technologies for workplace health promotion. Method: Based on a literature review, the present study outlines current knowledge of ethical issues in research, development, and implementation of technologies in the workplace. Specifically, the focus is on two ethical issues that play an important role in the workerCemployer relation: privacy and autonomy. Application: Two cases indicative for a multidisciplinary project aimed at developing and evaluating sensor and intervention technologies that contribute to keeping ageing workers healthy and effectively employable are explored. A context-specific approach of ethics is used to investigate ethical issues during the development and implementation of sensor and intervention technologies. It is a holistic approach toward the diverse field of participants and stakeholders, and the diversity in perceptions of relevant values, depending on their respective professional languages. Discussion: The results show how protecting the privacy and autonomy of workers cannot be seen as stand-alone issues, but, rather, there is interplay between these values, the work context, and the responsibilities of workers and employers. Consequently, technologies in this research project are designed to improve worker conscientious autonomy, while concurrently creating balance between privacy and health, and assigning responsibilities to appropriate stakeholders. Conclusion: Focusing on a contextual conceptualisation of the ethical principles in the design and implementation of digital health technologies helps to avoid compartmentalization, out-of-context generalisation, and neglect of identifying responsibilities. Although it is a long reiterative process in which all stakeholders need to be included in order to assess all ethical issues sufficiently, this process is crucial to achieving the intended goal of a technology. Having laid out the landscape and problems of ethics around technologies for workplace health promotion, we believe policies and standards, and a very overdue discussion about these, are needed.","output":"Ethics in Design and Implementation of Technologies for Workplace Health Promotion: A Call for Discussion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the fact that a range of vaccines against COVID-19 have already been created and are used for mass vaccination, the development of effective, safe, technological, and affordable vaccines continues. We have designed a vaccine that combines the recombinant protein and DNA vaccine approaches in a self-assembled particle. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was conjugated to polyglucin:spermidine and mixed with DNA vaccine (pVAXrbd), which led to the formation of particles of combined coronavirus vaccine (CCV-RBD) that contain the DNA vaccine inside and RBD protein on the surface. CCV-RBD particles were characterized with gel filtration, electron microscopy, and biolayer interferometry. To investigate the immunogenicity of the combined vaccine and its components, mice were immunized with the DNA vaccine pVAXrbd or RBD protein as well as CCV-RBD particles. The highest antigen-specific IgG and neutralizing activity were induced by CCV-RBD, and the level of antibodies induced by DNA or RBD alone was significantly lower. The cellular immune response was detected only in the case of DNA or CCV-RBD vaccination. These results demonstrate that a combination of DNA vaccine and RBD protein in one construct synergistically increases the humoral response to RBD protein in mice.","output":"Self-Assembled Particles Combining SARS-CoV-2 RBD Protein and RBD DNA Vaccine Induce Synergistic Enhancement of the Humoral Response in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression of the 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L in different human organ/tissue derived microvascular endothelial cells.

The S protein mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells through binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. We measured the viability, intracellular cytokine release, oxidative stress, proinflammatory markers, and THP-1-like macrophage polarization. We observed an increase in apoptosis, ROS generation, MCP-1, and intracellular calcium expression in the THP-1 macrophages. Stimulation with the S protein polarizes the THP-1 macrophages towards proinflammatory futures with an increase in the TNF and MHC-II M1-like phenotype markers. Treating the cells with an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, at 100 M reduced apoptosis, ROS, and MHC-II expression induced by S protein. We analyzed the sensitivity of the HUVEC cells after the exposure to a conditioned media (CM) of THP-1 macrophages stimulated with the S protein. The CM induced endothelial cell apoptosis and MCP-1 expression. Treatment with perindopril reduced these effects. However, the direct stimulation of the HUVEC cells with the S protein, slightly increased HIF1 and MCP-1 expression, which was significantly increased by the ACE inhibitor treatment. The S protein stimulation induced ROS generation and changed the mitogenic responses of the PBMCs through the upregulation of TNF and interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine expression. These effects were reduced by the perindopril (100 M) treatment. Proteomic analysis of the S protein stimulated THP-1 macrophages with or without perindopril (100 M) exposed more than 400 differentially regulated proteins.

Although the number of hospital patients using interventions such as the video consultation has increased in recent years only a small proportion of the outpatient and inpatient visits involve telemedicine. The TELEMED database (https://telemedicine.cimt.dk/) has been launched at the Center for Innovative Medical Technologies in Denmark to ensure that hospital managers and healthcare professionals have access to information about telemedicine services and their effectiveness. This article describes the development and the content of the TELEMED database. METHODS A structured literature search was made in the PubMed Database for randomised controlled trials or observational studies with a control group that investigated the effect of telemedicine interventions for hospital patients. Data were extracted from each article on the clinical effectiveness, patient perceptions, economic effects and implementation challenges. As the database should only provide inspiration to healthcare professionals regarding possibilities for use of telemedicine, the risk of bias in the studies was not assessed. RESULTS The literature search resulted in 2825 hits. Based on full text assessment, 331 articles were included for data extraction and assessment. These articles present telemedicine services used in 22 different medical specialities. Forty-eight percent of the studies found a positive, statistically significant clinical effect, while 47% showed no statistically significant difference. In 48% of the studies, patients' experiences were examined and of these 68% found positive patient experiences. Fifty-four percent of the articles included information on the economic effects and, of these, 51% found reduction in healthcare utilization. In the majority of studies between two and four types of implementation challenges were found.Conclusions and recommendations: The TELEMED database provides an easily accessible overview of existing evidence-based telemedicine services for use by hospital managers and health professionals, who whish to to implement telemedicine.

HYPOTHESIS Pediatric emergency turnover and the corresponding lesion mechanisms were altered by lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS All children undergoing emergency orthopedic surgery during lockdown (group 1) were prospectively included, then retrospectively compared to series operated on during the same period in the previous 3 years. Demographic and surgical data were analyzed, and the pathway changes that were developed were detailed. RESULTS Turnover fell by a mean 33.5%, without change in indications. The most frequent lesions were wounds (54.3%), followed by fractures (34.3%) and infections (11.4%); the upper limbs were involved in 84.6% of cases. Lockdown had been infringed in 9.7% of traumas, mainly concerning fractures (55%). Postoperative management was modulated during lockdown in 34% of cases, without complications at the time of writing. DISCUSSION Pediatric emergency turnover decreased, without major change in lesion mechanisms. Accidents associated with lockdown infringement were rare (<10%), demonstrating good adaptation on the part of these children living in an urban area.

The primary treatment for patients with MAFLD is diet-induced weight loss; however, excessive dieting is poorly effective. Objectives The aim of this trial was to evaluate whether a high protein and low glycemic index (HPLG) dietary intervention would result in improvement of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and related metabolic markers in MAFLD. Methods A 12-week controlled, parallel-group, randomized intervention trial was performed. A number of 63 participants with MAFLD were enrolled and randomized between the HPLG dietary group and the balanced diet control group. Both diets had the same hypocaloric level and were prescribed ad libitum within food limit lists. The primary outcome was CAP. The main secondary outcomes were weight loss and improvement of metabolism-related indexes at week 12 after the program initiation. Results A total of 59 participants completed the intervention and were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 39.3  8.9 years and 66.1% were men. In this trial, protein and carbohydrate intakes were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the HPLG group compared to controls (p < 0.001). At week 12, CAP was significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.001). However, a significantly greater reduction in liver fat was observed in the HPLG group compared to the control group (p = 0.011), with mean relative reductions of 30.90 dB/m (95% CI, 21.53 to 40.26, p < 0.001) and 15.43 dB/m (95% CI, 7.57 to 23.30, p < 0.001), respectively. From baseline to week 12, a significantly greater loss in bodyweight was recorded in participants in the HPLG group (6.52 kg; 95% CI, 5.50 to 7.54, p < 0.001) compared to control subjects (2.00 kg; 95% CI, 0.89 to 3.11, p = 0.001). Moreover, body fat percentage in the HPLG group was significantly reduced compared with the control group (p = 0.002).

In many patients colonoscopies and CTCs show no significant bowel disease (SBD).

The REducing Colonoscopies in patients without significant bowEl DiseasE (RECEDE) study aims to test urine volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis alongside FIT to improve detection of SBD and to reduce the number of colonoscopies and CTCs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, prospective diagnostic accuracy study evaluating whether stool FIT plus urine VOC compared with stool FIT alone improves detection of SBD in patients referred for colonoscopy or CTC due to persistent lower gastrointestinal symptoms. To ensure SBD is not missed, the dual test requires a high sensitivity, set at 97% with 95% CI width of 5%. Our assumption is that to achieve this sensitivity requires 200 participants with SBD. Further assuming 19% of all participants will have SBD and 55% of all participants will return both stool and urine samples we will recruit 1915 participants. The thresholds for FIT and VOC results diagnosing SBD have been pre-set. If either FIT or VOC exceeds the respective threshold, the participant will be classed as having suspected SBD. As an exploratory analysis we will be testing different thresholds. The reference comparator will be a complete colonoscopy or CTC. Secondary outcomes will look at optimising the FIT and VOC thresholds for SBD detection.

We evaluated the immunoexpression of AZIN1 and 2 in tumor tissue from ACC patients, and related the results to clinical and clinicopathological features and patient survival. STUDY DESIGN: We performed immunohistochemical study on minor salivary and mucous gland ACC tissue samples of patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital (Helsinki, Finland) during 1974-2012. We scored AZIN1 and 2 immunoexpression in 42 and 45 tumor tissue samples, respectively, and correlated them with clinicopathological factors and survival. RESULTS: Enhanced AZIN2 expression was associated with better survival. In addition, both AZINs were seen more commonly in cribriform and tubular than in solid growth patterns. AZIN1 expression did not correlate with the studied clinicopathological factors. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that AZIN2 expression is higher in cancer tissue with secretory functions.

Notably, there is limited data regarding the influence of social determinants of health, like perceived discrimination and economic stress, which may exacerbate COVID-19 health risks. The primary goals of this study are to test the bearing of subjective experiences of discrimination, financial security, and quality of care on illness severity and lasting symptom complaints. METHODS1,584 recovered COVID-19 patients that experienced mild to severe forms of the disease provided information about their illness, medical history, lasting symptoms, and psychosocial information. Prevalence data isolated differences in patients infected early versus late in the pandemic. Path analyses examined hypothesized associations between discrimination, illness severity, and lasting symptoms. Post hoc logistic regressions tested social determinants hypothesized to predict neurological, cognitive, or mood symptoms. RESULTS70.6% of patients reported presence of one or more lasting symptoms after recovery. Neural systems were especially impacted, and 19.4% and 25.1% of patients reported mood or cognitive/memory complaints, respectively. Path models demonstrated that frequency and stress about experiences of discrimination predicted increased illness severity and increased lasting symptom count, even when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and mental/physical health comorbidities. Notably, this effect was specific to stress related to discrimination, and did not extend to general stress levels. Further, perceived but not objective socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with increased lasting symptom complaints after recovery. Finally, associations between discrimination and illness differed with individual perceptions about quality of medical care. CONCLUSIONSLasting symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 are highly prevalent and neural systems are significantly impacted. Importantly, psychosocial factors (perceived discrimination and perceived SES) can exacerbate individual health risk. This study provides actionable directions for improved health outcomes by establishing that sociodemographic risk and medical care influence near and long-ranging health outcomes.","output":"Social determinants of health exacerbate disparities in COVID-19 illness severity and lasting symptom complaints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in over 1 million deaths, primarily affecting older patients with chronic ailments Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been deemed particularly vulnerable given their high rates of disability and increased susceptibility to infections There have also been concerns regarding disease-modifying therapy (DMT) during the pandemic as many DMTs may increase the risk of infection due to some of their immunosuppressive properties Furthermore, due to MS-related chronic inflammatory damage within the central nervous system, there have been concerns for worsening neurological injury by COVID-19 This has resulted in an alarmingly high level of anxiety and stress among the MS community leading to a lack of compliance with medications and routine check-ups, and even failure to obtain treatment for relapse However, there is currently substantial evidence that MS and most DMT usage is not associated with increased COVID-19 severity MS patients who suffer worse outcomes were more likely to be older and suffer from significant disabilities and comorbid conditions, which would also be expected from those in the general population Likewise, there is little if any evidence demonstrating an increased susceptibility of MS patients to COVID-19-related neurological complications Therefore, we aim to summarize the most recent findings related to COVID-19 and MS demonstrating that MS and most DMTs do not appear as risk factors for severe COVID-19","output":"Review of the COVID-19 Risk in Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant virus genomes are engineered as vectors for functional genomics and production of foreign proteins. The application of plant virus vectors is of potential interest to the worldwide, multibillion dollar, grape and wine industries.

However, grapevine virus biology exerts certain limitations on the utility of the virus-derived gene expression and RNA interference vectors. As is typical for viruses infecting woody plants, several grapevine viruses exhibit prolonged infection cycles and relatively low overall accumulation levels, mainly because of their phloem-specific pattern of systemic infection.

Whether angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the viral binding site for SARS-CoV-2, contributes to the spike protein-induced barrier disruption also remains unclear. Here, a 3D-BBB microfluidic model was used to interrogate mechanisms by which the spike protein may facilitate barrier dysfunction. The spike protein upregulated the expression of ACE2 in response to laminar shear stress. Moreover, interrogating the role of ACE2 showed that knock-down affected endothelial barrier properties. These results identify a possible role of ACE2 in barrier homeostasis. Analysis of RhoA, a key molecule in regulating endothelial cytoskeleton and tight junction complex dynamics, reveals that the spike protein triggers RhoA activation. Inhibition of RhoA with C3 transferase rescues its effect on tight junction disassembly. Overall, these results indicate a possible means by which the engagement of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 facilitates disruption of the BBB via RhoA activation. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the BBB may lead to strategies to prevent the neurological deficits seen in COVID-19 patients.

Scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients, identifying treatment options and developing vaccines. In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not being conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Yet these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and to thus appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to better understand the state and dynamics of the pandemic. Methods: In 100, randomly selected constituencies out of 755, 3,000 Munich households are identified via random route and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and subjects []14 years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of []3 ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children <14 years, are offered a pharyngeal swab taken at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. In case of severe symptoms, participants will be transferred to a Munich hospital. For one year, the study teams re-visits the households for blood sampling every six weeks. Discussion: With the planned study we will establish a reliable epidemiological tool to improve the understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to better assess the effectiveness of public health measures as well as their socio-economic effects. This will support policy makers in managing the epidemic based on scientific evidence.","output":"Protocol of a population-based prospective COVID-19 cohort study Munich, Germany (KoCo19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study of the implications of a shift to working from home (WFH) in the context of the COVID pandemic. The literature and news coverage of this topic focuses on rising concerns over cybersecurity, but exploratory interviews suggest a need to reframe this issue. A focus on the threats or rising security problems tied to WFH is important but too narrow. An equally critical question is whether early experiences with and adaptation to WFH created a cybersecurity infrastructure and practices that have enabled a much greater scale of WFH. In essence, for some kinds of work for some types of individuals, is it possible that advances in cybersecurity have been an enabler of WFH and other remote telework, rather than a barrier? This question provides a basis for expanding research on whether cybersecurity is a barrier or enabler of WFH patterns, including many mixed or hybrid modes of splitting work between the office, home and other remote locations. Given the issues tied to the limited perspectives of even those with expertise in support of WFH, we suggest the basic need for survey research and selected case studies on several well-defined sets of individuals to gain a more empirically anchored perspective on whether cybersecurity has shifted from a barrier to becoming an enabler of remote work.","output":"Cybersecurity in Working from Home: An Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of the research was to verify the possibilities of using virtual reality in combination with classical approaches to the rehabilitation of patients after stroke.

At the same time, we tried to identify quantitative and qualitative parameters that could be objectively measured and based on them to evaluate the progress of patients in rehabilitation or in personalizing individual rehabilitation scenarios. RESULTS In patients who underwent a combined method of rehabilitation, we observed progress in the development of their ability to improve motor skills. We identified various categories of parameters that can be evaluated by artificial intelligence methods, and we also identified that the key elements in the use of virtual reality as a rehabilitation method are the so-called \\"WOW\\" effect and the creation of an emotional change in the patient that motivates him to rehabilitate.

In the modern era, contemporary radiation planning and delivery may mitigate radiation-related toxicity in this theoretically high-risk cohort. This is the first manuscript to report clinical outcomes for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and underlying IBD curatively treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). METHODS: A large institutional database of patients (n = 4245) treated with SBRT for adenocarcinoma of the prostate was interrogated to identify patients who were diagnosed with underlying IBD prior to treatment. All patients were treated with SBRT over five treatment fractions using a robotic radiosurgical platform and fiducial tracking. Baseline IBD characteristics including IBD subtype, pre-SBRT IBD medications, and EPIC bowel questionnaires were reviewed for the IBD cohort. Acute and late toxicity was evaluated using the CTCAE version 5.0. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients were identified who had underlying IBD prior to SBRT for the curative treatment of prostate cancer. The majority (n = 18) were diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and were being treated with local steroid suppositories for IBD. No biochemical relapses were observed in the IBD cohort with early follow up. High-grade acute and late toxicities were rare (n = 1, grade 3 proctitis) with a median time to any GI toxicity of 22 months. Hemorrhoidal flare was the most common low-grade toxicity observed (n = 3). CONCLUSION: To date, this is one of the largest groups of patients with IBD treated safely and effectively with radiation for prostate cancer and the only review of patients treated with SBRT. Caution is warranted when delivering therapeutic radiation to patients with IBD, however modern radiation techniques appear to have mitigated the risk of GI side effects.","output":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in men with underlying inflammatory bowel disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From smart self-tightening sutures and expandable stents to morphing airplane wings, shape memory structures are increasingly present in our daily life. The lack of methods for synthesizing intricate structures from them on the micron and submicron level, however, is stopping the field from developing. In particular, the methods for the synthesis of shape memory polymers (SMPs) and structures at this scale and the effect of new geometries remain unexplored. Here, we describe the synthesis of shape memory polyurethane (PU) capsules accomplished by interfacial polymerization of emulsified droplets. The emulsified droplets contain the monomers for the hard segments, while the continuous aqueous phase contains the soft segments. A trifunctional chemical cross-linker for shape memory PU synthesis was utilized to eliminate creep and improve the recovery ratios of the final capsules. We observe an anomalous dependence of the recovery ratio with the amount of programmed strain compared to previous SMPs. We develop quantitative characterization methods and theory to show that when dealing with thin-shell objects, alternative parameters to quantify recovery ratios are needed. We show that while achieving 94-99% area recovery ratios, the linear capsule recovery ratios can be as low as 70%. This quantification method allows us to convert from observed linear aspect ratios in capsules to find out unrecovered area strain and stress. The hollow structure of the capsules grants high internal volume for some applications (e.g., drug delivery), which benefit from much higher loading of active ingredients than polymeric particles. The methods we developed for capsule synthesis and programming could be easily scaled up for larger volume applications.","output":"Shape Memory Polyurethane Microcapsules with Active Deformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Problems caused by the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and its mutations have brought challenges in pandemic control for all countries worldwide.

Here, we assess the specificities of four commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISAs in serum/plasma panels originating from Africa, South America, and Europe. METHODS: 882 serum/plasma samples collected from symptom-free donors before the COVID-19 pandemic in three African countries (Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria), Colombia, and Germany were analysed with three nucleocapsid-based ELISAs (Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP IgG, EDI&#8482; Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG, Mikrogen recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgG), one spike/S1-based ELISA (Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG), and in-house common cold CoV ELISAs. RESULTS: High specificity was confirmed for all SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISAs for Madagascan (93.4-99.4%), Colombian (97.8-100.0%), and German (95.9-100.0%) samples. In contrast, specificity was much lower for the Ghanaian and Nigerian serum panels (Ghana: NCP-based assays 77.7-89.7%, spike/S1-based assay 94.3%; Nigeria: NCP-based assays 39.3-82.7%, spike/S1-based assay 90.7%). 15 of 600 African sera were concordantly classified as positive in both the NCP-based and the spike/S1-based Euroimmun ELISA, but did not inhibit spike/ACE2 binding in a surrogate virus neutralisation test. IgG antibodies elicited by previous infections with common cold CoVs were found in all sample panels, including those from Madagascar, Colombia, and Germany and thus do not inevitably hamper assay specificity. Nevertheless, high levels of IgG antibodies interacting with OC43 NCP were found in all 15 SARS-CoV-2 NCP/spike/S1 ELISA positive sera. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the chosen antigen and assay protocol, SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA specificity may be significantly reduced in certain populations probably due to interference of immune responses to endemic pathogens like other viruses or parasites.","output":"Limited specificity of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISAs in serum samples of African origin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To study fungal infections such as Mucormycosis, Aspergillosis, Candidiasis, Cryptococcosis associated with Covid-19.

METHODS: All stroke patients treated by thrombectomy (June 2015-October 2018) were prospectively enrolled in this observational study. At 90 days, functional outcome was assessed by the mRS, and patient-reported HRQoL by the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Self-report Questionnaire, consisting of five health domains. The EQ-5D utility index (EQ-5D-I; -0.594 to 1.00 with higher values indicating better HRQoL) was calculated. Linear regression analysis was applied to identify predictors of better HRQoL (higher EQ-5D-I). RESULTS: Of 504 patients (median age 76 years, 51.8% female), the mean EQ-5D-I was 0.39 (SD 0.44). The proportion of stroke survivors who reported complaints in the different domains decreased from 66% in Usual Activities, to 57% in Mobility, 50.4% in Selfcare, 41.7% in Pain/Discomfort and 40.8% Anxiety/Depression. A lower age, a lower pre-stroke mRS, a lower baseline NIHSS, and a higher ASPECT score, concomitant thrombolysis therapy, and a successful recanalization were independent predictors of better HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported HRQoL provides a more comprehensive assessment of stroke outcome than the mRS. Health domains involving motor function showed most frequently complaints in HRQoL after stroke thrombectomy, while a large proportion of patients did not report any complaints across the different health domains. Predictors of better HRQoL closely match the predictors of better functional outcome measured by the mRS in other thrombectomy studies.","output":"Patient-reported health-related quality of life after stroke thrombectomy in clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of information technology promotes the reform of education.

Methods: In ADVANCE (NCT03105128) and MOTIVATE (NCT03104413), patients with moderately to severely active CD received intravenous (IV) RZB induction therapy or placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks. Patients with clinical response to RZB IV induction were re-randomised in a 52-week maintenance study (FORTIFY, NCT03105102) to receive subcutaneous (SC) RZB or PBO (ie, withdrawal). For this post-hoc analysis, patient subgroups were stratified by years of CD duration at baseline (< 2, 2-5, > 5-10, and > 10 years). Induction analyses focused on patients who received RZB 600 mg IV or PBO for 12 weeks. As all patients who entered maintenance responded to RZB IV induction, maintenance analyses were limited to those patients who responded to induction and then received RZB 360 mg SC for 52 weeks. Clinical and endoscopic outcomes were evaluated using nonresponder imputation incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety was assessed throughout the studies. Results: The induction and maintenance analyses included 527 patients who received RZB 600 mg IV and 141 patients who received RZB 360 mg SC, respectively. At the end of induction (week 12), patients with CD duration of < 2 years achieved higher rates of endoscopic outcomes with IV RZB induction vs patients with longer durations of disease (Figure 1), and regardless of baseline CD duration, greater proportions of RZB-treated patients achieved clinical remission (defined by stool frequency and abdominal pain), endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, and ulcer-free endoscopy vs PBO (P  .05). Clinical remission rates at week 12 were numerically higher in patients with CD duration of < 5 years vs > 5 years (Figure 1). Similar results for improved clinical and endoscopic outcomes associated with shorter disease duration were observed at week 52 with RZB 360 mg SC maintenance treatment (Figure 2). RZB was well tolerated with lower rates of serious adverse events and serious infections vs PBO in induction, across CD duration subgroups. Conclusion: RZB induction and maintenance therapy was effective and well tolerated with a safety profile generally similar across CD duration subgroups. Achievement of clinical and endoscopic endpoints were higher in patients with shorter duration of CD, suggesting that earlier introduction of RZB therapy may lead to improved outcomes.","output":"Shorter disease duration is associated with better outcomes in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease treated with risankizumab: Results from the phase 3 ADVANCE, MOTIVATE, and FORTIFY studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic across countries all over the world urges governments to revolutionize the traditional medical hospitals/centers to provide sustainable and trustworthy medical services to patients under the pressure of the huge overload on the computing systems of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for medical monitoring as well as treatment services of medical professionals. Uncertain malfunctions in any part of the medical computing infrastructure, from its power system in a remote area to the local computing systems at a smart hospital, can cause critical failures in medical monitoring services, which could lead to a fatal loss of human life in the worst case. Therefore, early design in the medical computing infrastructures power and computing systems needs to carefully consider the dependability characteristics, including the reliability and availability of the WSNs in smart hospitals under an uncertain outage of any part of the energy resources or failures of computing servers, especially due to software aging. In that regard, we propose reliability and availability models adopting stochastic Petri net (SPN) to quantify the impact of energy resources and server rejuvenation on the dependability of medical sensor networks. Three different availability models (A, B, and C) are developed in accordance with various operational configurations of a smart hospitals computing infrastructure to assimilate the impact of energy resource redundancy and server rejuvenation techniques for high availability. Moreover, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the components that impose the greatest impact on the system availability. The analysis results indicate different impacts of the considered configurations on the WSNs operational availability in smart hospitals, particularly 99.40%, 99.53%, and 99.64% for the configurations A, B, and C, respectively. This result highlights the difference of 21 h of downtime per year when comparing the worst with the best case.

This study aimed to explore the psychological effects of COVID-19 on patients with this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with a phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 11 patients with COVID-19 was recruited. Data were collected from the beginning of March to the beginning of June 2020 using semi-structured interviews and they were analyzed according to Van Manen's method. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Initially, 315 codes were extracted. During data analysis and comparisons, the codes were reduced to 108. Ultimately, 10 categories, 38 subcategories, and 3 themes emerged. The theme of behavioral responses including 5 categories (Remorse, Fear and despair, Death anxiety, Growth, Support), disease-caused helplessness including two categories (Failure, Denial), and decline of social networks including three categories (Rejection, Stigma, Feeling guilty). CONCLUSIONS: After understanding the findings of this research, nurses working in the wards of patients with COVID-19 can better consider the importance of assessing and analyzing the psychological challenges and experiences of these patients during the course of illness and quarantine.

We investigated the protective effect and usefulness of loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) during chest compression. Methods This was a single-center simulation study performed from May 2019 to July 2019 in a tertiary hospital. We measured the concentrations of ambient aerosol and particles inside the loose-fitting PAPR during chest compression, and this ratio was set as the simulated workplace protecting factor (SWPF). According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulations, the assigned protection factor (APF) of loose-fitting PAPRs is 25. Thus, the loose-fitting PAPRs were assumed to have a protective effect when the SWPF were  250 (APF  10). We measured the SWPF of PAPR in real time during chest compression and also investigated the problems encountered during its use. Results Ninety-one participants (median age 29 [interquartile range (IQR): 26C32] years; 74% female) completed the simulation. None of the participants failed with SWPF below 250 during three sessions of chest compression. The median (IQR) values of SWPF at three cycles were 17,063 (10,145-26,373), 15,683 (9477-32,394), and 16,960 (7695-27,279). There was no disconnection of equipment or mechanical failures during chest compression. In addition, most participants (83%) replied that they rarely or never experienced difficulty in verbal communication and felt that the loose-fitting PAPR was comfortable.

Due to the high mental, physical, and emotional demands of the pediatric hematology/oncology profession, workplace supports should be in place to address the needs of the staff. A nurse-led support program is one strategy to enhance staff well-being. Methods: The Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant Advancing Resiliency Team (HART) is a nurse-led peer-to-peer on-site support program for multidisciplinary staff caring for hematology/oncology patients. HART coaches, working 8-hour shifts, covering both day and night shift hours, are present 3 days a week on the unit. HART offers a confidential space for one on one or group interactions, educational sessions, assistance with work related, patient-care based, or personal concerns, and various forms of integrative therapies. Results: There have been over 1,100 coach consults and 98 HART shifts worked. The most commonly reported changes since HART began include staff feeling more supported by leadership and staff making time for breaks during the work shift. A 25.6% increase in staff reporting to be extremely satisfied with unit support was found. Discussion: Cultivating a culture of staff support is important. Due to COVID-19, physical HART coach presence was put on hold for 4 weeks and virtual interventions were trialed. Since its return, coach consult numbers have been steadily rising.

Our focus on Ethiopia is of particular relevance given that ECE provision has expanded dramatically in recent years, aimed at ensuring children are prepared for primary school. Using data collected through a phone survey with 480 parents and caregivers, the results revealed that learning disruption due to COVID-19 school closures is likely to be substantial and will probably widen existing inequalities further. Many poorer households and those where parents or caregivers are not literate, are less likely to have child-oriented learning resources, and home learning activities between parents and children in these households are limited. The study highlights that greater attention needs to be paid to mitigate the threats of COVID-19 on Ethiopia's recent gains in ECE, to prevent the pandemic from further reinforcing inequalities between children from advantaged and disadvantaged households.","output":"The Implications of COVID-19 for Early Childhood Education in Ethiopia: Perspectives from Parents and Caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of parasite infection grows with the size of host aggregations, which, in turn, may also depend on host sex and age and the quality of environmental resources. Herein, we studied the relationship between ectoparasitic infections with the wing mite (Spinturnix myoti) and the size of the breeding colonies, sex, age, and body condition index (BCI) of its host, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). The influence of environmental quality in the Carpathian Mountains (Poland) was also examined. We found significant differences in mite abundance and BCI between different breeding aggregations of the greater mouse-eared bat and also between the host sex/age categories. The most heavily infected bats were adult M. myotis females, while young males appeared to be the least infected. The BCI differed significantly between the sexes in young bats (males had a higher BCI than females) and also between colonies. No significant differences in the BCI were found for adult females. We did not find any relationship between the infestation rate of M. myotis, their colony size, the quality of environmental resources (percentage of forest cover around the colony), or the BCI. The prevalence of the various developmental stages of the mites did not differ between the host sex/age categories; however, differences were found in the sex ratios of deutonymphs and adult mites between adult M. myotis females. We predict that parasite load may not be dependent on colony size itself, but mainly on microclimatic factors, which are in turn directly correlated with colony size.","output":"Is parasite load dependent on host aggregation size?

Scarf injury occurs when a woman wearing a long, traditional scarf called an orna rides in a recently introduced autorickshaw with a design flaw that allows the orna to become entangled in the vehicle's driveshaft. Caught in the engine, the orna pulls the woman's neck into hyperextension, causing a debilitating high cervical spinal cord injury and quadriplegia. The circumstances of the scarf injury reveal the need for more critical cultural analysis than the fields of global health and rehabilitation typically offer. First, the fatal design flaw of the vehicle reflects different norms of gender and dress in China, where the vehicle is manufactured, versus Bangladesh, where the vehicle is purchased at a low price and assembled on-site-a situation that calls transnational capitalist modes of production and exchange into question. Second, the experiences of women with scarf injuries entail many challenges beyond the injury itself: the transition to life with disability following the rehabilitation period is made more difficult by negative perceptions of disability, lack of resources and accessible infrastructure, and cultural norms of gender and class in Bangladesh. Our cross-disciplinary conversation about women with scarf injuries, involving critical disability studies, global health and rehabilitation experts, exposes the shortcomings of each of these fields but also illustrates the urgent need for deeper and more purposeful collaborations. We, therefore, argue that the developing subfield of global health humanities should include purposeful integration of a humanities-based critical disability studies methodology.","output":"Exploring the intersection of critical disability studies, humanities and global health through a case study of scarf injuries in Bangladesh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of imatinib combined with the Best Conventional Care (BCC) versus placebo plus BCC in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS: Addition of imatinib to the BCC will provide a superior clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19 compared with BCC plus placebo. This hypothesis is on the basis of 1) intralysosomal entrapment of imatinib will increase endosomal pH and effectively decrease SARS-CoV-2/cell fusion, 2) kinase inhibitory activity of imatinib will interfere with budding/release or replication of SARS-CoV-2, and 3) because of the critical role of mechanical ventilation in the care of patients with ARDS, imatinib will have a significant clinical impact for patients with critical COVID-19 infection in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). TRIAL DESIGN: This is an individual patient-level randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-parallel arm phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of imatinib for the treatment of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Participants will be followed for up to 60 days from the start of study drug administration. This trial will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion Criteria: Patients may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria: 1) Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study. For patients who are too unwell to provide consent such as patients on invasive ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), their Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) can sign the informed consent, 2) Hospitalized patients &#8805;18 years of age, 3) Positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract sample (oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) by Center for Disease Control or local laboratory within 7 days of randomization, 4) Women of childbearing potential must agree to use at least one primary form of contraception for the duration of the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for the study: 1) Patients receiving any other investigational agents in a clinical trial. Off-label use of agents such as hydroxychloroquine is not an exclusion criterion, 2) Pregnant or breastfeeding women, 3) Patients with significant liver or renal dysfunction at the time of screening as defined as: 3.1) Direct bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL, 3.2) AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase >5x upper limit of normal, 3.3) eGFR &#8804;30 mL/min or requiring renal replacement therapy, 4) Patients with significant hematologic disorder at screen as defined as: 4.1) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/L, 4.2) Platelet <20,000/L, 4.3) Hemoglobin <7 g/dL, 5) Uncontrolled underlying illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled active seizure disorder, or psychiatric illness/social situations that per site Principal Investigator's judgment would limit compliance with study requirements, 6) Known allergy to imatinib or its component products, 7) Any other clinical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would make the subject unsuitable for the study. Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD is the initiating site. The study may be opened in other centers on the basis of the accrual rate or the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Imatinib: All doses of imatinib should be administered with a meal and a large glass of water. Imatinib can be dissolved in water or apple juice for patients having difficulty swallowing. In this study, patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 tests receive imatinib for a total of 14 days; 400 mg orally daily Days 1-14. Imatinib 400 mg tablets will be encapsulated using size 000 capsules and cellulose microcrystalline filler. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, imatinib will be given as oral suspension (40 mg/mL). To make the oral suspension, imatinib tablets will be crushed and mixed in Ora-sweet solution to yield a concentration of 40 mg/mL suspension by pharmacy. Additionally, in the absence of supportive microbiological testing results, we confirm that the in-use stability period for the prepared imatinib suspensions will be 24 hours at room temperature or 7 days at refrigerated conditions. The pharmacy staff will follow the American Society Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines for handling hazardous drugs. Placebo: The matching placebo will be packaged by Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy at University of Maryland Medical Center. The placebos will be prepared using size 000 capsules and cellulose microcrystalline filler. Imatinib 400 mg capsules and placebo capsules will be identical form and color. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, placebo will be given as oral suspension with similar process for making imatinib suspension. Concomitant Medications/supportive care: In both arms, patients can receive concomitant available local standard of care antipyretics, antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals and anti-inflammatory including hydroxychloroquine at the discretion of the treating physician as necessary. For other drug-drug interactions particularly with CYP P450, the treating physician should consider the risk and benefit of drug administration based on available information. Co-administration of off-label immunomodulatory treatments for COVID-19 including but not limited to corticosteroids, sarilumab, clazakizumab, tocilizumab, and anakinra will be allowed but may affect interpretability of study outcomes. The timing, dosing, and duration of these treatments will be meticulously collected, including any of these treatments that may be used for participants who experience progression of COVID-19 disease after study enrollment. Two analyses will be performed, the primary analysis will compare the primary endpoint in the two trial arms irrespective of any other treatment; the second analysis will be stratified for co-administration of immunomodulatory drugs. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a two-point improvement at Day 14 from baseline using the 8-category ordinal scale. The ordinal scale is an evaluation of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities; 2) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 3) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 4) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 5) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 8) Death. The secondary endpoints include: All-cause mortality at Day 28, All-cause mortality at Day 60, Time to a 2-point clinical improvement difference over baseline, Duration of hospitalization, Duration of ECMO or invasive mechanical ventilation (for subjects who are on ECMO or mechanical ventilation at Day 1), Duration of ICU stay (for subjects who are in ICU at Day 1), Time to SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-PCR, Proportion of patients with negative oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on days 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28 after starting treatment, Proportion of subjects with serious adverse events, Proportion of subjects who discontinue study drug due to adverse events. The exploratory endpoints include: Determine the impact of treatment arms on IL-6 levels, Obtain blood/peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for storage to look at transcriptomics in severe disease, Association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with severity of illness, Mean change in the ordinal scale from baseline, Time to an improvement of one category from admission using an ordinal scale, Duration of hospitalization, Duration of new oxygen use, Number of oxygenation free days, Duration of new mechanical ventilation, Number of ventilator free days. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible patients will be uniformly randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either imatinib or placebo for 14 days. Both groups will receive the BCC. The randomized treatment allocations use stratified, permuted block randomization with a variable block size; blocks are generated using a validated random number generator. In order to balance the severity of the respiratory illness between the two arms, randomization will be stratified based on radiographic findings and oxygen requirements: 1) Severe disease: evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray or CT scan OR chest auscultation (rales, crackles), and SpO2 &#8804;92% on ambient air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg, and requires supplemental oxygen administration by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or other similar oxygen delivery device; 2) Critical disease: requires supplemental oxygen delivered by non-rebreather mask or high flow cannula OR use of invasive or non-invasive ventilation OR requiring treatment in an intensive care unit, use of vasopressors, extracorporeal life support, or renal replacement therapy. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants, caregivers, and the statistician are blinded to group assignment. The only people who are not blinded are Site Pharmacists. Blinding will be performed via a specific randomization process. Centralized, concealed randomization will be executed by the Primary Site's Pharmacist. Data on eligible consented cases will be submittedelectronically on the appropriate on-study form to the pharmacy, where the patient is randomized to imatinib or placebo. Imatinib 400 mg capsules and placebo capsules will be identical form and color. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, placebo will be given as oral suspension with similar process for making imatinib suspension. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial is designed as a double-blind, two-parallel arm, randomized controlled trial with a uniform (1:1) allocation ratio to: Arm A) Imatinib or Arm B) Placebo. Patients in both arms will receive the BCC per local institutional standards at the discretion of the treating physician. Group sample sizes of 102 in Arm A and 102 in Arm B achieve 80.6% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.20. The proportion in Arm A (imatinib treatment arm) is assumed to be 0.30 under the null hypothesis and 0.50 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in Arm B (placebo control arm) is 0.30. The test statistic used is the two-sided Fisher's Exact Test. The significance level of the test is targeted at 0.05. The significance level actually achieved by this design is &#945;=0.0385. The power of the test is calculated using binomial enumeration of all possible outcomes. The primary analysis will be conducted using an intention to treat principle (ITT) for participants who at least receive one dose of study drug or placebo. The sample size is not inflated for dropouts. All patients will be evaluable irrespective of the clinical course of their disease. TRIAL STATUS: Current protocol version is 1.2 from May 8, 2020. The recruitment started on June 15, 2020 and is ongoing. We originally anticipated that the trial would finish recruitment by mid 2021. We are aware of the enrollment requirement of approximately 200 patients, which is required to provide scientific integrity of the results. We are also aware of the fact that enrolling this number of patients in a single-site at University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) may take longer than expected, particularly taken into account other competing studies. For this reason, we are actively considering opening the protocol in other sites. After identification of other sites, we will fulfill all regulatory requirements before opening the protocol in other sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394416 .

Education is vital for understanding the importance of this regimen, and adhering to it. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face-to-face manner, either in a community or a hospital setting, using paper-based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly-evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth-based technology (defined by the World Health Organization as mobile and wireless technologies to achieve health objectives) is an innovative way to provide health education which has the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional heart failure education programmes and services. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and quantify the potential benefits and harms of mHealth-delivered education for people with heart failure. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an extensive search of bibliographic databases and registries (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal), using terms to identify HF, education and mHealth. We searched all databases from their inception to October 2019 and imposed no restriction on language of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they were conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), involving adults (&#8805; 18 years) with a diagnosis of HF. We included trials comparing mHealth-delivered education such as internet and web-based education programmes for use on smartphones and tablets (including apps) and other mobile devices, SMS messages and social media-delivered education programmes, versus usual HF care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We include five RCTs (971 participants) of mHealth-delivered education interventions for people with HF in this review. The number of trial participants ranged from 28 to 512 participants. Mean age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years, and 63% of participants across the studies were men. Studies originated from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Most studies included participants with symptomatic HF, NYHA Class II - III. Three studies addressed HF knowledge, revealing that the use of mHealth-delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.40, P = 0.51, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 411 participants; low-quality evidence). One study assessing self-efficacy reported that both study groups had high levels of self-efficacy at baseline and uncertainty in the evidence for the intervention (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.57 to 1.77; P = 0.31; 1 study, 29 participants; very low-quality evidence).Three studies evaluated HF self-care using different scales. We did not pool the studies due to the heterogenous nature of the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. None of the studies reported adverse events. Four studies examined health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There was uncertainty in the evidence for the use of mHealth-delivered education on HRQoL (MD -0.10, 95% CI -2.35 to 2.15; P = 0.93, I2 = 61%; 4 studies, 942 participants; very low-quality evidence). Three studies reported on HF-related hospitalisation. The use of mHealth-delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF-related hospitalisation (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06; P = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 894 participants; low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the studies due to limitations in study design and execution, heterogeneity, wide confidence intervals and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found that the use of mHealth-delivered educational interventions for people with HF shows no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge; uncertainty in the evidence for self-efficacy, self-care and health-related quality of life; and may result in little to no difference in HF-related hospitalisations. The identification of studies currently underway and those awaiting classification indicate that this is an area of research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.","output":"mHealth education interventions in heart failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Degradation of bio-based (polylactic acid [PLA] cups, Mater-Bi?

We review the hypothesis that sex-related differences in outcomes in COVID-19 are due to different activity of ACE2 between men and women. We also show that studies in humans have demonstrated no significant difference in serum ACE2 levels between healthy men and women. However, men with hypertension and heart failure typically have higher level of serum ACE2 activity compared to women. We hypothesize that the worse outcomes in men with COVID-19 compared to women is likely due to higher prevalence of hypertension and heart failure among men compared to women.

Angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as necessary cell entry point for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Previous animal studies have demonstrated an increased ACE2 expression following treatment with either angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) that have led to a massive precariousness regarding the optimal cardiovascular therapy during this pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have measured ACE2 mRNA expression using real\\\\time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in atrial biopsies of 81 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and we compared 62 patients that received ACEi/ARB vs. 19 patients that were not ACEi/ARB\\\\treated. We found atrial ACE2 mRNA expression to be significantly increased in patients treated with an ACEi or an ARB, independent of potential confounding comorbidities. Interestingly, the cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression correlated significantly with the expression in white blood cells of 22 patients encouraging further evaluation if the latter may be used as a surrogate for the former. Similarly, analysis of 18 ventricular biopsies revealed a significant and independent increase in ACE2 mRNA expression in patients with end\\\\stage heart failure that were treated with ACEi/ARB. On the other hand, cardiac unloading with a left ventricular assist device significantly reduced ventricular ACE2 mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: Treatment with ACEi/ARB is independently associated with an increased myocardial ACE2 mRNA expression in patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with end\\\\stage heart failure. Further trials are needed to test whether this association is deleterious for patients with COVID\\\\19, or possibly protective. Nevertheless, haemodynamic factors seem to be equally important for regulation of cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression.","output":"Angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment and haemodynamic factors are associated with increased cardiac mRNA expression of angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 in patients with cardiovascular disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although most fungi cause pathogenicity toward human beings, dynasties of the East Asian region have domesticated and utilized specific fungi for medical applications.

As SARS-CoV-2 has the potentiality of leading to life-threatening respiratory failure, its transmission routes need to be characterized. Yet, the possibility of airborne transmission is still debated. This study was performed to evaluate potential hospital indoor air viral quality in order to detect SARS-COV-2. For this purpose, an impinger method was used to monitor the SARS-COV-2 virus in the air. Thus, 33 samples were collected from 8 different hospital locations. The sampling time was between 50 and 60 min with a sampling flow rate of 28 L/min. Air samples were taken from 2 to 5 m away from the patients beds. Temperature, relative humidity, and CO(2) concentration were 28, 37, and 438 ppm, respectively. The results indicated that air samples which were 2 to 5 m away from the patients beds were negative for the presence of the virus. According to the obtained results, it is suggested that airborne transmission may not have much effect on this pandemic. However, as the patients with SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized in rooms with negative air pressure, the results might have been negatively affected.

DESIGN Survey. SETTING 110 eye banks in 26 European countries. PARTICIPANTS 64 eye banks covering 95% of European corneal transplantation activity. INTERVENTIONS A questionnaire listing the number of corneas procured and distributed from February to May 2018-2020 was circulated to eye banks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the number of corneal procurements. Additional outcomes were national algorithms for donor selection, classified according to their stringency (donors with COVID-19 history, suspected for COVID-19, asymptomatic, PCR testing) and the pandemic severity in each country. We calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient to determine, two by two, the relationship between the 3-month decline in eye banking activity (procurement), the stringency of donor selection algorithm and the grading of pandemic severity (cases and deaths). A partial correlation was run to determine the relationship between decline and stringency while controlling for pandemic severity. RESULTS Procurements decreased by 38%, 68% and 41%, respectively, in March, April and May 2020 compared with the mean of the previous 2 years, while grafts decreased, respectively, by 28%, 68% and 56% corresponding to 3866 untreated patients in 3 months. Significant disparities between countries and the decrease in activity correlated with stringency in donor selection independent of pandemic severity. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate significant differences between countries regarding donor screening algorithms based on precautionary principles and, consequently, a decrease in the donor pool, already constrained by a long list of contraindications. Fundamental studies are needed to determine the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by corneal transplantation and guide evidence-based recommendations for donor selection to justify their substantial medical and economic impact.","output":"One threat, different answers: the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cornea donation and donor selection across Europe."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION There are worldwide concerns of an impending avian influenza outbreak, with nations formulating infection control strategies to prepare for such an event. Little evidence exists for how infection control measures impact on the provision of cancer services, or how patient experience would be affected. Our aim was to compare patient satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction, during and following a period of infection control measures. METHODS We measured patient satisfaction using a validated 29-question instrument for two weeks during the implementation of strict infection control measures as a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (T1), and compared results with a two-week period after measures had been lifted (T2). RESULTS A total of 296 patients were surveyed, 149 at T1 and 147 at T2. Most patients indicated overall satisfaction, with 92.3 percent and 86.9 percent satisfied at T1 and T2, respectively (p-value is not significant). Mean satisfaction index was 3.02 and 3.04 out of 4 at T1 and T2, respectively (p-value is not significant). However, the responses for several individual questions did differ significantly between time points. At T1 more patients indicated satisfaction for understanding the doctor's plans (p-value is 0.001), while at T2, more patients indicated satisfaction for being told how to care for their condition (p-value is 0.04). CONCLUSION The study demonstrated high patient satisfaction at both time points. Similar levels of satisfaction despite infection control measures may be due to patients being more tolerant of problems in doctor-patient interactions during the outbreak due to media campaigns. This research may facilitate those healthcare services planning to minimise the impact of infection control measures on patient care.","output":"Does the implementation of radiation oncology outpatient infection control measures adversely affect patient satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic, narrowing ethics into silos such as clinical and public health does not help the cause of ethics, which often gets neglected in desperate times.

Acute respiratory infections are now the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide, especially in developing countries. Recently, human rhinovirus (HRV) infection has been emerged as an important cause of pneumonia and asthma exacerbation. OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of several viral agents principally, respiratory syncytial virus, and HRV in children with ARIs and their relationship with asthma exacerbation and pneumonia. METHODS: Between October 2011 and March 2014, 432 nasopharyngeal samples of children <15 years of age with ARI hospitalized at a referral hospital for respiratory diseases were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses using a multiplex RT-qPCR. Clinical, epidemiological, and demographic data were collected and associated with symptomatology and viral infections. RESULTS: Viral infections were detected in at least 597% of the enrolled patients, with HRV (266%) being the most frequently detected. HRV infections were associated with clinical features of asthma and difficulty in breathing such as wheezing (P = 00003), supraesternal (P = 0046), and xiphoid retraction (P = 0030). HRV subtype C (HRV-C) infections were associated with asthma (P = 002). CONCLUSIONS: Human rhinovirus was the virus most commonly detected in pediatric patients with ARI. There is also an association of HRV-C infection with asthma exacerbation, emphasizing the relevance of this virus in severe pediatric respiratory disease.","output":"Detection and characterization of respiratory viruses causing acute respiratory illness and asthma exacerbation in children during three different seasons (2011C2014) in Mexico City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that recently emerged in China is thought to have a bat origin, as its closest known relative (BatCoV RaTG13) was described previously in horseshoe bats. We analyzed the selective events that accompanied the divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13. To this end, we applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach, which leverages within-population variation and divergence from an outgroup. Results indicated that most sites in the viral open reading frames (ORFs) evolved under conditions of strong to moderate purifying selection. The most highly constrained sequences corresponded to some nonstructural proteins (nsps) and to the M protein. Conversely, nsp1 and accessory ORFs, particularly ORF8, had a nonnegligible proportion of codons evolving under conditions of very weak purifying selection or close to selective neutrality. Overall, limited evidence of positive selection was detected. The 6 bona fide positively selected sites were located in the N protein, in ORF8, and in nsp1. A signal of positive selection was also detected in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein but most likely resulted from a recombination event that involved the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence. In line with previous data, we suggest that the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 encoded/encodes an RBM similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 itself and in some pangolin viruses. It is presently unknown whether the common ancestor still exists and, if so, which animals it infects. Our data, however, indicate that divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 was accompanied by limited episodes of positive selection, suggesting that the common ancestor of the two viruses was poised for human infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are dangerous zoonotic pathogens; in the last 2 decades, three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused human epidemics. One of these is the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how, since its divergence from a closely related bat virus, natural selection shaped the genome of SARS-CoV-2. We found that distinct coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome evolved under conditions of different degrees of constraint and are consequently more or less prone to tolerate amino acid substitutions. In practical terms, the level of constraint provides indications about which proteins/protein regions are better suited as possible targets for the development of antivirals or vaccines. We also detected limited signals of positive selection in three viral ORFs. However, we warn that, in the absence of knowledge about the chain of events that determined the human spillover, these signals should not be necessarily interpreted as evidence of an adaptation to our species.","output":"Computational Inference of Selection Underlying the Evolution of the Novel Coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stakeholders in the field of medical education globally would generally agree that sustaining medical education through the dark times of the covid-19 pandemic is worth celebrating.

For metastable materials such as graphene oxide (GO), the low throughput is aggravated by the requirement of extremely low laser dose to avoid sample damage. Here we introduce algorithm-improved confocal Raman microscopy (ai-CRM), which increases the Raman scanning rate by one to two orders of magnitude with respect to state-of-the-art works for a variety of 2D materials. Meanwhile, GO can be imaged at a laser dose that is two to three orders of magnitude lower than previously reported, such that laser-induced variations of the material properties can be avoided. ai-CRM also enables fast and spatially resolved quantitative analysis, and is readily extended to 3D mapping of composite materials. Since ai-CRM is based on general mathematical principles, it is cost-effective, facile to implement and universally applicable to other hyperspectral imaging methods.","output":"Algorithm-improved high-speed and non-invasive confocal Raman imaging of 2D materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New students to learning disability nursing are always welcome as they embark on an exciting and challenging career","output":"Uncertain times bring out the best in learning disability nursing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.

In total, 938 subjects received a questionnaire including the Chalder fatigue scale (CFQ-11) and the energy/fatigue scale of the RAND-36 questionnaire. We estimated z scores for comparison with general population norms. Determinants were analyzed using multivariable logistic and linear regression analysis. In total, 458 subjects (49%) responded to the survey at median 117.5 days after COVID-19 onset, and 46% reported fatigue. The mean z scores of the CFQ-11 total was 0.70 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.82), CFQ-11 physical 0.66 (0.55 to 0.78), CFQ-11 mental 0.47 (0.35 to 0.59) and RAND-36 energy/fatigue ?0.20 (?0.31 to ?0.1); all CFQ-11 scores differed from those of the norm population (p < 0.001).

This study evaluated whether a non-endoscopic Cytosponge could detect benign oesophageal pathologies and thus have future potential in triaging patients with persistent symptoms. METHODS AND RESULTS Two complementary cohorts were recruited: (i) patients with reflux symptoms and no prior endoscopy (n = 409), and (ii) patients with reflux symptoms referred for endoscopy (n = 411). All patients were investigated using the Cytosponge and endoscopy. Significant epithelial inflammation was present in 130 (16%) Cytosponge samples, 32 of which had ulcer slough. Candida and significant inflammation was detected in a further 22 (2.3%) cases; epithelial infiltration with >15 eosinophils/high-power field reflecting possible eosinophilic oesophagitis (EOE) in five (0.6%); and viral inclusions suggestive of herpes oesophagitis in one (0.1%). No significant pathology was detected in the majority, 662 (81%), of Cytosponge samples. Cytosponge and endoscopy findings were in agreement in 574 (70%) cases, in 165 (67%) of the discordant cases one investigation showed mild inflammation while the other was negative, with an additional 22 (8.9%) differing on the extent of inflammation. Eighteen cases with severe inflammation, six with candida and two with EOE were detected only at endoscopy, while 18 with candida and significant inflammation, 13 with ulcer slough, one probable EOE and one viral oesophagitis were identified on the Cytosponge only. CONCLUSIONS The Cytosponge detects a range of benign oesophageal pathologies, and therefore has potential clinical utility in the triaging of patients with troublesome reflux symptoms.

Smoking increases the risk of respiratory infections; thus, cessation represents a huge opportunity for public health. However, there is scarce evidence about if and how smoking affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed an observational case-control study, assessing the single-day point prevalence of smoking among 218 COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in 7 Italian non-intensive care wards and in a control group of 243 patients admitted for other conditions to 7 general wards COVID-19-free. We compared proportions for categorical variables by using the 2 test and performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the variables associated with risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. RESULTS: The percentages of current smokers (4.1% vs 16%, p=0.00003) and never smokers (71.6% vs 56.8%, p=0.0014) were significantly different between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients. COVID-19 patients had lower mean age (69.5 vs 74.2 years, p=0.00085) and were more frequently males (59.2% vs 44%, p=0.0011). In the logistic regression analysis, current smokers were significantly less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with non-smokers (Odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.48, p<0.001), even after adjusting for age and gender (OR 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.31, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We reported an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in non-intensive care wards. The meaning of these preliminary findings, which are in line with those currently emerging in literature, is unclear; they need to be confirmed by larger studies. IMPLICATIONS: An unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in some Italian non-intensive care wards is reported. This finding could be a stimulus for the generation of novel hypotheses on individual predisposition and possible strategies for reducing the risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, and needs to be confirmed by further larger studies designed with adequate methodology.","output":"The Paradox of the Low Prevalence of Current Smokers Among Covid-19 Patients Hospitalized in Non-Intensive Care Wards: Results From an Italian Multicenter Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus in the coronavirus family, causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

In order to slow down and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, applying the social vaccine concept should be considered in parallel. From a health promotion perspective, a social vaccine is a process of social and political mobilization driven by governmental and non-governmental organizations aiming at populations by applying interventions such as health communication, education and mass media campaigns as well as determinant-based programs to address environmental factors influencing personal behavior and community capacities to cope with and overcome the societal burdens of COVID-19.

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients have a high IA incidence and risk of rupture. Dysfunction/absence of primary cilia in PKD endothelial cells (ECs) may impair mechano-transduction of WSS and favour vascular disorders. The molecular links between primary cilia dysfunction and IAs are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type and primary cilia-deficient Tg737orpk/orpk arterial ECs were submitted to physiological (30 dynes/cm2) or aneurysmal (2 dynes/cm2) WSS and unbiased transcriptomics were performed. Tg737orpk/orpk ECs displayed a 5-fold increase in the number of WSS-responsive genes compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, we observed a lower trans-endothelial resistance and a higher endothelial permeability, which correlated with disorganized intercellular junctions in Tg737orpk/orpk cells. We identified ZO-1 as a central regulator of primary cilia-dependent endothelial junction integrity. Finally, clinical and histological characteristics of IAs from non-PKD and PKD patients were analysed. IAs in PKD patients were more frequently located in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory than in non-PKD patients. IA domes from the MCA of PKD patients appeared thinner with less collagen and reduced endothelial ZO-1 compared with IA domes from non-PKD patients. CONCLUSION: Primary cilia dampen the endothelial response to aneurysmal low WSS. In absence of primary cilia, ZO-1 expression levels are reduced, which disorganizes intercellular junctions resulting in increased endothelial permeability. This altered endothelial function may not only contribute to the severity of IA disease observed in PKD patients, but may also serve as a potential diagnostic tool to determine the vulnerability of IAs.","output":"Primary cilia control endothelial permeability by regulating expression and location of junction proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B-related compensated liver cirrhosis is related to a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, and antiviral therapy is the preferred method.

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and cardinal demographic and psychosocial factors associated with specific alcohol use patterns among Ugandan university students. Methods: a cross section study conducted over 5-months among university students using a standardized socio-demographic questionnaire screened for alcohol use problems, depression symptoms and academic stress using the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT), self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20) and the higher education stress inventory (HESI) respectively. Multivariate multinomial regression models were used to determine factors independently associated with a specific alcohol use pattern with low-risk drinkers as the reference group. Results: a thousand out of 1200 students completed all study requirements for which 60% were males; median age was 22.3 (SD=2.36). The prevalence estimates of any alcohol use, low-risk drinking, heavy episodic drinking and alcohol misuse were 31%, 17.3%, 4.5% and 8.9% respectively.

The viral spike (S) protein is incorporated into the viral envelope and mediates infectious entry of HCoV-229E into host cells, a process that depends on the activation of the S-protein by host cell proteases. However, the proteases responsible for HCoV-229E activation are incompletely defined. Here we show that the type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT cleave the HCoV-229E S-protein (229E-S) and augment 229E-S-driven cell-cell fusion, suggesting that TMPRSS2 and HAT can activate 229E-S. Indeed, engineered expression of TMPRSS2 and HAT rendered 229E-S-driven virus-cell fusion insensitive to an inhibitor of cathepsin L, a protease previously shown to facilitate HCoV-229E infection. Inhibition of endogenous cathepsin L or TMPRSS2 demonstrated that both proteases can activate 229E-S for entry into cells that are naturally susceptible to infection. In addition, evidence was obtained that activation by TMPRSS2 rescues 229E-S-dependent cell entry from inhibition by IFITM proteins. Finally, immunohistochemistry revealed that TMPRSS2 is coexpressed with CD13, the HCoV-229E receptor, in human airway epithelial (HAE) cells, and that CD13(+) TMPRSS2(+) cells are preferentially targeted by HCoV-229E, suggesting that TMPRSS2 can activate HCoV-229E in infected humans. In sum, our results indicate that HCoV-229E can employ redundant proteolytic pathways to ensure its activation in host cells. In addition, our observations and previous work suggest that diverse human respiratory viruses are activated by TMPRSS2, which may constitute a target for antiviral intervention.","output":"TMPRSS2 activates the human coronavirus 229E for cathepsin-independent host cell entry and is expressed in viral target cells in the respiratory epithelium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION A bloodless surgery can be desirable also for non Jehovah's witnesses patients, but requires a team approach from the very first assessment to ensure adequate planning.

DISCUSSION Before surgery a meticulous coagulopathy research and hemodynamic optimization are useful to prepare patient to operation. During surgery, controlled hypotension can help to obtain effective hemostasis. After surgery, clinicians monitored any possible active bleeding, using continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring, limiting the blood loss due to serial in vitro testing.

Niclosamide (NCS) is an anti-parasitic drug of known antiviral potential. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the antiviral effect and safety of NCS on SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Randomized controlled open label clinical trial encompassed 75 COVID-19 patients treated with standard of care plus NCS were included as experimental group and 75 COVID-19 patients treated with only standard of care therapy as control group. Survival rate, time to recovery, and side effects were the main endpoints for the assessment of the therapeutic effect and safety of NCS. RESULTS: No significant difference between the two study groups in the incidence of death Vs recovery within 30 days of follow up(p = 1).Median survival time to cure in the NCS addon group was significantly less than controls (5 Vs 7days, Log rank p = 0.005).All the recoveries took place within 20 days in the NCS add on group, which is 10 days shorter than that in the controls (30 days), NCS add on treatment increased the risk of cure by 60% per day compared to control group (adjusted HR = 1.6,p = 0,007) after adjusting for the count of comorbidities. Additionally, two or more comorbidities reduced the risk of cure to 33% (p < 0.001).Male gender increased the risk of cure by 42% (p = 0.046). Older age group decreased the risk of recovery per day to 0.58 and 0.53 for 50C59 and 60+ years of age. Hyypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) significantly reduced the risk of being cured per day to 0.56 (p = 0.003)and 0.65 (p = 0.039) respectively. No significant signals of safety in NCS add on therapy compared to control group. CONCLUSION: adding NCS to the standards of care measures increased the risk of the cure and had shorter time to stay in the hospital compared with controls., male gender increased the risk of cure, while older patients>40 years, HT, and DM decreased the risk of cure. Also, NCS add on therapy was relatively safe; hence, NCS is of clinical benefit for freeing hospital beds for more patients in pandemic crisis.","output":"A randomised controlled trial of effectiveness and safety of Niclosamide as add on therapy to the standard of care measures in COVID-19 management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Strassen matrix multiplication can be categorized into divide-and-conquer algorithms, and they are known as the most efficient algorithms.

The development of the COVID-19 epidemic in China could be used as a reference for the other countries' control strategy. Methods: We used a classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to forecast the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in China by nowcasting. The linear regression analyses were employed to predict the COVID-19 epidemic's inflexion point. Finally, we used a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to simulate the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in China throughout 2020. Results: Our nowcasts show that the COVID-19 transmission rate started to slow down on January 30. The linear regression analyses further show that the inflexion point of this epidemic would arrive between February 17 and 18. The final SEIR model simulation forecasted that the COVID-19 epidemic would probably infect about 82,000 people and last throughout 2020 in China. We also applied our method to USA's and global COVID-19 data and the nowcasts show that the development of COVID-19 pandemic is not optimistic in the rest of 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic's scale in China is much smaller than the previous estimations.

We investigated homeostatic control of self-activated T cells within unperturbed tissue environments by combining high-resolution multiplexed and volumetric imaging with computational modeling. In lymph nodes, self-activated T cells produced interleukin (IL)-2, which enhanced local regulatory T cell (Treg) proliferation and inhibitory functionality. The resulting micro-domains reciprocally constrained inputs required for damaging effector responses, including CD28 co-stimulation and IL-2 signaling, constituting a negative feedback circuit. Due to these local constraints, self-activated T cells underwent transient clonal expansion, followed by rapid death (\\"pruning\\"). Computational simulations and experimental manipulations revealed the feedback machinery's quantitative limits: modest reductions in Treg micro-domain density or functionality produced non-linear breakdowns in control, enabling self-activated T cells to subvert pruning.

Methods: We identified patients from the two public hospitals in Vitoria who were admitted to ICU with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. Data reported here were available in March 31th, 2020. Mortality was assessed in those who completed 7-days of ICU stay. Results: We identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [51-75] years. Symptoms began a median of 7 [5-12] days before ICU admission. The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (n = 48%), arterial hypertension (n = 44%) and chronic lung disease (n = 37%). All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 HFNT, 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (49%) required prone position. After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated patients died (13% within one week), 10 (22%) were extubated, and 21/45 (47%) underwent mechanical ventilation. Six patients had documented co-infection.

METHODS: A retrospective study to review and compare clinical data including electronic medical records and laboratory tests from pregnant and nonpregnant patients admitted the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China from December 8, 2019 to April 1, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 72 women (30 pregnant and 42 nonpregnant) with COVID-19 were included. No patients developed severe pneumonia during the study. Compared with the nonpregnant group, pregnant patients were admitted to hospital earlier (0.25 vs 11.00 days; P<0.001), presented milder symptoms, had a higher rate of asymptomatic infection (26.7% vs 0%), and shorter length of hospital stay (14.5 vs 17.0 days; P<0.01). Laboratory test results showed that levels of inflammation markers such as white blood cell count, neutrophil count and percentage, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and D-dimer were significantly higher in pregnant women, whereas mean lymphocyte percentage was significantly lower compared with nonpregnant women. CONCLUSION: In some respects, the clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of COVID-19 in pregnant patients seems to be distinctive from their nonpregnant counterparts.

The risk of ischemic stroke may be higher in patients with COVID-19 infection similar to those with other respiratory tract infections. We present a comprehensive set of practice implications in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. METHODS The practice implications were prepared after review of data to reach the consensus among stroke experts from 18 countries. The writers used systematic literature reviews, reference to previously published stroke guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulate practice implications. All members of the writing group had opportunities to comment in writing on the practice implications and approved the final version of this document. RESULTS This document with consensus is divided into 18 sections. A total of 41 conclusions and practice implications have been developed. The document includes practice implications for evaluation of stroke patients with caution for stroke team members to avoid COVID-19 exposure, during clinical evaluation and performance of imaging and laboratory procedures with special considerations of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS These practice implications with consensus based on the currently available evidence aim to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute ischemic stroke who are suspected of, or confirmed, with COVID-19 infection.

But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state's social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state's own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the \\"loss from anarchy\\" in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers.

First, there is no unique and predetermined long-run equilibrium level of aggregate employment, as the equilibrium is permanently changed by temporary shocks. Second, as the economic system is not self-adjusting, substantial, timely, and sustained expansionary monetary and fiscal policy should be applied to mitigate the impact of shocks, including the temporary ones.

Eurythenes atacamensis sp. nov. is a large species, max. observed length 83.2 mm, possesses diagnostic features, including a short gnathopod 1 palm and a chelate gnathopod 2 palm, and a distinct genetic lineage based on a 16S rRNA and COI phylogeny. This species is a dominant bait-attending fauna with an extensive bathymetric range, spanning from 4974 to 8081 m. The RV Sonne SO261 specimens were recovered along a 10-station transect from abyssal to hadal depths and further examined for demographic and bathymetric-related patterns. Ontogenetic vertical stratification was evident across the trench axis, with only juveniles present at abyssal depths (4974C6025 m). Total length-depth analysis revealed that the size of females was unrelated to depth, whereas juveniles followed a sigmoidal relationship with a step-up in size at depths >7200 m. Thus, these bathymetric trends suggest that juveniles and females employ differing ecological strategies in subduction trench environments.

Title and abstracts were screened according to an eligibility criteria to identify studies which included a full audit cycle (eg, initial equity analysis, service changes and review). Data were extracted from studies meeting the eligibility criteria after full text review and risk of bias assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 596 articles. Fifteen records were reviewed in full text and three records were included in final review. An additional HEA report was identified through contact with an author. Three different HEAs were included from one peer-reviewed journal article, two published reports and one unpublished report (n=4 records on n=3 HEAs). This included 102 851 participants and over 148 practices/pharmacies (information was not recorded for all records). One study reviewed health equity impacts of HEA implementation in key indicators for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Given the high complexity many issues have to be taken into account. Simplification is urgently warranted not to loose focus of the important things to be done. Methods: To look at phase 3 from the endpointin this case hospital admissionshould facilitate the focus on key variables upstream. Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. Results: Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients. Conclusions: System failure has to be averted by clarity in regard to the key parameters and their independent variables. The regional management is crucial and should be coordinated by a so-called bed-coordinator.

However, despite their success, most of the current data-driven solutions lack proper quantifications of model uncertainty that communicate how much to trust the forecasts. Recently, several practical tools to estimate uncertainty have been developed in probabilistic deep learning. However, there have not been empirical applications and extensive comparisons of these tools in the domain of air quality forecasts. Therefore, this work applies state-of-the-art techniques of uncertainty quantification in a real-world setting of air quality forecasts. Through extensive experiments, we describe training probabilistic models and evaluate their predictive uncertainties based on empirical performance, reliability of confidence estimate, and practical applicability. We also propose improving these models using free adversarial training and exploiting temporal and spatial correlation inherent in air quality data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed models perform better than previous works in quantifying uncertainty in data-driven air quality forecasts. Overall, Bayesian neural networks provide a more reliable uncertainty estimate but can be challenging to implement and scale.

This would limit the psychophysical consequences of the lockdown. Furthermore, VIOLA could be effective in maintaining a proper lifestyle, contributing to improve the quality of life of pwMS.VIOLA has the potential of increasing the adherence of pwMS to the rehabilitation confirming that digital communication tools are a valuable solution for those home-bound.].","output":"Managing chronic disease in the COVID-19 pandemic: an e-learning application to promote a healthy lifestyle for persons with multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; dioxin) and related polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs) alter the reproductive development of laboratory animals. Therefore, we exposed animals to a mixture of dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that included TCDD, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (PeCDD), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (1-PeCDF), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (4-PeCDF), octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF), 3,3,4,4-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77), 3,3,4,4,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126), and 3,3,4,4,5,5-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB169). The mixture composition approximated the relative abundance of these compounds in foodstuff (L. S. Birnbaum and M. J. DeVito, 1995, Toxicology Vol. 105, pp. 391C401). Following the work of Gray et al. with TCDD (1997, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology Vol. 146, pp. 11C20), we exposed time-pregnant dams on gestation day (GD) 15 at doses up to 1.0 g TCDD toxic equivalency (TEQ)/kg and the development of offspring was monitored. This mixture significantly increased the time to puberty in both male and female offspring. At postnatal day (PND) 32 seminal vesicle weights were decreased; however, only ventral prostate weight was affected at PND 49 and no effects were seen at PND 63. In female offspring, the mixture caused dose-dependent increases in the incidence of vaginal thread. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was higher than with TCDD the comparable TEQ exposure. Based on the slightly lowered responsiveness to the mixture, we used 2.0 g TEQ/kg to examine reproductive effects. This dose elicited the responses observed with 1.0 g TCDD/kg. Results indicate that the mixture causes a similar spectrum of effects seen with TCDD and the slightly lowered degree of response based on administered dose appears to be due to decreased transfer of mixture components to the offspring. Thus, the use of the WHO consensus TEFs (M. Van den Berg et al., 1998, Environ. Health Perspec. 106, 775C792) reasonably predicts the developmental toxicity of this mixture of dioxin-like PHAHs.","output":"A Mixture of Dioxins, Furans, and Non-ortho PCBs Based upon Consensus Toxic Equivalency Factors Produces Dioxin-Like Reproductive Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lung injury and STAT1 deficit induce EGFR overexpression in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Understanding the level of public attention-a prerequisite for effective communication-implicates expensive and time-consuming surveys. We hypothesise that the relative search volume from Google Trends could be used as an indicator of public attention of a disease and its prevention measures. The search terms 'RKI' (Robert Koch Institute, national public health authority in Germany), 'corona' and 'protective mask' in German language were shortlisted. Cross-correlations between these terms and the reported cases from 15 February to 27 April were conducted for each German federal state. The findings were contrasted against a timeline of official communications concerning COVID-19. The highest correlations of the term 'RKI' with reported COVID-19 cases were found between lags of - 2 and - 12 days, meaning web searches were already performed from 2 to 12 days before case numbers increased. A similar pattern was seen for the term 'corona'. Cross-correlations indicated that most searches on 'protective mask' were performed from 6 to 12 days after the peak of cases. The results for the term 'protective mask' indicate a degree of confusion in the population. This is supported by conflicting recommendations to wear face masks during the first wave.

Our question is: How is ethics-in-action negotiated during critical incidents in the construction of a research space that involves a long-term research relationship with a young child? This article is based on a research project that focused on childrens transitions in early childhood education and care (ECEC). These transitions include the transition from home care to ECEC as well as transitions from child groups or settings to other ECEC groups or settings, and the transition to pre-primary education. We apply a particular lens to the corpus of data, analyzing and reflecting critical incidents vis--vis a negotiation of ethics-in-action during the construction of our research space, which involved a long-term research relationship with a child. Our results show that critical incidents in our studys negotiation of ethics-in-action included (a) the focus childs spontaneous contributions to the studys interviews, (b) interdependencies between the child and diverse researchers, and (c) the childs evolving expertise in data collection, which restructured our studys research space.

While much has been described in the literature about lung infiltrates and respiratory failure associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pneumothorax remains a relatively rare presentation with current literature indicating a rate of one percent. We describe a case series of three patients each of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and presented with pneumothorax. These patients were treated at the New York City Health and Hospitals (NYC H+H) system, a network of eleven hospitals in four different boroughs of New York City. None of these patients had a history of lung disease and one patient was a previous smoker. One out of three patients died. Inflammatory markers were noted to be elevated in each of these patients to levels that have been associated with severe COVID-19 infection. CT scans in these patients showed bilateral air space disease consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumothorax with other features including pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumatoceles. This may indicate the underlying pathogenesis of pneumothorax in these patients to involve inflammation-induced pulmonary parenchymal injury and necrosis with subsequent development of air leaks into the pleural cavity, a mechanism similar to that noted in patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to protect healthcare workers has been a recurrent challenge in terms of global stocks, supply logistics and suitability. In some settings, around 20% of healthcare workers treating COVID-19 cases have become infected, which leads to staff absence at peaks of the pandemic, and in some cases mortality. Methods: To address shortcomings in PPE, we developed a simple powered air purifying respirator, made from inexpensive and widely available components. The prototype was designed to minimize manufacturing complexity so that derivative versions could be developed in low resource settings with minor modification. Results: The Personal Respirator C Southampton (PeRSo) delivers High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtered air from a battery powered fan-filter assembly into a lightweight hood with a clear visor that can be comfortably worn for several hours. Validation testing demonstrates that the prototype removes microbes, avoids excessive CO(2) build-up in normal use, and passes fit test protocols widely used to evaluate standard N95/FFP2 and N99/FFP3 face masks. Feedback from doctors and nurses indicate the PeRSo prototype was preferred to standard FFP2 and FFP3 masks, being more comfortable and reducing the time and risk of recurrently changing PPE. Patients report better communication and reassurance as the entire face is visible. Conclusion: Rapid upscale of production of cheaply produced powered air purifying respirators, designed to achieve regulatory approval in the country of production, could protect healthcare workers from infection and improve healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A Personal Respirator to Improve Protection for Healthcare Workers Treating COVID-19 (PeRSo)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its outbreak in China at the end of 2019, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was characterized by both easy spreading and high mortality.

New diseases emerge annually and place enormous burdens on many countries. Additionally, using humans to handle pandemic situations increases the chances of disease spreading. Therefore, various technologies that do not directly involve humans should be employed to handle pandemic situations. The Internet of Drones (IoDT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain are emerging technologies that have revolutionized the modern world. This article presents a blockchain-based AI-empowered pandemic situation supervision scheme in which a swarm of drones embedded with AI is engaged to autonomously monitor pandemic outbreaks, thereby keeping human involvement as low as possible. A use case based on a recent pandemic (i.e., COVID-19) is discussed. Two types of drone swarms are used to handle multiple tasks (e.g., checking face masks and imposing lockdowns). A lightweight blockchain is considered to handle situations in remote areas with poor network connectivity. Additionally, a two-phase lightweight security mechanism is adopted to validate the entities in the proposed scheme. A proof of concept is established using an experimental environment setup and dataset training. An analysis of the experimental results demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

Home-based options have been proposed and were found noninferior to center-based rehabilitation; however, there is a lack of home-based programs, and more understanding is needed. We aimed to test the feasibility, uptake, and adherence to a home-based program for COPD rehabilitation with health coaching. METHODS We conducted a randomized trial with a wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program. The 8-week intervention consisted of video-guided exercises to be done 6 times a week and captured with a computer tablet. Health coaching was done weekly over the telephone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to define their weekly goals. The primary outcomes were uptake, adherence, and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnea Domain. Secondary outcomes were self-management abilities and CRQ Emotions-Mastery-Fatigue. RESULTS 154 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were randomized. Subject adherence was 86% to the proposed 6-times a week exercise routine. There (P = .062) was no significant difference in breathlessness (CRQ dyspnea). There was a significant improvement in self-management abilities (P < .001). The results of the qualitative interviews showed high levels of acceptability of the program. CONCLUSIONS The tested home-based rehabilitation program with health coaching was feasible, highly acceptable, showed a high degree of adherence, and improved self-management abilities.

The aim was to provide professionals the opportunity to challenge and reflect upon their own practices by introducing them to a trauma-informed and restorative practice based on the importance of building emotional safety and connection. The findings suggest that given time and space for reflection in a setting characterized by equality and safety, professionals can develop increased (a) self-awareness and compassion, (b) emotional safety and tolerance of stress in challenging communication, (c) trauma understanding, and (d) personal growth.

Interestingly, the genetic diversity was mainly caused by extensive genomic insertions and/or deletions (indels) instead of the point mutations. Further analyses showed that the indels may be attributed much to the homologous recombination, as supported by significant associations between the occurrence of extensive recombination events and the indels in the ASFV genomes. Besides, the homologous recombination also led to changes of gene content of ASFVs. Finally, repeated elements of dozens of nucleotides in length were observed to widely distribute and cluster in the adjacent positions of ASFV genomes, which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination. This work highlighted the importance of homologous recombination in shaping the genetic diversity of the ASFVs, and could help understand the evolution of the virus.","output":"Homologous recombination shapes the genetic diversity of African swine fever viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives This study explored the factors influencing health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China. The impact of perceived stress and positive perception of interventions on health behaviours in China were assessed using the extended information-motivation-behaviour skills (IMB) model. Study design Cross-sectional survey. Methods The Questionstar online survey tool was used to construct a structured questionnaire based on the IMB model. Between 14 and 22 February 2020, during the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in China, 2449 participants were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and Tencent QQ social media platforms in China. Data were collected through an online questionnaire and structural equation modelling was performed to evaluate the extended IMB model. Results Health behaviours were assessed using a scoring system (total score range 8C40); the average health behaviour score in this study was 34.62  4.44. The term health risk stress refers to the impact that perceived stress has on health and this was experienced by 39.9% of participants. Only 35.9% of participants answered all 7 questions on COVID-19 information correctly. The final model showed that information, motivation, behavioural skills, heath risk stress and positive perception of interventions had significant direct effects on health behaviours. Health behaviours were positively associated with the positive perception of interventions, but negatively associated with health risk stress. Behavioural skills had the greatest impact on health behaviours. Conclusions In the face of public health emergencies, the extended IMB model has been used as a theoretical framework to construct more effective interventions. The government should pay attention to publicity and guidance, strengthen positive interactions with the public and disclose relevant information in a timely manner to gain trust and to maintain the positive public perception of the interventions. In terms of health education, the government should focus on behavioural skills, promptly rectify ineffective prevention information and raise awareness about the disease in order to relieve stress and anxiety in the population.","output":"Factors Influencing Health Behaviours during the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: an Extended IMB Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-coronavirus-2 enters host cells through binding of the Spike protein to ACE2 receptor and subsequent S priming by the TMPRSS2 protease. We aim to assess differences in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in normal tissues from oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and lung tissues as well as neoplastic tissues from the same areas. METHODS: The study has been conducted using the TCGA and the Regina Elena Institute databases and validated by experimental model in HNSCC cells. We also included data from one COVID19 patient who went under surgery for HNSCC. RESULTS: TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues. It was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors, in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we modeled the multivariate effect of TP53, HPV, and other inherent variables on TMPRSS2. All variables had a statistically significant independent effect on TMPRSS2. In particular, in tumor tissues, HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes were associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. The further analysis of both TCGA and our institutional HNSCC datasets identified a signature anti-correlated to TMPRSS2. As proof-of-principle we also validated the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient tissues Finally, we did not find TMPRSS2 promoter methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. These observations may help to better assess the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.","output":"TMPRSS2, a SARS-CoV-2 internalization protease is downregulated in head and neck cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the second case of severe postvaccinial encephalitis with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis since smallpox vaccination was reintroduced in 2002.

In this case, several detection methods have been established based on nucleic acid diagnostic techniques and immunoassays to achieve sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, most methods are still largely dependent on professional instruments, highly trained operators, and centralized laboratories. These limitations gravely diminish their practicality and portability. Herein, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cas12a based assay was developed for portable, rapid and sensitive of SARS-CoV-2. In this assay, samples were quickly pretreated and amplified by reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification under mild conditions. Then, by combining the CRISPR Cas12a system and a glucose-producing reaction, the signal of the virus was converted to that of glucose, which can be quantitatively read by a personal glucose meter in a few seconds. Nucleocapsid protein gene was tested as a model target, and the sensitivity for quantitative detection was as low as 10 copies/l, which basically meet the needs of clinical diagnosis. In addition, with the advantages of lower material cost, shorter detection time, and no requirement for professional instrument in comparison with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, this assay is expected to provide a powerful technical support for the early diagnosis and intervention during epidemic prevention and control.","output":"A CRISPR-Cas12a-derived biosensor enabling portable personal glucose meter readout for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) model is widely used in epidemiology to mathematically model the spread of infectious diseases with incubation periods.

Vasohibin-1 (VASH-1) is an angiogenesis inhibitor, while vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is one of the main factors promoting vascular formation. The subject of this study was to assess serum concentration of these factors in patients with diagnosed NEN and in control group. Methods. The study group consisted of 120 patients with diagnosed NENs, while the control group consisted of 69 healthy volunteers. The concentrations of VASH-1 and VEGF-A in serum were tested using the ELISA. We also analyzed the association of the concentration of these factors with demographic data (e.g., age and gender), body mass index (BMI), primary tumor location, histological grade, metastasis, clinical staging, selected biochemical parameters and markers of NENs, and information on smoking habits. Results. The mean concentration of VASH-1 was 218.8  359.8 pg/ml in the study group and 973.1  1239.4 pg/ml in the control group, that difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the NEN group, the highest concentration of VASH-1 was in patients with pancreatic NENs in relation to NENs with different location of the primary tumor (p < 0.05). Negative correlation was found between the concentration of VASH-1 and serotonin (r S = -0.19, p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed for VEGF-A (p = 0.658). Conclusions. Patients with NENs showed lower serum level of VASH-1 in comparison to healthy volunteers. The highest level of VASH-1 was observed in tumors localized in pancreas. This might reflect the relevant function of VASH-1 in NENs and requires further evaluation to further knowledge of angiogenesis in NENs. Furthermore, the serum concentration of VEGF-A showed no statistical differences and probably does not have diagnostic value in this group of patients.","output":"Assessment of the Concentration of Endogenous Factors Regulating Angiogenesis, VASH-1 and VEGF-A, in the Blood Serum of Patients with Neuroendocrine Neoplasms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to explore the experiences of mothers and efforts in implementing home education for children with autism, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.

OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to identify, track, and monitor trends in the population in Saudi Arabia at risk of major depressive disorders and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study utilizes continuous, cross-sectional, national-level mental health screening via computer-assisted phone interviews, conducted in four waves on a monthly basis (between May and August 2020). Arabic-speaking adults, aged &#8805;18 years, and living in Saudi Arabia were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4056 participants per wave was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to measure anxiety. In addition, it will collect data on sociodemographic variables and potential risk factors. RESULTS: Study recruitment began in May 2020. The data analysis was completed in October 2020, and the final report is expected to be published by the end of December 2020.

The answer to the latter question is a complete endocrine evaluation of both cortical (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids) and medullary (catecholamines) secretion.Expert opinion:A multidisciplinary discussion is suggested for patients with adrenal disease, after the exclusion of nonfunctioning benign cortical adenoma, in order to plan a close and tailored follow-up for the suspected malignant or functioning forms.

Recreational noise pollution, especially unpredictable and intermittent sounds, and its effects on wildlife and biodiversity have been poorly studied. Researchers have paid very little attention to the effect of noisy traditional festivals (fireworks and powder-guns). This study aimed to explore the effect of these recreational activities on the juvenile productivity of an urban avian bioindicator: the house sparrow. We studied five pairs of localities in the Valencia Region (E Spain) with noisy traditional festivals. Each pair was composed of one locality with festivals during the breeding season and the closest similar locality, but with festivals outside the reproductive period (controls). Both locality types were sampled twice each spring (May-June of 2019 and 2020). Sampling dates were selected as 15 and 30 days after noisy festivals ended, while the control localities were sampled 1 day after the census of their correspondent town pair with noisy breeding season festivals. The ratio of the juveniles/adults detected during surveys in the influence area of festivals (100-m buffer around the parades route) was used as a house sparrow breeding success proxy. Data were analysed using GLMM: year (2019/2020), festivals season (breeding/non-breeding), survey (15/30 days), and their interactions were included as fixed factors. Pair of localities and locality nested within the pair were random factors. In 2019, juvenile productivity was lower in the towns with noisy traditional festivals during the breeding season than in the control towns. The 2020 festivals were cancelled due to COVID-19.

This article aims at researchers, clinicians of family medicine, general practice and policy-makers worldwide. The implications for the clinical practice of primary health care are discussed. Current research is an effort to explore new directions in epidemiology and health services delivery. METHODS: Projections consisted of machine learning, dynamic modelling algorithms and whole simulations. Input data consisted of global indicators of infectious diseases. Four simulations were run for 20% versus 60% flu-vaccinated populations and 10 versus 20 personal contacts. Outputs consisted of numerical values and mathematical graphs. Outputs consisted of numbers for never infected, vaccinated, infected/recovered, symptomatic/asymptomatic and deceased individuals. Peaks, percentages, R(0), durations are reported. RESULTS: The best-case scenario was one with a higher flu-vaccination rate and fewer contacts. The reverse generated the worst outcomes, likely to disrupt the provision of vital community services. Both measures were proven effective; however, results demonstrated that increasing flu-vaccination rates is a more powerful strategy than limiting social contacts.

RESULTS Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a quick detection of the disease in either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. In literature, there are numerous studies that underline the importance of CT as the first-step diagnostic tool in COVID-19 diagnosis. Even in asymptomatic patients, COVID-19 pneumonia may manifest with chest CT imaging abnormalities. CONCLUSION There is a need for an algorithm, which involves a combination of PCR and CT in diagnosis of COVID-19 (Ref. 85).","output":"Challenges in COVID-19 diagnosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pre-existing immune responses towards adenoviral vector limit the use of a vector based on particular serotypes and its clinical applicability for gene therapy and/or vaccination. Therefore, there is a significant interest to vectorize novel adenoviral types that have low seroprevalence in the human population. Here, we describe the discovery and vectorization of a chimeric human adenovirus, which we call HAdV-20-42-42. Full genome sequencing revealed that this virus is closely related to human serotype 42, except for the penton-base which is derived from serotype 20. The HAdV-20-42-42 vector could be propagated stably to high titers on existing E1-complementing packaging cell lines. Receptor binding studies revealed that the vector utilized both CAR and CD46 as receptors for cell entry. Furthermore, the HAdV-20-42-42 vector was potent in transducing human and murine cardiovascular cells and tissues, irrespective of the presence of blood coagulation factor X. In addition, the vector did not sequester in the liver upon intravenous administration in rodents. Finally, we demonstrate that potent T-cell responses against vector-delivered antigens could be induced upon vaccination. In summary, from the data obtained we conclude that HAdV-20-42-42 provides a valuable addition to the portfolio of adenoviral vectors available to develop safe and efficacious products in the fields of gene therapy and vaccination. IMPORTANCE Adenoviral vectors are currently under investigation for a broad range of therapeutic indications in diverse fields, such as oncology and gene therapy, as well as for vaccination both for human and veterinary use. A wealth of data shows that pre-existing immune responses may limit the use of a vector. Particularly in the current climate of global pandemic, there is a need to expand the toolbox with novel adenoviral vectors for vaccine development. Our data demonstrates that we have successfully vectorized a novel adenovirus serotype with low seroprevalence. The cell transduction data and antigen-specific immune responses induced in vivo demonstrate that this vector is highly promising for the development of gene therapy and vaccine products.","output":"Human AdV-20-42-42, a promising novel adenoviral vector for gene therapy and vaccine product development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic brought significant disruption to in-hospital medical training. Virtual reality simulating the clinical environment has the potential to overcome this issue and can be particularly useful to supplement the traditional in-hospital medical training during the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital access is banned for medical students. The aim of this study was to assess medical students perception on fully online training including simulated clinical scenarios during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From May to July 2020 when in-hospital training was not possible, 122 students attending the sixth year of the course of Medicine and Surgery underwent online training sessions including an online platform with simulated clinical scenarios (Body Interact?) of 21 patient-based cases. Each session focused on one case, lasted 2 h and was divided into three different parts: introduction, virtual patient-based training, and debriefing. In the same period, adjunctive online training with formal presentation and discussion of clinical cases was also given. At the completion of training, a survey was performed, and students filled in a 12-item anonymous questionnaire on a voluntary basis to rate the training quality. Results were reported as percentages or with numeric ratings from 1 to 4. Due to the study design, no sample size was calculated. RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen students (94%) completed the questionnaire: 104 (90%) gave positive evaluation to virtual reality training and 107 (93%) appreciated the format in which online training was structured. The majority of participants considered the platform of virtual reality training realistic for the initial clinical assessment (77%), diagnostic activity (94%), and treatment options (81%). Furthermore, 97 (84%) considered the future use of this virtual reality training useful in addition to the apprenticeship at patients bedside. Finally, 32 (28%) participants found the online access difficult due to technical issues. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, online medical training including simulated clinical scenarios avoided training interruption and the majority of participant students gave a positive response on the perceived quality of this training modality. During this time frame, a non-negligible proportion of students experienced difficulties in online access to this virtual reality platform.","output":"Pre-graduation medical training including virtual reality during COVID-19 pandemic: a report on students perception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lymphatic malformation (LM) that causes inguinoscrotal swelling is extremely rare.

In clinical practice, there is a need for improved plasma biomarker-based tools for VTE diagnosis and risk prediction. We used multiplex proteomics profiling to screen plasma from patients with suspected acute VTE, and a case-control study of patients followed up after ending anticoagulant treatment for a first VTE. With replication in 5 independent studies, together totalling 1137 patients and 1272 controls, we identify Complement Factor H Related Protein (CFHR5), a regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation, as a novel VTE associated plasma biomarker. Using GWAS analysis of 2967 individuals we identified a genome-wide significant pQTL signal on chr1q31.3 associated with CFHR5 levels. We showed that higher CFHR5 levels are associated with increased thrombin generation in patient plasma and that recombinant CFHR5 enhances platelet activation in vitro. Thrombotic complications are a frequent feature of COVID-19; in hospitalised patients we found CFHR5 levels at baseline were associated with short-time prognosis of disease severity, defined as maximum level of respiratory support needed during hospital stay. Our results indicate a clinically important role for regulation of the alternative pathway of complement activation in the pathogenesis of VTE and pulmonary complications in acute COVID-19.

For the first time, we reconstruct the epidemic trajectory across the country and assess the level of under-reporting in infections and deaths using province-level age-stratified weekly all-cause mortality data. Our estimates suggest that as of 2021-09-17, only 48% (95% confidence interval 43-55%) of COVID-19 deaths in Iran have been reported. We find that in the most affected provinces such as Qazvin, Qom, and East Azerbaijan approximately 0.4% of the population have died of COVID-19 so far. We also find significant heterogeneity in the estimated attack rates across the country with 11 provinces reaching close to or higher than 100% attack rates. Despite a relatively young age structure in Iran, our analysis reveals that the infection fatality rate gradually increased over time in several provinces and reached levels that are comparable some of the high-income countries with a larger percentage of older adults, suggesting that limited access to medical services, coupled with undercounting of COVID-19-related deaths, can have a significant impact on COVID-19 fatalities.

Its genome encodes a polyprotein that can be further processed into structural and non-structural proteins. ZIKV protease is an important target for antiviral development due to its role in cleaving the polyprotein to release functional viral proteins. The viral protease is a two-component protein complex formed by NS2B and NS3. Structural studies using different approaches demonstrate that conformational changes exist in the protease. The structures and dynamics of this protease in the absence and presence of inhibitors were explored to provide insights into the inhibitor design. The dynamic nature of residues binding to the enzyme cleavage site might be important for the function of the protease. Due to the charges at the protease cleavage site, it is challenging to develop small-molecule compounds acting as substrate competitors. Developing small-molecule compounds to inhibit protease activity through an allosteric mechanism is a feasible strategy because conformational changes are observed in the protease. Herein, structures and dynamics of ZIKV protease are summarized. The conformational changes of ZIKV protease and other proteases in the same family are discussed. The progress in developing allosteric inhibitors is also described.

Since cognitive deficits are common in this population, we investigated how cognition influenced their understanding of the pandemic, socio-behavioral responses and lifestyle adaptations during lockdown, and how these factors affected their mood or memory. METHOD: Telephone-based survey involving 204 older adults &#8805;65 y/o (median: 82) with previous assessments of cognitive state: 164 normal-old (NOLD), 24 mild-neurocognitive disorder (mild-NCD), 18 mild-moderate dementia. A structured questionnaire was developed to assess psychological and socio-behavioral variables. Logistic regression was used to ascertain their effects on mood and memory. RESULTS: With increasing cognitive deficits, understanding of the pandemic and the ability to follow lockdown policies, adapt to lifestyle changes, and maintain remote interactions decreased. Participants with dementia were more depressed; NOLDs remained physically and mentally active but were more bored and anxious. Sleeping and health problems independently increased the likelihood of depression (OR: 2.29; CI: 1.06-4.93; p = 0.034 and OR: 2.45; CI: 1.16-5.16; p = 0.018, respectively); Regular exercise was protective (OR: 0.30; CI: 0.12-0.72; p = 0.007). Worsening subjective memory complaints were associated with dementia (p = 0.006) and depression (p = 0.004); New-onset sleeping problems raised their odds (OR: 10.26; CI: 1.13-93.41; p = 0.039). Finally, >40% with health problems avoided healthcare mainly due to fear of contagion. DISCUSSION: NOLD and mild-NCD groups showed similar mood-behavioral profiles suggesting better tolerance of lockdown. Those with dementia were unable to adapt and suffered from depression and cognitive complaints.

The global incidence of asthma is rising. Clinical and experimental models of asthma clearly indicate that the disease is multifactorial in nature with a wide array of factors contributing to progression and exacerbation, including interactions between immunological markers and the microbial community populating the respiratory tract. In particular, strict hygiene compliance during the early years of life and early exposure to antibiotics are linked to alterations in the biological environment within the airways and to changes in immunological markers, leading to allergies, such as asthma. With the gap in current research knowledge on the various non-bacterial microbial communities in the asthmatic airways, this review summarizes current methods used to assess microbial diversity as well as evidence for the link between microbial alterations and asthma, including changes in the bacterial microbiome, often characterized by the outgrowth of certain bacterial phyla such as proteobacteria and Firmicutes, in addition to disrupted mycobiome, virome, and parasitome. The current review emphasizes the dynamic, context-dependent changes in the microbiome in asthma and the importance of broad-scope analyses, covering a wide range of taxa.

Remote COVID-19 monitoring platforms emerged as potential solutions. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity and contribution of two different platforms used to remotely monitor patients with COVID-19 to maintain quality, safety, and patient engagement in care, as well as their acceptability, usefulness, and user-friendliness from the user's perspective. The first platform is focused on telecare phone calls (Telecare-Covid), and the second is a telemonitoring app (CareSimple-Covid). Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study. The data were collected through a phone survey from May to August 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and t-test analysis. Participants' responses and comments on open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis to identify certain issues and challenges and potential avenues for improving the platforms. Results: Fifty one patients participated in the study. Eighteen participants used the CareSimple-Covid platform and 33 participants used the Telecare-Covid platform. Overall, the satisfaction rate for quality and safety of care for the two platforms was 80%. Over 88% of the users on each platform considered the platforms' services to be engaging, useful, user-friendly, and appropriate to their needs. The survey identified a few significant differences in users' perceptions of each platform: empathy toward users and the quality and safety of the care received were rated significantly higher on the CareSimple-Covid platform than on the Telecare-Covid platform. Users appreciated four aspects of these telehealth approaches: (1) the ease of access to services and the availability of care team members; (2) the user-friendliness of the platforms; (3) the continuity of care provided, and (4) the wide range of services delivered. Users identified some technical limitations and raised certain issues, such as the importance of maintaining human contact, data security, and confidentiality. Improvement suggestions include promoting access to connected devices; enhancing communications between institutions, healthcare users, and the public on confidentiality and personal data protection standards; and integrating a participatory approach to telehealth platform development and deployment efforts. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that the two remote monitoring platforms are well-received by users, with very few significant differences between them concerning users' experiences and views. This type of program could be considered for use in a post-pandemic era and for other post-hospitalization clienteles.

Data were stratified by geography to compare the declining western Alaskan population in the Aleutian Islands through eastern Prince William Sound to the increasing population in southeastern Alaska. Prevalences of antibodies from the 1970s to the early 1990s were noted for Leptospira interrogans, Chlamydophila psittaci, Brucella spp., phocid herpesvirus-1, and calciviruses. Serum samples collected from 1997-2000 were tested for antibodies to these agents as well as to marine mammal morbilliviruses, canine parvovirus, and canine adenovirus-1 and -2. Conclusions could not be drawn about changes in antibody prevalence to these agents during the decline of Steller sea lions, however, because data were incomplete or not comparable as a result of inconsistencies in testing techniques. Despite these shortcomings, results provided no convincing evidence of significant exposure of Steller sea lions to morbilliviruses, Brucella spp., canine parvovirus, or L. interrogans. Steller sea lions have been exposed to phocid herpesviruses, caliciviruses, canine adenovirus, and C. psittaci or to cross-reactive organisms in regions of both increasing and decreasing sea lion abundance. Based on similar antibody prevalence estimates from the increasing and decreasing populations, these agents are unlikely to have been the primary cause of the population decline. They may have contributed to the decline or impeded population recovery, however, because of undetected mortality and morbidity or reductions of fecundity and body condition in animals under other stresses. Systematic monitoring for disease agents and their effects is needed to determine whether infectious disease currently plays a role in the decline and lack of recovery of Steller sea lions.","output":"Infectious disease and the decline of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska, USA: insights from serologic data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Radiomics has been widely used in quantitative analysis of medical images for disease diagnosis and prognosis assessment. The objective of this study is to test a machine-learning (ML) method based on radiomics features extracted from chest CT images for screening COVID-19 cases. METHODS The study is carried out on two groups of patients, including 138 patients with confirmed and 140 patients with suspected COVID-19. We focus on distinguishing pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases by segmentation of whole lung volume and extraction of 86 radiomics features. Followed by feature extraction, nine feature-selection procedures are used to identify valuable features. Then, ten ML classifiers are applied to classify and predict COVID-19 cases. Each ML models is trained and tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The predictive performance of each ML model is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. RESULTS The range of accuracy and AUC is from 0.32 (recursive feature elimination [RFE]+Multinomial Naive Bayes [MNB] classifier) to 0.984 (RFE+bagging [BAG], RFE+decision tree [DT] classifiers) and 0.27 (mutual information [MI]+MNB classifier) to 0.997 (RFE+k-nearest neighborhood [KNN] classifier), respectively. There is no direct correlation among the number of the selected features, accuracy, and AUC, however, with changes in the number of the selected features, the accuracy and AUC values will change. Feature selection procedure RFE+BAG classifier and RFE+DT classifier achieve the highest prediction accuracy (accuracy: 0.984), followed by MI+Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and logistic regression (LGR)+DT classifiers (accuracy: 0.976). RFE+KNN classifier as a feature selection procedure achieve the highest AUC (AUC: 0.997), followed by RFE+BAG classifier (AUC: 0.991) and RFE+gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) classifier (AUC: 0.99). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the ML model based on RFE+KNN classifier achieves the highest performance to differentiate patients with a confirmed infection caused by COVID-19 from the

Given variable levels of virus in the population through public health interventions, proper concentration and extraction of viral RNA is a key step in ensuring accurate detections. With many commercial RNA extraction kits and methodologies available, the performance of 4 different kits were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater, specifically focusing on their applicability to lower population densities such as those at university campus dorms. Raw wastewater samples were collected at 4 sites on a college campus over a 24 hour period as a composite sample. Included in these sites was an isolation site that housed students that tested positive for Covid-19 via nasopharyngeal swabs. These samples were analyzed using the following kits: Qiagen All Prep PowerViral DNA/RNA kit, New England BioLabs Monarch RNA MiniPrep Kit, and Zymo Quick RNA-Viral Kit, and the Zymo Quick-RNA Fecal/Soil Microbe MicroPrep Kit. All four sites were processed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Extractions were then quantified with RT-qPCR one-step reactions using an N2 primer and a linearized plasmid standard. While the Zymo Quick-RNA Fecal/Soil Microbe MicroPrep Kit (also known as the Zymo Environ Water RNA Kit) only recovered approximately 73% (38%) SARS-CoV-2 RNA compared to the Zymo Quick-RNA Viral kit, it was the most time efficient kit to yield comparable results. This extraction kit had a cumulative processing time of approximately 5 h compared, while the other three kits had processing times between approximately 9 and 9.5 h.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three merged data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient laboratory testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 18-65 with continuous enrollment in the health plan from January 2019 to the date of a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three comparator groups, matched by propensity score, to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, an historical 2019 comparator group, and an historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: More than 50 clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined as the date of first SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (index date) plus 21 days) were identified using ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes. Excess risk in the four months after acute infection and hazard ratios with Bonferroni corrected 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: 14% of adults aged &#8804;65 who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (27 074 of 193 113) had at least one new type of clinical sequelae that required medical care after the acute phase of the illness, which was 4.95% higher than in the 2020 comparator group. The risk for specific new sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection after the acute phase, including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety, and fatigue, was significantly greater than in the three comparator groups (2020, 2019, and viral lower respiratory tract illness groups) (all P<0.001). Significant risk differences because of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people (all P<0.001), and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 compared with the 2020 comparator group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the excess risk of developing new clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen in other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were admitted to hospital because of covid-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults (aged &#8804;50), those with no pre-existing conditions, or those not admitted to hospital for covid-19 also had an increased risk of developing new clinical sequelae.

The treatment of critically ill patients is a challenging task, without identified credible predictors of mortality. METHODS: We performed an analysis of 160 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit between June 23, 2020, and October 2, 2020, in University Hospital Center Bezanijska kosa, Belgrade, Serbia. Patients on invasive, noninvasive ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy with moderate to severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition of ARDS, were selected for the study. Demographic data, past medical history, laboratory values, and CT severity score were analyzed to identify predictors of mortality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess potential predictors of mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 65.6 years (range, 29C92 years), predominantly men, 68.8%. 107 (66.9%) patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 31 (19.3%) on noninvasive, and 22 (13.8%) on high flow oxygen therapy machine. The median total number of ICU days was 10 (25(th) to 75(th) percentile: 6C18), while the median total number of hospital stay was 18 (25(th) to 75(th) percentile: 12C28). The mortality rate was 60% (96/160). Univariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the significance of age, CRP, and lymphocytes at admission to hospital, serum albumin, D-dimer, and IL-6 at admission to ICU, and CT score. Serum albumin, D-dimer, and IL-6 at admission to ICU were independently associated with mortality in the final multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In the present study of 160 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS, IL-6, serum albumin, and D-dimer at admission to ICU, accompanied by chest CT severity score, were marked as independent predictors of mortality.","output":"Predictors of Mortality in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients Demanding High Oxygen Flow: A Thin Line between Inflammation, Cytokine Storm, and Coagulopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), targeting tumor antigens, or immune checkpoints, have demonstrated a remarkable anti-tumor effect against various malignancies. However, high costs for mono- or combination therapies, associated with adverse effects or possible development of resistance in some patients, warrant further development and modification to gain more flexibility for this immunotherapy approach. An attractive alternative to passive immunization with therapeutic antibodies might be active immunization with mimotopes (B-cell peptides) representing the mAbs' binding epitopes, to activate the patient's own anti-tumor immune response following immunization. Here, we identified and examined the feasibility of inducing anti-tumor effects in vivo following active immunization with a mimotope of the immune checkpoint programmed cell death 1 (PD1), alone or in combination with a Her-2/neu B-cell peptide vaccine. Overlapping peptides spanning the extracellular domains of human PD1 (hPD1) were used to identify hPD1-derived mimotopes, using the therapeutic mAb Nivolumab as a proof of concept. Additionally, for in vivo evaluation in a tumor mouse model, a mouse PD1 (mPD1)-derived mimotope was identified using an anti-mPD1 mAb with mPD1/mPDL-1 blocking capacity. The identified mimotopes were characterized by in vitro assays, including a reporter cell-based assay, and their anti-tumor effects were evaluated in a syngeneic tumor mouse model stably expressing human Her-2/neu. The identified PD1-derived mimotopes were shown to significantly block the mAbs' capacity in inhibiting the respective PD1/PD-L1 interactions. A significant reduction in tumor growth in vivo was observed following active immunization with the mPD1-derived mimotope, associated with a significant reduction in proliferation and increased apoptotic rates in the tumors. Particularly, combined vaccination with the mPD1-derived mimotope and a multiple B-cell epitope Her-2/neu vaccine potentiated the vaccine's anti-tumor effect. Our results suggest active immunization with mimotopes of immune checkpoint inhibitors either as monotherapy or as combination therapy with tumor-specific vaccines, as a new strategy for cancer treatment.","output":"A New Strategy Toward B Cell-Based Cancer Vaccines by Active Immunization With Mimotopes of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is a common cancer with high morbidity and mortality in renal cancer. Thus, the transcriptome data of KIRC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed and drug candidates for the treatment of KIRC were explored through the connectivity map (CMap) database. METHODS The transcriptome data of KIRC patients were downloaded from TCGA database, and KIRC-associated hub genes were screened out through differential analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Afterward, the CMap database was used to select drug candidates for KIRC treatment, and the drug-targeted genes were obtained through the STITCH database. A PPI network was constructed by combining drug-targeted genes with hub genes that affected the pathogenesis of KIRC to obtain final hub genes. Finally, combining hub genes and KIRC-associated hub genes, the pathways affected by drugs were explored by pathway enrichment analysis. RESULTS A total of 2,312 differentially expressed genes were found in patients, which were concentrated in immune cell activity, cytokine, and chemokine secretion pathways. Drug screening disclosed 5 drug candidates for KIRC treatment: fedratinib, Ly344864, geldanamycin, AS-605240, and luminespib. Based on drug-targeted genes and KIRC-associated hub genes, 16 hub genes were screened out.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses to IBV infection is a crucial element for further improvements in strategies to control IB. To this end, two chicken lines, selected for high (L10H line) and low (L10L line) serum concentration of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) were studied. In total, 32 birds from each line were used. Sixteen birds from each line were infected with IBV and sixteen were left uninfected. Eight uninfected and infected birds from each line were euthanized at 1 and 3 weeks post infection. RNA sequencing was performed on spleen samples from all 64 birds and differential gene expression analysis was performed for four comparisons: L10L line versus L10H line for uninfected birds at weeks 1 and 3, respectively, and in the same way for infected birds. Functional analysis was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) Immune System Process terms specific for Gallus gallus. RESULTS: Comparing uninfected L10H and L10L birds, we identified 1698 and 1424 differentially expressed (DE) genes at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. For the IBV-infected birds, 1934 and 866 DE genes were identified between the two lines at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. The two most enriched GO terms emerging from the comparison of uninfected birds between the two lines were Lymphocyte activation involved in immune response and Somatic recombination of immunoglobulin genes involved in immune response at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. When comparing IBV-infected birds between the two lines, the most enriched GO terms were Alpha-beta T cell activation and Positive regulation of leukocyte activation at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy birds from the two lines showed significant differences in expression profiles for subsets of adaptive and innate immunity-related genes, whereas comparison of the IBV-infected birds from the two lines showed differences in expression of immunity-related genes involved in T cell activation and proliferation. The observed transcriptome differences between the two lines indicate that selection for MBL had influenced innate as well as adaptive immunity.

Since the Zika epidemic and the increased co-circulation of other arboviruses, the serology-based diagnosis of dengue has become more problematic due to the high antigenic resemblance, especially among the flavivirus family. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the diversity, specificity and temporal evolution of the antibody response following dengue infection is needed. In order to close this knowledge gap, we used a high-density peptide microarray of 9,072 linear peptides covering the entire proteome diversity of dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses. The IgM and IgG antibody responses were measured against the designed microarray in symptomatic dengue infected individuals from an arbovirus endemic area in Peru and in overseas travelers returning to Belgium, as representatives of multiple-exposed and primary infections, respectively. Serum samples were collected longitudinally across four time points over the period of six months in Peru and over two time points in travelers. We show that epitopes eliciting the strongest flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies, in both primary and secondary infections were concentrated in the capsid, E, NS1, NS3 and NS5 proteins. The IgG antibody responses against NS1 and NS3 followed a rise-and-fall pattern, with peak titers between two to four weeks after onset of illness. The response to the E and NS5 proteins increased rapidly in the acute phase and was maintained at stable levels until at least 6 months after illness. A more scattered IgM antibody reactivity across the viral proteome was observed in the acute phase of the disease and that persisted through the 6-month window. The magnitude, breadth (i.e. number of unique epitopes targeted) and depth (i.e. number of epitope variants recognized) of the IgG response was higher in secondary infections compared to primary infections. For IgM antibodies, the magnitude of the response was higher in primary infected individuals whereas the breadth and depth of the response was lower in this group compared with the endemic subjects. Finally, through this arboviral proteome-wide epitope mapping, we were able to identify IgM and IgG dengue-specific epitopes which can be useful serological markers for dengue diagnosis and serostatus determination.","output":"Dynamics of the Magnitude, Breadth and Depth of the Antibody Response at Epitope Level Following Dengue Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced health-care providers to find creative ways to allow continuity of care in times of lockdown. Telemedicine enables provision of care when in-person visits are not possible. Sheba Medical Center made a rapid transition of outpatient clinics to video consultations (VC) during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel. OBJECTIVE: Results of a survey of patient and clinician user experience with VC are reported. METHODS: Satisfaction surveys were sent by text messages to patients, clinicians who practice VC (users) and clinicians who do not practice VC (non-users). Questions referred to general satisfaction, ease of use, technical issues and medical and communication quality. Questions and scales were based on surveys used regularly in outpatient clinics of Sheba Medical Center. RESULTS: More than 1200 clinicians (physicians, psychologists, nurses, social workers, dietitians, speech therapists, genetic consultants and others) provided VC during the study period. Five hundred and forty patients, 162 clinicians who were users and 50 clinicians who were non-users completed the survey. High level of satisfaction was reported by 89.8% of patients and 37.7% of clinician users. Technical problems were experienced by 21% of patients and 80% of clinician users. Almost 70% of patients but only 23.5% of clinicians found the platform very simple to use. Over 90% of patients were very satisfied with clinicians courtesy, expressed a high sense of trust, thought that clinicians explanations and recommendations were clear and estimated that the clinician understood their problems and 86.5% of them would recommend VC to family and friends. Eighty-seven percent of clinician users recognize the benefit of VC for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic but only 68% supported continuation of the service after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our study reports high levels of patient satisfaction from outpatient clinics VC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower levels of clinician satisfaction can mostly be attributed to technical and administrative challenges related to the newly implemented telemedicine platform. Our findings support the continued future use of VC as a means of providing patient-centered care.

This extends to the self-other relationship as there is both being infected and infecting the other.

METHODS: First, we discuss about the psychological and neuronal features of self and and self-other relation and how they are rooted in a deeper layer of the brain's neural activity complemeting its cognitive surface layer. Secondly, we demonstrate cultural differences of eastern and western concepts of self, i.e., independency and inter-dependency, and how these reflect the manifestation of the brain's neuro-social and -ecological alignment. Finally, we highlight how inter-subjective and cultural nature of self surface in the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Discussing various lines of empirical data showing the brain's intimate alignment to both social and ecological environmental contexts our results support the assumption of the brain's deep layer features by laying bare a continuum of different degrees of neuro-social and neuro-ecological alignment. This entails a a two-stage model of self with neuro-social-ecological and psychological levels that extends the previously suggested basis model of self-specificity (BMSS). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the current pandemic shows the importance of the deeper inter-subjective and cultural layers of both self and brain; their neglect can be life-threatening for self and others and, paradoxically, might reduce, rather than enlarge, the self's sense of freedom and independence.

CONCLUSIONS: Gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, such as Roseburia and Faecalibacterium, could be less abundant in patients with psychiatric disorders, whereas commensal genera, for example, Bifidobacterium, might be more abundant compared with healthy controls. However, most included studies were hampered by methodological shortcomings including small sample size, unclear diagnostics, failure to address confounding factors, and inadequate bioinformatic processing, which might contribute to inconsistent results. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to improve quality and comparability of future microbiota studies in psychiatry.","output":"Gut Microbiota in Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal childhood vaccination against influenza in Europe. AREAS COVERED: : We conducted a systematic review of original article assessing the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination by searching PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases for studies in English, starting from January 1st, 2010 up to October 21st, 2020. EXPERT OPINION: Our literature review showed that all studies identified highlight that paediatric vaccinations using a live vaccine, especially in the quadrivalent formulation, are cost-effective compared to current vaccinations (elderly and at-risk groups) with TIV or no vaccination. A significant contribution to this positive economic profile is due to the indirect protection. Already many clinical data report the relevant direct and indirect impact of vaccination against influenza for younger subjects. The recent studies collected in this review showed also that the paediatric vaccination is also cost-effective.

This protein acts both as a Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblase and a Ca(2+)-activated ion channel but several studies have reported conflicting results about the ion selectivity of the TMEM16F-mediated current. Here, we have performed a detailed side-by-side comparison of the ion selectivity of TMEM16F using the whole-cell and inside-out excised patch configurations to directly compare the results. In inside-out configuration, Ca(2+)-dependent activation was fast and the TMEM16F-mediated current was activated in a few milliseconds, while in whole-cell recordings full activation required several minutes. We determined the relative permeability between Na(+) and Cl (P(Na)/P(Cl)) using the dilution method in both configurations. The TMEM16F-mediated current was highly nonselective, but there were differences depending on the configuration of the recordings. In whole-cell recordings, P(Na)/P(Cl) was approximately 0.5, indicating a slight preference for Cl permeation. In contrast, in inside-out experiments the TMEM16F channel showed a higher permeability for Na(+) with P(Na)/P(Cl) reaching 3.7. Our results demonstrate that the time dependence of Ca(2+) activation and the ion selectivity of TMEM16F depend on the recording configuration.","output":"Anion and Cation Permeability of the Mouse TMEM16F Calcium-Activated Channel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different members of the tetraspanin superfamily have been described to regulate different virus infectious cycles at several stages: viral entry, viral replication or virion exit or infectivity.

Here we aimed at analysing the role of CD81 in Herpes simplex virus 1 infectivity using a neuroblastoma cell model. For this purpose, we generated a CD81 KO cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Despite being CD81 a plasma membrane protein, CD81 KO cells showed no defects in viral entry nor in the expression of early protein markers. In contrast, glycoprotein B and C, which require viral DNA replication for their expression, were significantly reduced in CD81 KO infected cells. Indeed, HSV-1 DNA replication and the formation of new infectious particles were severely compromised in CD81 KO cells. We could not detect significant changes in SAMHD1 total expression levels, but a relocalization into endosomal structures was observed in CD81 KO cells.

Recently, researchers have attempted to remotely control the in vivo behavior of drugs with light to overcome the shortcomings of conventional drug delivery systems. Photodynamic and photothermal systems are representative strategies wherein a photosensitive material is activated in response to a specific wavelength of light. AREA COVERED: Photosensitive materials generally exhibit poor solubility and low biocompatibility. Additionally, their low photostability negatively affects delivery performance. A formulation of lipid-based nanoparticles containing photosensitive substances can help achieve photosensitive drug delivery with improved biocompatibility. The lipid bilayer structure, which can be assembled and disassembled by modulating the surrounding conditions (temperature, pH, etc.), can also be crucial for controlled release of drugs. EXPERT OPINION: To the best of our knowledge, translation research on photoresponsive nanoparticles is scarce. However, as various drugs based on lipid nanoparticles have been clinically approved, the development potential of the lipid-based photoresponsive nanoparticles seems high. Thus, the identification of valid indications and development of optimum medical devices will increase the interest in photoresponsive material-based nanoparticles.","output":"Lipid-based nanoparticles for photosensitive drug delivery systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Muscle wasting disease indications are among the most debilitating and often deadly noncommunicable disease states. As a comorbidity, muscle wasting is associated with different neuromuscular diseases and myopathies, cancer, heart failure, chronic pulmonary and renal diseases, peripheral neuropathies, inflammatory disorders, and, of course, musculoskeletal injuries. Current treatment strategies are relatively ineffective and can at best only limit the rate of muscle degeneration. This includes nutritional supplementation and appetite stimulants as well as immunosuppressants capable of exacerbating muscle loss. Arguably, the most promising treatments in development attempt to disrupt myostatin and activin receptor signaling because these circulating factors are potent inhibitors of muscle growth and regulators of muscle progenitor cell differentiation. Indeed, several studies demonstrated the clinical potential of inhibiting the inhibitors, increasing muscle cell protein synthesis, decreasing degradation, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, and preserving muscle function. Such changes can prevent muscle wasting in various disease animal models yet many drugs targeting this pathway failed during clinical trials, some from serious treatment-related adverse events and off-target interactions. More often, however, failures resulted from the inability to improve muscle function despite preserving muscle mass. Drugs still in development include antibodies and gene therapeutics, all with different targets and thus, safety, efficacy, and proposed use profiles. Each is unique in design and, if successful, could revolutionize the treatment of both acute and chronic muscle wasting. They could also be used in combination with other developing therapeutics for related muscle pathologies or even metabolic diseases.","output":"Myostatin/Activin Receptor Ligands in Muscle and the Development Status of Attenuating Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study was conducted with an exploratory study design to explore the amount of debris around beaches on Libong Island, Thailand.

METHODS This multi-centre cohort study involved patients aged 18 years and older hospitalised with COVID-19, using routinely collected data. We used Cox regression analysis to assess the impact of age, frailty and delirium on the risk of inpatient mortality, adjusting for sex, illness severity, inflammation and co-morbidities. We used ordinal logistic regression analysis to assess the impact of age, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and delirium on risk of increased care requirements on discharge, adjusting for the same variables. RESULTS Data from 5,711 patients from 55 hospitals in 12 countries were included (median age 74, interquartile range [IQR] 54-83; 55.2% male). The risk of death increased independently with increasing age (>80 versus 18-49: hazard ratio [HR] 3.57, confidence interval [CI] 2.54-5.02), frailty (CFS 8 versus 1-3: HR 3.03, CI 2.29-4.00) inflammation, renal disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer, but not delirium. Age, frailty (CFS 7 versus 1-3: odds ratio 7.00, CI 5.27-9.32), delirium, dementia and mental health diagnoses were all associated with increased risk of higher care needs on discharge.

Non-use of chemoprophylaxis in travellers remains the main reason for this. The proliferation of online travel blogs as a source of advice (sometimes the only one used) for preparing a trip to an endemic area may play a role in the decision to use chemoprophylaxis. The aim of this study was to analyse the information offered on malaria in the main travel blogs in English and Spanish. METHODS: Five hundred travel blogs in English and 100 in Spanish, considered highly relevant were analysed. The relevance were according to different metrics: (1) Alexa Rank; (2) social networks (RRSS) measuring the total followers of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube; (3) number of monthly visits using the SEMrush tool; (4) domain authority; and (5) number of backlinks or incoming links using the SEMrush tool. RESULTS: Of the included travel blogs, 57% of those in English and 64% of those in Spanish offered information on malaria, and 79 and 75%, respectively, featured a discussion on malaria written as a blog post or in forum comments. Information on chemoprophylaxis was available in 56.1% of English-language blogs and 10.7% of Spanish-speaking blogs, while its side effects were discussed in 38.6 and 68.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). Content analysis revealed that the information was usually insufficient, incomplete or, more seriously, inaccurate. In many cases, this could discourage users from taking appropriate preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Travel blogs in English and Spanish provide low-quality information on malaria.

METHODS: The study was a pilot, randomized controlled trial comparing a mindful parenting program to waitlist. Participants were parents (N = 25) of children aged 3C18 years, with self-reported concerns regarding their childs internalizing problems, recruited from the community. Demand was assessed using recruitment and adherence rates. Acceptability was assessed using parent-reported usefulness. Preliminary efficacy was assessed using parent reports of child internalizing problems, mindful parenting, parenting stress, cognitive emotion regulation, parental experiential avoidance, and parent beliefs about child anxiety. Intervention group parents also provided weekly in-session data on coping in stressful parenting situations. The likelihood of successful expansion was assessed using qualitative feedback on whether and how the program had helped parents manage child internalizing problems, particularly anxiety. RESULTS: Feasibility was established for the four aspects assessed. The program was well-attended and acceptable to parents. Moderate to large effects were found in favor of the intervention group for most parent and child outcomes. Weekly data showed improved coping in difficult parenting situations. Qualitative feedback suggested that parents believed that increased acceptance and empathy had helped them cope with child internalizing problems. CONCLUSIONS: Mindful parenting programs may assist parents of children with internalizing problems to manage parenting stress and emotionally regulate themselves, even in difficult parenting moments. They may also reduce child internalizing problems, through improved parental emotion regulation, and greater acceptance of and empathy for their child.

METHODS We analyzed records of consecutive patients who underwent emergency open colectomy for IC between 2008 and 2019. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and operative parameters associated with postoperative mortality. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups were compared for mortality, morbidity, ICU stay, hospital stay, and survival. RESULTS During the study period, 94 patients (mean age, 67.4  13.7 years) underwent emergent open colectomy for IC. In the majority of cases, IC involved the entire colon (53.2%) and vasopressor agents were required preoperatively (63.8%) and/or intraoperatively (78.8%). Thirty-four patients underwent surgery due to AS-IC, whereas 60 due to Other-IC causes. In the AS-IC group, 9 patients had undergone endovascular aortic repair and 25 open aortic surgery; 61.8% of patients needed aortic surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA). Overall, 66 patients (70.2%) died within 90 days from surgery. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups showed similar operative outcomes and postoperative complication rates. However, the duration of the ICU stay (19 days vs. 11 days; p = 0.003) and of the total hospital stay (22 days vs. 16 days; p = 0.016) was significantly longer for the AS-IC group than for the Other-IC group. The rate of intestinal continuity restoration at 1 year after surgery was higher for the Other-IC group than for the AS-IC group (58.8% vs. 22.2%; p = 0.05). In the multivariate model, preoperative increased lactate levels, a delay between signs/symptoms' onset and surgery > 12 h, and the occurrence of postoperative acute kidney injury were statistically associated with postoperative mortality. Neither IC etiology (aortic surgery vs. other etiology) nor ruptured AAA was associated with postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION Emergency open colectomy for IC is associated with high postoperative mortality, which appears to be unrelated to the IC etiology. Preoperative lactate levels, > 12-h delay to surgery, and postoperative acute kidney injury are independent predictors of postoperative mortality.","output":"Predictors of mortality following emergency open colectomy for ischemic colitis: a single-center experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is pandemic.

In multivariable-adjusted analyses, association sizes (P0.039) for MAP were 0.016 cm and 0.014 cm for septal and posterior wall thickness, ?0.15 for E/A ratio, ?0.66 for E/e, and ?0.64% for ejection fraction, independent of pulse pressure. With adjustment additionally applied for MAP, E/A ratio and longitudinal strain increased with higher pulse pressure with association sizes amounting to 0.067 (P=0.026) and 0.40% (P=0.023). In multivariable-adjusted analyses of both placebo and spironolactone groups, lower MAP and higher pulse pressure predicted the primary composite end point (P0.028) and hospitalized HF (P0.002), whereas MAP was also significantly associated with total mortality (P0.007). Sensitivity analyses stratified by sex, median age, and region generated confirmatory results with exception for the association of adverse outcomes with pulse pressure in patients with age 69 years. In conclusion, the clinical application of MAP and pulse pressure may refine risk estimates in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. This finding may help further investigation for the development of HF with preserved ejection fraction preventive strategies targeting pulsatility and blood pressure control.","output":"Clinical Significance of Mean and Pulse Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the first whole-genome sequence of a GA13-like isolate of avian infectious bronchitis virus CK/CR/1160/16 (MN757859), obtained in 2016 in the province of Alajuela, Costa Rica.

It is of great significance in clinical to develop rapid and specific detection methods for miRNAs. Herein, we established a fluorescent probe for ulcerative colitis (UC) activity-associated two serum biomarkers (miR-23a and miR-223) simultaneous detection, which used multi-color fluorescent DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNC) illuminated by a close guanine (G)-rich sequence as a signal transducer and two split DNA probes as recognition units. In principle, the two DNA probe sequences containing AgNC nucleation sequence and G-rich sequence respectively, formed a ternary complex when in the presence of target miRNA through base pairing, so as to induce enhancement of fluorescence emission of AgNC by shortening the distance from G-rich sequence. The combined probes for miR-23a and miR-223 detection generated increased fluorescence signals at 460 nm ex/545 nm em and at 560 nm ex/630 nm em, respectively. With this technique, we successfully quantified the two target miRNAs with high selectivity. Furthermore, the potential clinic applicability of this method was verified by testing the spiked standard miRNAs in human serum. Thus, this one-step, low-cost, and homogenous method offers a great opportunity for disease-associated multiplex miRNAs simultaneous detection.","output":"Detection of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated microRNAs by two color DNA-templated silver nanoclusters fluorescent probes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) poses serious challenges to people's health worldwide.

Cybercrimes have been on the rise as criminals and hackers continue to take advantage of IoT's security loopholes and vulnerabilities. The enormity of the attacks has not only been damaging to the quality of life, but it poses a disservice and an unquantifiable risk to human safety. Thus, a timely and comprehensive review, analysis and investigation of the security of IoTs is crucial. Through a systematic literature review of over 200 articles, we set out the latest findings and trends to provide new insights into the security of IoTs, taking cognizant of its social, economic, technical and legal implications, which will be beneficial to researchers, manufacturers, individuals, organizations, and governments. Although many studies reviewing the state of IoT exist in the literature, no studies shape the area of its security well. Hence, there is currently no study that provides an in-depth survey of the emerging security concerns of IoT from diverse perspectives and in tandem with the current condition of the global world today.

Objectives: Assess the impact of COVID-19 boosters on protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a real-world setting from a highly vaccinated (99%) population curated from a linked database with test results, vaccination history, patient demographics, and genomic sequencing information from the National Basketball Association (NBA). Methods: In this population, 1,613 fully vaccinated staff and players (median age 34.5 years, 88% male) who tested at least once between 1 December 2021 and 5 January 2022, were analyzed. Individuals were tested at the time of reporting any symptom, regardless of severity, after known exposure per self-report or contact tracing and/or during enhanced surveillance. Boosted individuals (n=1260) were compared to fully vaccinated and booster eligible individuals (n=162), defined as 2 months post-JNJ-78436735 or 5-months post-second dose of mRNA vaccine. Individuals not yet eligible for a booster and those who recovered from COVID-19 between 1 November and 30 November, 2021 (n=25) were examined in secondary analyses but excluded from the primary comparison. Individuals who were not fully vaccinated (n=27) or who received a booster within 14 days during or prior to the observation period (n=916) were excluded. Results: In this closely monitored population, fully vaccinated booster-eligible individuals were 2.6 times more likely (RR = 2.6, 95% CI: 2.2 to 3.0, p<0.0001) to have a confirmed COVID-19 infection than boosted individuals. Secondary analysis including non-boosted individuals with recent vaccination or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection found that non-boosted individuals were at greater risk of infection compared with boosted individuals (RR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.8 to 2.4, p<0.001). Results were similar when stratified by primary vaccination type with overlapping confidence intervals. No hospitalizations or deaths were observed in this cohort. Genetic sequencing confirmed 93% of infections to be Omicron (among n=330 sequenced). Conclusions: These results highlight the protective benefit of boosters against incident SARS-CoV-19 infection, not only for severe symptoms and death.

METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study of patients with suspected COVID-19 and confirmed COVID-19. Patient background, clinical course, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings, and the presence of alternative diagnoses were evaluated. Clinical risk scores were developed based on clinical differences between patients with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 110 patients suspected of having COVID-19, 60.9% underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing based on the judgment of physicians. Two patients were found to have COVID-19. The clinical characteristics of 108 non-COVID-19 patients were compared with those of 23 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have a history of high-risk exposures and an abnormal sense of taste and smell. The COVID-19 group had significantly higher rates of subnormal white blood cell counts, lower eosinophil counts, and lower procalcitonin levels than the non-COVID-19 group. When blood test results, CT findings, and the presence of alternative diagnoses were scored on an 11-point scale (i.e., COVID-19 Clinical Risk Score), the COVID-19 group scored significantly higher than the non-COVID-19 group, more than four points in the COVID-19 group. All non-COVID patients who did not undergo PCR had a score of 4 or less.

Hypoxia, immune-mediated injury, and vascular damage are the potential mechanisms for the CNS manifestations. Headache, dizziness, chemosensory disturbances, such as loss of smell, taste, encephalopathy, stroke, etc., are among the commonly encountered neurological presentations. Headache is identified as one of the red flag symptoms for COVID-19. Sudden onset of loss of smell and/or taste in the absence of nasal congestion can help in COVID-19 case identification and testing prioritization. Both hemorrhagic and ischemic brain injury is common in patients developing stroke.

Early detection of new infections is crucial in the control of emerging diseases. Evidence of early recorded COVID-19 cases outside China has been documented in various countries. In this study, we aimed to identify the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection circulation by retrospectively analyzing sera of measles patients, weeks before the reported first COVID-19 cases in Angola. Materials and Methods We examined the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay on a combined two-step sandwich enzyme immunoassay method. In total, we received 568 study patients with blood specimens collected from 23 September 2019 to 28 February 2020, 442 sera samples that met the criteria of the study were withdrawn and selected from the overall 568 received samples. In this study, we considered seropositives, patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) antibodies with the index value >1. Results Of the 442 sera samples that met the criteria of the study, 204 were measles seropositive. Forty out of 204 were confirmed reactive to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins using IgG and IgM more than 2 weeks before the first reported case in Angola. The humoral response analysis showed significant differences (p = 0.01) between the IgG and IgM indexes in the unvaccinated measles patients. Similarly, a significant difference (p = 0.001) was seen between the IgG and IgM indexes in the vaccinated measles patients. Conclusion Here, using the humoral response analysis, we report the identification of early circulation SARS-CoV-2 infection weeks before the first recognized cases in the Republic of Angola.","output":"Early Evidence of Circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Unvaccinated and Vaccinated Measles Patients, September 2019CFebruary 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides estimates of the destructive impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on air transport at the macro-regional level To this end, weekly data on the air service volumes are analyzed through an ITS SARIMA model and a counterfactual analysis covering the 2016C2020 We find that the real effect of COVID-19 was a reduction above 80% in all world's macro-regions in May 2020, and still a decrease of about 70% at the end of the Summer 2020, with the only expectation of China and Eastern Asia, and North America, where the reductions are, respectively, ?29% and ?54% The empirical evidence confirms that the impact of the pandemic crisis and of the subsequent lockdown has been dramatic, much higher than any previous crisis We also find that the impact is greater for intercontinental connections and for FSCs, while LCCs appear to be slightly more resilient These results confirm that airline economic sustainability is currently at high risk, and that the unequal resources of the various countries in subsidizing national airlines could generate a competitive imbalance in the future","output":"The disruptive impact of COVID-19 on air transportation: An ITS econometric analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the increasingly widespread use of video consultations, there are very few documented descriptions of how to set up and implement video consultations in real-time practice.

They have demonstrated significant early promise over other methods of biological data representation, such as in target discovery, side effect prediction and drug repurposing. In parallel, an explosion of -omics data for the deep characterization of biological systems routinely uncovers molecular signatures of disease for similar applications. Here, we present RPath, a novel algorithm that prioritizes drugs for a given disease by reasoning over causal paths in a knowledge graph (KG), guided by both drug-perturbed as well as disease-specific transcriptomic signatures. First, our approach identifies the causal paths that connect a drug to a particular disease. Next, it reasons over these paths to identify those that correlate with the transcriptional signatures observed in a drug-perturbation experiment, and anti-correlate to signatures observed in the disease of interest. The paths which match this signature profile are then proposed to represent the mechanism of action of the drug. We demonstrate how RPath consistently prioritizes clinically investigated drug-disease pairs on multiple datasets and KGs, achieving better performance over other similar methodologies. Furthermore, we present two case studies showing how one can deconvolute the predictions made by RPath as well as predict novel targets.","output":"Causal reasoning over knowledge graphs leveraging drug-perturbed and disease-specific transcriptomic signatures for drug discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Published data suggest that there are increased hospitalizations, placental abnormalities, and rare neonatal transmission among pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objectives: To evaluate adverse outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy and to describe clinical management, disease progression, hospital admission, placental abnormalities, and neonatal outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational cohort study of maternal and neonatal outcomes among delivered women with and without SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy was conducted from March 18 through August 22, 2020, at Parkland Health and Hospital System (Dallas, Texas), a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital with widespread access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. Women were included if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and delivered. For placental analysis, the pathologist was blinded to illness severity. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, or cesarean delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate among women delivered after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal illness severity, neonatal infection, and placental abnormalities were described. Results: From March 18 through August 22, 2020, 3374 pregnant women (mean [SD] age, 27.6 [6] years) tested for SARS-CoV-2 were delivered, including 252 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3122 who tested negative. The cohort included 2520 Hispanic (75%), 619 Black (18%), and 125 White (4%) women. There were no differences in age, parity, body mass index, or diabetes among women with or without SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was more common among Hispanic women (230 [91%] positive vs 2290 [73%] negative; difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%; P < .001). There was no difference in the composite primary outcome (52 women [21%] vs 684 women [23%]; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73-1.21; P = .64). Early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 6 of 188 tested infants (3%), primarily born to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. There were no placental pathologic differences by illness severity. Maternal illness at initial presentation was asymptomatic or mild in 239 women (95%), and 6 of those women (3%) developed severe or critical illness. Fourteen women (6%) were hospitalized for the indication of COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: In a large, single-institution cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Neonatal infection may be as high as 3% and may occur predominantly among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women. Placental abnormalities were not associated with disease severity, and hospitalization frequency was similar to rates among nonpregnant women.","output":"Pregnancy Outcomes Among Women With and Without Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, has become a global pandemic. Given that the highest viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is found in the airway, otolaryngologists are at high risk of infection. As a result, multiple recommendations have emerged regarding protective measures for surgical teams, including suspending non-urgent procedures and surgeries. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngology residency training programs nationwide. Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was completed in April 2020. The participants were recruited through an online survey, sent by email to all Chilean otolaryngology residents. Demographics, clinical activities, on-call shifts, COVID-19 infection status, exposure to COVID-19 patients, deployment to other specialties, diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, and surgeries performed were analyzed. Self-reported surgical data logs from previous years were used to compare results. Results: Forty-seven residents completed the survey (84% response rate); 64% of residents refer seeing patients ten days or less during April 2020. Commonly performed procedures such as flexible nasolaryngoscopy, rigid nasal endoscopy, and peritonsillar abscess drainage were not performed by over 40% of the residents in that month. Only 38% participated in surgeries, with an average of 0.6 surgeries as a first surgeon, a dramatic decrease in surgical exposure when comparing the data logs from previous years. Most residents refer the following measures taken by their residency program to improve residency training: bibliographic videoconferences (87%), online clinical case seminars (60%), weekly journal clubs (38%), among others. Conclusions: Clinical and surgical opportunities decreased dramatically during April 2020. Adjustments to the regular academic curricula should be considered to decrease the negative impact of this pandemic on residency training.","output":"How the COVID-19 pandemic affects specialty training: An analysis of a nationwide survey among otolaryngology residents in Chile./ How the COVID-19 pandemic affects specialty training: An analysis of a nationwide survey among otolaryngology residents in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective was to evaluate the cross-cultural measurement invariance of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in 7 Latin American countries (Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay).

Optimal fluid management should provide adequate oxygen delivery to the body, while avoiding inadvertent increase in lung edema which further impairs gas exchange. In ARDS patients, positive fluid balance has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stay, and higher mortality. Accordingly, a restrictive strategy has been compared to a more liberal approach in randomized controlled trials conducted in various clinical settings. Restrictive strategies included fluid restriction guided by the monitoring of extravascular lung water, pulmonary capillary wedge or central venous pressure, and furosemide targeted to diuresis and/or albumin replacement in hypoproteinemic patients. Overall, restrictive strategies improved oxygenation significantly and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, but had no significant effect on mortality. Fluid management may require different approaches depending on the time course of ARDS (i.e., early vs. late period). The effects of fluid strategy management according to ARDS phenotypes remain to be evaluated. Since ARDS is frequently associated with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure, the prediction of fluid responsiveness is crucial in these patients to avoid hemodynamically inefficienthence respiratory detrimentalfluid administration. Specific hemodynamic indices of fluid responsiveness or mini-fluid challenges should be preferably used. Since the positive airway pressure contributes to positive fluid balance in ventilated ARDS patients, it should be kept as low as possible. As soon as the hemodynamic status is stabilized, correction of cumulated fluid retention may rely on diuretics administration or renal replacement therapy.","output":"Fluid administration and monitoring in ARDS: which management?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) of uro-oncologic patients whose surgery was postponed without being re-scheduled during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From the 1(st) March to the 26(th) April 2020, major urological surgeries were drastically reduced at our tertiary referral hospital. In order to evaluate the HRQOL outcomes, the SF-36 questionnaire was sent to all patients scheduled for major surgery at our department 3 weeks after the cancellation of the planned surgical procedures due to the COVID-19 emergency. RESULTS: All patients included in the analysis were waiting for surgery since a median time of 52.85 days (IQR 35-72 d). When considering physical characteristics, median PF was 91.5 (IQR 50-100) and median PH was 82.75 (IQR 50- 100) with a median BP of 79.56 (IQR 45-90). Basing on emotional and social aspects, median RE was 36.83 (IQR 0-100) with a median SF of 37.98 (IQR 12.5-90). Mostly of patients reported a loss of energy (median EF 35.28 with an IQR of 15-55) and an increased anxiety (median EWB 47.18 (IQR 20 -75). All patients perceived a reduction of their health conditions with a median GHP of 49.47 (IQR 15-85). Generally, 86% of patients (n=43) referred an almost intact physical function but a significant emotional alteration characterized by a prevalence of anxiety and loss of energy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the lockdown which has impacted most operating rooms in Italy could be responsible for an increased anxiety and decrement in health status of the oncological patients. Without any effective real solution, we should expect a new medical catastrophe which will be caused by an increased risk of tumor progression and mortality in uro-oncologic patients.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality-of-life in uro-oncologic patients: what should we wait for?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this project was to document and increase vaccine coverage in migrant school children on the Thailand-Myanmar border.

All of a sudden, the lives of Italians were forced to shift in accordance with the regulations issued by government. This change in the lives of Italians can be mirrored by an adjustment in food consumer behaviour that, consequently, brought about a transition in the whole supply chain. This paper gives an overview of the recent changes in consumption patterns that occurred due to the Italian lockdown, and how evolutions in behaviour are intertwined with the evolution of the main food supply chains. Many of the events here depicted are likely to last far beyond the crisis and affect the subsequent evolution of food consumption in Italy. The Italian retail supply chain successfully adapted to the big shift in consumption. Despite purchases for essential items having increased, no stockout harmed the food security of Italians. Out-of-home consumption moved inside houses giving space to home meal preparation and comfort food. Home delivery has been the most important element in this context, as it boomed during this period, helping laggard consumers fill the digital divide, as it was mostly mediated by e-commerce platforms and instant messaging. It was also the leverage that allowed small retailers and small producers regain their space.

First-generation (FGS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have inherent limitations that are unable to resolve a minority clonotypes information in the virus population. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies with ultra-long reads have the potential to solve this problem but have a high error rate. Here, we evaluated emerging direct RNA sequencing and cDNA sequencing with the MinION platform and established a novel approach that combines the high accuracy of Illumina sequencing technology and long reads of nanopore sequencing technology to resolve both variants and clonotypes of influenza virus. Furthermore, a new program was written to eliminate the effect of nanopore sequencing errors for the analysis of the results. By using this pipeline, we identified 47 clonotypes in our experiment.

This study was conducted to investigate whether the observed shedding of ischemically damaged epithelial cells affects IR induced inflammation in the human small gut. METHODS AND FINDINGS Using a newly developed IR model of the human small intestine, the inflammatory response was studied on cellular, protein and mRNA level. Thirty patients were consecutively included. Part of the jejunum was subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia and variable reperfusion periods (mean reperfusion time 120 (+/-11) minutes). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. Increased plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) levels indicated loss in epithelial cell integrity in response to ischemia and reperfusion (p<0.001 vs healthy). HIF-1alpha gene expression doubled (p = 0.02) and C3 gene expression increased 4-fold (p = 0.01) over the course of IR. Gut barrier failure, assessed as LPS concentration in small bowel venous effluent blood, was not observed (p = 0.18). Additionally, mRNA expression of HO-1, IL-6, IL-8 did not alter. No increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, TNFalpha release, increased numbers of inflammatory cells (p = 0.71) or complement activation, assessed as activated C3 (p = 0.14), were detected in the reperfused tissue. CONCLUSIONS In the human small intestine, thirty minutes of ischemia followed by up to 4 hours of reperfusion, does not seem to lead to an explicit inflammatory response.

RESULTS The dissociation constants (K(D)) for HER2 binding were 78 pM for the three-helix Affibody molecule and 2.1 nM for the two-helix Affibody molecule. (111)In-PEP09239 cleared more rapidly from the blood. In xenografts with high HER2 expression, the uptake of (111)In-ABY-002 was significantly higher than that of (111)In-PEP09239. The tumour-to-blood ratio was higher for (111)In-PEP09239 at 4 h after injection, while there was no significant difference in other tumour-to-organ ratios. The tumour uptake of (111)In-ABY-002 was eightfold higher than that of (111)In-PEP09239 in xenografts with low expression. Tumour-to-blood ratios were equal in this case, but other tumour-to-organ ratios were appreciably higher for the three-helix variant. CONCLUSION For tumours with high HER2 expression, two-helix HER2-targeting Affibody molecules can provide higher tumour-to-blood ratio at the cost of lower tumour uptake. In the case of low expression, both tumour uptake and tumour-to-organ ratios are appreciably higher for three-helix than for two-helix HER2-targeting Affibody molecules.","output":"Direct comparison of 111In-labelled two-helix and three-helix Affibody molecules for in vivo molecular imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To review practical, evidence-based strategies that may be implemented to promote teleworker safety, health, and well-being during and after the coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND The prevalence of telework has increased due to COVID-19. The upsurge brings with it challenges, including limited face-to-face interaction with colleagues and supervisors, reduced access to ergonomics information and resources, increased social isolation, and blurred role definitions, which may adversely affect teleworker safety, health, and well-being. METHOD Evidence-based strategies for improving occupational safety, health, and well-being among teleworkers were synthesized in a narrative-based review to address common challenges associated with telework considering circumstances unique to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Interventions aimed at increasing worker motivation to engage in safe and healthy behaviors via enhanced safety leadership, managing role boundaries to reduce occupational safety and health risks, and redesigning work to strengthen interpersonal interactions, interdependence, as well as workers' initiation have been supported in the literature.

All orthopaedic consent forms from four-week periods in March, June and July were reviewed. Measures such as staff education were implemented after the second cycle. Of consent forms for 37 operations performed in March, only 1 mentioned the risk of contracting COVID-19 and zero mentioned ITU.

Following educational measures, the third cycle showed a significant improvement as of 100 consent form records available for review, 73 included risk of COVID-19 whilst 26 mentioned ITU. The results show that earlier in the pandemic, surgeons at our centre were not counselling patients regarding COVID-19. This improved slightly between the first and second cycles, likely reflecting increased awareness of the nosocomial transmission of COVID-19.

METHOD This was a pretest-posttest study design. The study was conducted with 40 obese postpartum women with LBP randomized to receive DNS (n = 20) or General Exercise (GE, n = 20) 6 times a week for 6 weeks. The data were gathered before and after the 6-week intervention. RESULTS Forty participants completed the study (mean  SD, age 29.30  3.77 years; weight 88.10  6.09 kg; height 165.40  6.31 cm; and BMI, 32.19  1.07 kg/m2).

The objective of this study is to test a machine-learning (ML) method based on radiomics features extracted from chest CT images for screening COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The study is carried out on two groups of patients, including 138 patients with confirmed and 140 patients with suspected COVID-19. We focus on distinguishing pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases by segmentation of whole lung volume and extraction of 86 radiomics features. Followed by feature extraction, nine feature-selection procedures are used to identify valuable features. Then, ten ML classifiers are applied to classify and predict COVID-19 cases. Each ML models is trained and tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The predictive performance of each ML model is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. RESULTS: The range of accuracy and AUC is from 0.32 (recursive feature elimination [RFE]+Multinomial Naive Bayes [MNB] classifier) to 0.984 (RFE+bagging [BAG], RFE+decision tree [DT] classifiers) and 0.27 (mutual information [MI]+MNB classifier) to 0.997 (RFE+k-nearest neighborhood [KNN] classifier), respectively. There is no direct correlation among the number of the selected features, accuracy, and AUC, however, with changes in the number of the selected features, the accuracy and AUC values will change. Feature selection procedure RFE+BAG classifier and RFE+DT classifier achieve the highest prediction accuracy (accuracy: 0.984), followed by MI+Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and logistic regression (LGR)+DT classifiers (accuracy: 0.976).

The pandemic has also increased the use of hypo-fractionated treatment schedules where MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) can aid in dose escalation. This specialized technique requires increased staffing in close proximity, thus requiring novel coverage practices to increase physical distancing while still providing specialty care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A remote physician ART coverage practice was developed and described using commercially available software products. Our remote physician coverage practice provided control to the physician to contour, and review images and plans. The time from completion of image registration to the beginning of treatment was recorded for 20 fractions before remote physician ART coverage and 14 fractions after implementation of remote physician ART coverage. Visual quality was calculated using cross correlation between the treatment delivery computer screen and the remote physician screen. RESULTS: For the 14 fractions after implementation, the average time from image registration to the beginning of treatment was 24.96.1min. In comparison, the 20 fractions analyzed without remote coverage had an average time of 29.29.8min. The correlation between the console screen and the remote physician screen was R = 0.95.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate associations between public knowledge about COVID-19, adherence to social distancing, and public trust in government information sources (eg, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), private sources (eg, FOX and CNN), and social networks (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform future policies related to critical information distribution. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey (N=1243) between April 10 and 14, 2020. Data collection was stratified by US region and other demographics to ensure representativeness of the sample. RESULTS: Government information sources were the most trusted among the public. However, we observed trends in the data that suggested variations in trust by age and gender. White and older populations generally expressed higher trust in government sources, while non-White and younger populations expressed higher trust in private sources (eg, CNN) and social networks (eg, Twitter). Trust in government sources was positively associated with accurate knowledge about COVID-19 and adherence to social distancing. However, trust in private sources (eg, FOX and CNN) was negatively associated with knowledge about COVID-19.

We also enquired about participants satisfaction with their pursuit of their academic studies while living under COVID-19 restrictions. An internet-based survey was conducted during the month of April 2020, involving 3,122 Bangladeshi university students aged 18 to 29 years (59.5% males; mean age 21.42 years). Prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and stress were, respectively, 76.1%, 71.5% and 70.1% for at least mild symptoms, 62.9%, 63.6% and 58.6% for at least moderate symptoms, 35.2%, 40.3%, and 37.7% for at least severe symptoms and 19.7%, 27.5% and 16.5% for at least very severe symptoms. The present estimates of DAS were more prevalent than in previous pre-COVID-19 studies among Bangladeshi university students. Regression analyses with DASS-21-score as a dependent variable revealed associations with factors mostly as hypothesized.

The approach was applied to the 2015C2017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of final epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions.

Here, we analyzed the N-glycosylation of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of IBV strain M41 spike protein and assessed the role of this modification in host receptor binding. Ten single AsnCtoCAla substitutions at the predicted N-glycosylation sites of the M41CRBD were evaluated along with two control ValCtoCAla substitutions. CD analysis revealed that the secondary structure of all variants was retained compared with the unmodified M41CRBD construct. Six of the 10 glycosylation variants lost binding to chicken trachea tissue and an ELISA-presented 2,3-linked sialic acid oligosaccharide ligand. LC/MS(E) glycomics analysis revealed that glycosylation sites have specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Overall, the glycosylation patterns of most variant RBDs were highly similar to those of the unmodified M41CRBD construct. In silico docking experiments with the recently published cryo-EM structure of the M41 IBV spike protein and our glycosylation results revealed a potential ligand receptor site that is ringed by four glycosylation sites that dramatically impact ligand binding.

Both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Current methods for evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs rely mostly on transformed cells and animals. Transformed cell models are distantly related to physiological and pathological conditions. Although animals are the best choices for preclinical drug testing, they are not time- or cost-efficient.

Both influenza virus PR8 (H1N1) and A/Human/Hubei/3/2005 (H3N2) can replicate efficiently in mouse lung slices and trigger significant cytokine and chemokine responses. The induction of selected cytokines and chemokines were found to have a positive correlation between ex vivo and in vivo experiments, suggesting that the ex vivo cultured lung slices may closely resemble the lung functionally in an in vivo configuration when challenged by influenza virus. Furthermore, a set of agents with known antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory activities were tested to validate the ex vivo model.

Timing data was collated to look at the following: anaesthetic preparation time, anaesthetic time, surgical preparation time, surgical time, transfer to recovery time and turnaround time. Data for 2019 was collected retrospectively and data for 2020 was collected prospectively. Results: A total of 222 patients underwent emergency orthopaedic surgery in May 2019 and 161 in May 2020. A statistically significant increase in all timings was demonstrated in 2020 apart from anaesthetic time which demonstrated a significant decrease. A subgroup analysis for hip fractures demonstrated a similar result. No increase in surgical time was observed in hand and wrist surgery or for debridement and washouts.Although the decrease in anaesthetic time is difficult to explain, this could be attributed to a reduction in combined anaesthetic techniques and possibly the effect of fear. The other increases in time demonstrated can largely be attributed to the PPE required for aerosol generating procedures and other measures taken to reduce spread of the virus.

In-hospital mortality was not different between CLD patients with or without cirrhosis [p = 0.24] but was higher in those with cirrhosis who developed ACLF [adjusted HR 9.06, 95% CI 2.63-31.12, p < 0.001] with a trend for increased mortality by grade of ACLF [p = 0.002]. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between the CLD cohort compared to matched control without CLD (log rank, p = 0.98) and between the cirrhosis cohort compared to matched control without cirrhosis (log rank, p = 0.51). CONCLUSION: Development of ACLF is the main driver of increased in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and cirrhosis.","output":"Risk factors and outcomes for

an exponential increase in case numbers Estimates of the progression of disease and potential impact of different interventions are needed to inform policymaking decisions Herein, we model the possible trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in 52 African countries under different intervention scenarios DesignWe developed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to estimate the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries while considering four scenarios: no intervention, moderate lockdown, hard lockdown and hard lockdown with continued restrictions once lockdown is lifted We further analysed the potential impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations affected by HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) ResultsIn the absence of an intervention, the most populous countries had the highest peaks in active projected number of infections with Nigeria having an estimated 645 081 severe infections The scenario with a hard lockdown and continued post-lockdown interventions to reduce transmission was the most efficacious strategy for delaying the time to the peak and reducing the number of cases In South Africa, projected peak severe infections increase from 162 977 to 2 03 261, when vulnerable populations with HIV/AIDS and TB are included in the analysis ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the African continent Estimates of the potential impact of

Any person can catch COVID-19 from an infected person via aerosol droplets when the person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To limit such a transmission, World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended people to wear masks and physically distance themselves by staying at least 1 m (3 feet) away from others. As aerosol droplets (by cough or sneeze) land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails, and remain active on these surfaces for hours to days, people are advised to use soaps for at least 20 s. and alcohol-based sanitizers as well. As the public made efforts, clinicians and researchers investigated and found that drugs which were initially used to treat other diseases may work as a treatment option for COVID-19. One of those drugs was Chloroquine and its related derivative called hydroxychloroquine. In this review article, we have systematically searched for details of COVID-19 pandemic till May 2020 and assembled few data pertaining to (i) Corona viruses; (ii) SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and (iii) How chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine mediates anti-viral effect in both prophylactic and therapeutic setting. These data have been acquired mostly from PubMed and websites of WHO and Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). We did a systematic search and found that the properties of chloroquine are very much essential for the COVID-19 scenario.

Profound changes in patient volumes and behavior have occurred during the SARS Cov2 pandemic, but understanding these changes across organizations is challenging. Network analysis provides a novel approach to address this. Methods We retrospectively evaluated hospital-based encounters with an index emergency department visit in a healthcare system comprising 18 hospitals, using patient transfer as a marker of unmet clinical need. We developed quantitative models of transfers using network analysis incorporating the level of care provided (ward, progressive care, intensive care) during pre-pandemic (May 25, 2018 to March 16, 2020) and mid-pandemic (March 17, 2020 to March 8, 2021) time periods. Results 829,455 encounters were evaluated. The system functioned as a non-small-world, non-scale-free, dissociative network. Our models reflected transfer destination diversification and variations in volume between the two time points C results of intentional efforts during the pandemic. Known hub-spoke architecture correlated with quantitative analysis. Conclusion Applying network analysis in an integrated US healthcare organization demonstrates changing patterns of care and the emergence of bottlenecks in response to the SARS Cov2 pandemic, consistent with clinical experience, providing a degree of face validity. The modeling of multiple influences can identify susceptibility to stress and opportunities to strengthen the system where patient movement is common and voluminous. The technique provides a mechanism to analyze the effects of intentional and contextual changes on system behavior.","output":"A Novel Approach of Modelling Acute Patient Care Across a Healthcare System Using Network Analysis: Effects of The SARS Cov2 Pandemic On Patient Movement (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The threat of a human pandemic of influenza has prompted the development of national influenza pandemic preparedness plans over the last 4 years. Analyses have been carried out to assess preparedness in Europe, Asia and Africa. We assessed plans to evaluate the national strategic pandemic influenza preparedness in the countries of Latin America. Published national pandemic influenza preparedness plans from Latin American countries were evaluated against criteria drawn from the World Health Organization checklist. Plans were eligible for inclusion if formally published before 16 November 2007. Fifteen national plans were identified and retrieved from the 17 Latin American countries surveyed. Latin American countries demonstrated different degrees of preparedness, and that a high level of completeness of plans was correlated to a country's wealth to a certain extent. Plans were judged strong in addressing surveillance requirements, and provided appropriate communication strategies directed to the general public and health care personnel. However, gaps remained, including the organization of health care services response; planning and maintenance of essential services; and the provision of containment measures such as the stockpiling of necessary medical supplies including vaccines and antiviral medications. In addition, some inconsistencies and variations which may be important, such as in border control measures and the capacity to contain outbreaks, exist between country plansissues that could result in confusion in the event of a pandemic. A number of plans remain developmental in nature and, as elsewhere, more emphasis should be placed on strengthening the operability of plans, and in testing them. Whilst taking account of resources constraints, plans should be further developed in a coherent manner with both regional and international imperatives.","output":"Pandemic influenza preparedness in Latin America: analysis of national strategic plans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The investigation of migratory patterns during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic before spring 2020 border closures in Europe is a crucial first step toward an in-depth evaluation of border closure policies. Here we analyze viral genome sequences using a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to estimate the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe prior to border closures. Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic and coinfer the geographic location of ancestral lineages as well as the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe during this time has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei, China or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration. In summary, our analysis offers a view on the early state of the epidemic in Europe and on migration patterns of the virus before border closures.

S2 exhibits structural variations more significantly than S1 during the 200 ps molecular dynamics simulations because it is located at the open mouth of the catalytic cleft and the amino acid residues lining up this subsite are least conserved.

The analyses revealed that psychological inflexibility and symptomatology increased over time, and that inflexibility at the beginning of the lockdown indirectly predicted self-reported symptoms at the end of the lockdown via autoregressive parallel paths that also connected cross-sectionally to reveal that changes in inflexibility were predictive of changes in mental health. These results present a dynamic and robust relationship between psychological inflexibility and mental health symptoms throughout a relatively long and presumably stressful period of time.","output":"Psychological inflexibility and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain: A longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Several techniques can be proposed as fertility sparing surgery in young patients treated for cervical cancer but uncertaincies remain concerning their outcomes. Analysis of oncological issues is then the first aim of this review in order to evaluate the best strategy. RESULTS Data were identified from searches of MEDLINE, Current Contents, PubMed and from references in relevant articles from January 1987 to 15th of September 2021. We carry out an updated systematic review involving 5862 patients initially selected for fertility-sparing surgery in 275 series. FINDINGS In patients having a stage IB1 disease, recurrence rate/RR in patients undergoing simple conisation/trachelectomy, radical trachelectomy/RT by laparoscopico-vaginal approach, laparotomic or laparoscopic approaches are respectively: 4.1%, 4.7%, 2.4% and 5.2%. In patients having a stage IB2 disease, RR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or RT by laparotomy are respectively 13.2% and 4.8% (p = .0035). After neoadjuvant treatment a simple cone/trachelectomy was carried out in 91 (30%) patients and a radical one in 210 (70%) cases. But the lowest pregnancy rate is observed in patients undergoing RT by laparotomy (36%). CONCLUSIONS The choice between these treatments should be based above all, on objective oncological data that strike a balance for each procedure between the best chances for cure and the fertility results. In patients having a stage IB1 disease, oncological results are quite similar according to the procedure used. In patients having a stage IB2 disease, RT by open approach has the lowest RR.

We sampled 1000/state using an online survey from Jul 15-31 and Sep 16-Oct 15, 2020, with additional waves planned at 6-8 week intervals. At the time of surveys, there were no systematic differences in testing availability (public, private and free testing options) across these states. Participants were recruited using on online panel;demographic targets were provided to match age, sex, race/ethnicity and income distributions of each state. Participants were 18 years, provided consent, and resided in the study state. The survey covered demographics, symptoms, and PCR testing in the prior 2 weeks. Results: Of 3,058 persons surveyed most recently (Sep 16-Oct 15), 316 (10%) reported wanting/needing a test in the prior two weeks. Median age of participants wanting/needing a test was 36 years and 46% were female;47% self-identified as White and 57% reported working outside home. Of 316 who wanted/needed a test in the prior 2 weeks, 53% were able to get tested, of whom, 94% received results, with no significant differences by state (Figure);this was not substantially different from the proportion able to get tested in July (51%). Among those wanting/needing a test, getting tested was significantly less common among men (aOR: 0.46) and those reporting black race (aOR: 0.53) and more common in those reporting recent travel (aOR: 3.35;all p&lt;0.05). The primary reasons for testing were desire to know status (35%) and symptoms (28%). Among those tested, 53% had to wait 8 days to get a result from the time they wanted/needed a test. Of those tested, 71% reported quarantining while awaiting results. An additional 146 who wanted/needed a test did not get tested;the main reasons for not testing in this group were not knowing where to go (36%) and distance/waiting time (33%);an additional 21% reported fear of being tested.

Estimation is based on a moment condition that can be derived from an agent-based stochastic network model of COVID-19 transmission. The outcomes in terms of the reproduction number and the trajectory of per-capita cases through the end of 2020 are very diverse. The reproduction number depends on the transmission rate and the proportion of susceptible population, or the herd immunity effect. Changes in the transmission rate depends on changes in the behaviour of the virus, reflecting mutations and vaccinations, and changes in people's behaviour, reflecting voluntary or government mandated isolation. Over our sample period, neither mutation not vaccination are major factors, so one can attribute variation in the transmission rate to variations in behaviour. Evidence based on panel data models explaining transmission rates for nine European countries indicates that the diversity of outcomes resulted from the non-linear interaction of mandatory containment measures, voluntary precautionary isolation, and the economic incentives that governments provided to support isolation. These effects are precisely estimated and robust to various assumptions. As a result, countries with seemingly different social distancing policies achieved quite similar outcomes in terms of the reproduction number. These results imply that ignoring the voluntary component of social distancing could introduce an upward bias in the estimates of the effects of lock-downs and support policies on the transmission rates.","output":"COVID-19 Time-varying Reproduction Numbers Worldwide: An Empirical Analysis of Mandatory and Voluntary Social Distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Little is known about COVID-19 vaccination intentions among refugee communities in the United States. The objective of this study was to measure COVID-19 vaccination intentions among a sample of refugees in the United States and the reasons for their vaccine acceptance or hesitancy. METHODS From December 2020 through January 2021, we emailed or text messaged anonymous online surveys to 12 bilingual leaders in the Afghan, Bhutanese, Somali, South Sudanese, and Burmese refugee communities in the United States. We asked community leaders to complete the survey and share the link with community members who met the inclusion criteria (arrived in the United States as refugees, were aged 18, and currently lived in the United States). We compared the characteristics of respondents who intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine with those of respondents who did not intend to receive the vaccine or were unsure. We then conducted crude and adjusted logistic regression analysis to measure the association between employment as an essential worker and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. RESULTS Of 435 respondents, 306 (70.3%) indicated that they planned to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Being an essential worker (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.37; 95% CI, 1.44-3.90) and male sex (aOR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.12-3.12) were significantly associated with higher odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

Patients were evaluated by best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), full-field stimulus threshold (FST) test, semiautomated kinetic visual field (SKVF), microperimetry, and chromatic pupillometry over 6 months. RESULTS: No complications occurred in the first patient, whereas in the second a subretinal hemorrhage was observed in the first treated eye, and excessive resistance to drug injection occurred during treatment of the second eye. BCVA improved by at least one Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study line in all treated eyes. The FST test and SKVF showed clinically significant improvements in all eyes (i.e., change of light sensitivity > 10 decibels; area enlargement of at least 20%).

METHODS: Medical students completing an anonymous 70-question survey at the conclusion of their surgical clerkship from June 2019 to October 2020 were divided into 2 cohorts: students completing their clerkship prior to March 2020 and after June 2020. Quantitative assessment was performed to evaluate the clerkship performance and perceptions. Resulting findings were used to construct an interview guide and conduct semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Fifty-nine medical students rotated through the surgical clerkship prior to COVID and 23 during the COVID-era. No differences in perception of the surgical clerkship, participation in essential activities, or shelf examination scores were found. Students completing their clerkship during the COVID-era reported a lower perception of interaction and professional relationships with attending and resident surgeons (p = 0.03). Qualitatively, students completing their clerkship during the COVID-era struggled to balance clinical experiences with personal wellness and noted that building relationships with faculty was substantially more difficult. CONCLUSIONS: There does not appear to be a difference in the level of participation in essential clerkship activities nor a diminished perception of learning between students completing their surgical clerkship before or during the pandemic. However, there does appear to be a difference in the relationships formed between students and attending surgeons. Altered didactic structures and apprenticeship-type rotations may help mitigate such effects.

Southeast Asia experienced severe dengue outbreaks in 2019, and over 1000 cases had been reported in Jiangxi, a previously known low-epidemic region in China. However, the emergence of a dengue virus epidemic in a non-epidemic region remains unclear. METHODS: We enrolled 154 dengue fever patients from four hospitals in Jiangxi, from April 2019 to September 2019. Real-time PCR, NS1 antigen rapid test, and IgM, IgG tests were performed, and 14 samples were outsourced to be sequenced metagenomically. RESULTS: Among the 154 cases, 42 were identified as imported and most of them returned from Cambodia. A total of 113 blood samples were obtained and 106 were identified as DENV-1, two as DENV-2, and five were negative through RT-PCR. All DENV-1 strains sequenced in this study were all classified to one cluster and owned a high similarity with a Cambodia strain isolated in 2019. The evolutionary relationships of amino acid were consistent with that of nucleotide genome result. The sequence-based findings of Jiangxi strains were consistent with epidemiological investigation. CONCLUSION: Epidemiological analysis demonstrated that the emergence of dengue cases led to autochthonous transmission in several cities in Jiangxi, a low-epidemic region before.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) contains a caveat that limits diagnosing catatonia in patients during delirium. However, the literature has shown that up to 31% of patients have co-occurring catatonia and delirium when using the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale and 12.7% of patients with delirium meet DSM-5 criteria for catatonia. The authors present a case of a patient with concomitant delirium and catatonia. Diagnosing catatonia in this patient, even in the setting of delirium, was necessary for appropriate treatment and clinical improvement. Typical treatment for patients with delirium, antipsychotic medication, contributes to the worsening of catatonia while first-line treatment for catatonia, benzodiazepines, has been shown to exacerbate delirium. Delayed recognition of the patients catatonia resulted in inadequate treatment that worsened her catatonic symptoms and prolonged hospitalization. The potential contraindications to treatment interventions call for an appropriate diagnosis of catatonia when co-occurring with delirium despite the DSM-5 limitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) ICD-11 code for catatonia allows for less exclusivity in assessing for clinical catatonia in that the limitations to diagnosis only include harmful effects of drugs, medicaments or biological substance, not elsewhere classified - a more collaborative definition for catatonia criteria in the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 codes can provide a way forward with more flexibility in symptom interpretation and treatment.","output":"The Importance of Diagnosing Concomitant Delirium and Catatonia: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sleep disorder is one of the most common problems during menopause, which affects different areas of people's lives.

This study examined caregiving frequency and its relation to loneliness, perceived stress, and negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then investigated the moderating roles of COVID-19 concerns and impacts, anticipating magnified effects among caregivers. Participants included respondents from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) COVID-19 project sample (n=2108, mean age=69) who reported their caregiving frequency, general concern about COVID-19, related concerns about family members health, and social disruptions caused by the pandemic. Controlling for age, gender, and health status, daily caregivers reported significantly greater distress during COVID-19 compared to non-caregivers (p=.036). Higher levels of concern about family members health during COVID-19 was significantly associated with greater loneliness among daily caregivers (p = .009), but not among non-caregivers, such that daily caregivers with greater concerns had the highest levels of loneliness. On the other hand, unexpectedly, daily caregivers who experienced fewer social disruptions due to the pandemic reported higher levels of loneliness (p = .002);however, the association was null for non-caregivers.

We retrospectively analyzed the effect of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in 578 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and prospectively monitored 110 patients for circulating microthrombi and plasma markers of coagulation in the first week of admission. Moreover, we determined platelet shape change and also thrombi in postmortem lung biopsies in a subset of patients with COVID-19. We observed no association of antiplatelet therapy with COVID-19 survival. Adverse outcome in COVID-19 was associated with increased activation of the coagulation cascade, whereas circulating microthrombi did not increase in aggravated disease. This was in line with analysis of postmortem lung biopsies of patients with COVID-19, which revealed generally fibrin(ogen)-rich and platelet-low thrombi. Platelet spreading was normal in severe COVID-19 cases; however, plasma from patients with COVID-19 mediated an outcome-dependent inhibitory effect on na?ve platelets. Antiplatelet medication disproportionally exacerbated this platelet impairment in plasma of patients with fatal outcome. Taken together, this study shows that unfavorable outcome in COVID-19 is associated with a profound dysregulation of the coagulation system, whereas the contribution of platelets to thrombotic complications is less clear. Adverse outcome may be associated with impaired platelet function or platelet exhaustion.

It has long been evident that viral diversification through reassortment is constrained by genetic incompatibility between divergent parental viruses. In contrast, the role of virus-extrinsic factors in determining the likelihood of reassortment has remained unclear. To evaluate the impact of such factors in the absence of confounding effects of segment mismatch, we previously reported an approach in which reassortment between wild-type (wt) and genetically tagged variant (var) viruses of the same strain is measured. Here, using wt/var systems in the A/Netherlands/602/2009 (pH1N1) and A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) strain backgrounds, we tested whether inoculation of parental viruses into distinct sites within the respiratory tract limits their reassortment. Using a ferret (Mustella putorius furo) model, either matched parental viruses were coinoculated intranasally or one virus was instilled intranasally whereas the second was instilled intratracheally. Dual intranasal inoculation resulted in robust reassortment for wt/var viruses of both strain backgrounds. In contrast, when infections were initiated simultaneously at distinct sites, strong compartmentalization of viral replication was observed and minimal reassortment was detected. The observed lack of viral spread between upper and lower respiratory tract tissues may be attributable to localized exclusion of superinfection within the host, mediated by innate immune responses. Our findings indicate that dual infections in nature are more likely to result in reassortment if viruses are seeded into similar anatomical locations and have matched tissue tropisms.IMPORTANCE Genetic exchange between influenza A viruses (IAVs) through reassortment can facilitate the emergence of antigenically drifted seasonal strains and plays a prominent role in the development of pandemics. Typical human influenza infections are concentrated in the upper respiratory tract; however, lower respiratory tract (LRT) infection is an important feature of severe cases, which are more common in the very young, the elderly, and individuals with underlying conditions. In addition to host factors, viral characteristics and mode of transmission can also increase the likelihood of LRT infection: certain zoonotic IAVs are thought to favor the LRT, and transmission via small droplets allows direct seeding into lower respiratory tract tissues. To gauge the likelihood of reassortment in coinfected hosts, we assessed the extent to which initiation of infection at distinct respiratory tract sites impacts reassortment frequency. Our results reveal that spatially distinct inoculations result in anatomical compartmentalization of infection, which in turn strongly limits reassortment.","output":"Influenza A Virus Reassortment Is Limited by Anatomical Compartmentalization following Coinfection via Distinct Routes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID 19 pandemic has created challenges in providing timely care for patients and families with Substance Use disorders (SUDs).

Its high mutation rate in conjunction with recombination of the RNA genome constantly creates IBV variants that are difficult to control by currently available vaccines. In this study, we addressed the question whether small-scale holdings might harbor IBV variants that serve as a reservoir for newly emerging variants. Egyptian IBV isolate EGY/NR725/2016 (NR725/16) from a small-scale broiler farm was assigned to genotype I, clade 23 (S1:GI-23), based on partial S1 gene sequences and corroborated by full genome sequencing. Analysis of the S1 gene established three subclades for historical IBV strains (S1:GI-23.1, S1:GI-23.2.1 and S1:GI-23.2.2) and confirmed NR725/16 as being part of a separate fourth subclade (S1:GI-23.3). Samples from the years 2018 and 2019 revealed that the new subclade prevails in Egypt, carrying fixed mutations within the hypervariable regions (HVR) 1-3 of the S1 protein that affect two neutralization sensitive epitopes at sites 294F, 297S and 306Y (48.2) and 329R (62.1). In addition, recombination was recognized in isolate NR 725/16, with intra-subtype mixing for the entire genes 3ab and E and inter-subtype mixing for the entire gene 6b with a close match to QX like viruses of genotype GI-19. Further analysis of gene 3ab detected the homologous gene pool to NR725/16 in samples from 2013 (3ab:C) and closely related 3ab genotypes in IBV Egyptian isolates from 2016, 2018 and 2019. These data prove a flourishing exchange between poultry holdings with a common gene pool. The continued circulation of viruses harboring genes S1:GI-23.3 and 3ab:C indicates an evolutionary advantage of this combination possibly by combining antigenic escape with modulated pathogenicity to facilitate IBV spread in the vaccinated poultry population in Egypt.","output":"Emerging infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Egypt: Evidence for an evolutionary advantage of a new S1 variant with a unique gene 3ab constellation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many unintended, long-lasting consequences for society.

The present study explored emergency nurses behaviours and strategies in handling uncertainty and practice changes during an epidemic event. A qualitative study based on the Straussian grounded theory approach was established. Semi-structured, face-to-face, individual interviews were conducted with 26 emergency nurses for data collection. Adapting protocol to the evolving context of practice was revealed as the core category. Four interplaying subcategories were identified: (1) Completing a comprehensive assessment, (2) continuing education for emerging infectious disease management, (3) incorporating guideline updates and (4) navigating new duties and competencies. The nurses demonstrated the prudence to orientate themselves to an ambiguous work situation and displayed the ability to adapt and embrace changes in their practice and duties. These findings offer insights into the need for education and training schemes that allow emergency nurses to acquire and develop the necessary decision-making and problem-solving skills to handle a public health emergency.","output":"Investigating the Strategies Adopted by Emergency Nurses to Address Uncertainty and Change in the Event of Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Grounded Theory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of immunotherapy is a game changer in cancer therapy with monoclonal antibody- and T cell-based therapeutics being the current flagships.

Nursing staff are known to be at risk of developing back disorders, where low back pain has a prevalence from 16% to 60% in the world. This study aims to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain among nurses who working in a Roman hospital. METHODS Cross sectional study was carried out in an Italian hospital and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire-IRSST was administered to 256 registered nurses. Logistic regression analyses were performed to understand risk factors associated with pain. RESULTS Nurses reported different locations of pain related to musculoskeletal disorders. The prevalence of low back pain was 90.2% during life, 80% during the last year and 44.5% during the last week. Female sex increases the risk of being affected by low back pain (OR = 2.07, 95% CI= 1.00-4.32). CONCLUSIONS Musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain are reported by the majority of nurses interviewed, and a higher prevalence is observed in women.

As hospital systems run far over capacity, facing possible shortages of critical care medical resources and personal protective equipment as well as clinician deaths, the psychological stressors necessitate a strong well-being support model for staff. At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing front-line care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system's full support is required to address the needs of its workforce.In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force-created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system-used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the roll-out of support initiatives for each priority area.

The prevalence of co-infection and secondary infection in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. AIMS: To investigate the role of co-infections and secondary infections in disease severity of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out between 11 January 2020 and 1 March 2020 among 408 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients in China. These patients were divided into three groups based on disease severity: mild or moderate, severe, or critically ill. Microbiological pathogens in blood, urine, and respiratory tract specimens were detected by the combination of culture, serology, polymerase chain reaction, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). RESULTS: The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR 34-60 years). Fifty-two patients (12.7%) had at least one additional pathogen, 8.1% were co-infected, and 5.1% had a secondary infection. There were 13 Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, 8 Haemophilus influenzae cases, 8 respiratory viruses, and 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae cases, primarily detected in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. Hospital-acquired infection pathogens were more common in critically ill patients. Compared to those without additional pathogens, patients with co-infections and/or secondary infections were more likely to receive antibiotics (p < 0.001) and have elevated levels of d-dimer (p = 0.0012), interleukin-6 (p = 0.0027), and procalcitonin (p = 0.0002). The performance of conventional culture was comparable with that of mNGS in diagnosis of secondary infections. CONCLUSION: Co-infections and secondary infections existed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and were relevant to the disease severity. Screening of common respiratory pathogens and hospital infection control should be strengthened.","output":"Clinical and etiological analysis of co-infections and secondary infections in COVID-19 patients: An observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Ag) that can be performed at point of care (POC) can supplement molecular testing and help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Deployment of an Ag RDT requires an understanding of its operational and performance characteristics under real-world conditions and in relevant subpopulations. We evaluated the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site in Massachusetts using anterior nasal (AN) swab reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for clinical testing. Individuals presenting for molecular testing in two of seven lanes were offered the opportunity to also receive BinaxNOW testing. Dual AN swabs were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic children (&#8804;18 years of age) and adults. BinaxNOW testing was performed in a testing pod with temperature/humidity monitoring. One individual performed testing and official result reporting for each test, but most tests had a second independent reading to assess interoperator agreement. Positive BinaxNOW results were scored as faint, medium, or strong. Positive BinaxNOW results were reported to patients by phone, and they were instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Of 2,482 participants, 1,380 adults and 928 children had paired RT-PCR/BinaxNOW results and complete symptom data. In this study, 974/1,380 (71%) adults and 829/928 (89%) children were asymptomatic. BinaxNOW had 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.0 to 99.3) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 98.6 to 100.0) specificity in adults within 7 days of symptoms and 84.6% (95% CI, 65.1 to 95.6) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI, 94.5 to 100.0) specificity in children within 7 days of symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic adults were 70.2% (95% CI, 56.6 to 81.6) and 99.6% (95% CI, 98.9 to 99.9), respectively, and in asymptomatic children, they were 65.4% (95% CI, 55.6 to 74.4) and 99.0% (95% CI, 98.0 to 99.6), respectively. By cycle threshold (CT ) value cutoff, sensitivity in all subgroups combined (n = 292 RT-PCR-positive individuals) was 99.3% with CT values of &#8804;25, 95.8% with CT values of &#8804;30, and 81.2% with CT values of &#8804;35. Twelve false-positive BinaxNOW results (out of 2,308 tests) were observed; in all 12, the test bands were faint but otherwise normal and were noted by both readers. One invalid BinaxNOW result was identified. Interoperator agreement (positive versus negative BinaxNOW result) was 100% (n = 2,230/2,230 double reads). Each operator was able to process 20 RDTs per hour. In a separate set of 30 specimens (from individuals with symptoms &#8804;7 days) run at temperatures below the manufacturer's recommended range (46 to 58.5F), sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 95.2%. BinaxNOW had very high specificity in both adults and children and very high sensitivity in newly symptomatic adults. Overall, 95.8% sensitivity was observed with CT values of &#8804;30. These data support public health recommendations for use of the BinaxNOW test in adults with symptoms for &#8804;7 days without RT-PCR confirmation. Excellent interoperator agreement indicates that an individual can perform and read the BinaxNOW test alone. A skilled laboratorian can perform and read 20 tests per hour.

Broad-spectrum antivirals blocking viral entry can be an effective strategy for combating these viruses. Here, we demonstrate a frog-defensin-derived basic peptide (FBP), which broadly inhibits the influenza virus by binding to haemagglutinin so as to block low pH-induced HA-mediated fusion and antagonizes endosomal acidification to inhibit the influenza virus. Moreover, FBP can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike to block spike-mediated cellCcell fusion in 293T/ACE2 cells endocytosis. Omicron spike shows a weak cellCcell fusion mediated by TMPRSS2 in Calu3 cells, making the Omicron variant sensitive to endosomal inhibitors. In vivo studies show that FBP broadly inhibits the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in mice and SARS-CoV-2 (HKU001a and Delta)in hamsters. Notably, FBP shows significant inhibition of Omicron variant replication even though it has a high number of mutations in spike.

Data belonging to the one-year of pandemic, lock-down and gradual normalization periods and their time equivalents were compared retrospectively. RESULTS During pandemic, parasites were detected in 529 of 2.233 samples. Parasites were detected in 58 of the 178 samples during the lock-down period and 471 of the 2.055 samples in the gradual normalization period. Incidence of Cryptosporidium spp. increased during the pandemic and lock-down periods. Incidence of Blastocystis spp. decreased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods. Incidence of Giardia intestinalis decreased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods. Incidence of Entamoeba histolytica/dispar increased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods Incidence of Cyclospora spp. increased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods. Incidence of Enterobius vermicularis decreased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods and no case was seen during the lock-down period. CONCLUSION Although the incidence of parasites gives the impression that COVID-19 does not cause weakness in the fight against intestinal parasitic diseases, there may be parasitic infections with a similar frequency in the society that cannot access the laboratory.

This process is distinct from alternative splicing in eukaryotes, rendering current transcript assembly methods unsuitable to Nidovirales sequencing samples. Here, we introduce the Discontinuous Transcript Assembly problem of finding transcripts and their abundances c given an alignment under a maximum likelihood model that accounts for varying transcript lengths. Underpinning our approach is the concept of a segment graph, a directed acyclic graph that, distinct from the splice graph used to characterize alternative splicing, has a unique Hamiltonian path. We provide a compact characterization of solutions as subsets of non-overlapping edges in this graph, enabling the formulation of an efficient mixed integer linear program. We show using simulations that our method, Jumper, drastically outperforms existing methods for classical transcript assembly. On short-read data of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 samples, we find that Jumper not only identifies canonical transcripts that are part of the reference transcriptome, but also predicts expression of non-canonical transcripts that are well supported by direct evidence from long-read data, presence in multiple, independent samples or a conserved core sequence. Jumper enables detailed analyses of Nidovirales transcriptomes.

Our goals were to provide projections of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, and estimates of important features of disease transmission and clinical progression. In this paper, we outline the model design, implementation and calibration, and describe how projections and estimates were used to meet the changing requirements of policymakers and officials in Connecticut from March 2020 to February 2021. The approach takes advantage of our unique access to Connecticut public health surveillance and hospital data and our direct connection to state officials and policymakers. We calibrated this model to data on deaths and hospitalizations and developed a novel measure of close interpersonal contact frequency to capture changes in transmission risk over time and used multiple local data sources to infer dynamics of time-varying model inputs. Estimated epidemiologic features of the COVID-19 epidemic in Connecticut include the effective reproduction number, cumulative incidence of infection, infection hospitalization and fatality ratios, and the case detection ratio.

Prior work demonstrated that an ensemble of multiple BERT-based ranking models can not only boost the performance, but also reduce the performance variance. However, an ensemble of models is more costly because it needs computing resource and/or inference time proportional to the number of models. In this paper, we study how to retain the performance of an ensemble of models at the inference cost of a single model by distilling the ensemble into a single BERT-based student ranking model. Specifically, we study different designs of teacher labels, various distillation strategies, as well as multiple distillation losses tailored for ranking problems. We conduct experiments on the MS MARCO passage ranking and the TREC-COVID data set. Our results show that even with these simple distillation techniques, the distilled model can effectively retain the performance gain of the ensemble of multiple models. More interestingly, the performances of distilled models are also more stable than models fine-tuned on original labeled data. The results reveal a promising direction to capitalize on the gains achieved by an ensemble of BERT-based ranking models. ? 2021 Owner/Author.","output":"Ensemble Distillation for BERT-Based Ranking Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Telerehabilitation (TR) is a part of telemedicine involved in providing rehabilitation services to people in remote locations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS This study included 227 patients who underwent transperitoneal RAPN for anterior or posterior renal tumors. Tumor position was defined by RENAL nephrometry score. To minimize selection bias between anterior and posterior tumors, patient variables were adjusted using 1:1 propensity score matching. RESULTS Of the 227 patients, 125 were classified as having anterior tumors and 102 as having posterior tumors. After matching, 82 patients were included in each group. The mean preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 66 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean tumor size was 28 to 29 mm. The decrease in early postoperative nadir eGFR (-10% vs -4.0%, p = 0.0103) was significantly higher for posterior tumors than for anterior tumors. However, the difference improved 6 to 12 months after surgery (-6.0% vs -6.2%, p = 0.9564). The other surgical outcomes, including operative time, warm ischemia time (WIT), complications, surgical margin status, and length of hospital stay, were not significantly different between the two groups. In multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, posterior tumors (vs anterior tumor, odds ratio [OR]: 2.30, p = 0.0051), longer WIT (OR: 3.10, p = 0.0019), and high tumor complexity (vs low complexity, OR: 3.46, p = 0.0264) were independent predictors for development of a 10% decrease in early postoperative eGFR.

Understanding the roles of such 'superspreaders' can be crucial in deciding where to direct disease surveillance and controls to greatest effect. In the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain, it has been suggested that a minority of cattle farms or herds might make disproportionate contributions to the spread of Mycobacterium bovis, and hence might be considered 'superspreader farms'. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We review the literature to identify the characteristics of farms that have the potential to contribute to exceptional values in the three main components of the farm reproductive number - Rf : contact rate, infectiousness and duration of infectiousness, and therefore might characterize potential superspreader farms for bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. RESULTS: Farms exhibit marked heterogeneity in contact rates arising from between-farm trading of cattle. A minority of farms act as trading hubs that greatly augment connections within cattle trading networks. Herd infectiousness might be increased by high within-herd transmission or the presence of supershedding individuals, or infectiousness might be prolonged due to undetected infections or by repeated local transmission, via wildlife or fomites. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting control methods on putative superspreader farms might yield disproportionate benefits in controlling endemic bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain.

METHODS: We conducted a single centre, retrospective observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted between 1st March and 30th April 2020 subsequently diagnosed with PE following computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Patient demographics, comorbidities, presenting complaints and inpatient investigations were recorded. RESULTS: We identified 15 COVID-19 patients diagnosed with PE (median age = 58 years [IQR = 23], 87% male). 2 died (13%), both male patients >70 years. Most common symptoms were dyspnoea (N = 10, 67%) and fever (N = 7, 47%). 12 (80%) reported 7 days or more of non-resolving symptoms prior to admission. 7 (47%) required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), 2 (13%) of which were subsequently intubated. All patients had significantly raised D-dimer levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and prothrombin times. The distribution of PEs correlated with the pattern of consolidation observed on CTPA in 9 (60%) patients; the majority being peripheral or subsegmental (N = 14, 93%) and only 1 central PE. 10 (67%) had an abnormal resting electrocardiogram (ECG), the commonest finding being sinus tachycardia. 6 (40%) who underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) had structurally and functionally normal right hearts.

Machine learning algorithms trained on the 2D-MBBA data substantially improve the prediction of neutralization capacity against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus of serum samples of convalescent patients. The algorithms also helped identify a set of antibody isotype-antigen datasets that contributed to the prediction, which included those targeting regions outside the receptor-binding interface of the spike protein. We applied the assay to profile samples from vaccinated, immune-compromised patients, which revealed differences in the antibody profiles between convalescent and vaccinated samples. Our approach can rapidly provide deep antibody profiles and neutralization prediction from essentially a drop of blood without the need of BSL-3 access and provides insights into the nature of neutralizing antibodies. It may be further developed for evaluating neutralizing capacity for new variants and future pathogens.","output":"Two-dimensional multiplexed assay for rapid and deep SARS-CoV-2 serology profiling and for machine learning prediction of neutralization capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laboratory testing is an important component in the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, specimen collection not only risks exposure of health care workers and other patients to infection, but also necessitates use of personal protective equipment that may be in short supply during periods of heightened disease activity. Self-collection of nasal or oropharyngeal swabs offers an alternative to address these drawbacks. Although studies in the past decade have demonstrated the utility of this approach for respiratory infections, it has not been widely adopted in routine clinical practice. The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has focused attention on the need for safe, convenient, timely, and scalable methods for collecting upper respiratory specimens for testing. The goals of this article are to highlight the literature regarding self-collected nasal or oropharyngeal specimens for respiratory pathogen testing; discuss the role of self-collection in helping prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease from infected patients and facilitating a shift toward virtual medicine or telemedicine; and describe the current and future state of self-collection for infectious agents, and the impacts these approaches can have on population health management and disease diagnosis and prevention.","output":"Evolution of Specimen Self-Collection in the COVID-19 Era: Implications for Population Health Management of Infectious Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ischemic injury is a major cause of several cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, and ventricular remodeling. Using an in vitro hypoxia model to mimic ischemia, we found that hypoxia stimulated Wnt3a expression. A mechanistic study showed that hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) was directly recruited to the Wnt3a promoter. Wnt3a overexpression significantly decreased cell viability, promoted the generation of apoptotic cells, and enhanced hypoxia-induced injury in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. This was partially through the upregulation of Caspase-3 mRNA levels and cleaved PARP-1 protein levels. In addition, we observed that Wnt3a exacerbated hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytosolic release of cytochrome C. Furthermore, we found that Sirt3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase that modulates mitochondrial metabolism and homeostasis, was negatively regulated by Wnt3a. Conversely, Sirt3 overexpression repressed Wnt3a expression and ameliorated the hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, our findings suggest that the hypoxia-Wnt3a-Sirt3 regulatory axis might be a potential target for cell protection in cardiac ischemia and hypoxia.","output":"Hypoxia exacerbates cardiomyocyte injury via upregulation of Wnt3a and inhibition of Sirt3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE TaG3 bladder cancer is an under-investigated disease and because of its rarity it is commonly studies together with T1G3 disease. We sought to exclusively study TaG3 disease and to determine the factors associated with disease progression. MATERIAL AND METHOD We retrospectively studied patients with primary TaG3 bladder cancer. Progression to pT1 and pT2 were analyzed using Cox and competing-risk regression analyses. RESULTS Of 3,505 consecutive patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, 285 patients had primary TaG3 without concomitant carcinoma in-situ. Progression to pT1 occurred in 21 patients (7.4%). In a multivariable competing-risk regression analysis, intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was significantly associated with a lower risk of progression to pT1 (HR 0.23, 95%CI 0.08-0.64, P = 0.005). Recurrence in the first year of diagnosis was significantly associated with an increased risk of stage progression to pT1 (HR 7.81, 95%CI 2.50-24.44, P < 0.001). Progression to T2 was observed in 9 patients (3.2%). In univariable competing-risk regression analyses, intravesical BCG was significantly associated with a lower risk of progression to pT2 (HR 0.11, 95%CI 0.04-0.47, P = 0.003). On the other hand, recurrence in the first year of diagnosis was significantly associated with an increased risk of stage progression to T2 (HR 7.12, 95%CI 1.50-33.77, P = 0.013). In a subgroup of 199 patients who were treated with BCG, there was no statistically significant association between tumor recurrence in the 1st year of diagnosis and stage progression to pT1 (P = 0.14) or pT2(P = 0.19). CONCLUSION Patients with TaG3 bladder cancer are considered high risk but if appropriately treated with BCG that risk is considerably mitigated. Our data support that TaG3 without concomitant carcinoma in-situ should not be considered as aggressive as T1G3 as it has a lower risk of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Recurrence in the first year after diagnosis is the strongest predictor of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer.","output":"Primary Ta high grade bladder tumors: Determination of the risk of progression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In machine learning tasks an actual ground truth may not be available. Then, machines often have to rely on human labelling of data. This becomes challenging the more subjective the learning task is, as human agreement can be low. To cope with the resulting high uncertainty, one could train individual models reflecting a single humans opinion. However, this is not viable, if one aims at mirroring the general opinion of a hypothetical completely average person C the average Jane. Here, I summarise approaches to optimally learn efficiently in such a case. First, different strategies of reaching a single learning target from several labellers will be discussed. This includes varying labeller trustability and the case of time-continuous labels with potential dynamics. As human labelling is a labour-intensive endeavour, active and cooperative learning strategies can help reduce the number of labels needed. Next, sample informativeness can be exploited in teacher-based algorithms to additionally weigh data by certainty. In addition, multi-target learning of different labeller tracks in parallel and/or of the uncertainty can help improve the model robustness and provide an additional uncertainty measure. Cross-modal strategies to reduce uncertainty offer another view. From these and further recent strategies, I distil a number of future avenues to handle subjective uncertainty in machine learning. These comprise bigger, yet weakly labelled data processing basing amongst other on reinforcement learning, lifelong learning, and self-learning. Illustrative examples stem from the fields of Affective Computing and Digital Health C both notoriously marked by subjectivity uncertainty.","output":"Average Jane, Where Art Thou?

Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. VE was defined as (1- estimate). ResultsSeven RCTs (51,169 participants), 10 cohort studies (14,385,909 participants) and 16 case-control studies (734,607 cases) were included.

Apart from dromedary camels, insectivorous bats are suggested as another natural reservoir for MERS-like-CoVs. In order to gain insight on the tropism of these viruses in bats, we studied the DPP4 distribution in the respiratory and extra-respiratory tissues of two frugivorous bat species (Epomophorus gambianus and Rousettus aegyptiacus) and two insectivorous bat species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Eptesicus serotinus). In the frugivorous bats, DPP4 was present in epithelial cells of both the respiratory and the intestinal tract, similar to what has been reported for camels and humans. In the insectivorous bats, however, DPP4 expression in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract was almost absent. The preferential expression of DPP4 in the intestinal tract of insectivorous bats, suggests that transmission of MERS-like-CoVs mainly occurs via the fecal-oral route.

Here, we found MP activation in human diabetic retinopathy, especially in neovessels from human neovascular membranes in proliferative retinopathy, including TNF- expression. There was similar activation in the mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model of ischemia-induced neovascularization. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are in clinical use for glycemic control in diabetes and are also known to modulate microglia. Herein, we investigated the effect of a long-acting GLP-1R agonist, NLY01. Following intravitreal administration, NLY01 selectively localized to MPs in retina with OIR. NLY01 modulated MPs but not retinal endothelial cell viability, apoptosis, and tube formation in vitro. In OIR, NLY01 treatment inhibited MP infiltration and activation, including MP expression of cytokines in vivo. NLY01 significantly suppressed global induction of retinal inflammatory cytokines, promoted reparative angiogenesis, and suppressed pathologic retinal neovascularization.

Little is known about how race and ethnicity, imperfect (albeit accessible) proxies for structural racism, impact COVID-19 incidence among people with HIV (PWH). We report the cumulative incidence and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for COVID-19 in a long-term multi-site cohort of PWH across the US Figure 1. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the CNICS cohort Methods. We examined COVID-19 cumulative incidence and IRR among PWH in care between 3/1/2020 and 12/31/2020 at seven sites in the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort. We define COVID-19 incident case as having a laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR/Ag) SARS-CoV-2 positive result or diagnosis verified by chart review. Reinfections were excluded. Results are presented as monthly and quarterly cumulative incidence and IRR with 95% CI stratified by CD4 count, self-reported race/ethnicity, and site. Follow-up was censored on the earliest of diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, loss to follow up, or 12/31/2020 Results. Among 15,780 PWH in care in the CNICS cohort during the study period, 62% were non-white, with a median (IQR) age of 52 (IQR 40-59), 95% were on antiretroviral therapy, 17% had a CD4 count less than 350, and 6% less than 200. Overall, 651 PWH tested positive for COVID-19 for a cumulative incidence of 4.13%. COVID-19 cumulative incidence increased from 0.77% at the end of the first quarter to 4.12% by the end of December 2020. At the peak of the pandemic in December 2020, the cumulative incidence in Black PWH was 1.68 fold higher than in white PWH (p=.033) and 2.35 fold higher in Hispanics than in whites (P< .0001), figure 1. Similarly, the IRR for COVID-19 was 1.71 (95% CI 1.42-2.07) for Black and 2.40 (95% CI 1.91-3.01) for Hispanic PWH relative to white. Although there was variation across sites, reflecting geographic differences in pandemic waves and access to COVID-19 testing, overall individual trends remained the same.

This cohort comprised of patients with heterogenous disease stages from single liver lesions to multiple organ systems involvement commonly following multiple chemotherapy lines. Data was reviewed retrospectively for patient demographics, previous therapies, initial or disease stages at first intervention, comorbidities and mortality. Comorbidity was measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and age-adjusted Charlson Index (CACI) excluding mCRC as the index disease. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Overall median survival of 266 patients was 14 months. Age  70 years did not influence survival after local therapies. Similarly, CCI or CACI did not affect the patients prognoses in multivariate analyses.

This cross-sectional study builds on a proof-of-concept, the AMORE Project and provides a baseline assessment of accessibility to urgent tertiary care at peak and free-flow traffic times in Cali. It makes the case for assessing travel time over distance and accounting for traffic congestion. This study indicates that people in vulnerable situations have to travel longer and therefore invest more of their personal direct and indirect resources to access tertiary care emergency departments than the average population. This study emphasizes the added value of integrating new data sources that can inform health services and urban planning. These new data sources merit future testing by concerned stakeholders. This study used the digital AMORE Platform to show the effects of traffic congestion on equitable access to tertiary care emergency departments. The data shows which populations take longer to reach a facility within a time threshold under different traffic congestion levels. The broader proof-of-concept assesses the value of new data obtained by integrating secondary data from publicly available sources. These sources combine geospatial analysis with census microdata, health services location data, and bigdata for travel times. The analysis covered the city of Cali, which has 2.258 million residents and is the third-largest city in Colombia. The analysis shows the projected accessibility assessments for two weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic, 6 to 12 July 2020, and 23 to 29 November 2020. Restrictions on car travel had been lifted before the July assessment, but stay-at-home orders were in place during the November assessment, which showed substantially less traffic. This assessment found that traffic congestion sharply reduces accessibility to tertiary emergency care. Reduced access has the greatest impact on people with less education, those living in low-income households or on the periphery of Cali, and specific ethnic groups (e.g., nomadic people like the Rrom, and Afro-descendants). This assessment also identifies the concentration of tertiary care emergency departments in areas of lower population density, leaving large swaths of the population with poor accessibility. Dashboards were used to report data using simple univariate and bivariate analyses. In July 2020, the estimated overall accessibility at peak traffic hours was 37% and in November 2020 it increased to 57% due to reduced traffic congestion.

We found that a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 6.11 at admission discriminated a higher risk for mortality. Importantly, however, corticosteroid treatment in such individuals was associated with a lower risk of 60-day all-cause mortality. Conversely, in individuals with an NLR &#8804; 6.11 or with type 2 diabetes, corticosteroid treatment was not associated with reduced mortality, but rather increased risks of hyperglycemia and infections. These results show that in the studied cohort corticosteroid treatment is associated with beneficial outcomes in a subset of COVID-19 patients who are non-diabetic and with severe symptoms as defined by NLR.","output":"The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Determines Clinical Efficacy of Corticosteroid Therapy in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Sustainability is increasingly concerned with the complex interactions between nature and society, and we need to seek solutions towards the challenges that threaten humanity's collective wellbeing.

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic approach to schedule PPE orders among healthcare facilities. In this PPE game, each independent healthcare facility optimises its own storage utilisation in order to keep its PPE cost at a minimum. Such a model can reduce peak demand considerably when applied to a variable PPE consumption profile. Experiments conducted for NHS England regions using actual data confirm that the challenge of securing PPE supply during disasters such as COVID-19 can be eased if proper stock management procedures are adopted. These procedures can include early stockpiling, increasing storage capacities and implementing measures that can prolong the time period between successive infection waves, such as social distancing measures. Simulation results suggest that the provision of PPE dedicated storage space can be a viable solution to avoid straining PPE supply chains in case a second wave of COVID-19 infections occurs.","output":"Game theory to enhance stock management of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests. Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also less sensitive. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage. India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop. 227.9 million) and Bihar (pop. 121.3 million) use a much higher proportion of such tests. Here we show, using simulations based on epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met. These are (a) that RAT test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions for increased effectiveness. We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test pricing. We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable, from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions outlined above are met.","output":"Optimizing testing for COVID-19 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between hypertension and outcome in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.

The global expression profiles of root tissues collected from low and high N treatments at different time points in two rice genotypes, Pokkali and Bengal, with contrasting responses to N stress and contrasting root architectures were examined. Overall, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Pokkali (indica) was higher than in Bengal (japonica) during low N and early N recovery treatments. Most low N DEGs in both genotypes were downregulated whereas early N recovery DEGs were upregulated. Of these, 148 Pokkali-specific DEGs might contribute to Pokkali's advantage under N stress. These DEGs included transcription factors and transporters and were involved in stress responses, growth and development, regulation, and metabolism. Many DEGs are co-localized with quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to root growth and development, chlorate-resistance, and NUE. Our findings suggest that the superior growth performance of Pokkali under low N conditions could be due to the genetic differences in a diverse set of genes influencing N uptake through the regulation of root architecture.","output":"Comparative Transcriptomics of Rice Genotypes with Contrasting Responses to Nitrogen Stress Reveals Genes Influencing Nitrogen Uptake through the Regulation of Root Architecture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper illustrates the results of a qualitative research conducted in fourteen residential care services for minors in Friuli Venezia Giulia.

The level of knowledge about delirium is often insufficient among nursing and medical staff. At the current time there is no suitable questionnaire to record the level of knowledge in German-speaking countries. AIM: Development of a questionnaire and evaluation of content validity. METHODS: Following a literature search to identify current best practice, several questionnaires were identified. An already published questionnaire with the dimensions of basic knowledge of delirium and risk factors has been translated, adapted and extended by the dimension of nonpharmacological delirium prevention. Delirium experts assessed the relevance of the questionnaire items in two rounds of reviews. Content validity was calculated using the Content Validity Index (CVI) at item (I-CVI) and scale (S-CVI) level. Additionally, the modified Kappa (k*) was calculated using a lower 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The original 30-item questionnaire was expanded to include 18 delirium prevention items. After the first round of scoring 30 out of 48 items showed good to excellent I?CVI scores. Considering the comments, 6 items were discarded and 12 were adapted in terms of language and content. In the final version of the questionnaire 41 items with excellent scores remained. The total scale score increased from 0.88 in the first version to 1.0 in the final version.

This study examined our hypothesis that, during vascular remodeling after stroke, treatment with atorvastatin could facilitate BBB maturation in remodeling vasculature in ischemic brain. Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion (MCAO/RP). Atorvastatin, at dose of 3 mg/kg, was delivered daily starting at 14 days after MCAO/RP onset for 7 days. The rats were studied at multiple time points up to 8 weeks with multimodal-MRI, behavior tests, immunohistochemistry, and biochemistry. The delayed treatment of atorvastatin significantly reduced infarct size and BBB permeability, restored cerebral blood flow, and improved the neurological outcome at 8 weeks after MCAO/RP. Postmortem studies showed that atorvastatin promoted angiogenesis and stabilized the newly formed vessels in peri-infarct areas. Importantly, atorvastatin facilitated maturation of BBB properties in the new vessels by promoting endothelial tight junction (TJ) formation. Further in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that proliferating peri-vascular pericytes expressing neural-glial antigen 2 (NG2) mediated the role of atorvastatin on BBB maturation through regulating endothelial TJ strand formations. Our results suggested a therapeutic potential of atorvastatin in facilitating a full BBB integrity and functional stroke recovery, and an essential role for pericyte-mediated endothelial TJ formation in remodeling vasculature.","output":"Treatment with Atorvastatin During Vascular Remodeling Promotes Pericyte-Mediated Blood-Brain Barrier Maturation Following Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the significant and high death toll of COVID-19 on care home residents and social care staff in England and Wales.

HOTTIP, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), participates in cell proliferation and invasion. However, the correlation between HOTTIP and RA remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify how HOTTIP works in RA and to investigate its role in the development of RA. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle progression. Binding between HOTTIP, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and miR-1908-5p was demonstrated by dual-luciferase assays. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of T cell differentiation-related proteins. We found that HOTTIP was upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). HOTTIP directly bound to miR-1908-5p and negatively modulated miR-1908-5p expression while positively regulating STAT3. The effects of HOTTIP overexpression on regulating the balance of the Th17/Treg cell ratio were partly reversed by miR-1908-5p overexpression. In addition, in vivo experiments demonstrated that overexpression of HOTTIP aggravated inflammation in RA mice, which was demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and the increased expression levels of CD4+ interleukin (IL)-17+, forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) and retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma-t (RORt). In summary, our study suggests that HOTTIP plays a damaging role in RA by promoting inflammation, which may be related to the regulation of miR-1908-5p expression and the STAT3 signaling pathway.

Also, we want to evaluate the causes of the increased number of cases of sporotrichosis in the pediatric population such as environmental changes in endemic areas, the biodiversity, and virulence among the pathogenic clade causing sporotrichosis in different areas of the globe, and especially the progression of the zoonotic transmission of infections caused by Sporothrix brasiliensis infections, associated to zoonotic transmission in Brazil and other endemic sporotrichosis countries. RECENT FINDINGS: After evaluating a case series of 40 patients, we found that pediatric sporotrichosis in Mexico is mainly caused by Sporothrix schenckii which prevails in rural areas and is mainly sapronotically transmitted. In Brazil, the longest and largest pediatric sporotrichosis outbreak is caused by Sporothrix brasiliensis, etiologically related to sick cats, directly from lesions containing a high yeast cell burden. When affecting children S. schenckii and S. brasiliensis may cause distinct clinical manifestations especially in the onset of the disease and affected anatomical site. In Mexico, most of the patients are successfully treated with potassium iodide, whereas in Brazil, all patients respond to itraconazole. SUMMARY: Sporothrix schenckii is the major etiologic agent in Mexico, being sapronotically transmitted, while in Brazil, Sporothrix brasiliensis is only transmitted by cats. In Mexico, the disease prevails in male patients (60%) from rural areas; in Brazil, the disease is more frequent in females (60%) from an urban region. Due to the zoonotic sporotrichosis outbreak in Brazil, the time of evolution seems to be shorter in Brazilian patients than in Mexican patients. Most Brazilian patients presented with facial lesions, including ocular involvement, while in Mexico, most of the children presented upper limbs involvement. In Mexico, treatment with potassium iodide in children was observed to induce faster remission than itraconazole, but controlled studies are lacking to evaluate this versus itraconazole, due to the low number of cases. A comparative study should be designed to evaluate the best and safest antifungal therapy for pediatric sporotrichosis.

METHODS: We sent an online survey to physicians, advanced practice providers, and registered nurses redeployed to COVID-19 care sites at an academic medical center from March to May 2020. We asked about the use of medications and perceived effectiveness of medications to treat symptoms of COVID-19 and the perceived challenge of symptom management. Comparison was made by provider type (episodic or longitudinal site of care). RESULTS: Responses from 64 providers were included. The most frequently used medications were acetaminophen (87.1% of respondents), benzonatate (83.9%), and albuterol metered dose inhalers (MDI) (80.6%). Therapies for lower respiratory tract symptoms were reported as more commonly used by longitudinal follow-up providers compared to episodic providers including guaifenesin (90.6% vs 60.0%, p = 0.007), benzonatate (93.8% vs 73.3%, p = 0.04), nebulized albuterol for patients with asthma (75.0% vs 43.3%, p = 0.019), and albuterol MDIs for patients without asthma (90.6% vs 66.7%, p = 0.029). Medications found to have the highest perceived efficacy by respondents using the therapy (> 80% reporting very efficacious) included albuterol, acetaminophen for fever, non-sedating antihistamines, nasal steroid spray, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for myalgia, arthralgia, or headache. Lower respiratory symptoms and anxiety were rated as the most challenging symptoms to manage. CONCLUSIONS: Providers reported that clinical care of mild COVID-19 with medications in common use for other respiratory infections is effective, both at episodic care and longitudinal sites of care, but that specific symptoms are still challenging to manage.

To facilitate the management of the pandemic in Italy, it is essential to understand the level of attention on COVID-19. The aim of the study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practices towards SARS-CoV-2 among the nursing students of University of Palermo during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The current study was a cross-sectional study. On-line questionnaires were used for the collection of the data by providing a survey in all nursing students. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: demographics and Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) survey. A multivariate linear regression model was used and adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) are presented. RESULTS: 525 students were interviewed and their mean age was 21.8.

In this regard, vitamin D supplementation, particularly in individuals likely to be deficient, may be a promising option. Vitamin D is a hormone that modulates many of the same inflammatory and oxidative signaling pathways triggered during COVID-19. For example, vitamin D suppresses the actions of the renin-angiotensin system, which has a determining role in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response related to COVID-19. This paper analyzes the evidence that vitamin D supplementation might be a valuable preventive/therapeutic measure in groups at risk for or infected with COVID-19.

This number is increasing further due to COVID-19 and the associated automation of education and testing.

Most of the papers proposing new models rely only on quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) based agreement with human raters for showing model efficacy. However, this effectively ignores the highly multi-feature nature of essay scoring. Essay scoring depends on features like coherence, grammar, relevance, sufficiency and, vocabulary. To date, there has been no study testing Automated Essay Scoring: AES systems holistically on all these features. With this motivation, we propose a model agnostic adversarial evaluation scheme and associated metrics for AES systems to test their natural language understanding capabilities and overall robustness. We evaluate the current state-of-the-art AES models using the proposed scheme and report the results on five recent models. These models range from feature-engineering-based approaches to the latest deep learning algorithms. We find that AES models are highly overstable. Even heavy modifications(as much as 25%) with content unrelated to the topic of the questions do not decrease the score produced by the models. On the other hand, irrelevant content, on average, increases the scores, thus showing that the model evaluation strategy and rubrics should be reconsidered.

MERS CoV encodes 2 proteases, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). These proteases share in processing MERS CoV polyproteins at different sites to yield 16 nonstructural proteins. In this work, we provide evidence that MERS CoV 3CLpro and PLpro are subject to different genetic and evolutionary influences that shape the protein sequence, codon usage pattern, and codon usage bias. Compositional bias is present in both proteins due to a preference for AT nucleotides. Thymidine (T) was highly preferred at the third position of codons, preferred and overrepresented codons in PLpro, but was replaced by guanosine (G) in 3CLpro. Compositional constraints were important in PLpro but not in 3CLpro. Directed mutation pressure seems to have a strong influence on 3CLpro codon usage, which is more than 30-fold higher than that in PLpro. Translational selection was evident with PLpro but not with 3CLpro. Both proteins are less immunogenic by showing low CpG frequencies. Correspondence analysis reveals the presence of 3 genetic clusters based on codon usage in PLpro and 3CLpro. Every protein had one common cluster and 2 different clusters. As revealed by correspondence analysis, the number of influences on codon usage are restricted in MERS CoV 3CLpro. In contrast, PLpro is controlled by a broader range of compositional, mutational, and other influences. This may be due to the multifunctional protease, deubiquitination, and innate immunity suppressing profiles of PLpro.","output":"Synonymous and Biased Codon Usage by MERS CoV Papain-Like and 3CL-Proteases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high longitudinal and lateral coherence of synchrotron X-rays sources radically transformed radiography.

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. The reduction in international travel, social distancing measures and public health action have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Cases of COVID-19 continue to be notified by jurisdictions, albeit at a slowed rate. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. In the past reporting week new cases in Australia are mostly considered to be locally acquired, consistent with the drop in international travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years, with a third of these cases associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, cases continue to increase, with some areas such as Brazil and India showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have currently reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of disease occurrence.","output":"COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 15 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEST 10 May 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Observational analysis of percutaneous repositioning of displaced port-catheters in patients with dysfunctional central-venous port-systems. METHODS A total of 1061 patients with dysfunctional venous pectoral port-systems were referred for port-angiography. Dislocated port-catheters were identified in 37 (3.5 %) patients (11 males, mean age 58.1  7.2 [range 48-69] years; 26 females, 57.0  13.5 [range 24-75] years) 3.9  6.6 months (range 1 day-26 months) after port-implantation. Percutaneous repositioning in all patients was performed by transfemoral catheter maneuvers, snaring, or wire-assisted long-loop snaring. Primary endpoint was successful repositioning. Safety endpoints included port-damage or procedure-related complications. Follow-up encompassed routine clinical and radiological controls, including chest X-ray or computed tomography for 12.9  17.9 (range 1-81) months. RESULTS Clinical signs of port-dysfunction due to dislocation of port-catheters included difficult aspiration in 23 (62.2 %), resistance or inability to inject in 17 (46.0 %), and pain during injection in 2 (5.4 %) patients. Primary technical success for repositioning displaced port-catheters was 97.3 % (36/37 patients). In 1 (2.7 %) patient, repositioning failed due to complete embedding of the port-catheter in an extensive chronic jugular vein thrombosis (Paget-von-Schroetter syndrome) that prevented endovascular access to the port-catheter. Redisplacement occurred after initial successful repositioning: immediately in two patients due to a too short port-catheter (two-tailed Fisher's exact-test, p = 0.0101), and in two patients with appropriate catheter-length after 5, resp. 7 months. No procedure-associated complications, e.g., port-catheter disconnection or disruption, occurred. CONCLUSIONS Repositioning of dysfunctional displaced central-venous port-catheters with appropriate catheter-length is safe and effective. Even challenging conditions, e.g., wall-adherent port-catheter tip or a thrombosed catheter-bearing vein are feasible. Repositioning of too short port-catheters is ineffective.","output":"Percutaneous Re-positioning of Dislocated Port-Catheters in Patients with Dysfunctional Central-Vein Port-Systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults appear to be more susceptible to the coronavirus disease.

Our objective was to compare short-term intra and post-operative complication rates of bilateral total salpingectomy versus partial salpingectomy performed during the course of a cesarean delivery. METHODS A large series of tubal sterilizations during cesarean sections were studied in a single tertiary medical center between 1/2014 and 8/2016 before and after a policy change was made, switching from partial salpingectomy to total salpingectomy. Patients who underwent bilateral partial salpingectomy using the modified Pomeroy technique were compared with those who underwent total salpingectomy. Operative length, estimated blood loss, postpartum fever, wound infection, need for re-laparotomy, hospitalization length, and blood transfusions were compared. RESULTS During the study period, 149 women met inclusion criteria. Fifty parturients underwent bilateral total salpingectomy and 99 underwent partial salpingectomy in the course of the cesarean section. Demographic, obstetrical, and surgical characteristics were similar in both groups. Mean cesarean section duration was comparable for partial salpingectomy and total salpingectomy (a median of 35 min in both groups, P = 0.92).

The present study deviates from the bulk of study in the literature with the incorporation of both aggregated and disaggregated measures of economic development on the environmental degradation function. For the empirical analysis, the study employed the Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach of cointegration to analyse the long-run and short-run relationship during 1971C2014. Further, the direction of the causality is investigated through the Wald test approach. The results revealed that the conventional EKC hypothesis does not hold in India in both aggregated and disaggregated models since economic growth and its component have a U-shaped impact on the environmental quality in India. However, the effect of population on environmental quality is positive but not significant in the aggregated model. Whereas, in the disaggregated model, it is significantly affecting environmental quality. Hence, it is possible to infer that the population of the country increases, the demand for energy consumption increase tremendously, particularly consumption of fossil fuel like coal, oil, and natural gas, and is also evident from the energy structure coefficient from both models. This increase is due to the scarcity of renewable energy for meeting the needs of people. On the contrary, urbanization reduces environmental degradation, which may be due to improved living conditions in terms of efficient infrastructure and energy efficiency in the urban area leading to a negative relation between urbanization and environmental degradation.","output":"Impact of Economic Structure on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Racial/ethnic minorities experience more severe outcomes of COVID-19 in the general United States (US) population. The aim of this study was to examine the association between race/ethnicity and COVID-19 hospitalization, ventilation status, and mortality in people with rheumatic disease. METHODS US patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 entered into the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry March 24 - August 26, 2020 were included. Race/ethnicity was defined as white, Black, Latinx, Asian and other/mixed race. Outcomes included hospitalization, requirement for ventilatory support, and death. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals controlling for age, sex, smoking, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities, medications taken prior to infection, and rheumatic disease activity. RESULTS A total of 1,324 patients were included, of whom 36% were hospitalized and 6% died; 26% of hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation. In multivariable models, Black (OR=2.74, 95% CI 1.90, 3.95), Latinx (OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.18, 2.49), and Asian (OR=2.69, 95% CI 1.16, 6.24) patients had higher odds of being hospitalized compared to white patients. Latinx patients also had three-fold increased odds of requiring ventilatory support (OR=3.25, 95% CI 1.75, 6.05). No differences in mortality based on race/ethnicity were found, though power may have been limited to detect associations. CONCLUSION Similar to findings in the general US population, racial/ethnic minorities with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 had increased odds of hospitalization and ventilatory support. These results illustrate significant health disparities related to COVID-19 in people with rheumatic diseases. The rheumatology community should proactively address the needs of patients currently experiencing inequitable health outcomes during the pandemic.","output":"Race/ethnicity association with COVID-19 outcomes in rheumatic disease: Data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance Physician Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the dynamic return and volatility connectedness for some dominant industrial (Aluminium, Copper, Lead, Nickel, Tin, and Zinc) and precious metals (Gold, Palladium, Platinum, Silver) to crude oil shocks (risk, demand, and supply) during the sample period between January 2, 2009 and July 17, 2020.

DESIGN: Explorative, qualitative study using problem-centred interviews. Interview data were analysed using structured qualitative content analysis. SETTING: Telephone interviews with nurses of different settings of palliative and inpatient hospice care. PARTICIPANTS: 16 nurses from inpatient hospice, palliative care units and specialised palliative home care were recruited. RESULTS: COVID-19 infection control measures placed both physical and psychological strain on palliative care nurses. Due to changes in infection control information, workflows were being readjusted on a daily basis, preventing everyday routines and hindering relief from stress. There are reduced and limited opportunities for sharing and reflecting on daily working routines with team colleagues. Specific causes of stress in the individual settings of palliative and inpatient hospice care were identified. Overall, there is a tension between the nurses perceptions of proper palliative care nursing, in terms of closeness, psychosocial and emotional support and compliance with infection control measures. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care nurses have been exposed to high levels of both physical and psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires rapid relief and support, with a need to ensure continuity of professional supervision and peer-support, which may be facilitated via digital technologies.

By clustering analysis, four groups (i.e., group of anxiety, depression, anger, and indifference) were derived. Then, this study examined how each of the emotional groups differently affect the shopping-related motivations (i.e., mood alleviation, shopping enjoyment, socialization seeking, and self-control seeking) and shopping behaviors (i.e., shopping for high-priced goods and buying of bulk goods).

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mental health status was assessed using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21), and insomnia was evaluated by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Samples were categorized into the frontline and non-frontline groups. Chi-square, odds ratio, and independent t-tests were used to compare groups by demographic and mental health outcomes. Results This study included 1139 HCWs working in Oman. There was a total of 368 (32.3%), 388 (34.1%), 271 (23.8%), and 211 (18.5%) respondents reported to have depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia, respectively while working during the pandemic period. HCWs in the frontline group were 1.4 times more likely to have anxiety (OR=1.401, p=0.007) and stress (OR=1.404, p=0.015) as compared to those working in the non-frontline group. On indices of sleep-wake cycles, HCWs in the frontline group were 1.37 times more likely to report insomnia (OR=1.377, p=0.037) when compared to those working in the non-frontline group. No significant differences in depression status between workers in the frontline and non-frontline groups were found (p=0.181). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different grades of HCWs. This study suggests that frontline HCWs are disproportionally affected compared to non-frontline HCWs. The problem with managing sleep-wake cycles and anxiety symptoms were highly endorsed among frontline HCWs. As psychosocial interventions are likely to be constrained owing to the pandemic, mental health care must first be directed to frontline HCWs.","output":"Factors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes in Oman during COVID19: Frontline vs Non-frontline Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a globally devastating impact. This highly contagious virus has significantly overburdened and undermined medical systems. While most infected patients experience only mild symptoms, those who are severely affect require urgent medical interventions and some develop acute respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation. The broad and potentially deadly impact of infection underscores the critical need for early recognition, especially for those at risk for respiratory failure. Those who are severely impacted and at high risk for respiratory failure have been found to present high levels of serum cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Timely diagnosis and management of those at risk for respiratory failure is crucial. Measurement of IL-6 may provide a means for distinguishing such patients. Currently, most serum IL-6 detection relies on the use of laboratory-based conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Although some rapid assays have been developed recently, they need to be conducted by specific technicians in central laboratory settings with advanced and expensive equipment. In this study, we propose an IL-6 test strip combined with a spectrum-based optical reader for early recognition of COVID-19-infected patients at imminent risk of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilator support. For our analyses, clinical demographic data and sera samples were obtained from three medical centers, and test strip specificity and detection performance were analyzed.

The propositions state that most interaction situations with strangers are benign (Proposition 1), that most strangers are benign (Proposition 2), and that most interactions with strangers enhance well-being (Proposition 3). These propositions are supported, first, by recent research designed to illuminate the primary features of interaction situations, showing that situations with strangers often represent low conflict of interest. Second, in our interactions with strangers, most people exhibit high levels of low-cost cooperation (social mindfulness) and high-cost helping if help to strangers is urgent.

It is unclear whether such differences are due to factors at the level of the human host, or at the level of the coronavirus, or both. At the host level, the entry proteins which allow virus binding and entry have variants with distinct properties, and the frequency of such variants differs between ethnicities. At the level of the virus, the D614G mutation enhances virus entry to the host cell. Since the two virus strains (D614 and G614) coexisted in the first six months of the pandemic in most populations, it has been difficult to distinguish between contributions of the virus and contributions of the host for anosmia. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in South Asian populations when either the D614 or the G614 virus was dominant. We show that populations infected predominantly with the G614 virus had a much higher prevalence of anosmia (pooled prevalence of 31.8%) compared with the same ethnic populations infected mostly with the D614 virus strain (pooled anosmia prevalence of 5.3%). We conclude that the D614G mutation is a major contributing factor that increases the prevalence of anosmia in COVID-19, and that this enhanced effect on olfaction constitutes a previously unrecognized phenotype of the D614G mutation. The new virus strains that have additional mutations on the background of the D614G mutation can be expected to cause a similarly increased prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions.","output":"The D614G Virus Mutation Enhances Anosmia in COVID-19 Patients: Evidence from a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Studies from South Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics, severity, and treatment of patients with acute appendicitis in Korea over a 2-year period during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic compared to those before the pandemic.

We divided the patients into three groups (pre-pandemic, before vaccination, and after vaccination) and analyzed the clinical outcomes. Results: : The time from symptom onset to hospital arrival and the time from symptom onset to operation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period. The rate of complicated appendicitis during the pandemic was higher than that before the pandemic. In addition, the number of new daily cases showed a positive correlation with the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (OR, 0.03;95% CI, 0.02 to 0.04;P<0.001) and complicated appendicitis (OR, 1.002;95% CI, 1.001C1.002;P=0.0017). The vaccination rate showed a negative correlation with the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (OR, -2.26;95% CI, -3.42 to -1.11;P<0.001) and complicated appendicitis (OR, 0.915;95% CI, 0.84 to 0.996;P=0.0404). Conclusions: : Employing hospital-wide efforts, such as screening by rapid PCR testing, to avoid further time delays, and nationwide efforts, such as vaccination, to shorten the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival, are necessary to maintain the quality of treatment of acute appendicitis during an infectious disease pandemic.","output":"The Impact of the Coronavirus Disease - 19 Pandemic on the Treatment of Acute Appendicitis: Presentation, Outcomes, Strategies of Acute Appendicitis During Coronavirus Disease -19 Pandemic (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This letter discusses mental health situation post-COVID The SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic is a current challenge for the healthcare systems of the world From a descriptive point of view, there are several classifications of the healthcare needs derived from COVID-19, through which the consequences of the pandemic could be studied or analyzed In a few weeks, COVID-19 has put in check the health systems' capacity throughout the world, with almost 3 million people infected, more than 200,000 deaths and 850,000 patients recovered A very important fact to take into account, is that it has occurred in a limited space of time, which has been a unique stress test for the health systems across the world, which have had to adjust in a record time, in order to absorb all demand and meet the needs of the population The second wave has to do with to the health care needs of the general population for reasons other than COVID-19, which begin to appear after the withdrawal of the first wave There are needs related to chronic conditions and the temporary withdrawal of continuity care programs, mostly patients who, during this time, have lowered their self-care protocols, often limited by the confinement circumstances The last wave is the most specific of mental health problems It is a longitudinal and cumulative wave From a conceptual perspective, WHO defines health as the balance between physical, social and psychological well-being There is no doubt that the deployment of health care resources to approach COVID-19 is being memorable (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"PostCOVID mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loudspring Oyj's subsidiary Eagle Filters Oy has decided to start manufacturing high-quality half-mask type FFP2 and FFP3 class respirators in Finland to meet strong Covid-19 demand for personal protective equipment.","output":"Eagle Filters to produce respirators in Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Paediatric vision screening programs identify children with ocular abnormalities who would benefit from treatment by an eye care professional. A questionnaire was conducted to assess existence and uptake of school-based vision screening programs across Canada. A supplementary questionnaire was distributed among Ontario's public health units to determine implementation of government mandated vision screening for senior kindergarten children. Methods Chief Medical Officers of Health for each province and territory, and Ontario's thirty-four public health units were sent a questionnaire to determine: 1) whether school-based vision screening is being implemented; 2) what age groups are screened; 3) personnel used for vision screening; 4) the type of training provided for vision screening personnel; and 5) vision screening tests performed. Results Of the thirteen provinces/territories in Canada, six perform some form of school-based vision screening. Two provinces rely solely on non-school-based programs offering eligible children an eye examination by an optometrist and three rely on ocular assessment conducted by a nurse at well-child visits. In Ontario, where since 2018 vision screening for all senior kindergarten students is government mandated, only seventeen public health jurisdictions are implementing universal vision screening programs using a variety of personnel ranging from food safety workers to optometrists. Conclusion Good vision is key to physical and emotional development. There is an urgent need for a universal, evidence-based and cost-effective multidisciplinary approach to standardize paediatric vision screening across Canada and break down barriers preventing children from accessing eye care.","output":"National survey of paediatric vision screening programs across Canada: Identifying major gaps and call to action."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19 has been involved in more than 800,000 cases worldwide.

These factors could be associated with sleep disturbances, such as insufficient duration and unsatisfactory quality. Although there is no specific study on sleep problems in this population. Methods: Observational, prospective and analytical cross-sectional study carried out in 107 resident physicians who worked in national reference hospitals in Peru. The sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh index (PI) and questions about food cravings were included. The questionnaire was strictly confidential, informed consent was obtained from each participant. A univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed. Results: The mean age was 32.37 years, 54.6% were women, 52.3% worked in COVID-19 areas, 55.1% were displaced to other areas outside their specialty, 13,1% suffered from COVID-19, 11.2% were in home confinement; 68.2% reported that they had food craving (79.45% for simple sugars). The mean sleep time was 5.90 hours, the mean Pittsburgh index (PI) score was 8.03; 89.71% had sleep problems (PI> 4). An association was found between sleep problems (PI> 4) and food craving (p <0.001, OR 12.78 [2.58-63.21]) and perform other activities with having a sleep problem (PI> 4 ) (p = 0.037; OR = 4.34). Conclusion: Resident physicians have a high prevalence of sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, which are associated with performing different activities within their training, and also problems are associated with food craving.","output":"Calidad de sue?o y antojo por azcares en mdicos residentes durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en el Per"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents an emergent global threat which is straining worldwide healthcare capacity. As of May 27th, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 340,000 deaths worldwide, with 100,000 deaths in the US alone. It is imperative to study and develop pharmacological treatments suitable for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Ascorbic acid is a crucial vitamin necessary for the correct functioning of the immune system. It plays a role in stress response and has shown promising results when administered to the critically ill. Quercetin is a well-known flavonoid whose antiviral properties have been investigated in numerous studies. There is evidence that vitamin C and quercetin co-administration exerts a synergistic antiviral action due to overlapping antiviral and immunomodulatory properties and the capacity of ascorbate to recycle quercetin, increasing its efficacy. Safe, cheap interventions which have a sound biological rationale should be prioritized for experimental use in the current context of a global health pandemic. We present the current evidence for the use of vitamin C and quercetin both for prophylaxis in high-risk populations and for the treatment of COVID-19 patients as an adjunct to promising pharmacological agents such as Remdesivir or convalescent plasma.","output":"Quercetin and Vitamin C: An Experimental, Synergistic Therapy for the Prevention and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Related Disease (COVID-19)"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(D,[["render",V]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/52.md","filePath":"drive/52.md"}'),R={name:"drive/52.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
