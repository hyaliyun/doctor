Apical pressure was correlated with the extent of dye clearance from the end of a needle tip in a plastic root canal model with similar dimensions. METHODS The mesiobuccal canal of a mandibular molar was instrumented to #35/06 and placed into a chamber coupled to a pressure transducer. Irrigation was performed using a digital peristaltic pump using flow rates from 1-15 mL/min with irrigation needles of different sizes and designs. A plastic root canal model instrumented to the same size filled with dye was used to measure the extent of dye clearance beyond the needle tip using the same irrigation conditions. RESULTS Positive-pressure irrigation revealed a flow rate-dependent increase in apical pressure (P < .05). The apical pressure at high irrigation flow rates was several times higher than at low flow rates. Needle designs with safety features yielded statistically significant lower apical pressures than needles without safety features (P < .05). There was no further increase in dye clearance from the end of the needle tip in a plastic root canal model at flow rates higher than 4 mL/min. CONCLUSIONS If apical clearance of dye beyond the needle tip is a measure of irrigation effectiveness, then maximum effectiveness with safe apical pressures can be gained at specific flow rates using specific needle tip designs. The use of an irrigation flow rate of 4 mL/min was able to achieve maximum effectiveness in this study.","output":"Apical pressure and extent of irrigant flow beyond the needle tip during positive-pressure irrigation in an in vitro root canal model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, initiates infection by binding to its cellular receptor (MHVR) via spike (S) proteins projecting from the virion membrane. The structures of these S proteins vary considerably among MHV strains, and this variation is generally considered to be important in determining the strain-specific pathologies of MHV infection, perhaps by affecting the interaction between MHV and the MHVR. To address the relationships between S variation and receptor binding, assays capable of measuring interactions between MHV and MHVR were developed. The assays made use of a novel soluble form of the MHVR, sMHVR-Ig, which comprised the virus-binding immunoglobulin-like domain of MHVR fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. sMHVR-Ig was stably expressed as a disulfide-linked dimer in human 293 EBNA cells and was immobilized to Sepharose-protein G via the Fc domain. The resulting Sepharose beads were used to adsorb radiolabelled MHV particles. At 4 degrees C, the beads specifically adsorbed two prototype MHV strains, MHV JHM (strain 4) and a tissue culture-adapted mutant of MHV JHM, the JHMX strain. A shift to 37 degrees C resulted in elution of JHM but not JHMX. This in vitro observation of JHM (but not JHMX) elution from its receptor at 37 degrees C was paralleled by a corresponding 37 degrees C elution of receptor-associated JHM (but not JHMX) from tissue culture cells. The basis for this difference in maintenance of receptor association was correlated with a large deletion mutation present within the JHMX S protein, as sMHVR-Ig exhibited relatively thermostable binding to vaccinia virus-expressed S proteins containing the deletion. These results indicate that naturally occurring mutations in the coronavirus S protein affect the stability of the initial interaction with the host cell and thus contribute to the likelihood of successful infection by incoming virions. These changes in virus entry features may result in coronaviruses with novel pathogenic properties.","output":"A role for naturally occurring variation of the murine coronavirus spike protein in stabilizing association with the cellular receptor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indoor localization has the capability to change the way of providing location-based services in a closed environment and has more potential than that of GPS if the present shortcomings can be overcome.

The absolute reason for this remains unclear, with contamination after harvesting and preparation of the graft being the most accepted hypothesis. Using the rationale that a contaminated graft could be the main factor in postoperative septic arthritis and in an effort to maximize the antibiotic efficacy of the graft, the Vancomycin presoaking technique was developed. It has shown success in decreasing the infection rate in ACL reconstruction. In recent years, an important number of research articles using this protocol have appeared, but the technique is still not widely implemented. Recent literature shows that Vancomycin presoaking of the graft has shown a successful decrease in the infection rate after hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction. It has also shown efficacy decreasing the infection rate in other types of grafts (patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, allograft) and also in patients with concomitant ligament procedures or open surgeries. Despite the positive effects of Vancomycin presoaking reducing the infection rate after ACL reconstruction, the lack of prospective randomized control trials and the heterogeneity of the different studies mean it is not feasible to recommend Vancomycin presoaking of the graft universally for every ACL reconstruction patient.

METHOD: M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 33,345 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms at the Chengdu Women's & Children's Central Hospital between January 2017 and December 2020, based on a serum antibody titer of &#8805;1:160 measured by the passive agglutination assay. Differences in infection rates were examined by sex, age, and temporal distribution. RESULTS: Two epidemic outbreaks occurred between October-December 2017 and April-December 2019, and two infection peaks were detected in the second and fourth quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Due to the public health response to COVID-19, the number of positive M. pneumoniae cases significantly decreased in the second quarter of 2020. The number of M. pneumoniae infection among children aged 3-6 years was higher than that in other age groups.

The reporting of high Ct value results has been under scrutiny, as the clinical significance of these values is not yet completely understood. The early detection of infected individuals (high Ct results) in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease using highly sensitive RT-PCR methods has been argued as a strategy to prevent transmission, while on the contrary, the reporting of high Ct has been criticized as false-positive results causing unnecessary testing and having several negative implications. The purpose of this study was to verify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in samples with a wide range of RT-PCR Ct values including samples with high Ct (37 to 42) using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Methods The study evaluated a total of 547 previously positive samples tested with the PerkinElmer New Coronavirus Nucleic Acid Detection RT-PCR kit. The samples included in this study ranged from Ct values of 17-42, with 44 samples having a Ct > 37. Of the 547 samples, 149 were sequenced using PerkinElmer NEXTFLEX Variant-Seq SARS-CoV2 assay on NovaSeq 6000, and 398 samples were sequenced using Illumina SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral panel kits using the NextSeq 500/550 system. Results Between the two clinical laboratories, a total of ~1.95 million samples were tested using the FDA-EUA PerkinElmer New Coronavirus RT-PCR assay. Of the 1.95 million samples, ~1.72 million were negative, ~250,000 positive, and ~16,500 in the range of 37-42. Of the 547 samples sequenced, the percentage of sequencing reads that aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-hu-1 reference genome (NC_045512.2) ranged from 25.5% to 99.69%. All samples sequenced showed high sequence specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Low Ct samples showed complete uniform coverage across the entire 29kb SAR-CoV-2 genome. The average coverage in samples with high Ct (>37) was found to be 55.5% (range 16.1-99.2%). However, as sample Ct increased, a gradual decrease in coverage uniformity was observed for few samples. Conclusion This study demonstrates for the first time that the viral RNA is present in the high Ct value range of 37- 42 and the sequence is unique to SARS-CoV-2 confirmed using two separate sequencing assays. This confirms that the detected Ct values are reflective of the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and they are not an artifact or contamination. In light of the recent work highlighting the majority of transmission being pre-symptomatic/ asymptomatic, and high Ct results being observed at both the early and late phases of infection warrants further investigation into the clinical utility of high Ct results to curtail the spread of the virus.","output":"COVID-19 RT-PCR diagnostic assay sensitivity and SARS-CoV-2 transmission: A missing link?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study was designed and implemented as a rapid survey of the psychosocial impacts of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19 in residents across the United Kingdom.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective monocentric analysis of sedation regimens in critically ill intubated patients with respiratory failure who required sedation in our mixed 32-bed university intensive care unit. All mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19-induced ARDS requiring continuously infused sedative therapy admitted between April 4, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were included. We recorded demographic data, sedative dosages, prone positioning, sedation levels and duration. Descriptive data analysis was performed; for additional analysis, a logistic regression with mixed effect was used. RESULTS: In total, 56 patients (mean age 67 (14) years) were included. The mean observed sedation period was 224 (139) hours. To achieve the prescribed sedation level, we observed the need for two or three sedatives in 48.7% and 12.8% of the cases, respectively. In cases with a triple sedation regimen, the combination of clonidine, esketamine and midazolam was observed in most cases (75.7%). Analgesia was achieved using sufentanil in 98.6% of the cases. The analysis showed that the majority of COVID-19 patients required an unusually high sedation dose compared to those available in the literature. CONCLUSION: The global pandemic continues to affect patients severely requiring ventilation and sedation, but optimal sedation strategies are still lacking. The findings of our observation suggest unusual high dosages of sedatives in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.

Therefore, determining the perceived stress and coping strategies among chronic disease patients is crucial to minimize the mental health consequences related to the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine COVID-19-related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 613 randomly selected adults with chronic disease in southwest Ethiopia. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the COVID-19-related stress score and coping strategy types, and independent sample t-tests and ANOVA tests were conducted.

Also, after the number of infections had declined, intensive care beds were kept free prophylactically; however, the percentage of beds reserved for COVID-19 differ in the individual federal states in Germany. The aim of this article is to define a necessary clearance quota of intensive beds for COVID-19 patients in Germany. An escalation and de-escalation scheme was created for rising and falling numbers of infected patients. METHODS: Data from the COVID-19 resource board of the state of Baden-Wrttemberg, the daily situation report of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the register of COVID-19 intensive care beds of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) as well as the daily report of COVID-19 Baden-Wrttemberg from April to November 2020 were used for the calculation. RESULTS: At the end of November 2020 approximately 13.5% of intensive care beds in Germany were used by COVID-19 patients. Of all persons tested positive for SARS-CoV?2, 1.5% were admitted to an intensive care unit. The hospitalization rate was 6% and the mean age of infected persons was 43 years. Based on these numbers hospitals are recommended to keep 10% of intensive care beds available for COVID-19 patients in the case of less than 35 new infections/100,000 in the catchment area, 20% should be kept free in case of an advanced warning level of 35 new infections/100,000 inhabitants and 30% for a critical limit of 50 new infections/100,000 inhabitants. Further internal hospital triggers, such as the occupancy of the intensive care beds with COVID-19 patients, should be considered. CONCLUSION: If the number of infections is low a general nationwide retention rate of more than 10% of intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients is not justified. Locally increasing numbers of infections require a local dynamic approach. If the number of infections increases, the free holding capacity should be increased according to a step by step concept in close coordination with the local health authorities and other internal hospital triggers. In order not to overwhelm hospital capacities in the event of local outbreaks, a corresponding relocation concept should be considered at an early stage.","output":"Eskalations?/Deeskalationskonzept zur COVID-19-bedingten Freihaltung von Intensivkapazit?ten an Kliniken"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe respiratory infections were highlighted in the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, as well as MERS-CoV, in 2012.

Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the ED ward, where further testing revealed Graves disease, along with continued elevated cardiac enzyme levels and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The troponin I level was 0.24 ng/mL after admission. All of the echocardiography results were normal: Left atrium 35 mm, left ventricle 48 mm, end-diastolic volume 102 mL, right atrium 39 mm  47 mm, right ventricle 25 mm, and ejection fraction 60%. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed on the fifth day of admission, revealing myocardial edema in the lateral wall and intramyocardial and subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement in the lateral apex, anterior lateral, and inferior lateral segments of the ventricle. The patient refused to undergo an endomyocardial biopsy. After 6 d, the patients cardiac enzymes, BNP, potassium, and electrocardiography returned to normal. After the patients symptoms were relieved, he was discharged from the hospital. During a 6-mo follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and subjected to thyroid function, liver function, kidney function, troponin I, and electrocardiograph routine tests for medicine adjustments. The hyperthyroid state was controlled. CONCLUSION: Acute myocarditis is a rare manifestation of Graves disease. Accelerated junctional rhythm is also a rare manifestation of acute myocarditis in adults. When the reason for hypokalemia and elevated cardiac enzymes in patients is unknown, cardiologists should consider Graves disease and also pay attention to accelerated junctional rhythm.","output":"Acute myocarditis presenting as accelerated junctional rhythm in Graves disease: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital contact tracing, in combination with widespread testing, has been a focal point for many plans to reopen economies while containing the spread of Covid\\\\19.

Surveillance data are currently generated using phenotypic characterization. However, due to poor scalability, this approach does little for true epidemiological investigations. There is a strong case for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to enhance the phenotypic data. To establish global AMR surveillance using WGS, we developed a laboratory implementation approach that we applied within the NIHR Global Health Research Unit (GHRU) on Genomic Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance. In this paper, we outline the laboratory implementation at 4 units: Colombia, India, Nigeria, and the Philippines. The journey to embedding WGS capacity was split into 4 phases: Assessment, Assembly, Optimization, and Reassessment. We show that on-boarding WGS capabilities can greatly enhance the real-time processing power within regional and national AMR surveillance initiatives, despite the high initial investment in laboratory infrastructure and maintenance. Countries looking to introduce WGS as a surveillance tool could begin by sequencing select Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) priority pathogens that can demonstrate the standardization and impact genome sequencing has in tackling AMR.","output":"Integrating Scalable Genome Sequencing Into Microbiology Laboratories for Routine Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 Indubitably, this new term is the most used designation all over the World in 2020. It is not restricted to any part of the society neither to any specific country or human activity or age;it is used by everyone, everywhere, in both real world and virtual platform. A quick search using the keywords Covid-19 and intellectual property rights (IPR), will mainly yield articles about the impact of Covid- 19- as a pandemic-on the protection of IPR and the measures to be taken by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) or other entities-providing legal services related to intellectual property-to preserve the pre-owned IPR and the means of assuring the sustainability of this protection during this pandemic.

In turn, this study will analyze Covid-19 not as a pandemic but as a DS. This study will be the first of its kind in the field of IPR paving the way towards the recognition of the legal status of Covid-19 as a new DS: this is vital knowing that the use of this term must be regulated to avoid confusing or misleading the consumer;such use has to be in conformity with the laws of the distinctive signs prohibiting illegal use as per article 3 of the GCC Trademark Law (GCC TM).

Postoperative delirium, an acute condition characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and a disturbance in attention, typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after surgery and can affect up to 60% of elderly surgical patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a new-onset of cognitive impairment which may persist for weeks or months after surgery.Traditionally, surgical anaesthesia has been maintained with inhalational agents. End-tidal concentrations require adjustment to balance the risks of accidental awareness and excessive dosing in elderly people. As an alternative, propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) offers a more rapid recovery and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting. Using TIVA with a target controlled infusion (TCI) allows plasma and effect-site concentrations to be calculated using an algorithm based on age, gender, weight and height of the patient.TIVA is a viable alternative to inhalational maintenance agents for surgical anaesthesia in elderly people. However, in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes, the optimal technique is unknown. OBJECTIVES To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non-cardiac surgery using propofol-based TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality, risk of hypotension, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2017), Embase (1974 to November 2017), PsycINFO (1887 to November 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants over 60 years of age scheduled for non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. We planned to also include quasi-randomized trials. We compared maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol-based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. MAIN RESULTS We included 28 RCTs with 4507 randomized participants undergoing different types of surgery (predominantly cardiovascular, laparoscopic, abdominal, orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures). We found no quasi-randomized trials. Four studies are awaiting classification because we had insufficient information to assess eligibility.All studies compared maintenance with propofol-based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. Six studies were multi-arm and included additional TIVA groups, additional inhalational maintenance or both. Inhalational maintenance agents included sevoflurane (19 studies), isoflurane (eight studies), and desflurane (three studies), and was not specified in one study (reported as an abstract). Some studies also reported use of epidural analgesia/anaesthesia, fentanyl and remifentanil.We found insufficient reporting of randomization methods in many studies and all studies were at high risk of performance bias because it was not feasible to blind anaesthetists to study groups. Thirteen studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Three studies had a high of risk of attrition bias, and we noted differences in the use of analgesics between groups in six studies, and differences in baseline characteristics in five studies. Few studies reported clinical trials registration, which prevented assessment of risk of selective reporting bias.We found no evidence of a difference in incidences of postoperative delirium according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agents (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 2.26; 321 participants; five studies; very low-certainty evidence); we noted during sensitivity analysis that using different time points in one study may influence direction of this result. Thirteen studies (3215 participants) reported POCD, and of these, six studies reported data that could not be pooled; we noted no difference in scores of POCD in four of these and in one study, data were at a time point incomparable to other studies. We excluded one large study from meta-analysis because study investigators had used non-standard anaesthetic management and this study was not methodologically comparable to other studies. We combined data for seven studies and found low-certainty evidence that TIVA may reduce POCD (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 869 participants).We found no evidence of a difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.45; 271 participants; three studies; very low-certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported intraoperative hypotension. We did not perform meta-analysis for 11 studies for this outcome. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible variation in clinical management and medication used to manage hypotension in each study (downgraded to low-certainty evidence); one study reported data in a format that could not be combined and we noted little or no difference between groups in intraoperative hypotension for this study. Eight studies reported length of stay in the PACU, and we did not perform meta-analysis for seven studies. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible differences in definition of time points for this outcome (downgraded to very low-certainty evidence); data were unclearly reported in one study. We found no evidence of a difference in length of hospital stay according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agent (mean difference (MD) 0 days, 95% CI -1.32 to 1.32; 175 participants; four studies; very low-certainty evidence).We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Reasons for downgrading included: study limitations, because some included studies insufficiently reported randomization methods, had high attrition bias, or high risk of selective reporting bias; imprecision, because we found few studies; inconsistency, because we noted heterogeneity across studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We are uncertain whether maintenance with propofol-based TIVA or with inhalational agents affect incidences of postoperative delirium, mortality, or length of hospital stay because certainty of the evidence was very low. We found low-certainty evidence that maintenance with propofol-based TIVA may reduce POCD. We were unable to perform meta-analysis for intraoperative hypotension or length of stay in the PACU because of heterogeneity between studies. We identified 11 ongoing studies from clinical trials register searches; inclusion of these studies in future review updates may provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","output":"Intravenous versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia for postoperative cognitive outcomes in elderly people undergoing non-cardiac surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SIQR model is exploited to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Japan where the number of the daily confirmed new cases is explicitly treated as an observable.

It is shown that the quarantine rate can be determined from the time dependence of the daily confirmed new cases, from which the number of infected individuals can be estimated. The infection rate and quarantine rate are determined for the period from mid-February to mid-April in Japan and transmission characteristics of the initial stages of the outbreak in Japan are analyzed in connection with the policies employed by the government.

To address the logic of this 3-cm cutoff beyond small single-center experiences, we stratified patients by 1-cm tumor size intervals and hypothesized that disease-specific survival (DSS) would not vary significantly between adjacent groups. METHODS Patients treated with local ablation for T1 HCC (8 cm) were identified from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database (2004-2008). Log-rank tests and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare DSS curves of adjacent study groups. RESULTS There were 1,083 patients included in the study (26 % female, median age: 62 years). The 3-year DSS was significantly lower in patients with 3- to 4-cm tumors compared to 2- to 3-cm tumors (58 vs. 72 %, p = 0.002). In adjusted models, DSS did not vary significantly between any size intervals up to 3 cm. Patients with 3- to 4-cm tumors, however, had a poorer prognosis compared with patients with 2- to 3-cm tumors (hazard ratio: 1.6, 95 % confidence interval: 1.18-2.18, p = 0.002). DSS also fell when tumor size increased from 5-6 to 6-7 cm (53 vs. 21 %, 0.006). CONCLUSIONS This study emphasizes the 3-cm size, and possibly the 6-cm size, as informative predictive thresholds when ablating HCC, because variability of DSS occurred specifically at these tumor sizes. Future research in this field should either adopt a 3-cm breakpoint or provide evidence for alternative thresholds.","output":"Ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma: validating the 3-cm breakpoint."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective To explore the possible preventive mechanism of Hunan expert group recommended Chinese medicine prescription of No. 2 (Pre-No. 2) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by network pharmacology method.

A component-target-disease interac-tion network of Pre-No. 2 was constructed by Cytoscape 3.7.2, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis of target protein pathway by DAVID. Results A total of 163 compounds and 278 target protein targets in Pre-No. 2 were collected from the TCMSP database. Kaempferol, wogonin, 7-methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone, formononetin, isorhamnetin, and licochalcone A were the most frequent targets in the regulatory network. GO enrichment analysis showed that Pre-No. 2 regulated response to virus, viral processes, humoral immune responses, defense responses to virus and viral entry into host cells. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the formula regulated the NF-B signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway, viral carcinogenesis, T cell signaling pathway and FcR-mediated phagocytosis signaling pathway.

We describe the diagnostic process behind diagnosing GBS in an elderly male who developed acute-onset quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a military ICU. A 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was subsequently intubated and treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir with improvement. On hospital day 32, the patient was extubated. Three days later, he developed acute, symmetric limb quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure requiring reintubation. Analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid showed a cytoalbuminologic dissociation, and electromyography/nerve conduction study showed slowed nerve conduction velocity. These findings are consistent with GBS. Blood cultures, serum polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical symptoms were not suggestive of other common pathogens causing his GBS. The patient's acute GBS in the setting of recent severe COVID-19 infection strongly suggests association between the two entities, as supported by a growing body of case literature.

Institutions have implemented a wide array of tactics to help manage hospital capacity strain with variable success. OBJECTIVE: Through qualitative interviews, our study explored interventions used to address hospital capacity strain and the perceived impact of these interventions, as well as how hospital capacity strain impacts patients, the workforce, and other institutional priorities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Qualitative study utilizing semi-structured interviews at 13 large urban academic medical centers across the USA from June 21, 2019, to August 22, 2019 (pre-COVID-19). Interviews were recorded, professionally transcribed verbatim, coded, and then analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive method at the semantic level. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Themes and subthemes of semi-structured interviews were identified. RESULTS: Twenty-nine hospitalist leaders and hospital leaders were interviewed. Across the 13 sites, a multitude of provider, care team, and institutional tactics were implemented with perceived variable success. While there was some agreement between hospitalist leaders and hospital leaders, there was also some disagreement about the perceived successes of the various tactics deployed. We found three main themes: (1) hospital capacity strain is complex and difficult to predict, (2) the interventions that were perceived to have worked the best when facing strain were to ensure appropriate resources; however, less costly solutions were often deployed and this may lead to unanticipated negative consequences, and (3) hospital capacity strain and the tactics deployed may negatively impact the workforce and can lead to conflict.

Before starting the post-mortem investigation a risk assessment should be carried out and the suitability of facilities, personnel and equipment should be evaluated. An autopsy room conforming to BSL 3 standards would be ideal but is not mandatory.

METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 55 consecutive COVID-19-related pneumonia patients were admitted to the Emergency Medicine Unit. Groups of lung involvement at computed tomography were classified as follows: 0 (<5%), 1 (5%-25%), 2 (26%-50%), 3 (51%-75%) and 4 (>75%). We also investigated in-hospital death and the predictive value of Yan-XGBoost model and PREDI-CO scores for death. RESULTS: The median age was 74 years and 34 were men. Time to admission increased from 2 days in group 0 to 8.5-9 days in groups 3 and 4. A progressive increase in LDH, CRP and d-dimer was found across groups, while a decrease of lymphocytes paO2 /FiO2 ratio and SpO2 was found. Ten (18.2%) patients died during the in-hospital staying. Patients who died were older, with a trend to lower lymphocytes, a higher d-dimer, creatine phosphokinase and troponin T. The Yan-XGBoost model did not accurately predict in-hospital death with an AUC of 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.76), which improved after the addition of the lung involvement groups (AUC 0.68, 95%CI 0.45-0.90). Conversely, a good predictive value was found for the original PREDI-CO score with an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.58-0.93) which remained similar after the addition of the lung involvement (AUC 0.76, 95% CI 0.57-0.94). CONCLUSION: We found that delayed hospital admission is associated with higher lung involvement. Hence, our data suggest that patients at risk for more severe disease, such as those with high LDH, CRP and d-dimer, should be promptly referred to hospital care.","output":"Time to hospitalisation, CT pulmonary involvement and in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients in an Emergency Medicine Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite an unprecedented global gain in knowledge since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, almost all mechanistic knowledge related to the molecular and cellular details of viral replication, pathology and virulence has been generated using early prototypic isolates of SARS-CoV-2.

This study aimed to develop a scoring system for predicting in-hospital mortality of patients with acute poisoning at the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the Injury Surveillance Cohort generated by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) during 2011C2018. We developed the new-Poisoning Mortality Scoring system (new-PMS) to generate a prediction model using the derivation group (2011C2017 KCDC cohort). Points were computed for categories of each variable. The sum of these points was the new-PMS. The validation group (2018 KCDC cohort) was subjected to external temporal validation. The performance of new-PMS in predicting mortality was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for both the groups. RESULTS: Of 57,326 poisoning cases, 42,568 were selected. Of these, 34,352 (80.7%) and 8216 (19.3%) were enrolled in the derivation and validation groups, respectively. The new-PMS was the sum of the points for each category of 10 predictors. The possible range of the new-PMS was 0C137 points. HosmerCLemeshow goodness-of-fit test showed adequate calibration for the new-PMS with p values of 0.093 and 0.768 in the derivation and validation groups, respectively. AUROCs of the new-PMS were 0.941 (95% CI 0.934C0.949, p < 0.001) and 0.946 (95% CI 0.929C0.964, p < 0.001) in the derivation and validation groups, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the new-PMS (cutoff value: 49 points) were 86.4%, 87.2%, and 87.2% and 85.9%, 89.5%, and 89.4% in the derivation and validation groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new-PMS system based on demographic, poisoning-related variables, and vital signs observed among patients at the ED. The new-PMS showed good performance for predicting in-hospital mortality in both the derivation and validation groups. The probability of death increased according to the increase in the new-PMS. The new-PMS accurately predicted the probability of death for patients with acute poisoning.

This is due to the pressure of studies and internships during the three years of training, which could affect the health and academic results of nursing students. However, some students react positively to stress and are considered resilient, since they bounce back and rise to the challenges set in the face of this stress. Empirical studies have identified academic, clinical, personal, and social factors related to the resilience of nursing students. METHOD: The objective of this descriptive correlational study was to explore some of the factors related to student resilience in the undergraduate nursing program at a university in Beirut. The data was collected using a standardized interview guide combining four North American instruments and the demographic academic profile of the students. RESULTS: More than half of the students are resilient, and, among all the factors, only the feeling of self-efficacy is a significant predictor of the nursing students' resilience.

Autonomous braking technology is also used as the last defense to ensure driver's safety. METHOD By taking the accuracy and timeliness of automatic system control into account, this paper proposes a rear-end Real-Time Autonomous Emergency Braking (RTAEB) system. The system inserts brake intervention based on drivers' real-time conflict identification and collision avoidance performance. A driving simulator-based experiment under different traffic conditions and deceleration scenarios were conducted to test the different thresholds to trigger intervention and the intervention outcomes. The system effectiveness is verified by four evaluation indexes, including collision avoidance rate, accuracy rate, sensitivity rate, and precision rate. RESULTS The results showed that the system could help avoid all collision events successfully and enlarge the final headway distance, and a TTC threshold of 1.5 s and a maximum deceleration threshold of -7.5 m/s2 could achieve the best collision avoidance effect. The paper demonstrates the situations that are more inclined to trigger the RTAEB (i.e., a sudden brake of the leading vehicle and a small car-following distance). Moreover, the study shows that driver characteristics (i.e., gender and profession) have no significant association with system trigger. Practical Applications: The study suggests that development of collision avoidance systems design should pay attention to both the real-time traffic situation and drivers' collision avoidance capability under the present situation.","output":"An improved automated braking system for rear-end collisions: A study based on a driving simulator experiment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Lewis rats are frequently used in biomedical research, little is known about their life-data and spontaneous pathology.

METHODS From our trans-sphenoidal surgical series of 331 cases, we retrospectively reviewed visual, endocrine and neuro-cognitive outcomes in the first consecutive eight patients (median age 63 years; range 47-73 years) with newly diagnosed supradiaphragmatic craniopharyngioma (median tumour height 23 mm; range 15-34 mm), removed by expanded endonasal approach (median follow-up 27 months; range 10-69 months). Gross total resection was attempted in all patients. RESULTS Gross total resection was achieved in 6 of 8 patients. Visual improvement was present in 6 of 8 patients of patients or in 14 of 16 eyes. New endocrinopathy, including diabetes insipidus, appeared in 5 of 8 patients. Stalk was preserved in 4 patients. Cognitive decline was present in 2 cases. Five of 8 patients retained previous quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Our early outcome results are comparable to the recent few expanded endonasal approach series, except for the incidence of new endocrinopathy and cerebrospinal fluid leak rate. This was influenced by higher number of transinfundibular tumours in our series, where stalk preservation is less likely, and not using nasoseptal flap or gasket closure in the first half of cases. Including data from the literature and ours, expanded endonasal approach shows a trend for improved gross total resection rate with less morbidity, more obviously for visual outcome and quality of life than for endocrine outcome.

There are some reports of acute attendances, ward admissions and outpatient clinics, however most of these are from the 1990s and early 2000s with limited recent data available. The caseload within the general paediatric service has changed over the last 10C20 years and there have been recent changes due to COVID-19.ObjectivesTo describe general paediatric caseload at University Hospital Southampton (UHS) including emergency department (ED) attendances, ward admissions and outpatient clinic appointments in order to contribute to local service improvements, national projects and research planning.MethodsData was collected for all patients under the age of 18 years. ED and ward data were collected retrospectively, the clinic data was collected both prospectively and retrospectively. Analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel.ResultsBetween 11thSeptember 2019 and 10th September 2020, 22,940 patients attended the ED. The top 3 presenting complaints were shortness of breath (10.8%), head injury (9.7%) and fever (9.5%) and the top 3 diagnoses (made by a doctor) were no abnormality detected/no diagnosis recorded (21.9%), URTI (6.6%) and closed fracture (5.6%). In the 12C17-year-old age group, mental health issues were the 4th most common diagnosis (8.4%). Over the same year, 3212 patients were admitted to wards under general paediatrics. The top reason for admission was viral infection for stays less than 24 hours (16.3%) and 24C72 hours (13.8%) and acute bronchiolitis (20.9%) for stays over 72 hours. The median length of stay was 1 day, and the most common length of stay was 0 days. Over 8 weeks of outpatient clinics (September-October 2020) there were 476 appointments. The top 3 reasons for attendance were constipation (8.2%), food allergies/intolerances (5.9%) and abdominal pain (4.2%). 16.3% of appointments were unattended.ConclusionsThis is the first report of the full service provided by the general paediatric department at UHS, identifying common conditions presenting to the service. There may be a number of reasons why the final diagnosis made in ED was most commonly no abnormality detected. These include patients symptoms easing prior to consultation and miseducation, where the patients attend for a reason perceived to be concerning, however the child is found to be well. Review of current guidance has shown a lack of information available for some common conditions and developing new pathways of care may be beneficial for clinicians and families. Additional targeted work and focussed education into these areas may lead to improvements in care. The data can be used to help inform further research projects, as well as to develop services within local healthcare systems, improving the management of patients presenting with conditions that could be dealt with outside a hospital setting.","output":"A service evaluation of general paediatric caseload"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood, little is known about the postfusion events that precede RNA replication, such as nucleocapsid disassembly. We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFVSK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFVSK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways and cellular factors, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E and RPLP1 expression. The initial round of YFV translation was shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur. Importantly, translation of incoming YFV genomes also required valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large complexes. RNA transfection and washout experiments showed that VCP/p97 functions at a postfusion, pretranslation step in YFV entry. Finally, VCP/p97 activity was required by other flaviviruses in mammalian cells and by YFV in mosquito cells. Together, these data support a critical role for VCP/p97 in the disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a postfusion step in virus entry.","output":"A Sensitive Yellow Fever Virus Entry Reporter Identifies Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP/p97) as an Essential Host Factor for Flavivirus Uncoating"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though forage and grazing lands represent the largest land use in the United States, the number of forage faculty positions nationwide has decreased by 47% in the last 15 years, with only an estimated 2.3 forage research and Extension full-time equivalents (FTE) per state.

Objective: Comparative study of clinical and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 stroke patients without typical symptoms at onset with stroke cases without COVID-19 infection. Methods: 28consecutive stroke patients, eight with coronavirus infection and twenty without COVID-19 admitted to neurology department of a tertiary care centre of North West India between 20 June,2020 and 19 July,2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Results: COVID-19 patients had higher frequency of seizures (4[50%]) vs 2[10%];p= 0.03)and altered mental status(6[75%] vs 6[30%] p= 0.04).

Initial studies describe an impact of preinterventional clot migration on technical and clinical success of thrombectomy and an association with worse clinical outcome. We, therefore, performed a large study of consecutive patients whose clots have been histologically analyzed and tried to determine whether clot composition influences the rates of clot migration and thereby interventional and clinical outcome. Methods- We retrospectively evaluated data of a prospectively collected cohort of 198 consecutive patients with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. We investigated the relationship between clot histology expressed as percentage of the main components (fibrin, erythrocytes [red blood cell], and white blood cells), the preinterventional computed tomography attenuation of the emboli, embolus length, and clot migration. We defined a binary outcome (clot migration versus no clot migration). The impact of embolus composition and computed tomography features was assessed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Results- One hundred sixty-three patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 36 (22.1%) showed a clot migration. Patients with proven clot migration had significantly higher levels of red blood cells than patients without clot migration (median 50% versus 26%, P<0.001). Lower amounts of fibrin were significantly more often observed in patients in the clot migration group as compared to the no clot migration group (43.5% versus 62.0%, P<0.001). Stroke cause did not differ between migrated and stable emboli. Multivariable analysis identified a higher amount of erythrocytes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 per median percentage, P<0.001) and a shorter embolus length (adjusted odds ratio, 0.90 per mm, P<0.008) as independent predictors of clot migration. Conclusions- Erythrocyte-rich clots and a shorter embolus length are independent reliable predictors for clot migration. This finding is clinically important as clot migration might have a negative impact on technical and clinical outcomes of patients suffering from emergent vessel occlusions of the middle cerebral artery undergoing endovascular therapy.","output":"Histological Clot Composition Is Associated With Preinterventional Clot Migration in Acute Stroke Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can result in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused an unprecedented global pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, MIH has significant potential to mitigate concerns about COVID-19 infection from seeking urgent care in health care settings. The MIGHTy Heart (Using Mobile Integrated Health and Telehealth to Support Transitions of Care among Heart Failure Patients) study is a comparative effectiveness pragmatic trial comparing a transitions of care coordinator to MIH. Recruitment began in January 2021, 10 months into the pandemic. Existing challenges to patient engagement in research have become more pronounced during the pandemic;studies show that pre-COVID-19, less than 50% of trials met proposed timelines for recruitment, and early evidence suggests this number has dropped during the pandemic. Here we report on the challenges and solutions for recruiting patients in emergency medicine-focused programs during the COVID-19 pandemic in the first 5 months of recruitment. Methods: We convened a Stakeholder Engagement Board (SEB) including nurses, patients, community paramedics, and case managers. We conducted a descriptive, thematic synthesis of the SEB discussions to address the challenges. We implemented strategies for increased enrollment generated by the SEB two months into the MIGHTy Heart study and evaluated changes in the proportion of patients enrolled among those who were eligible for the study before and after implementation of these strategies. Results: We identified 4 significant COVID-related challenges to recruitment into the MIGHTY-Heart study. COVID-19 patients excluded from inpatient recruitment: 18% of screened patients (n=287) were COVID-19 positive while inpatient, and hospital policy prevented the team from approaching them in contact isolation. Limited family presence: the hospital visitor policy restricts visiting hours to 4 hours and 1 family member. Patients are more likely to participate if the decision is made with a family member. Due to COVID-19, patients are more reticent to allow any health care providers in their homes out of concern for possibly infecting other family members with COVID-19. Mandatory mask wearing in the hospital has posed barriers to communication, especially for some of the elderly patients, who may rely on visual and auditory cues for verbal communication. From the SEB, we identified 3 strategies to support patient engagement. Virtual recruitment: after discharge, patients who were COVID-19 positive were contacted by phone or email. Patients were emailed the informed consent and study materials and mailed gift cards. Family engagement: per patient request, the research assistants would call patients family members if they were not at the bedside at the time of recruitment to explain the study and answer any questions that family members might have. Study materials were left at the patients bedside for patients to read and share with family members in advance of deciding to enroll in the study. The proportion of eligible patients who enrolled in MIGHTy Heart increased from 28-32% before these strategies were implemented to 46-52% in the months after implementation (Figure 1). Conclusion: The novel solutions developed by the SEB and study team increased enrollment in the MIH program.

Secondary outcomes include other BP measures, pulse wave velocity, plasma renin activity and aldosterone, and objectively-measured SB (via thigh-mounted activPAL) and physical activity (via waist-worn GT3X accelerometer). RESET BP has a targeted recruitment of 300 adults with desk jobs, along with elevated, non-medicated BP (systolic BP 120-159 mmHg or diastolic BP 80-99 mmHg) and physical inactivity (self-reported aerobic physical activity below recommended levels).

However, with the exception of JB cows, the frequency of this SNP has yet to be studied in other cow populations. In this study, we thus aimed to evaluate the frequency of this SNP in different cow breeds.

The current study evaluates the functional effects of coculturing adult human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs) in 3D engineered tissues on excitation and contraction with the goal of recapitulating healthy, nonarrhythmogenic myocardium in vitro. A small population (5% of total cell number) of hCFs in tissues improves tissue formation, material properties, and contractile function. However, two perturbations to the hCF population create disease-like phenotypes in engineered cardiac tissues. First, increasing the percentage of hCFs to 15% resulted in tissues with increased ectopic activity and spontaneous excitation rate. Second, hCFs undergo myofibroblast activation in traditional two-dimensional culture, and this altered phenotype ablated the functional benefits of hCFs when incorporated into engineered cardiac tissues. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that human cardiac fibroblast number and activation state modulate electromechanical function of hiPSC-cardiomyocytes and that a low percentage of quiescent hCFs are a valuable cell source to advance a healthy electromechanical response of engineered cardiac tissue for regenerative medicine applications.","output":"Human Cardiac Fibroblast Number and Activation State Modulate Electromechanical Function of hiPSC-Cardiomyocytes in Engineered Myocardium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Total-body PET enables high-sensitivity imaging with dramatically improved signal-to-noise ratio.

IAV PA-X protein modulates virus-induced host innate immune responses and viral pathogenicity via suppression of host gene expression or cellular shutoff, through cellular mRNA cleavage. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1 subtype naturally infect different avian species, they have an enormous economic impact in the poultry farming, and they also have zoonotic and pandemic potential, representing a risk to human public health. In the present study, we describe a novel bacteria-based approach to identify amino acid residues in the PA-X protein of the HPAIV A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 H5N1 that are important for its ability to inhibit host protein expression or cellular shutoff activity. Identified PA-X mutants displayed a reduced shutoff activity as compared to that of the wild-type (WT) A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 H5N1 PA-X protein. Notably, this new bacteria-based screening allowed us to identify amino acid residues widely distributed over the entire N-terminal region of PA-X. Furthermore, we found that some of the residues affecting A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 H5N1 PA-X host shutoff activity also affect PA polymerase activity in a minigenome assay. This information could be used for the rational design of new and more effective compounds with antiviral activity against IAV.

The antiviral effect, however, was limited to one or two virus replication cycles. Analysis of different GL treatment protocols suggested that the antiviral effect of GL was limited to an early step in the virus replication cycle. A direct inhibitory action of GL on IAV particles could be excluded and GL did not interact with virus receptor binding either. The antiviral effect of GL was abolished by treatment 1 h after virus infection, whereas pre-treatment and treatment during and after virus adsorption led to a reduction in the cytopathic effect, reduced viral RNA within the cells and in the cell supernatants, and reduced viral hemagglutination titers. Detailed virus uptake analyses unambiguously demonstrated reduced virus uptake in various GL-treated cells.

First, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to analyze the H-bond network that may serve as a Grotthuss-like proton conduit. MD simulations show that D1-Asp61, the H-bond acceptor of H2O at the Mn4CaO5 cluster (W1), forms an H-bond via one water molecule with D1-Glu65 but not with D2-Glu312. Then, D1-Asp61, D1-Glu65, D2-Glu312, and the adjacent residues, D1-Arg334, D2-Glu302, and D1-Glu323, were thoroughly mutated to the other 19 residues, i.e., 114 Chlamydomonas chloroplast mutant cells were generated. Mutation of D1-Asp61 was most crucial. Only the D61E and D61C cells grew photoautotrophically and exhibit O2-evolving activity. Mutations of D2-Glu312 were less crucial to photosynthetic growth than mutations of D1-Glu65. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations indicated that in the PSII crystal structure, the proton is predominantly localized at D1-Glu65 along the H-bond with D2-Glu312, i.e., pKa(D1-Glu65)a?>a?pKa(D2-Glu312). The potential-energy profile shows that the release of the proton from D1-Glu65 leads to the formation of the two short H-bonds between D1-Asp61 and D1-Glu65, which facilitates downhill proton transfer along the Grotthuss-like proton conduit in the S2 to S3 transition. However, inhibitions of photosynthetic growth were absent in the E65K and E65H mutants. It seems possible that D1-Glu65 is involved in the dominant pathway that proceeds from W1 via D1-Asp61 toward the thylakoid lumen, whereas D2-Glu312 and D1-Arg334 are used as alternative pathways in some mutants.","output":"Proton transfer pathway from the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II substantiated by extensive mutagenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI coronary artery disease revascularization guideline highlights the importance of the multidisciplinary heart team in making patient-centered, evidence-based clinical decisions for patients considered for coronary revascularization.

METHODS: A prospective multi-site study of Australian and New Zealand children hospitalized with S. aureus bacteremia (SAB), occurred over 24-months (2017-2018). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data was paired with clinical information from the ISAIAH cohort. RESULTS: 353 SAB isolates were sequenced; 85% methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ([MSSA], 301/353); 15% methicillin-resistant S. aureus ([MRSA], 52/353). There were 92 sequence types (STs), most commonly; ST5 (18%) and ST30 (8%), grouped into 23 clonal complexes (CCs), most frequently CC5 (21%) and CC30 (12%). MSSA comprised the majority of healthcare-associated SAB (87%, 109/125), with principal clones CC15 (48%, 11/21) and CC8 (33%, 7/21). Panton Valentine Leukocidin (PVL)-positive SAB occurred in 22% (76/353); predominantly MSSA (59%, 45/76), community-onset (92%, 70/76) infections.

The cytoplasmic redistribution of hnRNP A1 is considered to play an important role in the virus life cycle. Here, we demonstrated that SVV infection can promote redistribution of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling RNA-binding protein hnRNP A1 to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, whereas hnRNP A1 remained mainly in the nucleus of mock-infected cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the gene encoding hnRNP A1 attenuated viral replication as evidenced by decreased viral protein expression and virus production, whereas its overexpression enhanced replication. Moreover, infection with SVV induced the degradation of hnRNP A1, and viral 3 C protease (3 C(pro)) was found to be responsible for its degradation and translocation. Further studies demonstrated that 3 C(pro) induced hnRNP A1 degradation through its protease activity, via the proteasome pathway. This degradation could be attenuated by a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) and inactivation of the conserved catalytic box in 3 C(pro). Taken together, these results presented here reveal that SVV 3 C protease targets cellular hnRNP A1 for its degradation and translocation, which is utilized by SVV to aid viral replication, thereby highlighting the control potential of strategies for infection of SVV.","output":"Seneca Valley virus 3C(pro) degrades heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 to facilitate viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO).

To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22-June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (>50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4).

These findings suggest that among women of reproductive age with COVID-19, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with nonpregnant women, but their risk for death is similar.

Since the disease is usually diagnosed at advanced stages, it has poor prognosis. Therefore, reliable biomarkers are urgently needed for early diagnosis and prognostic assessment. Methods: We used genome-wide gene expression profiling datasets from human and rat early HCC (eHCC) samples to perform integrated genomic and network-based analyses, and discovered gene markers that are expressed in blood and conserved in both species. We then used independent gene expression profiling datasets for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for eHCC patients and from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to estimate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of the identified gene signature. Furthermore, we performed functional enrichment, interaction networks and pathway analyses. Results: We identified 41 significant genes that are expressed in blood and conserved across species in eHCC. We used comprehensive clinical data from over 600 patients with HCC to verify the diagnostic and prognostic value of 41-gene-signature. We developed a prognostic model and a risk score using the 41-geneset that showed that a high prognostic index is linked to a worse disease outcome. Furthermore, our 41-gene signature predicted disease outcome independently of other clinical factors in multivariate regression analysis. Our data reveals a number of cancer-related pathways and hub genes, including EIF4E, H2AFX, CREB1, GSK3B, TGFBR1, and CCNA2, that may be essential for eHCC progression and confirm our gene signatures ability to detect the disease in its early stages in patients biological fluids instead of invasive procedures and its prognostic potential.

During vaccination campaigns in such settings, public health agencies need to be able to assess how much the vaccination campaign is contributing to population immunity; specifically, the proportion of vaccines being administered to individuals who are already seropositive must be estimated. Objective To estimate population-level immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through May 31, 2021, in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Design, Setting, and Participants This observational case series assessed cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit occupancy, ventilator occupancy, and deaths from March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021, in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to November 2021. Exposures COVID-19-positive test result reported to state department of health. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcomes were statistical estimates, from a bayesian inference framework, of the percentage of individuals as of May 31, 2021, who were (1) previously infected and vaccinated, (2) previously uninfected and vaccinated, and (3) previously infected but not vaccinated. Results At the state level, there were a total of 1 160 435 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. The median age among individuals with confirmed COVID-19 was 38 years. In autumn 2020, SARS-CoV-2 population immunity (equal to the attack rate at that point) in these states was less than 15%, setting the stage for a large epidemic wave during winter 2020 to 2021. Population immunity estimates for May 31, 2021, were 73.4% (95% credible interval [CrI], 72.9%-74.1%) for Rhode Island, 64.1% (95% CrI, 64.0%-64.4%) for Connecticut, and 66.3% (95% CrI, 65.9%-66.9%) for Massachusetts, indicating that more than 33% of residents in these states were fully susceptible to infection when the Delta variant began spreading in July 2021. Despite high vaccine coverage in these states, population immunity in summer 2021 was lower than planned owing to an estimated 34.1% (95% CrI, 32.9%-35.2%) of vaccines in Rhode Island, 24.6% (95% CrI, 24.3%-25.1%) of vaccines in Connecticut, and 27.6% (95% CrI, 26.8%-28.6%) of vaccines in Massachusetts being distributed to individuals who were already seropositive. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that future emergency-setting vaccination planning may have to prioritize high vaccine coverage over optimized vaccine distribution to ensure that sufficient levels of population immunity are reached during the course of an ongoing epidemic or pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Attack Rate and Population Immunity in Southern New England, March 2020 to May 2021."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The double-helical topology of DNA molecules observed at room temperature in the absence of any external loads can be disrupted by increasing the bath temperature or by applying tensile forces, leading to spontaneous strand separation known as DNA melting.

In this study, computational methods developed by our lab were applied to RNA-seq data to detect transcript variants (i.e., alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) events). The RNA-seq data were obtained from a publicly available source, and they consist of mock-treated and SARS-CoV-2 infected (COVID-19) lung alveolar (A549) cells. Data analysis results show that more AS events are found in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells than in mock-treated cells, whereas fewer APA events are detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.

This indicates that no strong correlation exists between differential gene expression and the AS/APA events in the mock-treated or SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. These genes with transcript variants can be applied as another layer of molecular signatures for COVID-19 studies.

Therefore, the objective of the present review was to explore the potential role of NETs in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify the targeting drugs against NETs in Covid-19 patients. Different enzyme types are involved in the formation of NETs, such as neutrophil elastase (NE), which degrades nuclear protein and release histones, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PADA4), which releases chromosomal DNA and gasdermin D, which creates pores in the NTs cell membrane that facilitating expulsion of NT contents. Despite of the beneficial effects of NETs in controlling of invading pathogens, sustained formations of NETs during respiratory viral infections are associated with collateral tissue injury. Excessive development of NETs in SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked with the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to creation of the NETs-IL-1 loop. Also, aberrant NTs activation alone or through NETs formation may augment SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm (CS) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in patients with severe Covid-19.

Data were assessed based on a 9-point WHO ordinal scale extending from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 8). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups on admission. However, the intervention group demonstrated significantly better clinical status compared to the control group at day 5 (4.02 vs. 5.21, p = 0.002) and day 10 (2.90 vs. 4.71, p = 0.001) of admission. There was also a significant difference in the overall mean score between the intervention group and the control group, (3.909 vs. 4.873 respectively, p = 0.004). The mean length of hospital stay was 7.43  3.64 and 10.52  5.47 days in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p = 0.015). The need for a ventilator was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (18.2% vs 38.1% p = 0.040). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized hypoxic COVID-19 patients, methylprednisolone demonstrated better results compared to dexamethasone.

We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Models suggest that control of pathogens spreading in scale-free networks should focus on highly connected individuals rather than on mass random immunization.

There has been renewed interest in group testing recently due to its applications in diagnostic virology, including pool testing for the novel coronavirus. The majority of existing works on group testing focus on the \\\\emph{uniform} setting in which any subset of size $d$ from a ground set $V$ of size $n$ is potentially contaminated. In this work, we consider a {\\\\em generalized} version of group testing with an arbitrary set-system of potentially contaminated sets. The generalized problem is characterized by a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$, where $V$ represents the ground set and edges $e\\\\in E$ represent potentially contaminated sets. The problem of generalized group testing is motivated by practical settings in which not all subsets of a given size $d$ may be potentially contaminated, rather, due to social dynamics, geographical limitations, or other considerations, there exist subsets that can be readily ruled out. For example, in the context of pool testing, the edge set $E$ may consist of families, work teams, or students in a classroom, i.e., subsets likely to be mutually contaminated. The goal in studying the generalized setting is to leverage the additional knowledge characterized by $H=(V,E)$ to significantly reduce the number of required tests. The paper considers both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing and makes the following contributions. First, for the non-adaptive setting, we show that finding an optimal solution for the generalized version of group testing is NP-hard. For this setting, we present a solution that requires $O(d\\\\log{|E|})$ tests, where $d$ is the maximum size of a set $e \\\\in E$. Our solutions generalize those given for the traditional setting and are shown to be of order-optimal size $O(\\\\log{|E|})$ for hypergraphs with edges that have \`\`large'' symmetric differences.

Poor sleep quality may be linked to poor mental health and increased suicide ideation. To contextualise the risk factors associated with self-harm or suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study examined links between poor sleep quality, individual experiences and self-harm risk. METHODS: N=1544 (Mage=44.3y) from 63 countries completed an online survey in March-April 2020. Participants reported their pandemic experiences as free text responses, which were examined quantitatively for frequent word usage using Linguist Inquiry and Word Count software. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index assessed poor sleep quality (cut-off score >8). Item-9 of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 measured the risk of self-harm. RESULTS: Individuals with poor sleep quality (45%) used more negative emotional tone and had greater use of anxiety or money-related words in their comments than good sleepers (all ps<.05). Additionally, 19% of respondents (n=295) reported thoughts of self-harm at least several days a week (3.4% nearly every day). Logistic regression indicated that younger individuals, males, and those feeling isolated or less resilient had 1.2 to 1.5 times greater risk of self-harm (all ps<.001). Poor sleep quality was associated with a two-fold increased risk of self-harm (95%CI=1.5C2.7, p<.0001) after controlling for demographic variables. DISCUSSION: Poor sleep quality is linked to negative emotionality and increased risk of self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the effectiveness of digital contact-tracing depends crucially on widespread app installation and usage among citizens. Despite the large social benefits, evidence on the effectiveness of incentives to stimulate adoption of contact-tracing apps is scarce. Whereas monetary compensations for app installation or usage provide users with a direct economic benefit, research in related health domains has found that extrinsic incentives may crowd out intrinsic motivation and pro-social behaviour. Thus, we conduct a randomised controlled online experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of different incentive mechanisms in promoting the installation and usage of the German Corona-Warn-App (CWA). We find that monetary incentives are effective in significantly increasing verified app installations and app usage 14 days after installation, up to three times the usage without compensation. Deferred monetary compensation for verified usage yields lower installation rates than immediate monetary compensation for installation, but sustains the highest retention rate among adopters. Non-monetary compensation in the form of optional charity donations is found to be ineffective in promoting installations or usage beyond outcomes of monetary incentives, suggesting that there is no substantial crowding-out of intrinsic motives.

Risk of bias was assessed by the ROB-2 and ROBINS-I tool. Quantitative data synthesis was done using the generic inverse variance method and the fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Five simulation-based studies were finally included. A Significant decrease in CC rate (SMD: -0.28, 95%CI: -0.47 to -0.10) and CC depth (SMD: -0.26, 95%CI: -0.44 to -0.07) were observed in the PPE arm as compared to the no-PPE arm. The difference in CC rate was more prominently seen in adult CPR than in paediatric CPR.

Patients were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and results expressed as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Of 141 patients admitted, 93 were interviewed. Hyposmia and dysgeusia were present in 58 cases (62.4%). In 22.4% of them, olfactory and gustatory impairment clearly preceded systemic symptoms. The presence of active smoking was very limited in both groups: 8.6% in hyposmic vs 2.9% in normosmic patients (odds ratio 3.2; 95% CI 0.3-28.6).

METHODS Between 2006 and 2011, 254 patients (134 men; mean age 68 years) underwent FP angioplasty. The majority of patients (64%) were treated for critical limb ischemia. One hundred thirty-nine (55%) patients had short FP lesions 150 mm, while 115 patients had long FP lesions >150 mm. The mean lesion length was 7843 mm in the short FP lesion group and 25458 mm in the long FP lesion group. Duplex ultrasound follow-up with a peak systolic velocity ratio 2.0 was used to define restenosis. RESULTS The overall procedure success rate was 98%. One hundred forty-eight (58%) patients underwent stent placement. The mean number of stents deployed for treatment of short FP lesions was 1.00.4 vs. 2.00.7 for long FP lesions (p<0.001). The primary patency rate of short FP lesions treated with balloon angioplasty vs. stenting was 66% vs. 63% at 1 year (p=0.7). For long FP lesions, the 1-year primary patency rates of balloon angioplasty vs. stenting were 34% vs. 49% (p=0.006). Balloon angioplasty of long FP lesions was also associated with significantly lower assisted primary and secondary patency compared to stenting (p<0.05 for all comparisons). Sustained clinical improvement was >90% at 30 days but declined to 62% to 75% at 1 year. CONCLUSION Balloon angioplasty and stent placement result in similar patency rates and clinical outcomes for shorter to medium-length FP lesions. In comparison, stent placement in long FP lesions is associated with superior outcomes to balloon angioplasty, even when multiple stents are required. Procedure success and clinical improvement can be achieved in the majority of patients, but rates of restenosis remain high.","output":"Nitinol self-expanding stents vs. balloon angioplasty for very long femoropopliteal lesions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Traditional methods for cardiopulmonary assessment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pose risks to both patients and examiners. This necessitates a remote examination of such patients without sacrificing information quality. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system in examining patients with COVID-19 and to establish an examination protocol for telerobotic ultrasound scanning. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with COVID-19 were included and divided into two groups. Twelve were nonsevere cases, and 11 were severe cases. All patients underwent a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system examination of the lungs and heart following an established protocol. Distribution characteristics and morphology of the lung and surrounding tissue lesions, left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular area ratio, pericardial effusion, and examination-related complications were recorded. Bilateral lung lesions were evaluated by using a lung ultrasound score. RESULTS: The remote ultrasound system successfully and safely performed cardiopulmonary examinations of all patients. Peripheral lung lesions were clearly evaluated. Severe cases of COVID-19 had significantly more diseased regions (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 1.0 [0.0-2.8]) and higher lung ultrasound scores (12.0 [4.0-24.0] vs 2.0 [0.0-4.0]) than nonsevere cases of COVID-19 (both, P < .05). One nonsevere case (8.3%; 95% CI, 1.5-35.4) and three severe cases (27.3%; 95% CI, 9.7-56.6) were complicated by pleural effusions. Four severe cases (36.4%; 95% CI, 15.2-64.6) were complicated by pericardial effusions (vs 0% of nonsevere cases, P < .05). No patients had significant examination-related complications. INTERPRETATION: Use of the 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system is feasible and effectively obtains ultrasound characteristics for cardiopulmonary assessment of patients with COVID-19. By following established protocols and considering medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory markers, this system might help to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 remotely.","output":"Feasibility of a 5G-Based Robot-Assisted Remote Ultrasound System for Cardiopulmonary Assessment of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that quickly spread worldwide, resulting in a global pandemic.

Point-of-care antigen and molecular tests to detect current infection could increase access to testing and early confirmation of cases, and expediate clinical and public health management decisions that may reduce transmission. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups. SEARCH METHODS: Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on 30 Sept 2020. We checked repositories of COVID-19 publications and included independent evaluations from national reference laboratories, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and the Diagnostics Global Health website to 16 Nov 2020. We did not apply language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of people with either suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen or molecular tests suitable for a point-of-care setting (minimal equipment, sample preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results within two hours of sample collection). We included all reference standards that define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and established diagnostic criteria). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were screened independently in duplicate with disagreements resolved by discussion with a third author. Study characteristics were extracted by one author and checked by a second; extraction of study results and assessments of risk of bias and applicability (made using the QUADAS-2 tool) were undertaken independently in duplicate. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test and pooled data using the bivariate model separately for antigen and molecular-based tests. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-eight study cohorts were included (described in 64 study reports, including 20 pre-prints), reporting results for 24,087 samples (7,415 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly from Europe (n = 39) or North America (n = 20), and evaluated 16 antigen and five molecular assays. We considered risk of bias to be high in 29 (50%) studies because of participant selection; in 66 (85%) because of weaknesses in the reference standard for absence of infection; and in 29 (45%) for participant flow and timing. Studies of antigen tests were of a higher methodological quality compared to studies of molecular tests, particularly regarding the risk of bias for participant selection and the index test. Characteristics of participants in 35 (45%) studies differed from those in whom the test was intended to be used and the delivery of the index test in 39 (50%) studies differed from the way in which the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (97%) defined the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 based on a single RT-PCR result, and none included participants meeting case definitions for probable COVID-19. Antigen tests Forty-eight studies reported 58 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of sensitivity varied considerably between studies. There were differences between symptomatic (72.0%, 95% CI 63.7% to 79.0%; 37 evaluations; 15530 samples, 4410 cases) and asymptomatic participants (58.1%, 95% CI 40.2% to 74.1%; 12 evaluations; 1581 samples, 295 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the first week after symptom onset (78.3%, 95% CI 71.1% to 84.1%; 26 evaluations; 5769 samples, 2320 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (51.0%, 95% CI 40.8% to 61.0%; 22 evaluations; 935 samples, 692 cases). Sensitivity was high in those with cycle threshold (Ct) values on PCR &#8804;25 (94.5%, 95% CI 91.0% to 96.7%; 36 evaluations; 2613 cases) compared to those with Ct values >25 (40.7%, 95% CI 31.8% to 50.3%; 36 evaluations; 2632 cases). Sensitivity varied between brands. Using data from instructions for use (IFU) compliant evaluations in symptomatic participants, summary sensitivities ranged from 34.1% (95% CI 29.7% to 38.8%; Coris Bioconcept) to 88.1% (95% CI 84.2% to 91.1%; SD Biosensor STANDARD Q). Average specificities were high in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, and for most brands (overall summary specificity 99.6%, 95% CI 99.0% to 99.8%). At 5% prevalence using data for the most sensitive assays in symptomatic people (SD Biosensor STANDARD Q and Abbott Panbio), positive predictive values (PPVs) of 84% to 90% mean that between 1 in 10 and 1 in 6 positive results will be a false positive, and between 1 in 4 and 1 in 8 cases will be missed. At 0.5% prevalence applying the same tests in asymptomatic people would result in PPVs of 11% to 28% meaning that between 7 in 10 and 9 in 10 positive results will be false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. No studies assessed the accuracy of repeated lateral flow testing or self-testing. Rapid molecular assays Thirty studies reported 33 evaluations of five different rapid molecular tests. Sensitivities varied according to test brand. Most of the data relate to the ID NOW and Xpert Xpress assays. Using data from evaluations following the manufacturer's instructions for use, the average sensitivity of ID NOW was 73.0% (95% CI 66.8% to 78.4%) and average specificity 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 4 evaluations; 812 samples, 222 cases). For Xpert Xpress, the average sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 88.1% to 100%) and average specificity 97.2% (95% CI 89.4% to 99.3%; 2 evaluations; 100 samples, 29 cases). Insufficient data were available to investigate the effect of symptom status or time after symptom onset. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness when viral loads are higher. The assays shown to meet appropriate criteria, such as WHO's priority target product profiles for COVID-19 diagnostics ('acceptable' sensitivity &#8805; 80% and specificity &#8805; 97%), can be considered as a replacement for laboratory-based RT-PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be made, or where RT-PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. Positive predictive values suggest that confirmatory testing of those with positive results may be considered in low prevalence settings. Due to the variable sensitivity of antigen tests, people who test negative may still be infected. Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts was limited. Test accuracy studies cannot adequately assess the ability of antigen tests to differentiate those who are infectious and require isolation from those who pose no risk, as there is no reference standard for infectiousness. A small number of molecular tests showed high accuracy and may be suitable alternatives to RT-PCR. However, further evaluations of the tests in settings as they are intended to be used are required to fully establish performance in practice. Several important studies in asymptomatic individuals have been reported since the close of our search and will be incorporated at the next update of this review. Comparative studies of antigen tests in their intended use settings and according to test operator (including self-testing) are required.","output":"Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pronounced neutrophilia observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections suggests a role for these leukocytes in the pathology of the disease. Monocyte and neutrophil expression of CD64 and CD11b have been reported as early biomarkers to detect infections. The aim of this study was to study the expression of receptors for IgG (CD64) and adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD15s, CD65, CD162, CD66b) on neutrophils and monocytes in patients with severe COVID-19 after admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: The expression of receptors was analyzed using flow cytometry. EDTA blood from 23 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection was sampled within 48 h of admission to the ICU. Leukocytes were labeled with antibodies to CD11b, CD15s, CD65s, CD162, CD64, and CD66b. Expression of receptors was reported as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) or the percentage of cells expressing receptors. RESULTS: Results are presented as comparison of COVID-19 patients with the healthy group and the receptor expression as MFI. Neutrophil receptors CD64 (2.5 versus 0.5) and CD66b (44.5 versus 34) were increased and CD15 decreased (21.6 versus 28.3) when CD65 (6.6 versus 4.4), CD162 (21.3 versus 21.1) and CD11b (10.5 versus 12) were in the same range. Monocytes receptors CD64 (30.5 versus 16.6), CD11b (18.7 versus 9.8), and CD162 (38.6 versus 36.5) were increased and CD15 decreased (10.3 versus 17.9); CD65 were in the same range (2.3 versus 1.96). CONCLUSION: Monocytes and neutrophils are activated during severe COVID-19 infection as shown by strong upregulation of CD64. High monocyte and neutrophil CD64 can be an indicator of a severe form of COVID19. The adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD162, CD65, and CD15) are not upregulated on otherwise activated neutrophils, which might lead to relative impairment of tissue migration. Low adhesion profile of neutrophils suggests immune dysfunction of neutrophils. Monocytes maintain upregulation of some adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD162) suggesting the persistence of an increased ability to migrate into tissues, even during a severe stage of COVID-19. Future research should focus on CD64 and CD11b kinetics in the context of prognosis.","output":"High expression of neutrophil and monocyte CD64 with simultaneous lack of upregulation of adhesion receptors CD11b, CD162, CD15, CD65 on neutrophils in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

We applied the omental roll-up technique around pancreaticojejunostomy and investigated the effectiveness of this technique to prevent a pancreatic fistula. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING Tertiary hepatobiliary and pancreas surgery clinic, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul. PATIENTS Between March 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011, 68 patients underwent PD. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the surgical application of the omental roll-up technique around the PJ site: group 1 (those who did not undergo the omental roll-up technique) compared with group 2 (those who did undergo the omental roll-up technique). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The occurrence of a pancreatic fistula. RESULTS No differences were noted in the clinical characteristics, including patients' demographics and operation-related factors, between the 2 groups. A pancreatic fistula occurred in 23 of 39 patients in group 1 (59%) and in 6 of 29 patients in group 2 (20.7%). Group 2 had a significantly lower incidence of pancreatic fistula (P = .002), and these fistulas were classified as being grade A using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula Definition showing a transient high amylase level in the drainage fluid without significantly affecting the patient's recovery. Drain removal was performed earlier in group 2 (P < .001). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 23.4 days in group 1 compared with 15.9 days in group 2 (P = .009). Overall mortality was 1.5%; however, no deaths were related to a pancreatic fistula.

Reductions were observed in the number of patients reporting symptoms often associated with COVID-19 and all other complaints. After the declaration, higher acuity, older, male, Black, uninsured or non-Medicaid, publicly insured, accounted for a disproportionate share of utilization.

Ripening of tomato fruit is associated with several modifications such as loss of cell wall firmness and transformation of chloroplasts to chromoplasts. Besides a peak in H2O2, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are observed at the transition stage. However, the role of different components of oxidative stress metabolism in fruit ripening has been scarcely addressed. Two GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GGP) Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Micro-Tom mutants which have fruit with low ascorbic acid content (30% of wild type) were used in this work to unravel the participation of ascorbic acid and H2O2 in fruit maturation. Both GGP mutants show delayed fruit maturation with no peak of H2O2; treatment with ascorbic acid increases its own concentration and accelerates ripening only in mutants to become like wild type plants. Unexpectedly, the treatment with ascorbic acid increases H2O2 synthesis in both mutants resembling what is observed in wild type fruit. Exogenous supplementation with H2O2 decreases its own synthesis delaying fruit maturation in plants with low ascorbic acid content. The site of ROS production is localized in the chloroplasts of fruit of all genotypes as determined by confocal microscopy analysis. The results presented here demonstrate that both ascorbic acid and H2O2 actively participate in tomato fruit ripening.","output":"The effect of low ascorbic acid content on tomato fruit ripening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Commercial vaccines for in ovo vaccination have not yet been developed for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the major coronavirus in the poultry industry. Recombinant IBVs based on the Beaudette strain expressing the Beaudette spike protein (Beau-R) or that from the virulent M41 strain (BeauR-M41(S)) were assessed for their potential as prototype vaccines for application to 18-day-old embryos. Pathogenicity was assessed by observing the effect on hatchability, and/or the production of nasal discharge and/or the effects on ciliary activity in the trachea at various time points post hatch. In contrast to commercial IBV vaccines given in ovo, the Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) strains did not reduce hatchability or cause nasal discharge, and caused minimal damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea. The presence of the spike protein from a virulent virus did not increase the pathogenicity of the virus according to the criteria used. Assessment of the BeauR-M41(S) strain for efficacy showed that it protected up to 90% of chicks against challenge with virulent IB virus (M41) in a dose dependent manner. Further egg passage of the BeauR-M41(S) strain (BeauR-M41(S) EP10) did not increase its pathogenicity though it did improve its efficacy, based on serology and protection against a virulent challenge. BeauR-M41(S) EP10 was more efficacious than BeauR-M41(S) protecting more birds against virulent challenge and providing a better serological antibody response.

Secondary objectives included determining if cyclophosphamide contamination exceeded a defined threshold level of 1 ng/cm2 and if a larger number of prescriptions dispensed resulted in increased contamination. METHODS Mock prescriptions of 40 cyclophosphamide 50 mg tablets were counted on clean trays in three scenarios using a simulated outpatient pharmacy after assaying five cleaned trays as controls. The three scenarios consisted of five simulated dispensings of one, three, or six prescriptions dispensed per scenario. Wipe samples of trays and spatulas were collected and assayed for all trays, including the five clean trays used as controls. Contamination was defined as an assayed cyclophosphamide level at or above 0.001 ng/cm2 and levels above 1 ng/cm2 were considered sufficient to cause risk of human uptake. Mean contamination for each scenario was calculated and compared using one-way analysis of variance. P-values of < 0.05 implied significance. RESULTS Mean cyclophosphamide contamination on trays used to count one, three, and six cyclophosphamide prescriptions was 0.51  0.10 (p=0.0003), 1.02  0.10 (p < 0.0001), and 1.82  0.10 ng/cm2 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Control trays did not show detectable cyclophosphamide contamination. Increasing the number of prescriptions dispensed from 1 to 3, 1 to 6, and 3 to 6 counts increased contamination by 0.51  0.15 (p = 0.0140), 1.31 + 0.15 (p < 0.0001), and 0.80  0.15 ng/cm2 (p = 0.0004), respectively. CONCLUSION Dispensing one or more prescriptions of 40 cyclophosphamide 50 mg tablets contaminates pharmacy counting tools, and an increased number of prescriptions dispensed correlates with increased level of contamination. Counting out three or more prescriptions leads to trays having contamination that surpasses the threshold at which worker exposure may be increased. Pharmacies should consider devoting a separate tray to cyclophosphamide tablets, as cross-contamination could occur with other drugs and the efficacy of decontamination methods is unclear. Employee exposure could be minimized with the use of personal protective equipment, environmental controls, and cleaning trays between uses.

IgE binds to receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophils, and subsequent allergen exposure leads to cross-linking of IgE antibodies and release of cell mediators that cause allergy symptoms. Although this process is quite well-understood, very little is known about the epitopes on the allergen recognized by IgE, despite the importance of the allergen-antibody interaction for the allergic response to occur. This review discusses efforts to analyze allergen-antibody interactions, from the original epitope mapping studies using linear peptides or recombinant allergen fragments, to more sophisticated technologies, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. These state-of-the-art approaches, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, have led to the identification of conformational IgE epitopes. The first structures of an allergen (egg lysozyme) in complex with Fab fragments from IgG antibodies were determined in the 1980s. Since then, IgG has been used as surrogate for IgE, due to the difficulty of obtaining monoclonal IgE antibodies. Technical developments including phage display libraries have contributed to progress in epitope mapping thanks to the isolation of IgE antibody constructs from combinatorial libraries made from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of allergic donors. Most recently, single B cell antibody sequencing and human hybridomas are new breakthrough technologies for finally obtaining human IgE monoclonal antibodies, ideal for epitope mapping. The information on antigenic determinants will facilitate the design of hypoallergens for immunotherapy and the investigation of the fundamental mechanisms of the IgE response.","output":"Structural Aspects of the Allergen-Antibody Interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In high-density megacities, air pollution has a higher impact on public health than cities of lower population density. Apart from higher pollution emissions due to human activities in densely populated street canyons, stagnated air flow due to closely packed tall buildings means lower dispersion potential.

High-density urban morphologies need to be carefully designed to lessen the ill effects of high density urban living. This study addresses the knowledge-gap between planning and design principles and air pollution dispersion potentials in high density cities. The air ventilation assessment for projects in high-density Hong Kong is advanced to include air pollutant dispersion issues. The methods in this study are CFD simulation and parametric study. The SST ʨC model is adopted after balancing the accuracy and computational cost in the comparative study. Urban-scale parametric studies are conducted to clarify the effects of urban permeability and building geometries on air pollution dispersion, for both the outdoor pedestrian environment and the indoor environment in the roadside buildings. Given the finite land resources in high-density cities and the numerous planning and design restrictions for development projects, the effectiveness of mitigation strategies is evaluated to optimize the benefits. A real urban case study is finally conducted to demonstrate that the suggested design principles from the parametric study are feasible in the practical high density urban design.","output":"Improving air quality in high-density cities by understanding the relationship between air pollutant dispersion and urban morphologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Among hypertensive patients, the association between treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and the clinical severity of Covid-19, remains uncertain. AIMS: To determine whether hypertensive patients hospitalized with Covid-19 are at risk of worse outcomes if on treatment with ACEIs or ARBs compared to other anti-hypertensive medications. METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted at a single academic medical center [Fondazione Policlinico A.Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy] from March 1st to 31 st , 2020. We compared patients on treatment with an ACEIs/ARBs (ACEIs/ARBs group) to patients receiving other anti-hypertensive medications (No-ACEIs/ARBs group). The endpoints of the study were the all-cause in-hospital death and the combination of in-hospital death or need for ICU admission. RESULTS: The sample included 166 Covid-19 patients; median age was 74 years and 109 were men (66%). Overall, 111 patients (67%) were taking an ACEIs or ARBs. Twenty-nine patients (17%) died during hospital stay, and 51 (31%) met the combined endpoint. After adjustment for comorbidities, age and degree of severity at the presentation, ACEIs or ARBs treatment was an independent predictor neither of in-hospital death nor of the combination of in-hospital death/need for ICU. No differences were documented between treatment with ACEIs compared to ARBs. CONCLUSIONS: Among hypertensive patients hospitalized for Covid-19, treatment with ACEIs or ARBs is not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. This article is protected by copyright.

However, insufficient vaccine supplies to meet global demand and no effective approved prescribed drugs for COVID-19 have led some people to consider the use of alternative or complementary medicines, such as traditional herbal medicine. Medicinal plants have various therapeutic properties that depend on the active compounds they contain. Obviously, herbal medicine has had an essential role in treatment and prevention during COVID-19 outbreak, especially in Asian cultures. Hence, we reviewed the uses of herbal medicine in Asian cultures and described the prominent families and species that are sources of antiviral agents against COVID-19 on the basis of case reports, community surveys, and guidelines available in the literature databases. Antiviral efficacy as determined in laboratory testing was assessed, and several promising active compounds with their molecular targets in cell models against SARS-CoV-2 viral infection will be discussed. Our review findings revealed the highly frequent use of Lamiaceae family members, Zingiber officinale, and Glycyrrhiza spp. as medicinal sources for treatment of COVID-19. In addition, several plant bioactive compounds derived from traditional herbal medicine, including andrographolide, panduratin A, baicalein, digoxin, and digitoxin, have shown potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity as compared with some repurposed FDA-approved drugs.

Not surprisingly, natural antioxidants play pivotal roles in the decreasing of these diseases by their hydrophilicity, permeability, multi-factored interactions with biological surroundings, while the antioxidative effects are dependent upon the bond energies, donors or acceptors of hydrogen bonds as well as other physical properties of the functional groups. However, in comparison with natural antioxidants the synthetic antioxidants sometimes exhibit potentially deleterious effects, viz., pro-oxidative properties, and it is thereby worth exploring the structures of natural antioxidants with the aim of achieving valuable information for the antioxidative structures. Here, more than 70 natural antioxidants are collected from recent publications, and their configurations are optimized at MM2 level for summarizing the common characteristics from their structures. It is found that all the natural phenols, flavonoids, anthraquinones, alkaloids, terpenoids, and steroids exert three-dimensional (3D) architectures rather than a merely planar conjugation system. Hence, this 3D conformation might be beneficial for the natural antioxidants being recognized by biological surroundings. This deduction has been demonstrated by some synthetic antioxidants, in which their structures have been conformed to be 3D architecture. The 3D architecture will become a direction for the designing of antioxidative structures, and the testing of antioxidative effect is encouraged to employ signaling pathways, protein targets, and cell lines rather than individual radical-scavenging evaluation.","output":"Why natural antioxidants are readily recognized by biological systems? 3D architecture plays a role!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to discuss the guidelines and modification of practices with respect to corneal transplantation and eye banking during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period and beyond, at a network of tertiary care centers in India. METHODS: Descriptive study of the challenges faced in eye banking during the lockdown, and practices adopted to overcome the critical aspects in the clinical care of patients who presented with emergency corneal diseases requiring keratoplasty. RESULTS: Complete lockdown orders from the Indian government, as a strategy to control the Coronavirus pandemic, resulted in drastic reduction of all types of elective corneal transplants and eye banking activities from March 24, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The sudden cessation of eye banking resulted in an acute demand and supply imbalance of fresh donor corneas for transplants during this time. Our network of eye banks addressed this issue by adopting glycerol preservation of donor corneas, which were subsequently utilized for tectonic penetrating keratoplasty. The donor cornea retrieval was resumed in a strategized manner 3 weeks prior to the date of exit of the lockdown, with modified guidelines on donor suitability, screening, retrieval, processing, and harvesting from various sources. A triage of keratoplasty priority was formulated to tide over the post lockdown shortage of corneas. We performed 31 therapeutic keratoplasties during the nationwide lockdown among our network of tertiary eye care centers. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the approach and strategies to manage and tide over an unprecedented crisis situation faced by corneal surgeons in general and, specifically, the eye banking community.","output":"Corneal transplantation and eye banking practices during COVID-19-related lockdown period in India from a network of tertiary eye care centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously temporarily named 2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019.

The goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of face coverings as a protective measure. We examined the effectiveness of face coverings between 1 April and 31 December 2020. This was accomplished by analyzing trends of daily new COVID-19 cases, cumulative confirmed cases, and cases per 100,000 people in different U.S. states, including the District of Columbia. The results indicated a sharp change in trends after face covering mandates. For the 32 states with face covering mandates, 63% and 66% exhibited a downward trend in confirmed cases within 21 and 28 days of implementation, respectively. We estimated that face covering mandates in the 32 states prevented approximately 78,571 and 109,703 cases within 21- and 28-day periods post face covering mandate, respectively.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and need for certifying practicing surgeons and to assess proficiency of operating room (OR) personnel. METHODS Through a patient safety and health care delivery effectiveness grant, investigators at four state medical schools received funding for FLS certification of all attending surgeons and OR personnel credentialed in laparoscopy. Data were voluntarily collected under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Surgeons performed a single repetition of the FLS tasks oriented to the FLS proficiency-based curriculum and online cognitive materials and were encouraged to self-practice. The FLS certification examination was administered 2 months later under standard conditions. Operating room nurses and scrub technicians were enrolled in a curriculum with cognitive materials and a multistation skills practicum. Baseline and completion questionnaires were administered. Performance was assessed using signed-rank and (2) analysis. RESULTS The study aimed to enroll 99 surgeons. Subsequently, 87 surgeons completed at least one portion of the curriculum, 72 completed the entire curriculum (73% compliance), 83 completed the baseline skills assessment, and 27 (33%) failed. The self-reported practice time was 3.7  2.5 h. At certification (n = 76), skills performance had improved from 317  102.9 to 402  54.2 (p < 0.0001). One surgeon (1.3%) failed the skills certification, and nine (11.8%) failed the cognitive exam. Remediation was completed by six surgeons. Of the 64 enrolled OR personnel, 22 completed the curriculum (34% compliance). All achieved proficiency at skills, and 60% passed the cognitive exam. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that FLS certification for practicing surgeons and proficiency verification for OR personnel are feasible. A baseline skills failure rate of 33% and a certification failure rate of 13% suggest that FLS certification may be necessary to ensure surgeon competency. Fortunately, with only moderate practice, significant improvement can be achieved.","output":"Ensuring competency: are fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery training and certification necessary for practicing surgeons and operating room personnel?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims at developing and demonstrating in a real case study a methodology for supporting Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and assessment of preventive measures to reduce the risks of COVID-19 outbreaks within their entities. The proposed methodology applies the concepts from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to the current challenge of preventing risks of contagion of viruses like SARS-COV-2 among employees. For this purpose, the authors consider a network of employees whose interaction is caused by triggers, which are defined as common circumstances between two workers that may result in contagion, like sharing an office or participating in the same management board. The network cohesion is then evaluated, and those core nodes, which are the most significant contributors to its integration, are identified to be addressed in the design of the preventive measures. The impact of the designed preventive measures on the networks' cohesion is assessed for its prioritization and further deployment. The methodology has been demonstrated in a real case, a Spanish Research Center, providing promising results in a quick and easy manner. The objective insights provided by its application were demonstrated as very valuable for the Occupational Health and Safety Services in the design and evaluation of the set of preventing measures to be implemented before the return of the employees to the facilities after the Spanish confinement period.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined data from every patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to White Plains Hospital between March 9, 2020, and June 3, 2020. We used binomial logistic regression to analyze data for all patients, and propensity score matching for those treated with hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). The primary outcome of interest was inpatient mortality. RESULTS: 1,108 admitted patients with COVID-19 were available for analysis, of which 124 (11.2%) were excluded due to incomplete data. Of the 984 patients included, 225 (22.9%) died. Risk for death decreased for each day later a patient was admitted [OR 0.970, CI 0.955 to 0.985; p < 0.001]. Elevated initial C-reactive protein (CRP) value was associated with a higher risk for death at 96 hours [OR 1.007, 1.002 to 1.012; p = 0.006]. Hydroxychloroquine and CP administration were each associated with increased mortality [OR 3.4, CI 1.614 to 7.396; p = 0.002, OR 2.8560, CI 1.361 to 6.160; p = 0.006 respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CRP carried significant odds of early death.

Using type I interferons as an adjuvant to vaccination could prove to be a potent strategy. However, type I interferons have a short half-life. Albumin linked to a protein will prolong the half-life of the linked protein. METHODS: In this study, we explored the fusion of albumin to IFN (Alb-IFN) for its functional activity both in vitro and in vivo. We determined the half-life of Alb-IFN following treatment in the serum, tumor, and tumor draining lymph nodes in both wild type and FcRn knockout mice. We characterized the ability of Alb-IFN to enhance antigen-specific CD8+ T cells using ovalbumin (OVA) or human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 long peptides. Next, we evaluated the therapeutic antitumor effect of coadministration of AlbIFN with antigenic peptides against HPVE7 expressing tumor and the treatments ability to generate HPVE7 antigen specific CD8+ T cells. The contribution of the antitumor effect by lymphocytes was also examined by an antibody depletion experiment. The ability of Alb-IFN to serve as an adjuvant was tested using clinical grade therapeutic protein-based HPV vaccine, TACIN. RESULTS: Alb-IFN retains biological function and does not alter the biological activity of IFN. In addition, Alb-IFN extends half-life of IFN in serum, lymph nodes and tumor. The coadministration of Alb-IFN with OVA or HPVE7 antigenic peptides enhances antigen-specific CD8 +T cell immunity, and in a TC-1 tumor model results in a significant therapeutic antitumor effect. We found that CD8 +T cells and dendritic cells, but not CD4 +T cells, are important for the observed antitumor therapeutic effect mediated by Alb-IFN. Finally, Alb-IFN served as a potent adjuvant for TA-CIN for the treatment of HPV antigen expressing tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, Alb-IFN serves as a potent adjuvant for enhancement of strong antigen-specific CD8 +T cell antitumor immunity, reduction of tumor burden, and increase in overall survival. Alb-IFN potentially can serve as an innovative adjuvant for the development of vaccines for the control of infectious disease and cancer.","output":"Albumin and interferon- fusion protein serves as an effective vaccine adjuvant to enhance antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article was migrated.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious.

Traditional techniques require the placement of invasive central venous access devices. This study aimed to compare two non-invasive technologies for the estimation of regional venous saturation (reflectance plethysmography and near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]), using venous blood gas analysis as gold standard. Forty patients undergoing cardiac surgery were recruited in two groups. In the first group a reflectance pulse oximeter probe was placed on the skin overlying the internal jugular vein. In the second group, a Somanetics INVOS oximeter patch was placed on the skin overlying the internal jugular vein and overlying the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. Central venous catheters were placed in all patients. Oxygen saturation estimates from both groups were compared with measured saturation from venous blood. Twenty patients participated in each group.Data were analyzed by the limits of agreement technique suggested by Bland and Altman and by linear regression analysis. In the reflectance plethysmography group, the mean bias was 4.27% and the limits of agreement were 58.3 to -49.8% (r(2) = 0.00, p = 0.98). In the NIRS group the mean biases were 10.8% and 2.0% for the sensors attached over the cerebral hemisphere and over the internal jugular vein, respectively, and the limits of agreement were 33.1 to -11.4 and 19.5 to -15.5% (r(2) = 0.22, 0.28;p = 0.04, 0.03) for the cerebral hemisphere and internal jugular sites, respectively. While transcutaneous regional oximetry and NIRS have both been used to estimate venous and tissue oxygen saturation non-invasively, the correlation between estimates of ScvO(2) and SxvO(2) were statistically significant for near infrared spectroscopy, but not for transcutaneous regional oximetry. Placement of cerebral oximetry patches directly over the internal jugular vein (as opposed to on the forehead) appeared to approximate internal jugular venous saturation better (lower mean bias and tighter limits of agreement), which suggests this modality may with refinement offer the practitioner additional clinically useful information regarding global cerebral oxygen supply and demand matching.","output":"Non-invasive estimation of jugular venous oxygen saturation: a comparison between near infrared spectroscopy and transcutaneous venous oximetry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital and physical footprints are a trail of user activities collected over the use of software applications and systems.

However, existing data protection and privacy regulations provide key principles in high-level, making it difficult for software engineers to design and implement privacy-aware systems. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy that provides a comprehensive set of privacy requirements based on four well-established personal data protection regulations and privacy frameworks, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ISO/IEC 29100, Thailand Personal Data Protection Act (Thailand PDPA) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) privacy framework. These requirements are extracted, refined and classified into a level that can be used to map with issue reports. We have also performed a study on how two large open-source software projects (Google Chrome and Moodle) address the privacy requirements in our taxonomy through mining their issue reports. The paper discusses how the collected issues were classified, and presents the findings and insights generated from our study. Mining and classifying privacy requirements in issue reports can help organisations be aware of their state of compliance by identifying privacy requirements that have not been addressed in their software projects.

Fatality rate serves as a key indicator for the effectiveness of potential treatments or interventions. With limited time and understanding of novel emerging epidemics, comparisons of the fatality rates in real-time among different groups, say, divided by treatment, age, or area, have an important role to play in informing public health strategies. We propose a statistical test for the null hypothesis of equal real-time fatality rates across multiple groups during an ongoing epidemic. An elegant property of the proposed test statistic is that it converges to a Brownian motion under the null hypothesis, which allows one to develop a sequential testing approach for rejecting the null hypothesis at the earliest possible time when statistical evidence accumulates. This property is particularly important as scientists and clinicians are competing with time to identify possible treatments or effective interventions to combat the emerging epidemic. The method is widely applicable as it only requires the cumulative number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. A large-scale simulation study shows that the finite-sample performance of the proposed test is highly satisfactory. The proposed test is applied to compare the difference in disease severity among Wuhan, Hubei province (exclude Wuhan) and mainland China (exclude Hubei) from February to March 2020. The result suggests that the disease severity is potentially associated with the health care resource availability during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China.","output":"A sequential test to compare the real-time fatality rates of a disease among multiple groups with an application to COVID-19 data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This perspective article defines and discusses the concept of the village when working with families who are experiencing multiple adversities.

Blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 2 min throughout, while affect was assessed at baseline, after the final task, and following recovery. The rTSST was feasible to administer with minimal technical issues reported. Participants reported lower positive affect and higher negative affect during the tasks in the stress condition relative to controls. Similarly, stress participants had higher cardiovascular responses during the tasks relative to controls, except that blood pressure was not elevated during mental arithmetic in stress participants relative to controls.

As a first step towards understanding the biological role of E protein during PRRSV replication, E gene expression was blocked in a full-length infectious clone by mutating the ATG translational initiation to GTG, such that the full-length mutant genomic clone was unable to synthesize the E protein. DNA transfection of PRRSV-susceptible cells with the E gene knocked-out genomic clone showed the absence of virus infectivity. P129-E-transfected cells however produced virion particles in the culture supernatant, and these particles contained viral genomic RNA, demonstrating that the E protein is essential for PRRSV infection but dispensable for virion assembly. Electron microscopy suggests that the P129-E virions assembled in the absence of E had a similar appearance to the wild-type particles. Strand-specific RT-PCR demonstrated that the E protein-negative, non-infectious P129-E virus particles were able to enter cells but further steps of replication were interrupted. The entry of PRRSV has been suggested to be via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and lysomotropic basic compounds and known ion-channel blocking agents both inhibited PRRSV replication effectively during the uncoating process. The expression of E protein in Escherichia coli-mediated cell growth arrests and increased the membrane permeability. Cross-linking experiments in cells infected with PRRSV or transfected with E gene showed that the E protein was able to form homo-oligomers. Taken together, our data suggest that the PRRSV E protein is likely an ion-channel protein embedded in the viral envelope and facilitates uncoating of virus and release of the genome in the cytoplasm.","output":"The small envelope protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus possesses ion channel protein-like properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a high incidence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to the worsening of the clinical outcome in affected patients.

ABSTRACT Oscillatory brain activity coordinates the response of cortical neurons to synaptic inputs in a phase-dependent manner. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human primary motor cortex elicits larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs) when applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the sensorimotor -rhythm recorded with electroencephalography (EEG), demonstrating that this phase represents a state of higher excitability of the cortico-spinal system. Here, we investigated the influence of the phase of the -rhythm on cortical responses to TMS as measured by EEG. We tested different stimulation intensities above and below resting motor threshold (RMT), and a realistic sham TMS condition. TMS at 110% RMT applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the -rhythm was associated with higher absolute amplitudes of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) at 70 ms (P70) and 100 ms (N100). Enhancement of the N100 was confirmed with negative peak-triggered 90% RMT TMS, while phase of the -rhythm did not influence evoked responses elicited by sham TMS. These findings extend the notion that TMS applied at the negative vs. positive peak of the endogenous -oscillation recruits a larger portion of neurons as a function of stimulation intensity. This further corroborates that brain oscillations determine fluctuations in cortical excitability and establishes phase-triggered EEG-TMS as a sensitive tool to investigate the effects of brain oscillations on stimulus-related cortical dynamics.

Patients were randomized in blocks, to receive either HCQ 400mg twice a day for the first day followed by 200mg twice daily for the next 4 days plus standard of care (SOC) treatment or SOC treatment alone. SARS COV-2 viral load using nasal/orapharyngeal swabs was performed at baseline, day 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. The primary outcome was median time from randomization to SARS COV-2 viral clearance by day 6. Results: Of the 105 participants enrolled, 55 were assigned to the intervention group (HCQ plus SOC) and 50 to the control group (SOC only). Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms.

METHODS: We used four undifferentiated and two partially differentiated human developing neuronal cell lines. Infectivity was confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA) probing with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, evaluation of cytopathic effects, and neurite formation. We induced partial differentiation of all cell lines (since both olfactory cell lines were terminally differentiated) with retinoic acid (RA) to determine whether differentiation was a factor in viral permissiveness. The expression of serine protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors were examined by RT-qPCR and IFA to determine the mechanism of viral entry. RESULTS: Four to five days after exposure, both olfactory cell lines exhibited morphological evidence of infection; IFA analyses indicated that ~30% of the neurons were SARS-CoV-2 positive. At two weeks, 70C80% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The partially differentiated (CRL-2266 and CRL-2267) and undifferentiated cell lines (CRL-2142, CRL-2149, CRL-127, and CDL-2271) were essentially non-permissive. After RA treatment, only CRL-127 exhibited slight permissiveness (RT-qPCR). The TMPRSS2 receptor showed high expression in olfactory neurons, but low expression in RA treated CRL-127. ACE2 exhibited high expression in olfactory neurons, whereas other cell lines showed low expression, including RA-treated cell lines. ACE2 expression slightly increased in CRL-127 post RA-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies confirm neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 to olfactory neurons with viral entry likely mediated by TMPRSS2/ACE2. Other neuronal cell lines were non-permissive. Our results established that the nerve cells were infected regardless of male or female origin and strengthened the reported association of COVID-19 with loss of smell in infected individuals.","output":"Infectivity of Human Olfactory Neurons to SARS-CoV-2: A Link to Anosmia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: At the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic the focus of attention was on children and adolescents with chronic lung diseases. Due to a lack of epidemiological data and clinical experience, it was feared that children with respiratory diseases were a risk group for particularly severe courses of COVID-19, as has been reported for adults. Objective: The currently available (epidemiological) data on this patient group are presented as well as a description of our own experiences based on three selected cases. Material and methods: A review of the literature was carried out and three selected case reports and a discussion of current recommendations are presented. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than in adults. Furthermore, the known risk factors in adults cannot be simply transferred to pediatric patients. In the majority of cases, children and adolescents with chronic lung diseases show a milder course of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Conclusion: Although the hitherto available data show that children and adolescents have a lower risk for COVID-19 courses than adults, it should not be ignored that fatal outcomes have also been reported in pediatric patients. Moreover, late effects, such as the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) can sometimes lead to a fatal outcome. Nevertheless, care must be taken that this vulnerable patient group does not suffer from avoidable negative side effects of restriction and isolation measures. As an example, the no-show behavior in outpatient departments during the lockdown might have led to a relevant undertreatment of underlying chronic health conditions.","output":"COVID-19 bei Kindern und Jugendlichen mit chronischen Lungenerkrankungen: Klinische Erfahrungen und Perspektiven./ [COVID-19 in children and adolescents with chronic lung diseases]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innate immunity against pathogens is known to be mediated by: barriers to pathogen invasion, activation of complement, recruitment of immune cells, immune cell phagocytosis of pathogens, death of infected cells, and activation of the adaptive immunity via antigen presentation.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled consecutive patients aged 18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test who were admitted to hospital. The participants were divided into the test-based (TB) policy group or symptom-based (SB) group depending on the policy valid at their hospital discharge. Multivariable analyses were performed to assess the factors related to the duration of hospital stay and viral clearance. RESULTS: The study involved 305 patients (66.6% men). The mean age was 60.9 (15.2) years. TB and SB policy groups consisted of 145 (47.5%) and 160 patients (52.5%), respectively. The TB group had significantly longer duration of hospital stay (21.0 vs 16.0, P = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, SB policy was associated with significantly shorter hospital stay (-coefficient -5.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] -9.78 to -1.96, P = 0.003).

Here, we evaluate the changes in nationwide use of broad-spectrum antibiotics during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. METHODS: We obtained national reimbursement data on the prescription of antibiotics, including penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. We examined the number of antibiotic prescriptions compared with the previous three years in the same period from August to July. To quantify the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on antibiotic use, we developed a regression model adjusting for changes of viral acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) which are an important factor driving antibiotic use. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea, the broad-spectrum antibiotic use dropped by 15%-55% compared to the previous 3 years. Overall reduction in antibiotic use adjusting for ARTIs was estimated to be 14%-30%, with a larger impact in children. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that broad-spectrum antibiotic use was substantially reduced during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea.

N = 40 qualitative interviews were conducted remotely (phone/video) from participants across England and Wales, and transcribed verbatim. Descriptive case studies were shared at regular analysis meetings. Inductive reflexive thematic coding was undertaken and coding was discussed using a team approach to agreeing analytical codes. A multiple lens theoretical perspective was adopted to illuminate the perceived influences and restrictions on participants' reports of health behaviour change. RESULTS: There was a clear progressive narrative for all participants, through initial responses and reactions to the pandemic, framed as disruption, then, as lockdown was acclimatized to, evidence of adaptation. Adaptation was seen in terms of modification, substitution, adoption, discontinuation/cessation, stultification, maintenance and recalibration of health behaviours.

The current scantiness of viral genomic data and underutilisation of advanced molecular analysis methods on influenza viruses circulating in Africa has limited their extensive study and representation in the global influenza ecology. We aimed to sequence influenza type-A viruses (IAVs) that previously circulated in Uganda and characterised their genetic relatedness to the vaccine viruses and publicly available Africa IAVs. Methods This was an observational study nested to the Uganda national influenza surveillance programme. We used Next-generation sequencing to locally generate genomes from 116 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 118 A(H3N2) viruses collected between 2010 and 2018 from 7 districts across Uganda. A total of 206 hemagglutinin (HA), 207 neuraminidase (NA), and 213 matrix protein (MP) sequences were genetically compared to the WHO-recommended vaccines and other viruses isolated from Africa since 1994. Viral temporal and spatial divergence and circulating genetic clades were characterised using phylogenetic methods. Findings We successfully generated gene sequences for 919% (215/234) viruses. Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus HA, NA, and MP proteins had 9636-9909%, 9649-9939%, and 9748-9995% amino acid similarity, respectively, to vaccines recommended from 2010 through 2020. The local viruses incorporated amino acid substitutions (AAS) in their antigenic, receptor binding, and glycosylation sites each year causing them to antigenically drift away from vaccines. For seasons when vaccine formulations differed, Uganda IAV antigenic sites had 1-2 extra AAS relative to the Southern than Northern hemisphere vaccine viruses. All Uganda IAVs carried the adamantine-resistance marker S31N but not the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance markers H274Y and H275Y. However, some A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had permissive substitutions V234I, N369K, and V241I typical of NAI-resistant viruses. The 2017-2018 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to global genetic clade 6B.1, while the A(H3N2) viruses isolated in 2017 belonged to clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a. Uganda IAVs obtained before 2016 clustered distinctly from other Africa viruses while later viruses mixed with other Africa, especially Kenya and Congo, and global viruses. Several unique viral lineages (bootstrap >90) persisted in Uganda and other countries for 1-3 years. Interpretation The study reveals Uganda as part of the global influenza ecology with continuous importation, antigenic drift, and extensive local transmission of IAVs, presenting a potential risk of future outbreaks. For a country with limited health resources and where social distancing is not sustainable, viral prevention by vaccination should be prioritized. The notable viral diversity in Africa is a warning to countries to broaden and incorporate genome analysis in routine surveillance to monitor circulating and detect new viruses. This knowledge can inform virus selection for vaccine production and assist in developing cost-effective virus control strategies.

METHODS: Three hundred five patients with unexplained reduced LVEF of &#8804;45% who underwent both CA and CMR imaging were retrospectively registered. Patients were classified as CMR+ or CMR- according to presence or absence of myocardial ischemic scar, and classified CA+ or CA- according to presence or absence of significant coronary artery disease. RESULTS: CMR+ (na?=a?89) included all 54 CA+ patients, except 2 with distal coronary artery disease in whom no revascularization was proposed. Among the 247 CA- patients, 15% were CMR+. CMR imaging had 96% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 99% negative predictive value, and 58% positive predictive value for detecting CA+ patients. Revascularization was performed in 6.5% of the patients (all CMR+). Performing CA only for CMR+ patients would have decreased the number of CAs by 71%.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze university-based Master of Public Health (MPH) programs offered at Faculties of Public Health (FPH) and of Medicine (FM) in Arab countries. METHODS: We searched a regional database of academic public health institutions, conducted a search of university websites, and reviewed websites of the Association of Arab Universities and World Directory of Medical Schools. A factsheet for each MPH program was emailed to deans of respective faculties for validation and completion. We examined associations between presence of such programs and population size and Human Development Index (HDI). FINDINGS: A total of 19 FPH and 10 FM at 28 universities offer MPH programs (7 programs per 100 million population). Ten countries offer no MPH programs; the remaining 12 offer 1C5 programs each. Ten MPH programs were initiated over 45 years (1965C2009) and another 19 over 10 years (2010C2019). No correlation was observed between offering an MPH program and the countrys HDI or population size. Less than half of the programs admit students from fields outside health. FPH and FM-based programs are comparable in offering core disciplines but FPH programs offer more Social and Behavioral Sciences (83% vs. 60%). More FM-based programs provide practicum training (78% vs. 53%); 10 programs offer none. Epidemiology, alone or with Biostatistics, and Health Management and Policy are the two most frequently offered MPH concentrations. None of the MPH programs offer a concentration on public health in conflict or humanitarian crises; only one offers a certificate on the theme. Only three programs, all FPH-based, reported international accreditation. CONCLUSIONS: The recent increase in MPH programs in Arab countries is encouraging. Critical gaps are absence of MPH programs in 10 countries, less coverage of the social sciences, and lack of practicum experience in 10 programs. Upgrading and promoting public health education across the region to fill these gaps calls for collaboration among existing MPH programs.

Several studies have now identified long-COVID in >50% of COVID-19 patients, emphasizing the need for elucidating mechanisms underlying these symptoms. Pain is a prevalent symptom in long-COVID patients and presents as headache, persistent muscle pain, joint pain, stomach pain, chest pain, respiratory discomfort, and dysesthesia or paresthesia. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of pain maintenance in these patients could provide information on novel therapeutic strategies. Our lab has previously identified novel treatments for pain due to peripheral inflammation from dysesthesia-inducing mechanisms associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) respiratory infection in hamsters (1-4 days post-infection, dpi). We have also previously demonstrated the validity of long-term infection of hamsters (30-60 dpi) as a pre-clinical model of long-COVID. By utilizing the Von Frey assay, we found that SCV2, but not Influenza A, causes mechanical hypersensitivity at 28 dpi in both male and female hamsters. Bulk RNA sequencing of 31 dpi thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) revealed a unique transcriptional perturbation signature (168 DEGs, 47 up & 121 down, p-adj.<0.1), despite viral clearance at approximately 7 dpi. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of this sequencing (853 DEGs, p-nom.<0.05) identified several injury-related canonical pathways, including Production of NO & ROS in Macrophages, Signaling by Rho Family GTPases, mTOR Signaling, Estrogen Receptor Signaling, and Ephrin Receptor Signaling. The Enrichr DisGeNET browser associated these transcriptional changes with clinical neurodegeneration phenotypes, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease, Neurodegenerative Disorders, and Parkinson Disease. Of note, TUNEL staining did not demonstrate any sign of SCV2-induced sensory neuron apoptosis at 31 dpi. Further investigation of the sequencing dataset revealed a broad downregulation of TubbmRNA isoforms and Mbp, suggesting microtubule and myelin dysregulation. We also observed a drastic increase in Scn8areads, which could point to Nav 1.6-induced DRG neuron hyperexcitability. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SCV2 leaves a lasting hypersensitivity-associated transcriptomic signature in DRGs despite early viral clearance that appears to be associated with neurodegeneration mechanisms. As we continue investigating the mechanisms underlying SCV2-induced actions in DRGs and peripheral nerves, we will also use an upstream regulator analysis of our RNA sequencing data to identify promising therapeutic targets.","output":"Persistent SARS-CoV-2 Effects Induce Neuropathy Signature in Dorsal Root Ganglia Underlying Hypersensitivity in a Hamster Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the experiences of Chinese university teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on the teaching and learning methods adopted and the benefits and challenges encountered in the process.

Using a discrete choice experiment, we invited participants to make a series of choices between policy scenarios aimed at relaxing the lockdown, which were specified not in terms of their nature (e.g. whether or not to allow schools to re-open) but in terms of their effects along seven dimensions. These included health-related effects, but also impacts on the economy, education, and personal income. From the observed choices, we were able to infer the implicit trade-offs made by the Dutch between these policy effects. For example, we find that the average citizen, in order to avoid one fatality directly or indirectly related to COVID-19, is willing to accept a lasting lag in the educational performance of 18 children, or a lasting (>3 years) and substantial (>15%) reduction in net income of 77 households. We explore heterogeneity across individuals in terms of these trade-offs by means of latent class analysis. Our results suggest that most citizens are willing to trade-off health-related and other effects of the lockdown, implying a consequentialist ethical perspective. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the elderly, known to be at relatively high risk of being affected by the virus, are relatively reluctant to sacrifice economic pain and educational disadvantages for the younger generation, to avoid fatalities. We also identify a so-called taboo trade-off aversion amongst a substantial share of our sample, being an aversion to accept morally problematic policies that simultaneously imply higher fatality numbers and lower taxes. We explain various ways in which our results can be of value to policy makers in the context of the COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"Diabolical dilemmas of COVID-19: An empirical study into Dutch society's trade-offs between health impacts and other effects of the lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), is the most common treatment approach for common bile duct (CBD) stones.

About 37% (n=10) had pre-operative biliary stent. Pre-operative MRCP was done in 74% (n=20), and the mean diameter of CBD was 14.5 mm (range 7-30). The median operative time was 160 (range 80-265) min. The operative drain was inserted in 18 patients. One patient each (4%) had a bile leak and a retained stone. There was no open conversion, readmission, or mortality. Conclusion 3D LCBDE with primary repair by an absorbable barbed suture is safe and feasible. Relevance for patients This paper emphasized that one stage LCBDE should be a treatment option which is comparable with two stage ERCP followed by LC to treat CBD stones. In addition, 3D technology and barbed sutures use in LCBDE are safe and useful.","output":"3D Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration with primary repair by absorbable barbed suture is safe and feasible."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the lengthy process of producing the COVID-19 vaccine, most countries are trying to implement various low-cost strategies to slow down the spread of the virus and try to normalize the living conditions in society besides reducing the current recession.

Individuals and groups were compelled to construct theories of common sense about the disease to communicate and guide practices. The theory of social representations provides powerful concepts to analyse the psychosocial construction of COVID-19. This study aimed to understand the social representations of COVID-19 constructed by middle-class Brazilian adults and their ideological implications, providing a social-psychological analysis of these phenomena while the pandemic is still ongoing. We adopted a qualitative approach based on semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted online in April-May 2020. Participants were 13 middle-class Brazilians living in urban areas. We analysed the interviews with thematic analysis and a phenomenological approach. The social representations were organised around three themes: 1) a virus originated in human actions and with anthropocentric meanings (e.g., a punishment for the human-led destruction of the environment);2) a dramatic disease that attacks the lungs and kills people perceived to have \\"low immunity\\";and 3) a disturbing pandemic that was also conceived as a correction event with positive consequences. The social representations included beliefs about the individualistic determination of immunity, the attribution of divine causes to the pandemic, and the need for the moral reformation of humankind. The discussion highlights the ideological implications of these theories of common sense. Socially underprivileged groups are at greater COVID-19-related risk, which the investigated social representations may contribute to conceal and naturalise.","output":"Social Representations and Ideology: Theories of Common Sense About COVID-19 Among Middle-Class Brazilians and Their Ideological Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread from China in 2019/2020 to all continents. Significant geographical and ethnic differences were described, and host genetic background seems to be important for the resistance to and mortality of COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism (rs4646994) is one of the candidates with the potential to affect infection symptoms and mortality. METHODS: In our study, we successfully genotyped 408 SARS-CoV-2-positive COVID-19 survivors (163 asymptomatic and 245 symptomatic) and compared them with a population-based DNA bank of 2,559 subjects. RESULTS: The frequency of ACE I/I homozygotes was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with that in controls (26.2% vs. 21.2%; P = 0.02; OR [95% CI] = 1.55 [1.17-2.05]. Importantly, however, the difference was driven just by the symptomatic subjects (29.0% vs. 21.2% of the I/I homozygotes; P = 0.002; OR [95% CI] = 1.78 [1.22-2.60]). The genotype distribution of the ACE genotypes was almost identical in population controls and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (P = 0.76).

At the forefront of the ICU are highly trained nurses with a professional obligation to care for patients with COVID-19 despite the potential to become infected. The aim of this study was to explore ICU nurses' willingness to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study to explore ICU nurses' willingness to provide care during the COVID-19 pandemic was undertaken between 25 March and 3 April 2020 at a large principal and referral teaching hospital in Sydney, NSW Australia. RESULTS: A total of 83 ICU nurses completed the survey. Approximately 60% reported receiving sufficient information from managers regarding COVID-19 and about caring for a patient with COVID-19. Ninety percent of nurses were concerned about spreading COVID-19 to their family. Sixty one percent of the nurses indicated that they were willing to care for patients with COVID-19. Receiving timely communication from managers was the only predictor of willingness to care among ICU nurses.

Public health is being attacked with influenza containing new genes from a genetic assortment between animals and humankind. Unfortunately, the population does not have immunity for mutant genes and is attacked in every viral outbreak season. For these reasons, fast and accurate devices are in high demand. As currently used methods like Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests lack specificity, time and cost-savings, new methods are being developed.

M-NP(L&K) are made with polymeric cores wrapped with natural macrophage membrane doped with melittin and MJ-33. The membrane incorporated melittin and MJ-33 function as a PLA2 attractant and a PLA2 inhibitor, respectively. These molecules, together with membrane lipids, work synergistically to lure and kill PLA2 enzymes. These nanoparticles can neutralize PLA2 activity in the sera of mice and human patients with acute pancreatitis in a dose-dependent manner and suppress PLA2-induced inflammatory response accordingly. In mouse models of both mild and severe acute pancreatitis, M-NP(L&K) confer effective protection against disease-associated inflammation, tissue damage and lethality.

The iStable integrated server (predictor.nchu.edu.tw/iStable) was used to predict shifts in the protein stability due to mutations. A total of 372 variants were observed in the 332 SARS-CoV-2 sequences with several variants incident in multiple patients accounting for a total of 1596 incidences. Asymptomatic and Deceased specific mutants constituted 32% and 62% of the repertoire respectively indicating their exclusivity. However, the most prevalent mutations were those present in both. Though some parts of the genome are more variable than others but there was clear difference between incidence and prevalence. NSP3 with 68 variants had total occurrence of only 105 whereas Spike protein had 346 occurrences with just 66 variants. For Deleterious variants, NSP3 had the highest incidence of 25 followed by NSP2 (16), ORF3a (14) and N (14). Spike protein had just 7 Deleterious variants out of 66. Deceased patients have more Deleterious than Neutral variants as compared to the symptomatic ones.

Here we re-examine these published datasets. We report that only a few pangolin samples were found to contain coronavirus reads, and even then in low abundance, while other non-pangolin hosted viruses were present in higher abundance. We also discovered extensive contamination with human, rodent, and other mammalian gene sequences, which was a surprising finding. Furthermore, we uncovered a number of pangolin CoV sequences embedded in standard laboratory cloning vectors, which suggests the pangolin specimens could have been contaminated with sequences derived from synthetic biology experiments. Finally, we discover a third pangolin dataset (He et al. 2022) with low levels of SARSr-CoV sequences and unambiguous extensive contamination of several pangolin samples.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Observational, prospective study based on the registry of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest emergencies the SUMMA112 ambulance service responded to between March 1 and April 30, 2020, in the Spanish autonomous community of Madrid. The registry is a Utstein-style database. The period of March-April 2019 was the control period for direct comparison with the 2020 study period and with the January-February periods of 2019 and 2020. RESULTS The responders undertook advanced CPR in 146 of the 313 cardiopulmonary arrest cases registered during March-April, 2020. Of the 87 patients with COVID-19-positive tests, 33 reached the hospital alive. Advanced CPR was not applied in 167 cases; the most frequent reason was prolonged circulatory collapse.

Problems with the design or application of criteria are known to occur and pose risks to participants safety and trial integrity, sometimes also negatively impacting on trial recruitment and generalisability. We conducted a short, exploratory survey to gather evidence on UK recruiters experiences interpreting and applying eligibility criteria and their views on how criteria are communicated and developed. METHODS: Our survey included topics informed by a wider programme of work at the Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Leeds, on assuring eligibility criteria quality. Respondents were asked to answer based on all their trial experience, not only on experiences with our trials. The survey was disseminated to recruiters collaborating on trials run at our trials unit, and via other mailing lists and social media. The quantitative responses were descriptively analysed, with inductive analysis of free-text responses to identify themes. RESULTS: A total of 823 eligible respondents participated. In total, 79% of respondents reported finding problems with eligibility criteria in some trials, and 9% in most trials. The main themes in the types of problems experienced were criteria clarity (67% of comments), feasibility (34%), and suitability (14%). In total, 27% of those reporting some level of problem said these problems had led to patients being incorrectly included in trials; 40% said they had led to incorrect exclusions. Most respondents (56%) reported accessing eligibility criteria mainly in the trial protocol. Most respondents (74%) supported the idea of recruiter review of eligibility criteria earlier in the protocol development process. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey corroborates other evidence about the existence of suboptimal trial eligibility criteria. Problems with clarity were the most often reported, but the number of comments on feasibility and suitability suggest some recruiters feel eligibility criteria and associated assessments can hinder recruitment to trials. Our proposal for more recruiter involvement in protocol development has strong support and some potential benefits, but questions remain about how best to implement this. We invite other trialists to consider our other suggestions for how to assure quality in trial eligibility criteria.

This paper aims to explore these risks, their immediate impacts and the likely future impacts. The authors specifically focus on the institutional financial and social risks arising from the global pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect data using the 2019 annual reports of the 37 Australian public universities and relevant media contributions. The findings of identified sector change are interpreted through Laughlins organisational change diagnosis. Findings: The sector confronts significant financial and social risks because of its over-reliance on income from fee-paying onshore overseas students resulting in universities primarily undertaking morphostatic changes. These risks include job losses, changing employment conditions, mental health issues for students, scholars, other staff, including casual staff, online learning shortfalls and the student expectations of their university experience. The study reveals how many of these risks are the inevitable consequence of the accountingisation of Australian public universities. Practical implications: Despite material exposure, the universities provide only limited disclosure of the extent of the risks associated with increasing dependence on overseas student fees to 31 December 2019. The analysis highlights fake accountability and distorted transparency to users of audited financial statements C a major limitation of university annual reports. Originality/value: Research on the Australian higher education sector has mainly focussed on the impact of policies and changes. The public disclosure of critical risks taken by these universities are now addressed. ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Taming the black elephant: assessing and managing the impacts of COVID-19 on public universities in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent evidence suggests an association between endometrial cancer and the understudied bacterial species Porphyromonas somerae. This association was demonstrated in previous work that indicated a significantly enriched abundance of P. somerae in the uterine microbiome of endometrial cancer patients. Given the known associations of the Porphyromonas genus and oral cancer, we hypothesized that P. somerae may play a similar pathogenic role in endometrial cancer via intracellular activity. Before testing our hypothesis, we first characterized P. somerae biology, as current background data is limited. These novel characterizations include growth curves in liquid medium and susceptibility tests to antibiotics. We tested our hypothesis by examining growth changes in response to 17-estradiol, a known risk factor for endometrial cancer, followed by metabolomic profiling in the presence and absence of 17-estradiol. We found that P. somerae exhibits increased growth in the presence of 17-estradiol of various concentrations. However, we did not find significant changes in metabolite levels in response to 17-estradiol. To study direct host-microbe interactions, we used in vitro invasion assays under hypoxic conditions and found evidence for intracellular invasion of P. somerae in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. We also examined these interactions in the presence of 17-estradiol but did not observe changes in invasion frequency. Invasion was shown using three lines of evidence including visualization via differential staining and brightfield microscopy, increased frequency of bacterial recovery after co-culturing, and in silico methods to detail relevant genomic and transcriptomic components. These results underscore potential intracellular phenotypes of P. somerae within the uterine microbiome. Furthermore, these results raise new questions pertaining to the role of P. somerae in the progression of endometrial cancer.","output":"Porphyromonas somerae Invasion of Endometrial Cancer Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychology of science resistance, doubt, and denial has never had clearer consequences than during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A questionnaire was developed by a review of relevant literature and sports-related questionnaires, and input from five experienced sports dietitians. Item construct and format was adapted and modified from a previous questionnaire. The modified questionnaire sought information on demographics, nutrition knowledge, beliefs, intended practices, information sources and exercise-associated gastrointestinal symptoms. A five-phase validity process was conducted to determine content, face and construct validity, item difficulty and internal reliability of the questionnaire. The Delphi technique was applied with experts over three anonymous rounds. Items were reviewed to determine whether to keep, modify, or delete, rate the relevance of each item using a content validity index (CVI), and provide comments. A content analysis was conducted on all comments after each round. Online interviews were conducted with a pilot group of endurance athletes (n = 15) to assess item difficulty and feasibility. Nutrition knowledge was compared between pilot group of athletes and experts to determine construct validity and internal consistency. A test-retest process was applied to a second pilot group (n = 8) to verify questionnaire reliability. RESULTS: High CVI (&#8805;.83) and agreement scores were obtained through the Delphi technique.

They show great variability in terms of antibiotic class, indication, pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties, type of available formulations, spectrum of activity against bacteria other than MRSA, and toxicity profile. AREAS COVERED In this narrative review, the authors discuss the characteristics of currently available agents for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia. EXPERT OPINION The availability of different agents with anti-MRSA activity, and approved for the treatment of pneumonia can allow a personalized approach for any given patient based on the severity of the disease, the setting of occurrence, the patient's baseline risk of toxicity and drug interactions, and the possibility of oral therapy whenever early discharge or outpatient treatment are possible. Although some gray areas still remain, like the lack of high certainty evidence on the efficacy of some old agents and on the precise role of companion agents with toxin inhibitory activity in the case of necrotizing pneumonia, the frequent availability of different treatment choices, each with peculiar characteristics, is already allowing an important step toward a precision medicine approach for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia.","output":"Current pharmacotherapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology (EACTA) and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesia (SCA) aimed to create joint recommendations for the perioperative management of patients with suspected or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing cardiac surgery or invasive cardiac procedures.

Systematic research on sensitivity of rates to the choice of the study parameters is lacking. Materials and Methods: We used 12 data sources to systematically examine the influence of age, race, sex, database, time-at-risk, season and year, prior observation and clean window on incidence rates using 15 adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccines as an example. For binary comparisons we calculated incidence rate ratios and performed random-effect meta-analysis. Results: We observed a wide variation of background rates that goes well beyond age and database effects previously observed. While rates vary up to a factor of 1,000 across age groups, even after adjusting for age and sex, the study showed residual bias due to the other parameters. Rates were highly influenced by the choice of anchoring (e.g., health visit, vaccination, or arbitrary date) for the time-at-risk start. Anchoring on a healthcare encounter yielded higher incidence comparing to a random date, especially for short time-at-risk. Incidence rates were highly influenced by the choice of the database (varying by up to a factor of 100), clean window choice and time-at-risk duration, and less so by secular or seasonal trends. Conclusion: Comparing background to observed rates requires appropriate adjustment and careful time-at-risk start and duration choice.

The association between cranial ultrasound scan measured brain injury and rcSO2 was assessed. RESULTS 120 infants were included. Sixty-nine percent (83) of infants had a normal outcome (no IVH, no PVL, and survival at 1 month); less than one-quarter, 22% (26), had low grade IVH 1 or 2 (moderate outcome); and 9% (11) of infants had a severe outcome (IVH  3, PVL or died before 1 month age). rcSO2 values were lower for infants GA < 28weeks when compared with those GA 28-32, p < 0.001. There was no difference in absolute rcSO2 values between the three outcome groups but a greater degree of cerebral hypoxia was associated with preterm infants who had low grade 1 or 2 IVH.

A direct home-delivery service of the RM communicator has been implemented at 49 Italian arrhythmia centers. METHODS: According to individual patient preference or the organizational decision of the center, patients were assigned to the home-delivery group or the standard in-clinic delivery group. In the former case, patients received telephone training on the activation process and use of the communicator. In June 2020, the centers were asked to reply to an ad hoc questionnaire to describe and evaluate their experience in the previous 3 months. RESULTS: RM was activated in 1324 patients: 821 (62%) received the communicator at home and the communicator was activated remotely. Activation required one additional call in 49% of cases, and the median time needed to complete the activation process was 15 min [25th-75th percentile: 10-20]. 753 (92%) patients were able to complete the correct activation of the system. At the time when the questionnaire was completed, 743 (90%) communicators were regularly transmitting data. The service was generally deemed useful (96% of respondents) in facilitating the activation of RM during the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly beyond.

Opioid overdose, the most severe outcome of opioid use disorder, remains the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. We interrogated the effects of opioid overdose on the brain using ChIP-seq to quantify patterns of H3K27 acetylation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons isolated from 51 opioid-overdose cases and 51 accidental death controls. Among opioid cases, we observed global hypoacetylation and identified 388 putative enhancers consistently depleted for H3K27ac. Machine learning on H3K27ac patterns predicted case-control status with high accuracy. We focused on case-specific regulatory alterations, revealing 81,399 hypoacetylation events, uncovering vast inter-patient heterogeneity.

The country is currently plagued by a huge burden of virusrelated cases and deaths. So far, the disease has highlighted a number of problems, some in common with other Countries and others peculiar to Italy which has suffered from a mortality rate higher than that observed in China and in most Countries in the world. The causes must be sought not only in the average age of the population (one of the oldest in the world), but also in the inconsistencies of the regional health systems (into which the National Health System is divided) and their delayed response, at least in some areas. Ethical issues emerged from the beginning, ranging from restrictions on freedom of movements and restrictions on personal privacy due to the lockdown, further to the dilemma for healthcare professionals to select people for ICU hospitalization in a shortage of beds in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Organizational problems also emerged, although an official 2007 document from the Ministry of Health had planned not only what measures had to be taken during an epidemic caused by respiratory viruses, but also what had to be done in the inter-epidemic period (including the establishment of DPIs stocks and ventilators), vast areas of Italy were totally unprepared to cope with the disease, as a line of that document was not implemented. Since organizational problems can worsen (and even cause) ethical dilemmas, every effort should be made in the near future to prepare the health system to respond to a similar emergency in a joint, coherent, and homogeneous way across the Country, as planned in the 2007 document. In this perspective, Pulmonary Units and specialists can play a fundamental role in coping with the disease not only in hospitals, as intermediate care units, but also at a territorial level in an integrated network with GPs.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy: ethical and organizational considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus has caused the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, leading to disproportionate fatalities in the low-risk population despite the generally mild nature of the illness.

METHODS: A single center retrospective observational study was performed between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 11, 2020 at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Zhejiang, China. All patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease 2019 were enrolled, and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records. Outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the average age was 47.5 years old (standard deviation, 14.6) and 54.5% were men. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (15.2%), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%). Common symptoms included dry cough (81.4%), fever (75.2%), anorexia (42.8%), fatigue (40.7%), chest tightness (32.4%), diarrhea (26.9%) and dizziness (20%). According to imaging examination, 79.3% patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 18.6% showed unilateral pneumonia, 61.4% showed ground-glass opacity, and 2.1% showed no abnormal result. Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean, 24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%, p < 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03).

No data have been published on individual abortion experiences or preferences of this understudied population. OBJECTIVE(S): To fill existing evidence gaps on the abortion experiences and preferences of TGE people in the United States to inform policies and practices to improve access to and quality of abortion care for this population. STUDY DESIGN: In 2019, we recruited TGE people assigned female or intersex at birth and aged 18 years and older from across the United States to participate in an online survey about sexual and reproductive health recruited through The PRIDE Study and online postings. We descriptively analyzed closed- and open-ended survey responses related to pregnancy history, abortion experiences, preferences for abortion method, recommendations to improve abortion care for TGE people, and respondent sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: The majority of the 1,694 respondents were less than 30 years of age. Respondents represented multiple gender identities and sexual orientations and resided across all four United States Census Regions. Overall, 210 (12%) respondents had ever been pregnant; these 210 reported 421 total pregnancies, of which 92 (22%) ended in abortion. For respondents most recent abortion, 41 (61%) were surgical, 23 (34%) were medication, and 3 (4.5%) used another method (primarily herbal). Most recent abortions took place at or before nine weeks gestation (n=41, 61%). If they were to need an abortion today, respondents preferred medication abortion to surgical abortion three to one (n=703 versus n=217), but 514 (30%) respondents did not know which method they would prefer. Reasons for medication abortion preference among the 703 respondents included a belief that it is the least invasive method (n=553, 79%) and the most private method (n=388, 55%). To improve accessibility and quality of abortion care for TGE patients, respondents most frequently recommended that abortion clinics adopt gender-neutral or gender-affirming intake forms, that providers utilize gender-neutral language, and that greater privacy be incorporated into the clinic.

By mid-March 2021, the COVID-19 almost hit all countries worldwide, with about 122 and 2.7 million confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. As a strong measure to stop the infection spread and deaths, many countries have enforced quarantine and lockdown of many activities. The shutdown of these activities has resulted in large economic losses. However, it has been widely reported that these measures have resulted in improved air quality, more specifically in highly polluted areas characterized by massive population and industrial activities. The reduced levels of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and particulate matter emissions have been reported and confirmed worldwide in association with lockdown periods. On the other hand, ozone levels in ambient air have been found to increase, mainly in response to the reduced nitrogen emissions.

Our 2020 edition of this review showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive and moderately specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this update, we include new relevant studies, and have removed studies with case-control designs, and those not intended to be diagnostic test accuracy studies. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 30 September 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of all designs, except for case-control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19 and that reported estimates of test accuracy or provided data from which we could compute estimates. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The review authors independently and in duplicate screened articles, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list. We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and we summarised pooled estimates in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented the uncertainty of accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 51 studies with 19,775 participants suspected of having COVID-19, of whom 10,155 (51%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Forty-seven studies evaluated one imaging modality each, and four studies evaluated two imaging modalities each. All studies used RT-PCR as the reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, with 47 studies using only RT-PCR and four studies using a combination of RT-PCR and other criteria (such as clinical signs, imaging tests, positive contacts, and follow-up phone calls) as the reference standard. Studies were conducted in Europe (33), Asia (13), North America (3) and South America (2); including only adults (26), all ages (21), children only (1), adults over 70 years (1), and unclear (2); in inpatients (2), outpatients (32), and setting unclear (17). Risk of bias was high or unclear in thirty-two (63%) studies with respect to participant selection, 40 (78%) studies with respect to reference standard, 30 (59%) studies with respect to index test, and 24 (47%) studies with respect to participant flow. For chest CT (41 studies, 16,133 participants, 8110 (50%) cases), the sensitivity ranged from 56.3% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 25.4% to 97.4%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT was 87.9% (95% CI 84.6 to 90.6) and the pooled specificity was 80.0% (95% CI 74.9 to 84.3). There was no statistical evidence indicating that reference standard conduct and definition for index test positivity were sources of heterogeneity for CT studies. Nine chest CT studies (2807 participants, 1139 (41%) cases) used the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) scoring system, which has five thresholds to define index test positivity. At a CO-RADS threshold of 5 (7 studies), the sensitivity ranged from 41.5% to 77.9% and the pooled sensitivity was 67.0% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.2); the specificity ranged from 83.5% to 96.2%; and the pooled specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 87.6 to 94.0). At a CO-RADS threshold of 4 (7 studies), the sensitivity ranged from 56.3% to 92.9% and the pooled sensitivity was 83.5% (95% CI 74.4 to 89.7); the specificity ranged from 77.2% to 90.4% and the pooled specificity was 83.6% (95% CI 80.5 to 86.4). For chest X-ray (9 studies, 3694 participants, 2111 (57%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 51.9% to 94.4% and specificity ranged from 40.4% to 88.9%. The pooled sensitivity of chest X-ray was 80.6% (95% CI 69.1 to 88.6) and the pooled specificity was 71.5% (95% CI 59.8 to 80.8). For ultrasound of the lungs (5 studies, 446 participants, 211 (47%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 68.2% to 96.8% and specificity ranged from 21.3% to 78.9%. The pooled sensitivity of ultrasound was 86.4% (95% CI 72.7 to 93.9) and the pooled specificity was 54.6% (95% CI 35.3 to 72.6). Based on an indirect comparison using all included studies, chest CT had a higher specificity than ultrasound. For indirect comparisons of chest CT and chest X-ray, or chest X-ray and ultrasound, the data did not show differences in specificity or sensitivity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest X-ray is moderately sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Ultrasound is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, chest CT and ultrasound may have more utility for excluding COVID-19 than for differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should pre-define positive imaging findings, include direct comparisons of the various modalities of interest in the same participant population, and implement improved reporting practices.","output":"Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness and social isolation are common sources of chronic stress in modern society. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that loneliness and social isolation increase mortality risk as much as smoking or alcohol consumption and more than physical inactivity or obesity. Loneliness in human is associated with higher blood pressure whereas enhanced atherosclerosis is observed in animal models of social isolation. Loneliness and social isolation lead to activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, enhanced sympathetic nerve activity, impaired parasympathetic function and a proinflammatory immune response. These mechanisms have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease conferred by social isolation although a causal relationship has not been established so far. There is evidence that oxidative stress is likely to be a key molecular mechanism linking chronic psychosocial stress to cardiovascular disease. NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress in the hypothalamus has been shown to be required for social isolation-induced HPA axis activation in socially isolated rats. Oxidative stress in the rostral ventrolateral medulla is also a key regulator of sympathetic nerve activity. In the vasculature, oxidative stress increases vascular tone and promote atherogenesis through multiple mechanisms. Thus, preventing oxidative stress may represent a therapeutic strategy to reduce the detrimental effects of social stress on health.","output":"The role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease caused by social isolation and loneliness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the extent and to identify the determinants of food insecurity and coping strategies in urban and rural households of Bangladesh during the month-long, COVID-19 lockdown period. SETTING: Selected urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: 106 urban and 106 rural households. OUTCOME VARIABLES AND METHOD: Household food insecurity status and the types of coping strategies were the outcome variables for the analyses. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were done to identify the determinants. RESULTS: We found that around 90% of the households were suffering from different grades of food insecurity. Severe food insecurity was higher in urban (42%) than rural (15%) households. The rural households with mild/moderate food insecurity adopted either financial (27%) or both financial and food compromised (32%) coping strategies, but 61% of urban mild/moderate food insecure households applied both forms of coping strategies. Similarly, nearly 90% of severely food insecure households implemented both types of coping strategies. Living in poorest households was significantly associated (p value <0.05) with mild/moderate (regression coefficient, ?: 15.13, 95% CI 14.43 to 15.82), and severe food insecurity (?: 16.28, 95% CI 15.58 to 16.97). The statistically significant (p <0.05) determinants of both food compromised and financial coping strategies were living in urban areas (?: 1.8, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.09), living in poorest (?: 2.7, 95% CI 1 to 4.45), poorer (?: 2.6, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.4) and even in the richer (?: 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.9) households and age of the respondent (?: 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21).

However, the accuracy of PSA below 4 ng/mL as a cutoff for diagnosing prostate cancer in a hospital setting is inconclusive. We systematically reviewed the accuracy of PSA below 4 ng/mL cutoff in a hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS We systematically reviewed the literature by searching major databases until March 2020, and a meta-analysis and quality assessment were performed. RESULTS A total of 11 studies were included at the completion of the screening process. The meta-analysis showed a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.16 for a PSA cutoff below 4 ng/mL. The area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87, the positive likelihood ratio was 1.23, the negative likelihood ratio was 0.46, and the diagnostic odds ratio was 2.64. PSA sensitivities and specificities varied according to the cutoff range: 0.94 and 0.17 for 2 to 2.99 ng/mL, and 0.92 and 0.16 for 3 to 3.99 ng/mL, respectively. No significant differences in the sensitivity and specificity of PSA cutoffs in the range of 2 to 2.99 ng/mL and 3 to 3.99 ng/mL were found. CONCLUSIONS Although a PSA cutoff <3 ng/mL is relatively more sensitive and specific than PSA 3 ng/mL, no significant differences in sensitivity and specificity were found in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Therefore, clinicians should choose an appropriate PSA cutoff on the basis of clinical circumstances and patients' characteristics.","output":"Diagnostic accuracy of prostate-specific antigen below 4 ng/mL as a cutoff for diagnosing prostate cancer in a hospital setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Philosophy does not offer tools for solving practical problems, but looks for a sense of concrete situations through a rational reflection In the present case this sense focuses on: 1 human fragility (the virus can kill any human being);2 human impotence (our situation is essentially identical with that of ancient epidemics: our defence reduces us to isolation);3 limited efficiency of techno-science (the decisive therapy for this illness has not been found yet, despite the efforts of hundreds of laboratories and pharmaceutical companies);4 rediscovery of common good and human solidarity (the protection of the individuals is needed for the protection of society and vice versa);5 the incumbent presence of death (in the light of which the hierarchy of values orienting human existence can be reshaped) The results of these reflections can point out responsibilities of the political power, and lead to hostility against philosophers and the effort of silencing their voice, reminding us of the example of Socrates Resumen La filosofa no nos ofrece herramientas para la resolucin de problemas prcticos, pero busca dar un sentido a las situaciones concretas a travs de una reflexin racional En el caso que nos ocupa este sentido se centra en: 1 la fragilidad humana (el virus puede matar a cualquier ser humano);2 impotencia humana (nuestra situacin es esencialmente idntica a la de las antiguas epidemias: nuestra defensa se reduce al aislamiento);3 eficiencia limitada de la tecnociencia (an no se ha encontrado la terapia decisiva para esta enfermedad, a pesar de los esfuerzos de cientos de laboratorios y empresas farmacuticas);4 redescubrimiento del bien comn y la solidaridad humana (la proteccin de los individuos es necesaria para la proteccin de la sociedad y viceversa);5 La presencia predominante de la muerte (en cuya luz se puede remodelar la jerarqua de valores que orientan la existencia humana) Los resultados de estas reflexiones pueden evidenciar responsabilidades del poder poltico y producir hostilidad contra los filsofos y el esfuerzo de silenciar su voz, recordndonos entre otros el ejemplo de Scrates","output":"The role of philosophy in the pandemic era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This narrative review covers the life-threatening thromboembolic events associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19.

The study confirmed the negative relationship between COVID-19 cases and temperature. It contributed to the resolution of the conflicting results about latitude after organizing it into a categorical variable instead of its continuous form. This approach works because the average temperature in the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region remains similar to the average temperatures in both the Above 15 degrees N region and the Below 15 degrees S region during their summer months because the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region does not experience the marked seasonal changes in temperature. Given the negative association between temperature and case numbers, this suggests that countries in the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region might continue exhibiting the low numbers they have thus far exhibited through the second half of this year, even as numbers climb in the Below 15 degrees S region. To succeed, their policymakers must control importation of the disease by implementing effective testing, quarantining, and contact tracing for people entering their borders. Policymakers in countries Below 15 degrees S region may manage their inherent risks by applying lessons learned from countries in the Above 15 degrees N region during these past months.

The leftover sampling methodology was used and a geographically stratified sampling plan was applied. Results: Of 55,947 serum samples collected, 705 (1.26%) were found positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with higher seroprevalence (9.09%) observed in December 2020. Highest seropositivity levels were observed in the 0C29 and 30C49 year age groups. Seroprevalence increased with age in the 0C29 age group. Highly populated metropolitan areas were characterized with elevated seroprevalence levels (11.92% in Attica, 12.76% in Thessaloniki) compared to the rest of the country (5.90%).

This Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report is a systematic review that synthesizes the evidence on the efficacy and safety of using these booths and provides recommendations to the Ministry of Health to facilitate decision-making regarding the relevance of using this technology. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed using Pubmed, Web of Science, INAHTA and GIN databases, from inception to June 4, 2020. Three independent reviewers selected eligible studies then extracted and synthesized the evidence. The synthesis was submitted to a multidisciplinary group of experts to provide recommendations. RESULTS Two scientific papers and a Malaysian HTA report were included in data synthesis. In light of the resources consulted, spraying disinfectants on humans in booths is not effective and can be toxic. Disinfectants are intended for use on surfaces, not on living tissue and spraying disinfectants on the outside of the body does not kill the virus inside an infected person's body. Furthermore, this procedure may increase the risk of neglecting other effective measures. CONCLUSION It is recommended to prohibit the use of disinfection booths in all structures.","output":"Disinfection booths in the context of COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remains an enormous and increasing health burden worldwide. To date, Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) is the only licensed anti-TB vaccine worldwide, which provides an important but limited protection from the Mtb infection. The development of alternative anti-TB vaccines is therefore urgently needed. Here we report, the generation of Ad5-CEAB, a recombinant adenovirus expressing Mtb antigens of CFP10, ESAT6, Ag85A and Ag85B proteins in a form of mixture. In order to evaluate the immunogenicity of Ad5-CEAB, mice were immunized with Ad5-CEAB by intranasal instillation three times with 2-week intervals. The results demonstrated that Ad5-CEAB elicited a strong antigen-specific immune response, particularly of the Th1 immune responses that were characterized by an increased ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 and secretions of Th1 type cytokines, IFN-, TNF-, IL-2 and IL-12. In addition, the Ad5-CEAB also showed an ability to enhance humoral responses with a dramatically augmented antigen-specific serum IgG. Furthermore, an elevated sIgA were also found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the immunized mice, suggesting the elicitation of mucosal immune responses. These data indicate that Ad5-CEAB can induce a broad range of antigen-specific immune responses in vivo, which provides a promising and novel route for developing anti-TB vaccines and warrants further investigation.","output":"A recombinant adenovirus expressing CFP10, ESAT6, Ag85A and Ag85B of Mycobacterium tuberculosis elicits strong antigen-specific immune responses in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore patients and physicians perspectives on a decision-making conversation for life-sustaining treatment, based on the Danish model of the American Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form. DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews following a conversation about preferences for life-sustaining treatment. SETTING: Danish hospitals, nursing homes, and general practitioners clinics. SUBJECTS: Patients and physicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative analyses of interview data. FINDINGS: After participating in a conversation about life-sustaining treatment using the Danish POLST form, a total of six patients and five physicians representing different settings and age groups participated in an interview about their experience of the process. Within the main research questions, six subthemes were identified: Timing, relatives are key persons, clarifying treatment preferences, documentation across settings, strengthening patient autonomy, and structure influences conversations. Most patients and physicians found having a conversation about levels of life-sustaining treatment valuable but also complicated due to the different levels of knowledge and attending to individual patient needs and medical necessities. Relatives were considered as key persons to ensure the understanding of the treatment trajectory and the ability to advocate for the patient in case of a medical crisis. The majority of participants found that the conversation strengthened patient autonomy. CONCLUSION: Patients and physicians found having a conversation about levels of life-sustaining treatment valuable, especially for strengthening patient autonomy. Relatives were considered key persons. The timing of the conversation and securing sufficient knowledge for shared decision-making were the main perceived challenges. KEY POINTS: Conversations about preferences for life-sustaining treatment are important, but not performed systematically. When planning a conversation about preferences for life-sustaining treatment, the timing of the conversation and the inclusion of relatives are key elements. Decision-making conversations can help patients feel in charge and less alone, and make it easier for health professionals to provide goal-concordant care. Using a model like the Danish POLST form may help to initiate, conduct and structure conversations about preferences for life-sustaining treatment.","output":"Decision-making conversations for life-sustaining treatment with seriously ill patients using a Danish version of the US POLST: a qualitative study of patient and physician experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until 2021, the ZNF699 gene was not associated with any human genetic disease.

The latest research suggests a relationship between resilience and physical fitness. Beneficial adaptations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic nervous system, endocannabinoid system, and tryptophan pathway, which are induced by an active lifestyle, are considered to be conducive to resilience. However, detailed knowledge on the molecular link between the effects of acute and chronic physical exercise and improved resilience to stress in humans is missing. Moreover, the relationship between innate and acquired aerobic capacity and resilience is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to implement a human exercise intervention trial addressing the following main hypotheses: a high innate aerobic capacity is associated with high resilience to stress, and web-based physical exercise training improves aerobic capacity of physically inactive adults, which is accompanied by improved resilience. In this setting, we will analyze the relationship between resilience parameters and innate and acquired aerobic capacity as well as circulating signaling molecules. METHODS: A total of 70 healthy, physically inactive (<150 minutes/week of physical activity) adults (aged 18-45 years) will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive weekly training using progressive endurance and interval running adapted individually to their remotely supervised home training performance via web-based coach support. A standardized incremental treadmill exercise test will be performed before and after the intervention period of 8 weeks to determine the innate and acquired aerobic capacity (peak oxygen uptake). Before and after the intervention, psychological tests and questionnaires that characterize parameters implicated in resilience will be applied. Blood and saliva will be sampled for the analysis of cortisol, lactate, endocannabinoids, catecholamines, kynurenic acid, and further circulating signal transducers. Statistical analysis will provide comprehensive knowledge on the relationship between aerobic capacity and resilience, as well as the capacity of peripheral factors to mediate the promoting effects of exercise on resilience. RESULTS: The study was registered in October 2019, and enrollment began in September 2019. Of the 161 participants who were initially screened via a telephone survey, 43 (26.7%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Among the 55% (17/31) of participants in the intervention group and 45% (14/31) of participants in the control group who completed the study, no serious adverse incidents were reported. Of 43 participants, 4 (9%) withdrew during the program (for individual reasons) and 8 (19%) have not yet participated in the program; moreover, further study recruitment was paused for an indeterminate amount of time because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, ML methods are applied to study the efficacy of therapies on COVID-19 hospital admissions in the Valencian Region in Spain. Methods: 5244 and 1312 COVID-19 hospital admissions - dated between January 2020 and January 2021 from 10 health departments, were used respectively for training and validation of separate treatment-effect models (TE-ML) for remdesivir, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. 2390 admissions from 2 additional health departments were reserved as an independent test to analyze retrospectively the survival benefits of therapies in the population selected by the TE-ML models using cox-proportional hazard models. TE-ML models were adjusted using treatment propensity scores to control for pre-treatment confounding variables associated to outcome and further evaluated for futility. ML architecture was based on boosted decision-trees. Results: In the populations identified by the TE-ML models, only Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were significantly associated with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.41 (P = 0.04) and 0.21 (P = 0.001), respectively. No survival benefits from chloroquine derivatives, lopinavir-ritonavir and azithromycin were demonstrated. Tools to explain the predictions of TE-ML models are explored at patient-level as potential tools for personalized decision making and precision medicine.

SARS-CoV-2 viruses hijack human proteins to promote their spread and virulence including the interactions involving the viral envelope (E) protein and human proteins. To understand the structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 viral-host recognition, we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine a structure for the human cell junction protein PALS1 and SARS-CoV-2 E protein complex. The structure shows that the E protein C-terminal DLLV motif recognizes a pocket formed exclusively by hydrophobic residues from the PDZ and SH3 domains in PALS1. Our structural analysis provides an explanation for the observation that the viral E protein recruits PALS1 from lung epithelial cell junctions resulting in vascular leakage, lung damage, viral spread, and virulence. In addition, our structure provides novel targets for peptide- and small-molecule inhibitors that could block the PALS1-E interactions to reduce the E-mediated damage to vascular structures.","output":"Structural Basis for SARS-CoV-2 Envelope Protein in Recognition of Human Cell Junction Protein PALS1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To compare the safety and efficacy of LVIS stent-assisted coiling with those of laser-cut stent-assisted coiling for the treatment of acutely ruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. METHODS Patients with acutely ruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms treated with LVIS stent-assisted coiling (LVIS stent group) and laser-cut stent-assisted coiling (laser-cut stent group) were retrospectively reviewed from January 2014 to December 2017. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for potential differences in age, sex, aneurysm location, aneurysm size, neck width, Hunt-Hess grade, and modified Fisher grade. Perioperative procedure-related complications and clinical and angiographic follow-up outcomes were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the associations between procedure-related complications and potential risk factors. RESULTS A total of 142 patients who underwent LVIS stent-assisted coiling and 93 patients who underwent laser-cut stent-assisted coiling were enrolled after 1:2 propensity score matching. The angiographic follow-up outcomes showed that the LVIS stent group had a slightly higher complete occlusion rate and lower recurrence rate than the laser-cut stent group (92.7% vs 80.6%; 3.7% vs 9.7%, P = 0.078). The clinical outcomes at discharge and follow-up between the two groups demonstrated no significant differences (P = 0.495 and P = 0.875, respectively). The rates of intraprocedural thrombosis, postprocedural thrombosis, postoperative early rebleeding, and procedure-related death were 0.7% (1/142), 1.4% (2/142), 2.8% (4/142), and 2.1% (3/142) in the LVIS stent group, respectively, and 4.3% (4/93), 2.2% (2/93), 1.1% (1/93), and 3.2% (3/93) in the laser-cut stent group, respectively (P = 0.082, 0.649, 0.651, and 0.683). Nevertheless, the rates of overall procedure-related complications and intraprocedural rupture in the LVIS stent group were significantly lower than those in the laser-cut stent group (5.6% vs 14.0%, P = 0.028; 0.7% vs 6.5%, P = 0.016). Multivariate analysis showed that laser-cut stent-assisted coiling was an independent predictor for overall procedure-related complications (OR = 2.727, P = 0.037); a history of diabetes (OR = 7.275, P = 0.027) and other cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 8.083, P = 0.022) were independent predictors for ischemic complications, whereas none of the factors were predictors for hemorrhagic complications.

In fighting against COVID-19, effective diagnosis of infected patient is critical for preventing the spread of diseases. Due to limited availability of test kits, the need for auxiliary diagnostic approach has increased. Recent research has shown radiography of COVID-19 patient, such as CT and X-ray, contains salient information about the COVID-19 virus and could be used as an alternative diagnosis method. Chest X-ray (CXR) due to its faster imaging time, wide availability, low cost, and portability gains much attention and becomes very promising. In order to reduce intra- and inter-observer variability, during radiological assessment, computer-aided diagnostic tools have been used in order to supplement medical decision making and subsequent management. Computational methods with high accuracy and robustness are required for rapid triaging of patients and aiding radiologist in the interpretation of the collected data. METHOD: In this study, we design a novel multi-feature convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for multi-class improved classification of COVID-19 from CXR images. CXR images are enhanced using a local phase-based image enhancement method. The enhanced images, together with the original CXR data, are used as an input to our proposed CNN architecture. Using ablation studies, we show the effectiveness of the enhanced images in improving the diagnostic accuracy. We provide quantitative evaluation on two datasets and qualitative results for visual inspection. Quantitative evaluation is performed on data consisting of 8851 normal (healthy), 6045 pneumonia, and 3323 COVID-19 CXR scans.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from 1 July to 8 September 2020. The main outcome was willingness of participants, and any children or older individuals living with them, to receive future COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore potential factors associated with vaccination willingness. RESULTS: A total of 1071 participants were asked about their willingness to receive future COVID-19 vaccines, for themselves and at least 747 children and 375 older individuals (&#8805;60 years old) living with them. The highest proportion of expected willingness to vaccinate was among participants (88.6%), followed by children (85.3%) and older individuals (84.0%).

RESULTS Of 1815 saccular aneurysms in 1505 patients, 323 (17.8%) were treated with stents (299 procedures) and 1492 (82.2%) without stents (1400 procedures). Procedure-related complications occurred in 9.4% with stents versus 5.6% without stents (P = .016, relative risk 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7). Ischemic complications were more frequent in the stent group than in the no-stent group (7.0% versus 3.5%; P = .005; relative risk, 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.5), as were hemorrhagic complications (2.3% versus 1.9%, P = .64).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the quality of the diagnosis and treatment guidelines on COVID-19 and analyze the consistency of the recommendations of these guidelines. METHODS: We searched for guidelines on diagnosis and/or treatment of COVID-19 through PubMed, CBM, CNKI, and WanFang Data, from January 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. In addition, we also searched official websites of the US CDC, European CDC and WHO, and some guideline collection databases. We included diagnosis and/or treatment guidelines for COVID-19, including rapid advice guidelines and interim guidelines. Two trained researchers independently extracted data and four trained researchers evaluated the quality of the guidelines using the AGREE II instruments. We extracted information on the basic characteristics of the guidelines, guideline development process, and the recommendations. We described the consistency of the direction of recommendations for treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 across the included guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 37 guidelines were included. Most included guidelines were assessed as low quality, with only one of the six domains of AGREE II (clarity of presentation) having a mean score above 50%. The mean scores of three domains (stakeholder involvement, the rigor of development and applicability) were all below 30%. The recommendations on diagnosis and treatment were to some extent consistent between the included guidelines. Computed tomography (CT), X-rays, lung ultrasound, RT-PCR, and routine blood tests were the most commonly recommended methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. Thirty guidelines were on the treatment of COVID-19. The recommended forms of treatment included supportive care, antiviral therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, antibiotics, immunoglobulin, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), convalescent plasma, and psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of currently available diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 is low.

In 2020, as part of Denmark's extensive, free-of-charge PCR-testing strategy, approximately 4 million individuals (69% of the population) underwent 106 million tests. Using these national PCR-test data from 2020, we estimated protection towards repeat infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020). For the main analysis, we excluded people who tested positive for the first time between the two surges and those who died before the second surge. We did an alternative cohort analysis, in which we compared infection rates throughout the year between those with and without a previous confirmed infection at least 3 months earlier, irrespective of date. We also investigated whether differences were found by age group, sex, and time since infection in the alternative cohort analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for potential confounders and estimated protection against repeat infection as 1 - RR. FINDINGS: During the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (220%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (211%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (065% [95% CI 051-082]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (327% [322-332]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0195 [95% CI 0155-0246]). Protection against repeat infection was 805% (95% CI 754-845). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0212 [0179-0251], estimated protection 788% [749-821]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 471% (95% CI 247-628). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 784% [721-832] vs female 791% [739-833]) or evidence of waning protection over time (3-6 months of follow-up 793% [744-833] vs &#8805;7 months of follow-up 777% [709-829]).

METHODS: Data on sociodemographic and occupational characteristics, change of job description, economic losses and emergency involvement and SARS-CoV2 infections in the workplace were collected using an anonymous online survey sent by healthcare professional associations. Data concerning psychological healthcare distress, were collected anonymously using BIAS 20 (stress balance) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). RESULTS: One thousand and one healthcare workers responded to the questionnaire. Biological risk at work was perceived by all HCWs, less so from psychologists and more so from those working in hospitals. Stress symptoms (DASS21 >14) were associated with a younger age group (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99) and less work experience (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96-0.99).

We aimed to apply the exercise standard proposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to home-based tele-Pilates exercise (HTPE), to determine its effect on the physical and mental health of pregnant women. We randomly divided the subjects into the following two groups who completed 8 weeks of HTPE (50 min/day, 2 days/week): (a) Pilates exercise (PE, n = 7) and (B) non-Pilates exercise (CON, n = 7). HTPE was performed by adjusting the program every 3 weeks, based on pain and physical fitness levels. We measured body composition, muscles of the hip joint, pelvic tilt, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), before and after HTPE. Following HTPE, while the percentage of body fat and body mass index had significantly decreased, the body fat mass did not change in the PE group (p < 0.05). The PE group showed an increase in strength of the left and right hip flexion and hip abduction, compared to the CON group (p < 0.01). The ODI and PSQI were significantly decreased in the PE group (p < 0.05).

These overlapped somewhat, as the liberal/left side of the political spectrum was more vocal about the dangers of COVID-19 and the pandemic, while the conservative/right frequently expressed less concern about COVID-related risks. Perhaps this confluence was borne out in sleep quality and dreams. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants rated their political affiliation on a scale of 0 (Very Conservative/Right) to 6 (Very Liberal/Left). Participants were also asked whether, since the pandemic, their sleep improved or worsened, whether their dream content has become more positive (more or less positive content, versus same) or negative (more or less negative content, versus same), the number of nightmares they recall, and whether their dreams included themes of politics and/or COVID. Regression analyses examined political affiliation as independent variable with ordinal logistic analyses for sleep improvement/worsening, multinomial logistic analyses for positive/negative content, linear regression analyses for nightmare frequency, and binary logistic analyses for presence of political/COVID themes in dreams. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Greater liberal/left affiliation was associated with a greater likelihood of worsened sleep (oOR=1.20, p=0.002), but no difference in likelihood of sleep improvement. Greater liberal/left affiliation was associated with a greater likelihood of decreased positive dream content (RRR=1.29, p=0.001) but no different in likelihood of increased positive content. In addition, greater liberal/left affiliation was associated with an increased likelihood of more negative dream content (RRR=1.33, p<0.0005) but no difference in the experience of less negative content. Liberal/left affiliation was also associated with more frequent nightmares during the pandemic (B=1.55, p=0.019), and more political dreams (OR=1.29, p=0.010) but no difference in COVID-related dreams. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, more liberal/left individuals reported a greater degree of worsening sleep and dream content that was less positive and more negative in nature.

For example, feeling like \\"hiding\\" and \\"creating a distance from oneself\\" in a text-based task were previously associated with recurrence risk in remitted depression. Despite their functional importance, action tendencies have not been systematically investigated in current depression, which was the aim of this pre-registered study.

The immersive VR-task, pre-programmed on devices sent to participants' homes, used hypothetical social interactions, in which either participants (self-agency) or their friend (other-agency) were described to have acted inappropriately. Good concurrent validity was demonstrated for VR- versus the text-based task. As predicted, compared with controls, people with depression showed a maladaptive profile: Particularly in the other-agency condition, rather than feeling like verbally attacking their friend, they were prone to feeling like hiding, and punishing themselves. The depression group showed a more pronounced slowing of response times in the other- versus the self-agency condition, which may reflect a stronger ambivalence about externalising blame in depression. Interestingly, feeling like punishing oneself was associated with a history of self-harm but not suicide attempts.

New Zealand has pursued an elimination strategy to COVID-19, reducing (but not eliminating) this disruption. Early in the pandemic, our national Cancer Control Agency (Te Aho o Te Kahu) began monitoring and reporting on service access to inform national and regional decision-making. In this manuscript we use high-quality, national-level data to describe changes in cancer registrations, diagnosis and treatment over the course of New Zealand's response to COVID-19. METHODS: Data were sourced (2018C2020) from national collections, including cancer registrations, inpatient hospitalisations and outpatient events. Cancer registrations, diagnostic testing (gastrointestinal endoscopy), surgery (colorectal, lung and prostate surgeries), medical oncology access (first specialist appointments [FSAs] and intravenous chemotherapy attendances) and radiation oncology access (FSAs and megavoltage attendances) were extracted. Descriptive analyses of count data were performed, stratified by ethnicity (Indigenous Mori, Pacific Island, non-Mori/non-Pacific). FINDINGS: Compared to 2018C2019, there was a 40% decline in cancer registrations during New Zealand's national shutdown in March-April 2020, increasing back to pre-shutdown levels over subsequent months. While there was a sharp decline in endoscopies, pre-shutdown volumes were achieved again by August. The impact on cancer surgery and medical oncology has been minimal, but there has been an 8% year-to-date decrease in radiation therapy attendances. With the exception of lung cancer, there is no evidence that existing inequities in service access between ethnic groups have been exacerbated by COVID-19.

This study aims to examine changes in the supply of consumer goods to Bali from outside Bali in the Indonesian territory and changes in the per capita consumption of the Balinese population due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two events were observed, namely the first event was the announcement of the first positive case of COVID-19 in Indonesia and the 2nd event was the determination of the status of a national disaster by the Indonesian government. Data analysis was performed using a different test with the SPSS v.23 program. The results of the analysis found that there was a difference in the supply of consumer goods to Bali from outside Bali and the per capita consumption of the Balinese population in the first and 2nd events. The supply of consumer goods and per capita consumption decreased significantly after the announcement of the first positive case of COVID-19 and then further decreased after the Indonesian government declared a national disaster status. The determination of the status of a national disaster has a greater impact on reducing the per capita consumption of the Balinese population than the announcement of the first COVID-19 patient. As a result of COVID-19 it is hoped that the Bali Provincial Government needs to make policy breakthroughs to encourage the fulfillment of consumer goods needs in Bali independently so that they do not always depend on supplies from outside Bali. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced peoples income and reduced buying power thus demanding people to be smarter in managing finances including adjusting consumption patterns according to the priority scale of needs.","output":"Supply of consumer goods, per capita consumption due to COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases caused by enveloped viruses, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year. Studies have found a relationship among temperature, humidity, and influenza virus incidence, transmission, or survival; however, there are contradictory claims about whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) is most important in mediating virus infectivity. Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets. Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high (>85%) and low (<60%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (60 to 85%). At an AH of less than 22 g  m(?3), the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g  m(?3), the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude. At a fixed RH of 75%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19C and 25C. We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity. The model explained 83% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus infectivity in droplets. This research provides novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses are responsible for a number of infectious diseases resulting in thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year in the United States. There has been a lively debate in the literature over whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) modulates virus infectivity. We designed a controlled study and used advanced statistical modeling techniques specifically to address this question. By providing an improved understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and virus infectivity, our work will ultimately lead to improved strategies for predicting and controlling disease transmission.","output":"Survival of the Enveloped Virus Phi6 in Droplets as a Function of Relative Humidity, Absolute Humidity, and Temperature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes of healthcare professionals towards CoronaVac and BioNTech vaccines applied in Turkey without the completion of phase 3 studies and to contribute to the policies that will be developed for the vaccine.

In medical schools, the COVID-19 pandemic required a complete switch to e-learning without any direct patient contact despite early reports showing that medical students preferred face-to-face teaching in clinical setting. We designed close to real-life patient e-learning modules to transmit competency-based learning contents to medical students and evaluated their responses about their experience. METHODS: Weekly e-learning cases covering a 10-week leading symptom-based curriculum were designed by a team of medical students and physicians. The internal medicine curriculum (HeiCuMed) at the Heidelberg University Medical School is a mandatory part of clinical medical education in the 6th or 7th semester. Case-design was based on routine patient encounters and covered different clinical settings: preclinical emergency medicine, in-patient and out-patient care and follow-up. Individual cases were evaluated online immediately after finishing the respective case. The whole module was assessed at the end of the semester. Free-text answers were analyzed with MaxQDa following Mayring\`s principles of qualitative content analyses. RESULTS: N = 198 students (57.6% female, 42.4% male) participated and 1252 individual case evaluations (between 49.5% and 82.5% per case) and 51 end-of-term evaluations (25.8% of students) were collected. Students highly appreciated the offer to apply their clinical knowledge in presented patient cases. Aspects of clinical context, interactivity, game-like interface and embedded learning opportunities of the cases motivated students to engage with the asynchronously presented learning materials and work through the cases.

HHcy has been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote inflammatory responses in endothelial cells (EC), and impair endothelial function, a hallmark for vascular injury. However, metabolic processes and molecular mechanisms mediating HHcy-induced endothelial injury remains to be elucidated. This study examined the effects of HHcy on the expression of microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA in human aortic EC treated with a pathophysiologically relevant concentration of homocysteine (Hcy 500 M). We performed a set of extensive bioinformatics analyses to identify HHcy-altered metabolic and molecular processes. The global functional implications and molecular network were determined by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) followed by Cytoscape analysis. We identified 244 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) mRNA, their relevant functional pathways, and 45 SDE miRNA. HHcy-altered SDE inversely correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs (45 induced/14 reduced mRNA) were discovered and applied to network construction using an experimentally verified database. We established a hypothetical model to describe the biochemical and molecular network with these specified miRNA/mRNA axes, finding: 1) HHcy causes metabolic reprogramming by increasing glucose uptake and oxidation, by glycogen debranching and NAD+/CoA synthesis, and by stimulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production via NNT/IDH2 suppression-induced NAD+/NADP-NADPH/NADP+ metabolism disruption; 2) HHcy activates inflammatory responses by activating inflammasome-pyroptosis mainly through &#8595;miR193ba??&#8593;CASP-9 signaling and by inducing IL-1? and adhesion molecules through the &#8595;miR29ca??&#8593;NEDD9 and the &#8595;miR1256a??&#8593;ICAM-1 axes, as well as GPCR and interferon &#945;/? signaling; 3) HHcy promotes cell degradation by the activation of lysosome autophagy and ubiquitin proteasome systems; 4) HHcy causes cell cycle arrest at G1/S and S/G2 transitions, suppresses spindle checkpoint complex and cytokinetic abscission, and suppresses proliferation through &#8595;miRNA335/&#8593;VASH1 and other axes. These findings are in accordance with our previous studies and add a wealth of heretofore-unexplored molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying HHcy-induced endothelial injury. This is the first study to consider the effects of HHcy on both global mRNA and miRNA expression changes for mechanism identification. Molecular axes and biochemical processes identified in this study are useful not only for the understanding of mechanisms underlying HHcy-induced endothelial injury, but also for discovering therapeutic targets for CVD in general.","output":"Molecular processes mediating hyperhomocysteinemia-induced metabolic reprogramming, redox regulation and growth inhibition in endothelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objectives of this study were to model various scenarios of African swine fever (ASF) virus transmission among farms in Vietnam and to evaluate the impact of control strategies using North American Animal Disease Spread Model (NAADSM). A total of 7,882 pig farms in the Red River Delta (RRD) region were obtained from the General Statistics Office, and then random points corresponding to the number of farms in each province were generated as exact farm locations were not available. A total of ten models were developed, including movement control scenarios. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of indirect contact Transmission probability (TP). Overall, the indirect contact exhibited an important role in transmitting the ASF virus. In order to minimize ASF transmission between farms, we found that movement restriction needed to reach a certain level (approximately between 50% and 75%) and that the restriction had to be applied in a timely manner. This study offers valuable insight into how ASF virus can be transmitted via direct and indirect contact and controlled among farms under the various simulation scenarios.

While this might suggest a reduced focus on the nature of the work performed and a greater focus on the conditions under which it is performed, in reality, anti-trafficking discourse remains in the grip of polarised positions on sex work even as the carceral effects of anti-trafficking law become evident and the Swedish model of criminalising the purchase of sexual services spreads.

The growing international sex workers movement has offered resistance, yet a closer look at the movement and the widespread support that it has garnered for decriminalisation from international organisations, while valuable, helps reveal the greatest cost yet of anti-trafficking discourse, namely, the inability of the sex workers movement to produce a sophisticated theory of regulation to reduce levels of exploitation within sex work, one which is commensurate with the informality and heterogeneity of sex markets the world over. Finally, to the extent that neoabolitionist projects derive legitimacy from interventions abroad, especially in the global South, I chronicle the edifice on which it rests in one such context, namely India, to demonstrate how countries in the global South are not merely conduits for the global Norths preoccupation with moral gentrification through neo-abolitionism, but rather, that the circuits of global governmentality while influential, are highly contingent, thus producing opportunities for creative forms of mobilisation by sex workers.","output":"The Sexual Politics of Anti-Trafficking Discourse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To study the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on cognitions and emotions felt during sexual intercourse by analyzing the responses of 1079 French-speaking subjects (338 men, 741 women, median age: 31 years) who participated in an online survey between April 27 and May 11, 2020 Method: Negative sexual cognitions (NSC), positive sexual emotions (PSE) and negative sexual emotions (NSE) are assessed using a tool inspired by the Sexual Mode Questionnaire Data are crossed with sociodemographic indicators, information on lockdown modalities, indices on sex life, information on psychological functioning and sexual satisfaction Main results: One third of the participants saw a decrease in the frequency of their sexual activities or in their sexual satisfaction Changes in NSCs were found in 74 4% of subjects (increase: 38 4%;decrease: 36%) Emotional changes are found in between 50 7% (NSC: increase: 20 2%;decrease: 30 5%) and 60 9% (PSE: increase: 24 6%;decrease: 36 3%) of participants The effect of lockdown on NSC, NSE, and PSE depends on gender at birth, intensity of depressive symptoms, and attachment styles Women appear to be more vulnerable to lockdown than men Insecure or depressed subjects also appear more vulnerable The lockdown impact also depends on changes in the frequency of physical/digital intercourse during lockdown and the modalities of confinement Changes in NSC, NSE, and PSE had a significant effect on sexual satisfaction during lockdown Conclusion: The lockdown impact on sexual emotions and cognitions is non-negligible and greater than the impact on sexual behaviors Whether it is positive or negative, it asks about the post-confinement repercussions: what becomes of a positive impact with deconfinement?

SUMMARY ANSWER: Our data suggest that at-home semen collection within 2 hours of processing does not negatively impact semen parameters and IUI pregnancy outcomes. What is known already: There are mixed reports regarding the effect of at-home semen collection on IUI outcomes. In a study of 633 cycles, no differences in semen parameters or pregnancy rates were observed between home and clinic collections(1). Conversely, in a smaller cohort, at-home collection was associated with worse pregnancy outcomes when IUI was coupled with gonadotropin stimulation, but not when coupled with clomiphene(2). We previously reported no differences in semen parameters and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) embryo transfer outcomes, when cycles using semen collected at-home were compared to cycles with on-site collection(3). However, such findings cannot necessarily be extended to the IUI setting. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a retrospective cohort study of all 529 IUI cycles that took place in 2020 at an academic fertility center. Semen collected at the clinic was used for 143 cycles before the COVIDC19 pandemic, and at-home collected specimens were used for the 386 cycles following the revised semen collection protocol. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Prior to the COVIDC19 pandemic, semen was collected at our clinic and processed within 30 minutes. Post-COVID, in order to maintain social distancing, semen was collected at-home, at an IUI-approved cup, and transported to our center within 2 hours, while maintained to room temperature. Logistic regression models were performed to evaluate the effect of at-home collection on achieving pregnancy (positive pregnancy test-PPT) and clinical pregnancy (sonographic confirmation-CP), adjusting for age and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The mean age (SD) (years) of the female partner was 35.4 (4.2) vs. 35.4 (4.4) (p = 0.978) and of the male partner 36.6 (4.4) vs. 37.1 (p = 0.328) for the clinic vs. at-home groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in dayC3 follicle stimulating hormone and AMH. In both groups the most common diagnoses were idiopathic and combined factors infertility (27.3% and 18.9% & 24.1% and 25.1%, respectively for the clinic & at-home groups, p = 0.376). Similarly, there were no differences regarding ovarian stimulation, and gonadotropins were the most common medication used in both groups (clinic: 44.1% vs. at-home: 39.4%, p = 0.775). Semen analysis parameters (volume, motility, forward progression, total motile count) were comparable between the 2 groups, with the exception of concentration (mil/ml) which was higher with at-home collection [66.1 (45.0) vs. 81.1 (63.0), p = 0.009]. In unadjusted models, at-home collection had no significant effect on the odds for a PPT [OR (95%CI): 0.691 (0.427C1.119), p = 0.133] or CP [0.751 (0.447C1.263), p = 0.281]. These results persisted even when adjusting for maternal age and AMH: PPT [0.708 (0.435C1.153), p = 0.165] and CP [0.773 (0.455C1.312), p = 0.340]. When sub-analysis was performed within the different medication groups, the above findings persisted for both gonadotropin and oral medication cycles. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The limitations of the study include its retrospective design and the absence of livebirth data, given the limited follow up period. However, regarding the latter, one can use the ongoing clinical pregnancy rate as an accurate estimate of livebirth. Wider implications of the findings: At-home semen collection within 2 hours of processing did not negatively impact semen analysis parameters or pregnancy outcomes following IUI. These data constitute an important addition to the current limited literature on the subject and provides an additional level of safety for our patients and staff during the COVIDC19 crisis.

The quick adoption of telemedicine occurred out of necessity for social distancing, and evidence-based approaches are needed to determine the future utility of this approach to delivering care. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with both provider and patient satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: This survey-based study was conducted in 2020. Surveys were distributed electronically by e-mail to providers and patients. Participants: Surveys related to satisfaction levels with telemedicine were distributed to 73 primary care providers and 6,626 patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measures of this study were satisfaction level with telemedicine in primary care. Results: Studies were completed by 23 primary care providers and 1,692 patients. Most patient participants were female (70.8%), white (89.7%), non-Hispanic or non-Latino (96.6%), and Massachusetts residents (96.9%). Variables that were found to be significantly associated with higher levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits included: travel time saved >30 min (odds ratio [OR] 1.8), having an easy visit connection (OR = 3.2), use of Zoom? video visit over telephone only (OR = 2.8), and identifying as female (OR 1.8). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients and providers reported high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine visits in a primary care setting. Providers felt that telemedicine visits usually take the same amount or less time than in-person visits. Both providers and patients reported a desire to see telemedicine visits continued after the pandemic. Patients who saved more than 30 min of travel time found it easy to connect or those who were female were more likely to be satisfied with telemedicine visits, while those that had telephone visits were less likely to be satisfied than those that had Zoom? visits.","output":"Telemedicine in Primary Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Provider and Patient Satisfaction Examined"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Convalescent plasma from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and monoclonal antibodies were shown to potently neutralize viral and pseudoviral particles carrying the S glycoprotein. However, a non-negligent proportion of plasma samples from infected individuals, as well as S-specific monoclonal antibodies, were reported to be non-neutralizing despite efficient interaction with the S glycoprotein in different biochemical assays using soluble recombinant forms of S or when expressed at the cell surface. How neutralization relates to the binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here, we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA, ELISA, and neutralization assays, we observed a strong correlation between these parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of pseudoviral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Antibody Binding to SARS-CoV-2 S Glycoprotein Correlates with but Does Not Predict Neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World median age population growth during the last decades brought with it an improvement of the relationship between Design Research and older users The balance between users requirements and Human-Centered Design (HCD) strategies to satisfy them has been destabilized by the COVID-19 pandemic Human-Centered Design smart clothing is becoming an essential tool for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) of elderly users improving their life quality, lifestyle, and health These devices allow the monitoring of the persons daily habits, health status, and well-being in a non-intrusive way, enhancing autonomy and independence By 2030, aging will affect more and more the human being of the smart society Future perspective needs to be addressed to empowering AAL where HCD smart clothing will become an essential tool for protecting senior citizens ? 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Human-Centered Design Smart Clothing for Ambient Assisted Living of Elderly Users: Considerations in the COVID-19 Pandemic Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is placing health systems in serious challenges worldwide.

In traditional analyses of the critical SIR model, the critical dynamical regime is started from a single infected node. The application of containment measures to an ongoing epidemic, however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such non-trivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model. We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model. We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the outbreak is a non-monotonic function of the initial number of infected individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations associated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics with non-trivial initial conditions. Far from heard immunity, fluctuations are much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing time series may be particularly challenging.","output":"Epidemic plateau in critical SIR dynamics with non-trivial initial conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Schizophrenia is a mental disease with a profound impact on human health. Patients with schizophrenia have poor oral hygiene, increasing their risk of systemic diseases, such as respiratory infections, and declining their quality of life. Therefore, this study aims to assess the oral health status of inpatients with schizophrenia, analyze its related factors, and thus provide scientific evidence for further exploration of corresponding control strategies. Methods: A total of 425 inpatients older than 50 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia from two psychiatric hospitals (mean age 58.49  5.72 years) were enrolled. The demographic data of the patients were checked on admission. Two independent dentists examined caries, missing teeth, and fillings. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Global Deterioration Scale were performed as cognitive tests. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status rating scale were used to determine their mental status. Results: The average decayed, missing, and filled teeth index was 12.99  8.86. Linear regression analysis showed that the decayed, missing, and filled teeth index had a significantly positive relationship with age (p < 0.001) and smoking (p < 0.001) and a negative relationship with MMSE (p = 0.029).

Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed if abnormal basal blood pressure. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixteen children were evaluated; 15 were finally included. Confirmed family member SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in all. Twenty-seven percent were asymptomatic. Anal and conjunctival swabs tests resulted negative in all. Patients with lower body mass index (BMI) presented significantly higher viral loads. Main laboratory abnormalities were: lactate dehydrogenase increasing (73%), low vitamin D levels (87%), hematuria (33%), proteinuria (26%), renal hyperfiltration (33%), and hypofiltration (13%).

Infection of monocytes/macrophages and/or recruitment of uninfected immune cells can result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. Uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome. Antiviral agents and immune modulating treatments are currently being trialled. Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents.","output":"COVID-19: Immunology and treatment options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We determine the full statistics of nonstationary heat transfer in the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti lattice gas model at long times by uncovering and exploiting complete integrability of the underlying equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.

The current corona virus pandemic is perceived as the most recent example. However, the notion of crisis is increasingly deployed as a signifier of relevance, rather than as an analytical concept. Moreover, human geography has so far little contributed to the interdisciplinary crisis research field which is fixated on the temporal aspects of crisis but neglects its spatiality. Against this background, the first aim of the paper is to demonstrate the value of thinking about crisis analytically. Therefore, we introduce theoretical knowledge developed within a recently emerging literature on crisis management.

However, various methodological challenges associated with WBE would affect the accuracy of prevalence estimation. To date, the overall uncertainty of WBE and the impact of each step on the prevalence estimation are largely unknown. This study divided the WBE approach into five steps (i.e., virus shedding; in-sewer transportation; sampling and storage; analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater; back-estimation) and further summarized and quantified the uncertainties associated with each step through a systematic review. Although the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA varied greatly between COVID-19 positive patients, with more than 10 infected persons in the catchment area, the uncertainty caused by the excretion rate became limited for the prevalence estimation. Using a high-frequency flow-proportional sampling and estimating the prevalence through actual water usage data significantly reduced the overall uncertainties to around 20C40% (relative standard deviation, RSD). And under such a scenario, the analytical uncertainty of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was the dominant factor. This highlights the importance of using surrogate viruses as internal or external standards during the wastewater analysis, and the need for further improvement on analytical approaches to minimize the analytical uncertainty. This study supports the application of WBE as a complementary surveillance strategy for monitoring COVID-19 prevalence and provides methodological improvements and suggestions to enhance the reliability for future studies.","output":"Uncertainties in estimating SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by wastewater-based epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 prevention behaviors may be seen as self-interested or prosocial. Using American samples from MTurk and Prolific (total n = 6,850), we investigated which framing is more effectiveand motivation is strongerfor fostering prevention behavior intentions. We evaluated messaging that emphasized personal, public, or personal and public benefits of prevention. In initial studies (conducted March 14-16, 2020), the Public treatment was more effective than the Personal treatment, and no less effective than the Personal+Public treatment. In additional studies (conducted April 17-30, 2020), all three treatments were similarly effective. Across all these studies, the perceived public threat of coronavirus was also more strongly associated with prevention intentions than the perceived personal threat. Furthermore, people who behaved prosocially in incentivized economic games years before the pandemic had greater prevention intentions. Finally, in a field experiment (conducted December 21-23, 2020), we used our three messaging strategies to motivate contact-tracing app signups (n = 152,556 newsletter subscribers).

The authors, members of the APsaA COVID-19 Advisory Team and longtime researchers in screen relations-based psychoanalytic care, recount lessons learned from their pandemic experience. As both disaster victim and mental health responder, they start with the cultural context for pandemic-specific mental health practice. Going deeper into the technological context for psychoanalytic care, they describe clinically-relevant differences between screen relations and physical co-presence, highlighting risk and trust, richness, and relational embodiment as key influences on clinical process and outcome. Common adaptions and responses that helped make pandemic-specific screen relations-based treatment work emerged from their own work and discussions and consultations with numerous colleagues. Curiosity, humility, clinical creativity, and self-care are highlighted. They close with hopes for a post-pandemic world in which we can mourn loss, reestablish trust, and renew and deepen our appreciation for relationships and intimacies only possible when we are bodies together in the same place at the same time.

We therefore sought to identify any unequal effects of the California stay-at-home orders between races and insurance statuses in a multicenter study utilizing trauma volume data. METHODS A posthoc multicenter retrospective analysis of trauma patients presenting to 11 centers in Southern California between the dates of January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019, was performed. The number of trauma patients of each race/insurance status was tabulated per day. We then calculated the changes in trauma volume related to stay-at-home orders for each race/insurance status and compared the magnitude of these changes using statistical resampling. RESULTS Compared to baseline, there was a 40.1% drop in total trauma volume, which occurred 20 days after stay-at-home orders. During stay-at-home orders, the average daily trauma volume of patients with Medicaid increased by 13.7  5.3%, whereas the volume of those with Medicare, private insurance, and no insurance decreased. The average daily trauma volume decreased for White, Black, Asian, and Latino patients with the volume of Black and Latino patients dropping to a similar degree compared to White patients. CONCLUSION This retrospective multicenter study demonstrated that patients with Medicaid had a paradoxical increase in trauma volume during stay-at-home orders, suggesting that the most impoverished groups remain disproportionately exposed to trauma during a pandemic, further exacerbating existing health disparities.","output":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stay-at-home order's unequal effects on trauma volume by insurance status in Southern California."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The focus of this study looks at the motivations and rationale from a national survey of over 7200 Canadians in November 2020 into why they use online services to purchase food.

Spread of COVID-19 has brought a paradigm shift in a similar manner to the way we learn things and has dramatically altered the teaching learning process. Like any other tool, online learning was considered to be a supporting hand for augmenting the teaching learning experience by making the learning process more interactive and participative. COVID-19 has made online teaching as the sole mode for teaching learning for students and teachers. Without any doubt, when we run out of options only then we can ascertain the true facets of something. It can also be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of online teaching over traditional teaching. The present study is an endeavor to assess the stakeholder's perception for this new teaching learning environment which has emerged during this unprecedented situation. Respondents were selected using stratified judgment sampling method. 120 respondents from Delhi NCR were interviewed using structured questionnaire. Statistical tools like factor analysis, cross tabulation, t-test and discriminant analysis were used for data analysis. Factor analysis led to formation of dimensions namely awareness related to online teaching learning process, perception for decisions taken by higher education bodies, impact of pandemic on economic conditions and subsequent attendance and effectiveness of online classes. Further two-group discriminant analysis was applied to find out association among predictors and effectiveness of online learning. It was observed that awareness related to online teaching learning process, perception for decisions taken by administration, impact of pandemic on economic conditions, attendance, socio-economic background were prominent factors which significantly affect the respondent's perception for effectiveness of online classes. ? 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

These factors have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (NSPCC, 2020b)(NSPCC, 2020a). We hypothesise an increase in Bridgends domestic and child abuse during lockdown. METHOD: Data was collected retrospectively from 23rd March to 30th September 2020 and compared to the same time period in 2019. Wales-wide data on domestic abuse was shared by the Welsh Governments Live Fear free helpline. Local data was shared by domestic abuse charity CALAN, the Emergency Department (ED) and Paediatric Department of Princess of Wales Hospital (POWH). RESULTS: During lockdown, Live Fear Free reported increasing average monthly contact across Wales in 2020 (511 April; 631 December). Locally, CALAN reported a 190% increase in self-referrals and a 198% increase in third party referrals, but there was a 36% decrease in referrals from Police for domestic abuse. The Paediatric Department observed a 67% decrease in child protection medical examinations (CPMEs) undertaken (52 vs. 17). 23 examinations in 2019 were referred from schools compared to 1 in 2020. There was a greater proportion of self-referrals for CPMEs in 2020. ED child protection referrals increased from 189 (2019) to 204 (2020). CONCLUSION: There was an increase in self-referrals to local support services for domestic and child abuse concerns and an increase in referrals from families/friends for child protection concerns. This was not the case with police, ED and schools/nurseries referrals. This suggests reduced engagement with public sector organisations during lockdown which services should consider.","output":"IMPACT OF COVID-19 LOCKDOWN: DOMESTIC AND CHILD ABUSE IN BRIDGEND"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When our nation was challenged by a global pandemic in 2020, nursing stepped forward to carry out what needed to be done - to take care of the nation's people.

Previous studies on its counterparts prove a complex and concomitant interaction between coronaviruses and autophagy. The precise manipulation of this pathway allows these viruses to exploit the autophagy molecular machinery while avoiding its protective apoptotic drift and cellular innate immune responses. In turn, the maneuverability margins of such hijacking appear to be so narrow that the modulation of the autophagy, regardless of whether using inducers or inhibitors (many of which are FDA-approved for the treatment of other diseases), is usually detrimental to viral replication, including SARS-CoV-2. Recent discoveries indicate that these interactions stretch into the still poorly explored noncanonical autophagy pathway, which might play a substantial role in coronavirus replication. Still, some potential therapeutic targets within this pathway, such as RAB9 and its interacting proteins, look promising considering current knowledge. Thus, the combinatory treatment of COVID-19 with drugs affecting both canonical and noncanonical autophagy pathways may be a turning point in the fight against this and other viral infections, which may also imply beneficial prospects of long-term protection.","output":"Canonical and Noncanonical Autophagy as Potential Targets for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The manuscript investigated the isolation, characterization and anti-infective potential of valinomycin (3), streptodepsipeptide P11A (2), streptodepsipeptide P11B (1), and one novel valinomycin analogue, streptodepsipeptide SV21 (4), which were all produced by the Gram-positive strain Streptomyces cavourensis SV 21.

Two validated surveys were completed: Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The mean scores were calculated and were compared between women by pregnancy outcomes. Continuous variables were presented as mean (standard deviation (SD)) and were compared to assess for significance between groups using independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance. Categorical variables were compared using 2 test. RESULTS A total of 142 women responded to the survey. For the SF-36, physical health was significantly higher for women at 24-36 months postpartum compared to those from 0-6 months postpartum for physical functioning (mean difference 21.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.2, 33.5), role limitation due to physical function (mean difference 32.1 (95% CI 9.4, 54.7)) and pain (mean difference 15.5 (95% CI 3.4, 30.9)).

Ethiopia reported the first COVID-19 in March, 2020. The number of cases is increasing, putting much pressure on oncology care. This study examines what the Ethiopian cancer patients and their caregivers knew about COVID 19 after the initial stages of the pandemic. It also assesses the information needs, psychological experiences as well as the impact of pandemic on oncologistpatient- caregiver communication and treatment process. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 participants (100 cancer patients and 100 caregivers) at the initial stage of pandemic (May 1 - June 30, 2020) at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data was collected using a pretested, structured questionnaire to assess knowledge and perceptions on COVID-19. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of TASH (04/14/2015) and the Ethical Review Board of Western Sweden (DNR 520- 18). Results: The results indicate that though both cancer patients and their caregivers show a high awareness of and knowledge about COVID 19, they need more information about the risks specific to cancer patients. The respondents are also concerned about the risks of pandemic outbreak in Ethiopia and its impact on availability of cancer care treatments in the country. The respondents report experiencing psychological concerns in relation to the pandemic. The higher educated patients and caregivers report being more concerned than the lower educated respondents. Delays in appointments and therapy are the main concerns in relation to cancer care. Further, both patients and caregivers experience that the restrictions on the number of caregivers present during interactions with oncologists negatively influence communication, resulting in relatives being excluded and patients experiencing loneliness and lack of support. Conclusions: Getting a better insight into knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among cancer patients and their caregivers is essential for managing the effects of pandemic in cancer care. To our knowledge, there was no similar study in Ethiopia.

People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be more susceptible to physical function deterioration while practicing social distancing. Recent reports have suggested that about 50% of people with MS (pwMS) decreased their leisure physical activity during COVID-19, and upwards of 30% reported decreased physical fitness levels. However, the impact of social distancing on adverse health-related outcomes such as falls has not received much scrutiny. Therefore, we explored the frequency and characteristics of falls experienced by people living with and without MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two-hundred and thirty-nine individuals, including 106 pwMS (median age: 59 years) and 133 people living without MS (median age: 66 years) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. A snowball sampling strategy was used for online recruitment. Participants completed a customized falls questionnaire and the number of falls experienced (if any) during COVID-19 was recorded. Fall-related characteristics such as the timing, locations, activities undertaken before falling and consequences, as well as self-reported physical activity were also recorded. RESULTS: Overall, participants reported 232 falls (1.67 falls/person in pwMS and 0.41 falls/person in non-MS participants). People living with MS (pwMS) had a significantly higher frequency of falls (58.5% vs 21.8%; p< 0.001) and recurrent falls (45.3% vs 9.8%; p< 0.001) compared to non-MS participants. Additionally, pwMS reported a significantly higher proportion of in-home falls (83.9% vs 54.2%; p = 0.004), as well as a higher proportion of overall injuries (44.3% vs 12.5%, p< 0.001), fractures (5.7% vs 0.8%, p = 0.048), and healthcare utilization (9.4% vs 1.6%, p = 0.007) compared to non-MS participants. A similar proportion of pwMS (49.1%) and non-MS participants (52.2%) reported lower physical activity levels during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study revealed that pwMS remain at high risk of falls and fall-related outcomes during COVID-19. The high number of falls experienced by pwMS is of clinical concern considering the current strain on the healthcare system. Findings from this study highlight the importance of monitoring falls and the potential for telerehabilitation in persons with MS during COVID-19.","output":"Frequency and characteristics of falls in people living with and without multiple sclerosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This preliminary study focuses on information practices of French-speaking immigrants to Israel with three goals in mind: a) understanding their information needs; b) mapping information sources used before and after immigration to cope with these needs, and c) analyzing the information practices related to immigrant's wellbeing.

viruses in this family were first recognized in the 1920s. Despite the importance of ND to the poultry industry, little is known about PMV1 strain emergence events and the subsequent dispersal and evolution of new strains. The genotype VI-PMV1 was first identified in the 1980s and has been named pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV1) because of unusual host specificity with Columbiformes (Collins et al., 1996); it has been responsible for panzootics in both chickens and pigeons during that time. Here, we used evolutionary analyses to characterize the emergence of this contemporary PMV1 lineage. We demonstrate that GVI-PMV1 arose through cross-species transmission events from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes, and quickly established in pigeon populations. Our studies revealed a close association between the time of viral emergence and panzootic events of this virus. The virus appeared first in Southeastern Europe and quickly spread across the European continent, which became the epicenter for global virus dissemination. With new viral gene sequences, we show that GVI-PMV1 viruses currently circulating in North America resulted from multiple invasion events from Europe, one associated with an exotic European Columbiformes species, and that extant lineages have diversified locally. This study extends our understanding of successful viral emergence subsequent to cross-species transmission and dispersal patterns of newly emerged avian viruses, which may improve surveillance awareness and disease control of this and other important avian pathogens.","output":"Successful establishment and global dispersal of genotype VI avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 after cross species transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome is a newly emerged hyper-inflammatory syndrome that is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population.ObjectivesWe aim to identify commonly presented clinical features, imaging findings, laboratory findings, treatment modalities and clinical outcomes of MIS-C/PIMS.

Timing of the nasal repair remains somewhat controversial. Some authors perform a combined nasal and lip repair in infancy while others advocate for a staged repair with the nasal component occurring later in childhood. Frequently, secondary repair is needed to address residual nasal deformities in early adulthood. Conchal cartilage has become increasingly popular as a source of cartilage for secondary reconstruction. Donor site morbidities include hematoma formation, scar formation, and wound healing complications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is 1 previous report of a full through-and-through conchal defect as a complication of auricular cartilage graft harvesting. The authors report an infrequently described iatrogenic conchal defect due to cartilage harvesting managed with a single-stage reconstruction using bookend flaps. METHODS A 19-year-old female with a history of unilateral cleft lip and palate repair underwent secondary rhinoplasty using conchal cartilage. A bolster dressing was applied to the conchal harvest site. The patient was unable to attend her postoperative clinic visit and was eventually seen 2 months postoperatively with the bolster still in place. A full-thickness conchal defect was present when the bolster was removed. RESULTS A pressure dressing such as a bolster is commonly used to prevent hematoma formation after conchal cartilage graft harvesting. This is routinely removed during the initial postoperative visit. Prolonged placement can result in donor site complications such as a full-thickness conchal defect. CONCLUSION A functional and aesthetic reconstruction of a full-thickness iatrogenic conchal defect was achieved with excellent results using a local posterior flap, and 2 anteriorly based bookend flaps for closure.

METHODS A prospective, randomized comparison of laparoscopic skills performance on four access devices (ADs) (GelPOINT, SILS Port, SSL Access System, TriPort) and one IP-SSA setup was conducted. A laparoscopic trainer box was used to train 18 (2nd- to 4th-year) medical students, four surgical residents, and five attending surgeons to proficiency in multiport laparoscopy using four laparoscopic drills (i.e., peg transfer, bean drop, pattern cutting, extracorporeal suturing). Drills then were performed in random order on each IP-SSA and AD-SSA setup using straight laparoscopic instruments. Repetitions were timed and errors recorded. Data are presented as mean  standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSD post hoc tests. RESULTS The attending surgeons had significantly faster total task times than the residents or students (P < 0.001), but the difference between the residents and students was not significant. Pair-wise comparisons showed significantly faster total task times for the IP-SSA setup than for all four AD-SSAs within the student group only (P < 0.05). The total task times for the residents and attending surgeons showed a similar profile, but the differences were not significant. When the data for the three groups were combined, the total task time was less for the IP-SSA setup than for each of the four AD-SSA setups (P < 0.001). Similarly, the IP-SSA setup was significantly faster than three of the four AD-SSA setups for peg transfer, three of the four setups for pattern cutting, and two of the four setups for suturing. No significant differences in error rates between the IP-SSA and AD-SSA setups were detected.

In recent years, however, international developments, such as the rise of wages in what were typically considered low-cost countries, coupled with uncertainties created through global political tensions, have incentivized companies to move their operations back to their respective home countries or to make new investments in United States-based facilities. This phenomenon, known as reshoring, has only increased in 2020 and 2021, amidst US - China tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Reshoring is growing in popularity particularly among companies based in the United States. In May 2021, for example, a US solar energy systems manufacturer called GAF Energy announced that the company would relocate its operations from Asia to Silicon Valley, expecting to add 400 jobs in research, engineering, and manufacturing roles (Szal, 2021). Around the same time, cycle and treadmill machine maker Peloton announced that it would invest $400 million to build its first US-based factory, citing heightened demand and the pandemic highlighting uncertainties that come with its global supply chain (Thomas, 2021). The company, which has announced that the US factory will be based in Troy Township, Ohio, stated that it expects to create over 2,000 jobs in the area. Also, in May 2021, Ford Motor announced a joint venture with South Korean battery maker SK Innovation to manufacture battery cells for electric vehicles in the United States (Wayland, 2021). The venture will be based in the US, marking a significant decision for Ford Motor, which operates worldwide and has notably been in the press in recent years for its decisions to offshore operations. Though an increasingly important and growing phenomenon, reshoring has not been studied nearly as much as offshoring. Experts predict that reshoring will only continue to increase as global supply chain uncertainties get revealed through political tensions and fallout from the pandemic. As companies gain a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities in offshoring their production, they will become more incentivized to invest in their home country-based facilities. As such, it is more important than ever to understand reshoring, the reasons behind why companies decide to reshore, the recent trends among companies moving operations back home, and predictions about how reshoring is likely to evolve in years to come. This paper offers an overview of the aforementioned points, specifically focusing on companies based in the US, which are some of the more likely companies to make the decision to offshore and subsequently reshore.","output":"Reshoring: An Overview, Recent Trends, and Predictions for the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Food allergy management and treatment require dietary modification, are associated with significant burdens, and affect food choices and behaviours. Emerging therapies, such as oral immunotherapy (OIT), provide a glimmer of hope for those living with the condition. Some burdens have received substantial focus, whereas many knowledge gaps on the significance of other impacts, including economic burden, remain. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence from many countries, but disproportionately from the United States, supports that food allergy carries significant healthcare and societal costs. Early introduction for the prevention of food allergies is theoretically cost-effective, but remains largely undescribed. Unique considerations, such as those to cows milk protein allergy, which affects a substantial proportion of infants, and adrenaline autoinjectors, which have a high cost-per-use, require a balance between cost-effectiveness to the healthcare system and adverse outcomes. Household costs have largely been explored in two countries, but owing to different healthcare structures and costs of living, comparisons are difficult, as are generalisations to other countries. Stock epinephrine in schools may present a cost-effective strategy, particularly in economically disadvantaged areas. Costs relating to OIT must be examined within both immediate benefits, such as protection from anaphylaxis, and long-term benefits, such as sustained unresponsiveness.

In this study we determine the impact of respiratory viruses and how viral co-detections/infections can affect clinical LRTI severity in children in a hospital setting. METHODS: Patients younger than 3 years of age admitted to a tertiary hospital in Brazil during the months of high prevalence of respiratory viruses had samples collected from nasopharyngeal aspiration. These samples were tested for 13 different respiratory viruses through real-time PCR (rt-PCR). Patients were followed during hospitalization, and clinical data and population characteristics were collected during that period and at discharge to evaluate severity markers, especially length of hospital stay and oxygen use. Univariate regression analyses identified potential risk factors and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine the impact of specific viral detections as well as viral co-detections in relation to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We analyzed 260 episodes of LRTI with a viral detection rate of 85% (n = 222). Co-detection was observed in 65% of all virus-positive episodes. The most prevalent virus was Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (54%), followed by Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) (32%) and Human Rhinovirus (HRV) (21%). In the multivariate models, infants with co-detection of HRV + RSV stayed 4.5 extra days (p = 0.004), when compared to infants without the co-detection. The same trends were observed for the outcome of days of supplemental oxygen use. CONCLUSIONS: Although RSV remains as the main cause of LRTI in infants our study indicates an increase in the length of hospital stay and oxygen use in infants with HRV detected by RT-PCR compared to those without HRV. Moreover, one can speculate that when HRV is detected simultaneously with RSV there is an additive effect that may be reflected in more severe clinical outcome. Also, our study identified a significant number of children infected by recently identified viruses, such as hMPV and Human Bocavirus (HBov), and this is a novel finding for poor communities from developing countries.","output":"Severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and toddlers from a non-affluent population: viral etiology and co-detection as risk factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many states have adopted stay-at-home orders, rendering a large segment of the workforce unable to continue doing their jobs.

In spite of antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal prophylaxis, reduced host defenses render the HSCT patient vulnerable to pulmonary and other infections in the early weeks and even months post-transplantation. This chapter suggests an integrative approach followed by a description of the most common pulmonary syndromes seen in HSCT patients, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). The high risk of developing pulmonary complications after HSCT necessitates a pre-transplant pulmonary workup. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are done prior to HSCT and include spirometry and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO). Low DLCO and alveolarCarterial oxygen gradient on PFTs carry increased mortality post-HSCT. Decreased DLCO and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 80 % are indicators of developing respiratory failure post-HSCT. Investigating new pulmonary complaints is challenging. All patients should undergo an extensive workup of new pulmonary findings, including dyspnea, cough, fever, and hypoxia. In the first 4C6 weeks post-HSCT, immunocompromised patients can develop bacterial pneumonia. Pathogens include gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas or Klebsiella), Staphylococcus aureus, and Nocardia. While chest X-rays could show typical lobar or multilobar opacities, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest (noncontrast CT scans are adequate for workup of infectious processes) may yield additional characteristic findings (nodules, ground glass opacities, etc.). Fungal pneumonias, primarily aspergillus, can also develop in this early period. There is a very strong association between invasive Aspergillus pneumonia and neutropenia lasting more than 10 days. Viral pneumonia may develop as well in this patient population; however, it tends to occur later. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral pathogen, but with monitoring and preemptive therapy, the incidence has declined. Other viruses have emerged as pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus (see Chap. 17).","output":"Pulmonary Complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global medical emergency. National and international gastrointestinal societies recommended that any endoscopic activity during the lockdown phase of the pandemic should be limited to emergency or non-deferrable procedures only. We assessed the financial implications and impact on endoscopy activity of the lockdown phase in a tertiary referral endoscopy unit. METHODS: The number of endoscopy procedures canceled and performed in our endoscopy unit during our delay phase (16-22/03/2020) and lockdown phase (23/03-29/05/2020) was reviewed and compared with endoscopy activity conducted during the same period in 2019. The financial impact was subsequently analyzed. RESULTS: Between 16/03/2020 and 29/05/2020, 683 procedures were canceled and 365 non-deferrable procedures were performed. In contrast, in 2019, 3437 procedures were performed over the same timeframe, resulting in a revenue contraction of approximately 2,062,857.

Regulatory sandboxes allow developers, in cooperation with an agency, to conduct limited tests of new technologies in real-world settings for the purpose of generating and sharing information about them. Thus far, however, \\"regulatory sandboxes\\"-as named-appear almost exclusively in the context of financial technologies, or FinTech. Whether regulatory sandboxes, in fact, exist elsewhere in administrative law would be a significant finding for both regulators and scholars;it would blunt criticisms that agencies are slow to respond to new technologies, provide regulators with an additional tool for governing new technologies, and suggest that lessons learned from current regulatory sandboxes are applicable elsewhere. This Article is the first to explore this broader view of regulatory sandboxes and develop a synoptic theory of them. To do so, it uses one of the most radical programs to introduce new technologies in U.S. history: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (\\"FDA\\")'s Emergency Use Authorization (\\"EUA\\") program for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. EUAs-like regulatory sandboxes but in stark contrast to typical FDA approval processes-focus on real-world deployment as a means for information gathering. EUAs are also technologically flexible and crafted with close input from the developer, among other features. Generalizing FDA's experience with EUAs also provides lessons about the intersection of regulatory sandboxes with public trust in the agency, political interference, and the maintenance of regulatory standards. At the same time, FDA's COVID-19 EUAs are exceptional in two senses: they touch upon the public health, widely considered to be exceptional subject matter in administrative law;and arose in the context of an unprecedented global pandemic. Nonetheless, FDA's experience with EUAs suggest regulatory sandboxes may be an underexplored and undertheorized feature of administrative governance of new technologies. Future work in the area should assess whether regulatory sandboxes exist under the rubric identified here, which technologies they regulate, and how those sandboxes operate.","output":"Regulatory Sandboxes and the Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The apextrin C-terminal (ApeC) domain is a class of newly discovered protein domains with an origin dating back to prokaryotes. ApeC-containing proteins (ACPs) have been found in various marine and aquatic invertebrates, but their functions and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Early studies suggested that amphioxus ACP1 and ACP2 bind to bacterial cell walls and have a role in immunity. Here we identified another two amphioxus ACPs (ACP3 and ACP5), which belong to the same phylogenetic clade with ACP1/2, but show distinct expression patterns and sequence divergence (40-50% sequence identities). Both ACP3 and ACP5 were mainly expressed in the intestine and hepatic cecum, and could be up-regulated after bacterial challenge. Both prokaryotic-expressed recombinant ACP3 and ACP5 could bind with several species of bacteria and yeasts, showing agglutinating activity but no microbicidal activity. ELISA assays suggested that their ApeC domains could interact with peptidoglycan (PGN), but not with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zymosan A. Furthermore, they can only bind to Lys-type PGN from Staphylococcus aureus, but not to DAP-type PGN from Bacillus subtilis and not to moieties of PGN such as MDPs, NAMs and NAGs. This recognition spectrum is different from that of ACP1/2. We also found that when expressed in mammalian cells, ACP3 could interact with TRAF6 via a conserved non-ApeC region, which inhibited the ubiquitination of TRAF6 and hence suppressed downstream NF-B activation. This work helped define a novel subfamily of ACPs, which have conserved structures, and have related yet diversified molecular functions. Its members have dual roles, with ApeC as a lectin and a conserved unknown region as a signal transduction regulator. These findings expand our understanding of the ACP functions and may guide future research on the role of ACPs in different animal clades.","output":"Two Amphioxus ApeC-Containing Proteins Bind to Microbes and Inhibit the TRAF6 Pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efforts of containing the novel virus (COVID-19) have begun to show signs of psychological impact on teachers and students across the globe.

Maltodextrins utilization by Enterococcus faecalis has been identified as an important factor for colonization of mammalians hosts. Here we show that the LacI/GalR transcriptional regulator MalR, the maltose genes regulator, is also the main regulator of the operons encoding an ABC transporter (mdxEFG) and three metabolic enzymes (mmdH-gmdH-mmgT) required for the uptake and catabolism of maltotetraose and longer maltodextrins. The utilization of maltose and maltodextrins is consequently coordinated and induced by the disaccharide maltose, which binds to MalR. Carbon catabolite repression of the mdxEFG and mmdH-gmdH-mmgT operons is mediated by both, P-Ser-HPr/MalR and P-Ser-HPr/CcpA. The latter complex exerts only moderate catabolite repression which became visible when comparing maltodextrin operon expression in a malR- and a malR-ccpA double mutant grown in the presence of maltose, which is transported via a phosphotransferase system and thus favours the formation of P-Ser-HPr. Moreover, maltodextrin transport via MdxEFG slows rapidly when glucose is added, suggesting an additional regulation via inducer exclusion. This complex regulation of metabolic operons likely allows E. faecalis to fine-tune gene expression in response to changing environmental conditions.IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecalis represents a leading cause of hospital acquired infections worldwide. Several studies highlighted the importance of carbohydrate metabolism in the infection process of this bacterium. The genes required for maltodextrin metabolism are particularly induced during mice infection and therefore should play an important role for pathogenesis.

It has been generally thought that this process is driven by interactions between the viral transmembrane proteins and the internal virion components (core, capsid, or nucleocapsid). This model was particularly applicable to alphaviruses, which require both spike proteins and a nucleocapsid for budding. However, genetic studies have clearly shown that the retrovirus core protein, i.e., the Gag protein, is able to form enveloped particles by itself. Also, budding of negative-strand RNA viruses (rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses) seems to be accomplished mainly by internal components, most probably the matrix protein, since the spike proteins are not absolutely required for budding of these viruses either. In contrast, budding of coronavirus particles can occur in the absence of the nucleocapsid and appears to require two membrane proteins only. Biochemical and structural data suggest that the proteins, which play a key role in budding, drive this process by forming a three-dimensional (cage-like) protein lattice at the surface of or within the membrane. Similarly, recent electron microscopic studies revealed that the alphavirus spike proteins are also engaged in extensive lateral interactions, forming a dense protein shell at the outer surface of the viral envelope. On the basis of these data, we propose that the budding of enveloped viruses in general is governed by lateral interactions between peripheral or integral membrane proteins. This new concept also provides answers to the question of how viral and cellular membrane proteins are sorted during budding.

We also assessed transmission from immunized and challenged to naive, directly in-contact pigs. Pigs were immunised with either adjuvanted, whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines or viral vectored (ChAdOx1 and MVA) vaccines expressing either the homologous or heterologous influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein as well as an influenza viral pseudotype (S-FLU) vaccine expressing heterologous HA.

Significant survival benefits have been shown by dexamethasone, tocilizumab and sarilumab, however they are only recommended in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Ivermectin is a well-established and readily available antiparasitic drug which may be suitable for treatment in mild and moderate disease stages. It recently demonstrated anti-viral properties in vitro and now over 80 clinical trials have been registered worldwide to test its effectiveness in COVID-19 patients. This meta-analysis aims to collect data on adverse events reported in new COVID-19 treatment trials for the use of ivermectin as a repurposed medication. Methods Data was extracted from randomised trials of COVID-19 treatment trials identified through systematic searches of PUBMED, EMBASE, MedRxiv and trial registries. The primary outcome of this meta-analysis is the frequency of adverse events. Key safety events included serious, gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular and dermatological adverse events. Results Overall, 18 trials investigating ivermectin for COVID-19 in a total of 2496 participants reported safety data and were included. There was no significant difference in the proportion of all adverse events between ivermectin and the comparator. There were 371/1261 (29%) adverse events recorded in the ivermectin containing arms and 376/1284 (29%) in the control arms (RR 1.02 [95% CI 0.77 - 1.34];p = 0.91). There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events across treatment arms (RR 1.95 [95% CI 0.75 - 5.11];p = 0.18).

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of more than one month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment scores. RESULTS: Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: LT can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction that could contraindicate LT, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs.

Clinical specimens of the COVID-19 patient including serum, oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, bile, abdominal drainage fluid, urine, stool, and gallbladder tissue were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Fresh normal gallbladder tissue and gangrenous gallbladder tissue were also collected for further research including hematoxylin and eosin (HE), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescent (IF) staining, and compared with the gallbladder from the COVID-19 patient. The bile, as well as the serum, oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, abdominal drainage fluid, urine, and rectal swabs were consecutively negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The viral host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was highly expressed in gallbladder epithelial cells, and viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) was visualized in the cytoplasm of gallbladder epithelial cells. Immune cells including CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD38, CD68, and MPO were positive in gangrenous gallbladder tissues without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and were relatively downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infective gallbladder tissue.

Inflammation, especially its severe form with excess release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) which is a life-threatening condition, is among the most important suspects involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. It has been shown that cytokine storm could cause notable morbidities such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which leads to hypoxia which is significantly associated with mortality of patients with COVID-19. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) which activates following ARDS-induced hypoxia plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of cytokine storm. The expression of tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-), interleukin 1  (IL-1), and IL-6 which are key elements of cytokine storm are by nuclear factor ʦ (NFB). Interestingly, during the hypoxia, HIF-1 activates NFB to induce expression of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors. These released factors starts a autocrine/paracrine loop and causes deterioration of their etiological pathways of expression: cytokine storm and ARDS. To sum up, it seems HIF-1 is an important target to hit to ameliorate the mentioned pathways. Herein, we suggest perfluorocarbons (PFCs) which are among the organofluorine compounds as a possible co-treatment to reduce hypoxemia and then hypoxia. These substances are known for their high gas solving potential that make them able to be used as a synthetic artificial blood product. Due to the potential of PFCs to affect the fountain of important physiopathological pathway such as inflammation a hypoxia through affecting NFB, they could be considered as multi-target co-treatment for ARD individuals with COVID-19.

All of the patients either survived to hospital discharge or died during hospitalization. Demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were collected. Patient outcomes (need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death) were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included, 53% of whom were women. Median age was 59 years (interquartile range 44-70) and 66% were younger than 65. Seventy-five percent identified themselves as Black, despite representing 58% of hospitalized patients at our institution in 2019. Common comorbid conditions included hypertension (68%), obesity (65%), and diabetes mellitus (31%). Frequent clinical manifestations included shortness of breath (76%), cough (75%), and fever (64%). Symptoms were present for a median of 7 days (interquartile range 4-7) on presentation. Twenty-four percent of patients required mechanical ventilation and, overall, 19% died (67% of those requiring mechanical ventilation). Eighty-four percent of those who died were Black.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to investigate presenteeism particularly in relation to respiratory infectious disease (RID). Hence, this rapid review aims to determine the prevalence of RID-related presenteeism, including COVID-19, and examines the reported reasons and associated risk factors. Methods: The review followed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search approach and focused on studies published in English and Chinese. Database searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI) and preprint databases MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Results: The search yielded 54 studies, of which four investigated COVID-19-related presenteeism. Prevalence of work presenteeism ranged from 14.1% to 55% for confirmed RID, and 6.6% to 100% for those working with suspected or subclinical RID. The included studies demonstrated that RID-related presenteeism is associated with occupation, sick pay policy, age, gender, health behaviour and perception, vaccination and organisational factors including workplace culture and peer pressure. Conclusions: This review demonstrates that presenteeism or non-adherence to isolation guidance is a real concern and can contribute to workplace transmissions and outbreaks. Policies which would support workers financially and improve productivity, should include a range of effective non-pharmaceutical inventions such as workplace testing, promoting occupational health services, reviewing pay and bonus schemes and clear messaging to encourage workers to stay at home when ill.

However, metadata are often incomplete, and there is no standardized format for recording metadata, leading to inefficiency during the metadata-based data retrieval process. Here, we propose a novel standardization method for DICOM metadata termed the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: R-CDM was designed to be compatible with Health Level Seven International (HL7)/Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and linked with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM to achieve a seamless link between clinical data and medical imaging data. The terminology system was standardized using the RadLex playbook, a comprehensive lexicon of radiology. As a proof of concept, the R-CDM conversion process was conducted with 41.7 TB of data from the Ajou University Hospital. The R-CDM database visualizer was developed to visualize the main characteristics of the R-CDM database. RESULTS: Information from 2801360 cases and 87203226 DICOM files was organized into two tables constituting the R-CDM.

This cohort study monitored safety in the first two programme years through active surveillance at 246 sentinel surveillance immunisation sites. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 70-79 years vaccinated with ZVL who responded to an opt-out survey sent via automated short message service (SMS) 3 days following vaccination (n=17 458) or contributed supplementary data through a separate, opt-in online survey at 16 and 24 days following vaccination (n=346). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of overall and prespecified adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) by sex, concomitant vaccination and underlying medical condition. Signal detection methods (fast initial response cumulative summation and Bayesian updating analyses) were applied to reports of medical attendance. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 72 years; 53% were female. The response rate following automated SMS was high (73% within 7 days of vaccination). Females were more likely than males to report any adverse event within 7 days of vaccination (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.31); injection site reaction was the most commonly reported (2.3%, n=377).

It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 meeting the criteria for hospital discharge (including two consecutive negative RT-PCR results) have experienced recurrent PCR positivity. However, the clinical course and risk factors for these patients have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR from the Guanggu Branch of Hubei Province Maternity and Childcare Hospital from February 24, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were enrolled. The epidemiological, radiographic, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from medical records. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to elucidate risk factors for patients with recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results 1087 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Of these, 20 (1.8%) died and 1067 (98.2%) were discharged from the hospital. Among the discharged cases, there were 81 (7.6%) patients found to develop a repeat positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA result. Older age was obviously associated with death. For patients with recurrent RT-PCR positivity, the median duration from illness onset to onset of complete RNA negative was 33.0 days (range, 6.0-82.0 days; IQR, 20.0-41.0 days), while that from illness onset to recurrence was 50.0 days (range, 21.0-95.0 days; IQR, 36.5-59.5 days). Multivariate regression analysis identified recurrence of positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA was associated with elevated IL-6 levels (P=0.004, OR=3.050; 95% CI, 1.432-6.499), increased lymphocyte count (P=0.038, OR=2.321; 95% CI, 1.048-5.138) and CT imaging features of lung consolidation (P=0.038, OR=1.641; 95% CI, 1.028-2.620) during hospitalization. Conclusion Elevated lymphocyte counts and IL-6 levels in blood, and consolidation features on CT imaging are useful risk factors for clinicians to identify patients at risk of developing recurrent positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This is speculated to be caused by a balance in immune regulation when fighting virus toxicity. For patients with a high risk of recurrent positivity, a prolonged observation and additional preventative measures should be implemented for at least 50 days after illness onset to prevent future outbreaks.","output":"Clinical Course and Risk Factors for Recurrence of Positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA: A Retrospective Cohort Study from Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The review introduces the history of cryptocurrencies, offering a description of the blockchain technology behind them.

The main contribution is an extensive demonstration that structural self-organization in the cryptocurrency markets has caused the same to attain complexity characteristics that are nearly indistinguishable from the Forex market at the level of individual time-series. However, the cross-correlations between the exchange rates on cryptocurrency platforms differ from it.

We aimed to evaluate the possible association between computed tomography (CT) signs of chronic CVD and mortality in infected patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a double-blind retrospective evaluation of the cerebral CT scans of 83 COVID-19 patients looking for CT signs of chronic CVD. We developed a rapid visual score, named CVD-CT, which summarized the possible presence of parietal calcifications and dolichosis, with or without ectasia, of intracranial arteries, areas of chronic infarction and leukoaraiosis. Statistical analysis was carried out with weighted Cohens K test for inter-reader agreement and logistic regression to evaluate the association of in-hospital mortality with CVD-CT, chest X-ray (CXR) severity score (Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema-RALE) for radiological assessment of pulmonary disease, sex and age. RESULTS: CVD-CT (odds ratio 1.6, 95% C.I. 1.2-2.1, p = 0.001) was associated with increased risk of mortality. RALE showed an almost significant association (odds ratio 1.05, 95% C.I. 1-1.1, p 0.06), whereas age and sex did not. CONCLUSION: CVD-CT is associated with risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of the study was to identify the body weight changes and their determinants in the nutritional and socio-demographic context during the COVID-19 pandemic in Polish women. During lockdown in Poland, 34% of women gained weight, while 18% of women reduced weight. As many as 44% of women with obesity before the pandemic increased their body weight, and 74% of women that were underweight reduced their body weight. In a group with weight gain, women increased their body weight by 2.8 kg on average and around 65% of them increased their total food intake. Unhealthy dietary changes and the negative lifestyle changes that comprised of an increase in screen time and a decrease in physical activity were found as key factors associated with weight gain. A higher risk of weight gain was associated with being obese before the pandemic or living in a macroeconomic region &gt;50% of EU-28 GDP, while those younger in age and carrying out remote work had a higher chance of weight loss. Concluding, the specific conditions during lockdown worsened the nutritional status, which may increase the risk of complicatedness and mortality from COVID-19. It seems advisable to create dietary and lifestyle recommendations tailored to the individual needs of women who are underweight or have excessive body weight. More attention should be paid also to environmental impacts.

METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics of 67 local clusters of COVID-19 cases in Sichuan Province reported as of March 17, 2020 were described and analyzed. Information about all COVID-19 clusters and involved cases was acquired from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention and analyzed with the epidemiological investigation results taken into account. RESULTS: The clusters were temporally and regionally concentrated. Clusters caused by imported cases from other provinces accounted for 73.13%; familial clusters accounted for 68.66%; the average attack rate was 8.54%, and the average secondary attack rate was 6.11%; the median incubation period was 8.5 d; a total of 28 cases met the criteria for incubation period determination, and in the 28 cases, the incubation period was > 14 d in 21.43% (6/28). a total of 226 confirmed cases were reported in the 67 clusters. Ten cases were exposed before the confirmed cases they contacted with developed clinical symptoms, and the possibility of exposure to other infection sources was ruled out; two clusters were caused by asymptomatic carriers; confirmed cases mainly presented with fever, respiratory and systemic symptoms; a gradual decline in the severity of clinical symptoms was noted with the increase of the case generation. CONCLUSIONS: Population movement and gathering restrictions and strict close contact management measures will significantly contribute to the identification and control of cases.

The government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting movement of people as a preventive measure. This survey was designed and conducted during the lockdown period to assess its effect on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India. METHODS: An online survey was sent across to practicing Indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (775/1260; 61.5%) were in private practice and 14.8% (187/1260) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes. At the time of taking the survey, 72.5% of the respondents (913/1260) were not seeing any patients due to the lockdown. Of those who were still examining patients, 82.9% (287/347) were only seeing emergency cases, based on their own clinical judgement. The proportion of ophthalmologists in ophthalmic institutes, government and municipal hospitals (126/253;49.8%) who were still seeing patients was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those in private practice (174/775;22.4%). Apart from emergencies such as trauma, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis (81.8%), other surgeries that were still being performed included intravitreal injections (9.1%) and cataract surgeries (5.9%). Approximately, 77.5% (976/1260) of the respondents had begun telephonic/e-mail/video consultations or consultations over social media applications since the lockdown began. In addition, 59.1% (745/1260) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other specialties while examining patients. When asked about the resumption of practice upon easing off of the restrictions, 57.8% (728/1260) of the respondents said they were unsure of when to resume elective surgeries; furthermore, 62.8% (791/1260) were unsure about the preferred screening strategy or precautionary approach prior to resuming surgeries and were awaiting guidelines. CONCLUSION: Our survey shows that majority of ophthalmologists in India were not seeing patients during the COVID-19 lockdown, with near-total cessation of elective surgeries. Emergency services were still being attended to by 27.5% of ophthalmologists who responded. A large proportions of ophthalmologists had switched over to telephonic advice or other forms of telemedicine to assist patients. Most of the responding ophthalmologists were unclear about when and how to resume surgeries upon easing off of the COVID-19 related restrictions. Regulatory bodies should take note of this and issue appropriate guidelines regarding the same.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 related lockdown on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India: Results of a survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a highly lethal pneumonia that emerged in 2012. There is limited information on MERS-CoV pathogenesis, as data from patients are scarce and the generation of animal models reproducing MERS clinical manifestations has been challenging. Human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice and a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERSMA-6-1-2) were recently described. hDPP4-KI mice infected with MERSMA-6-1-2 show pathological signs of respiratory disease, high viral titers in the lung, and death. In this work, a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV infectious cDNA was engineered by introducing non-synonymous mutations contained in the MERSMA-6-1-2 genome into a MERS-CoV infectious cDNA, leading to a recombinant mouse-adapted virus (rMERS-MA) that was virulent in hDDP4-KI mice. MERS-CoV adaptation to cell culture or mouse lungs led to mutations and deletions in genus-specific gene 5 that prevented full-length protein expression. In contrast, analysis of 476 MERS-CoV field isolates showed that gene 5 is highly stable in vivo, both in humans and camels. To study the role of protein 5, two additional viruses were engineered expressing a full-length gene 5 (rMERS-MA-5FL), or containing a complete gene 5 deletion (rMERS-MA-5). rMERS-MA-5FL virus was unstable, as deletions appeared during passage in different tissue culture cells, highlighting MERS-CoV instability. The virulence of rMERS-MA-5 was analyzed in a sublethal hDPP4-KI mouse model. Unexpectedly, all mice died after infection with rMERS-MA-5 in contrast to those infected with the parental virus, which contains a 17-nt deletion and a stop codon in protein 5 at position 108. Interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was delayed and dysregulated in the lungs of rMERS-MA-5 infected mice. Overall, these data indicated that rMERS-MA-5 virus was more virulent than the parental one and suggest that the residual gene 5 sequence present in the mouse-adapted parental virus had a function in ameliorating severe MERS-CoV pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus causing human infections with high mortality rate (35%). Animal models together with reverse genetics systems are essential to understand MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We developed a reverse genetics system for a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that reproduces the virus behavior observed in humans. This system is highly useful to investigate the role of specific viral genes in pathogenesis. In addition, we described a virus lacking gene 5 expression that is more virulent than the parental one. The data provide novel functions in IFN modulation for gene 5 in the context of viral infection, and will help to develop novel antiviral strategies.","output":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Gene 5 Modulates Pathogenesis in Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a non-selective cation channel that is broadly expressed in different human tissues, including the digestive system, where it acts as a molecular sensor and a transducer that regulates a variety of functional activities.

Among all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 14% were hospitalized, with 2% admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly across the world, with more than one hundred million confirmed cases and more than 2,500,000 dead. In March 2020, the Hospital of Valenciennes had to admit hundreds of COVID-19 patients, and its capacity was almost exceeded [2]. More recently, in France, thousands of critically ill patients had to be admitted to ICUs. In Europe, the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic could be more severe than the first one, and we already know that, in the case of increasing numbers of critically ill, some of them will die as a result of the unavailability of mechanical ventilators [3]. This shortage may be lessened if one ventilator could service more than one patient. The main worry is that this concept could be not useful and systematically deleterious for the patient. Some concepts have already been proposed to ventilate differently two circuits with a single ventilator, with several limitations like the lack of individualization of ventilation of each circuit [4-6]. More recently, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Clarke et al. [7] described a new concept able to deliver specific ventilation for two different lung tests with a single ventilator. Again, Levin et al.

A further 2-3 days validation with the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) and other partners to finalize the analysis was done. Three scenarios, with different combinations of vaccine products and delivery modalities, as well as time period were analyzed. The scenarios included AstraZeneca (40%), Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (30%), Moderna, Pfizer, and Sputnik V at 10% each; with full vaccination by second half of 2021 (Scenario 1); AstraZeneca (30%), J&J (40%), Moderna, Pfizer, and Sputnik V at 10% each with full vaccination by first half of 2022 (Scenario 2); and equal distribution (20%) among AstraZeneca, J&J, Moderna, Pfizer, and Sputnik V with full vaccination by second half of 2022 (Scenario 3). RESULTS: The estimated total cost of COVID-19 vaccination ranges between $348.7-$436.1 million for the target population of 17.5 million. These translate into per fully vaccinated person cost of $20.9 - $26.2 and per dose (including vaccine cost) of $10.5 - $13.1. Again, per fully vaccinated person excluding vaccine cost was $4.5 and $4.6, thus per dose excluding vaccine also ranged from $2.2 C $2.3. The main cost driver was vaccine doses, including shipping, which accounts for between 78% - 83% of total cost.

The challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially represent an overwhelmingly stressful event for patients with chronic diseases. Aim of our study was to investigate the levels of resilience in individuals with inflammatory arthritis living in Emilia Romagna, the third hardest-hit Italian region during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To this purpose, we developed a survey consisting of four different sections assessing demographic characteristics, the 14-item resilience scale (RS14) and questionnaires evaluating depression and anxiety. Consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis were recruited over a short time frame immediately after the end of national lockdown and compared with control individuals from the general population. One hundred twenty-two patients and 173 controls were included. Levels of resilience, as measured by RS14 score, were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory arthritis (82.6  14.0 vs 79.0  12.8, p = 0.018). After stratification for gender, the difference in RS14 score was maintained in women (p = 0.045), but not in men (p = 0.252). High resilience, defined as having a RS14 score > 90, was significantly more prevalent in patients than in controls (30% vs 16%, p = 0.009).

The current study aimed to explore risk perceptions and precautionary behavior in response to COVID-19. METHOD: Qualitative in-depth interviews by telephone were undertaken with 26 participants from three affected cities in an initial stage of the disease outbreak, from May 3 to June 5, 2020. The method of analyzing data was inductive. The results were analyzed using interpretation, categorizing, and thematic analysis. RESULTS: The perception of risk is influenced by numerous individual, community, and cultural factors; these perceptions act as triggers for precautionary behavior, with a tendency to deny risks or react with exaggeration in terms of the precautionary reactions related to COVID-19. The thematic analysis produced two major categories: 1) risk perception and 2) precautionary behavior. The analysis provides essential insight into risk perception and precautionary behavior. CONCLUSION: The risk perceptions and patterns of precautionary behavior could be unreliable, unhealthy, and culturally affected, which would influence the effectiveness of pandemic control measures.

An outbreak of COVID-19 has led to more than one million confirmed cases as of April 3rd, 2020. Understanding the early spread dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe COVID-19 spread with four datasets from within and outside of Wuhan, China; it is estimated how spread in Wuhan varied between January and February 2020. It is used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human spread to occur in locations outside Wuhan if disease holders were introduced. It is combined SEIR framework model with data on cases of COVID-19 in China and International cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how spread had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, it is calculated the probability that freshly introduced cases might produce outbreaks in other regions. Also, it is calculated approximately the median day by day basic reproduction number in Wuhan, refused from 245 (95% CI: 116-487) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23rd, 2020, to 1.05 (042-240) one week after.

Many associated pre-existing conditions and biomarkers have been reported, but these observational associations suffer from confounding and reverse causation. METHODS: Here, we perform a large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the causal roles of many traits in severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Our results highlight multiple body mass index (BMI)-related traits as risk-increasing: BMI (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.51C2.37), hip circumference (OR: 1.46, 1.15C1.85), and waist circumference (OR: 1.82, 1.36C2.43). Our multivariable MR analysis further suggests that the BMI-related effect might be driven by fat mass (OR: 1.63, 1.03C2.58), but not fat-free mass (OR: 1.00, 0.61C1.66). Several white blood cell counts are negatively associated with severe COVID-19, including those of neutrophils (OR: 0.76, 0.61C0.94), granulocytes (OR: 0.75, 0.601C0.93), and myeloid white blood cells (OR: 0.77, 0.62C0.96).

The Cep250 -/- mice presented with no major defects, apart from male infertility due to a reduction in the spermatogonial pool and the meiotic blockade. Spermatogonial stem cells expressing Zbtb16 were not affected, whereas the differentiating spermatogonia were vastly lost. These cells displayed abnormal ?3H2AX-staining, accompanied by an increase in the apoptotic rate. The few germ cells that survived at this stage, entered the meiotic prophase I and were arrested at a pachytene-like stage, likely due to synapsis defects and the unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks.

We review the broader literature on TNF to rationalize why abruptly-acquired neurodegenerative states do not exhibit the remorseless clinical progression seen in those states with gradual onsets. We propose that the three typically non-worsening neurodegenerative syndromes, post-stroke, post-traumatic brain injury (TBI), and post cardiac arrest, usually become and remain static because of excess cerebral TNF induced by the initial dramatic peak keeping microglia chronically activated through an autocrine loop of microglial activation through excess cerebral TNF. The existence of this autocrine loop rationalizes post-damage repair with perispinal etanercept and proposes a treatment for cerebral aspects of COVID-19 chronicity. Another insufficiently considered aspect of cerebral proinflammatory cytokines is the fitness of the endogenous cerebral anti-TNF system provided by norepinephrine (NE), generated and distributed throughout the brain from the locus coeruleus (LC). We propose that an intact LC, and therefore an intact NE-mediated endogenous anti-cerebral TNF system, plus the DAMP (damage or danger-associated molecular pattern) input having diminished, is what allows post-stroke, post-TBI, and post cardiac arrest patients a strong long-term survival advantage over Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease sufferers. In contrast, Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease patients remorselessly worsen, being handicapped by sustained, accumulating, DAMP and PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) input, as well as loss of the LC-origin, NE-mediated, endogenous anti-cerebral TNF system.

The aim of this study was to describe lymphocyte subsets in pediatric patients with mild/moderate or severe COVID-19. Methods: The subjects in the study were children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia confirmed with the real-time RT-PCR. The subjects were admitted to the Children's Medical Center, affiliated with the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, between March 7(th) and June 10(th) of 2020. The complete blood counts and lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed for each patient. Results: The study included 55 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (34 patients (62%) with an observed mild/moderate case of the disease and 21 patients (38%) with severedisease). Lymphocyte counts were found to be lower in patients with a severe case (mean  SD 1.6  0.9 in the severe group vs. 2.3  2.2 in the mild group). Compared to the group with mild/moderate pneumonia, children with severe pneumonia had an increased count of CD8(+) T cell and a lower percentage of CD4(+) T cell. However, the differences between the groups were negligible. Interestingly, the severe group had a lower CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio compared to the mild group (1.1  0.47 vs. 1.4  0.8, p-value: 0.063). CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio <2, 1.5, and 1 was found in 48 (87%), 40 (73%), and 19 cases (35%).

Transfer of these antibodies via colostrum caused Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) in calves, with a lethality rate of 90%. The exact immunological mechanisms behind the onset of BNP are not fully understood to date. To gain further insight into these mechanisms, we analyzed the immune proteome from alloreactive antibody producers (BNP cows) and non-responders. After in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood derived lymphocytes (PBL), we detected distinctly deviant expression levels of several master regulators of immune responses in BNP cells, pointing to a changed immune phenotype with severe dysregulation of immune response in BNP cows. Interestingly, we also found this response pattern in 22% of non-BVD-vaccinated cows, indicating a genetic predisposition of this immune deviant (ID) phenotype in cattle. We additionally analyzed the functional correlation of the ID phenotype with 10 health parameters and 6 diseases in a retrospective study over 38 months. The significantly increased prevalence of mastitis among ID cows emphasizes the clinical relevance of this deviant immune response and its potential impact on the ability to fight infections.","output":"A Functionally Different Immune Phenotype in Cattle Is Associated With Higher Mastitis Incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims To explore the current landscape of NHS primary dental care services for fee-exempt adult patients and observe attendance, band claiming and geographical patterns. Materials and methods Data were analysed from FP17 claims submitted to NHS Business Services Authority from 2006-2019. Results Fee-exempt adult patients in 2018-2019 account for 23.7% of all adult claims in NHS primary dental care. This percentage has decreased year-on-year since 2011-2012 from 31.5%. In 2018-2019, there were significantly fewer band 1 claims for fee-exempt adult patients (36.0%) compared to their fee-paying counterparts (58.3%). Treatment needs appear to be higher for fee-exempt adult patients since more band 2 and 3 treatment claims were completed (49.0%) compared to fee-payers (30.8%). Band 3 claims were three times higher for fee-exempt adult patients. Discussion Adults with fee exemptions must be able to access timely oral health services since they appear to have higher treatment needs than fee-payers. The areas with the highest proportion of fee-exempt adult patients reflect relative levels of deprivation across regions in England. Barriers to access must be reduced to fully engage all groups of patients and improve oral health.

Stem cell therapies hold great promise for the cure of neurological disorders, as stem cells can serve as cell replacement, while also secreting factors to enhance endogenous tissue regeneration. Adult human multipotent stem cells (MSCs) reside on blood vessels, and therefore can be found in many tissues throughout the body, including palatine tonsils. Several studies have reported the capacity of MSCs to differentiate into, among other cell types, the neuronal lineage. However, unlike the case with embryonic stem cells, it is unclear whether MSCs can develop into mature neurons. METHODS: Human tonsillar MSCs (T-MSCs) were isolated from a small, 0.6-g sample, of tonsillar biopsies with high viability and yield as we recently reported. Then, these cells were differentiated by a rapid, multi-stage procedure, into committed, post-mitotic, neuron-like cells using defined conditions. RESULTS: Here we describe for the first time the derivation and differentiation of tonsillar biopsy-derived MSCs (T-MSCs), by a rapid, multi-step protocol, into post-mitotic, neuron-like cells using defined conditions without genetic manipulation. We characterized our T-MSC-derived neuronal cells and demonstrate their robust differentiation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our procedure leads to a rapid neuronal lineage commitment and loss of stemness markers, as early as three days following neurogenic differentiation. Our studies identify biopsy-derived T-MSCs as a potential source for generating neuron-like cells which may have potential use for in vitro modeling of neurodegenerative diseases or cell replacement therapies.","output":"Direct differentiation of tonsillar biopsy-derived stem cells to the neuronal lineage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined individual-level determinants of self-reported changes in healthy (diet and physical activity) and addictive (alcohol use, smoking, and vaping) lifestyle behaviors during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period in the USA. A national online survey was administered between May and June 2020 that targeted a representative U.S. sample and yielded data from 1276 respondents, including 58% male and 50% racial/ethnic minorities. We used univariate and multivariable linear regression models to examine the associations of sociodemographic, mental health, and behavioral determinants with self-reported changes in lifestyle behaviors. Some study participants reported increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors since the pandemic (i.e., 36% increased healthy eating behaviors, and 33% increased physical activity). However, they also reported increases in addictive lifestyle behaviors including alcohol use (40%), tobacco use (41%), and vaping (46%). With regard to individual-level determinants, individuals who reported adhering to social distancing guidelines were also more likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors ( = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.21). Conversely, women ( = ?0.37, 95% CI ?0.62 to ?0.12), and unemployed individuals ( = ?0.33, 95% CI ?0.64 to ?0.02) were less likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors. In addition, individuals reporting anxiety were more likely to report increases in addictive behaviors ( = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.43).

RSV) is a common winter disease predominantly affecting children under one year of age. It is a common reason for presentations to an emergency department (ED) and frequently results in hospital admission, contributing to paediatric units approaching or exceeding capacity each winter. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the circulation of RSV was dramatically reduced in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Evidence from the Southern Hemisphere and other European countries suggests that as social distancing restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 are relaxed, RSV infection returns, causing delayed or even summer epidemics, with different age distributions. Study question: The ability to track, anticipate and respond to a surge in RSV cases is critical for planning acute care delivery. There is an urgent need to understand the onset of RSV spread at the earliest opportunity. This will influence service planning, to inform clinicians whether the population at risk is a wider age range than normal, and whether there are changes in disease severity. This information is also needed to inform decision on the timing of passive immunisation of children at higher risk of hospitalisation, intensive care admission or death with RSV infection, which is a public health priority. Methods and likely impact: This multi-centre prospective observational cohort study will use a well-established research network (Paediatric Emergency Research in the UK and Ireland, PERUKI) to report in real time cases of RSV infection in children aged under two years, through the collection of essential, but non-identifying patient information. Forty-five centres will gather initial data on age, index of multiple deprivation quintile, clinical features on presentation, and co-morbidities.

Reports of unrecognized anosmia in COVID-19 patients suggests that self-reported measures are insufficient for capturing patients with chemosensory dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to quantify the impact of recent COVID-19 infection on chemosensory function and demonstrate the use of at-home objective smell and taste testing in an at-risk population of healthcare workers. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty healthcare workers were screened for possible loss of smell and taste using online surveys. Self-administered smell and taste tests were mailed to respondents meeting criteria for elevated risk of infection, and one-month follow-up surveys were completed. RESULTS: Among subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% reported symptoms of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction. Self-reported smell and taste loss were both strong predictors of COVID-19 positivity. Subjects with evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (<45 days) had significantly lower olfactory scores but equivalent gustatory scores compared to other subjects. There was a time-dependent increase in smell scores but not in taste scores among subjects with prior infection and chemosensory symptoms. The overall infection rate was 4.4%, with 2.5% reported by PCR swab. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection had reduced olfaction and normal gustation on self-administered objective testing compared to those without infection. Rates of infection and chemosensory symptoms in our cohort of healthcare workers reflect those of the general public.","output":"Objective screening for olfactory and gustatory dysfunction during the COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective study in healthcare workers using self-administered testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is bringing an unprecedented health crisis to the world. To date, our understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host innate immunity is still limited. Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 12 (NSP12) was able to suppress interferon-? (IFN-?) activation in IFN-? promoter luciferase reporter assays, which provided insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this study, we demonstrated that IFN-? promoter mediated luciferase activity was reduced during co-expression of NSP12. However, we could show NSP12 did not affect IRF3 or NF-&#954;B activation. Moreover, IFN-? production induced by Sendai virus (SeV) infection or other stimulus was not affected by NSP12 at mRNA or protein level. Additionally, type I IFN signaling pathway was not affected by NSP12, as demonstrated by the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Further experiments revealed that different experiment systems, including protein tags and plasmid backbones, could affect the readouts of IFN-? promoter luciferase assays. In conclusion, unlike previously reported, our study showed SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 protein is not an IFN-? antagonist. It also rings the alarm on the general usage of luciferase reporter assays in studying SARS-CoV-2. Importance Previous studies investigated the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and interferon signaling, and proposed that several SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, including NSP12, could suppress IFN-? activation. However, most of these results were generated from IFN-? promoter luciferase reporter assay, and have not been validated functionally. In our study, we found that although NSP12 could suppress IFN-? promoter luciferase activity, it showed no inhibitory effect on IFN-? production or it downstream signaling. Further study revealed that contradictory results could generated from different experiment systems. On one hand, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 could not suppress IFN-? signaling. On the other hand, our study suggests that cautions need to be taken with the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 related luciferase assays.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 protein is not an IFN-? antagonist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the highly polymorphic nature of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules, it is not surprising that they function as key regulators of the host immune response to almost all invading pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent responsible for the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

Women frequently access digital information throughout their pregnancy. However, health care providers and women have little information to guide them toward potentially helpful or effective apps. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to evaluate a methodology for systematically searching and reviewing commercially available apps that support pregnant women with symptoms of anxiety in order to assist maternity care professionals in identifying resources that they could recommend for these women. METHODS: A stepwise systematic approach was used to identify, select, describe, and assess the most popular and highly user-rated apps available in the United Kingdom from January to March 2021. This included developing a script-based search strategy and search process, writing evaluation criteria, and conducting a narrative description and evaluation of the selected apps. RESULTS: Useful search terms were identified, which included nonclinical, aspirational, and problem-based phrases. There were 39 apps selected for inclusion in the review. No apps specifically targeted women with anxiety in pregnancy. Of the 39 apps included in the review, 33 (85%) focused solely on mind-body techniques to promote relaxation, stress reduction, and psychological well-being. Only 8 of the 39 (21%) apps included in the review reported that health care professionals had contributed to app development and only 1/39 (3%) provided empirical evidence on the effectiveness and acceptability of the app. The top 12/39 (31%) apps were evaluated by 2 independent reviewers using the developed criteria and scores. There was a small negative correlation between the reviewers scores and app user rating scores, with higher user rating scores associated with lower reviewer scores. CONCLUSIONS: App developers, publishers, and maternity care professionals should seek advice from women with lived experience of anxiety symptoms in pregnancy to locate, promote, and optimize the visibility of apps for pregnant women. There is a lack of resources that provide coping strategies based on current evidence for the treatment of anxiety in pregnancy. Maternity care providers are limited in their ability to locate and recommend acceptable and trustworthy apps because of the lack of information on the evidence base, development, and testing of apps. Maternity care professionals and women need access to libraries of trusted apps that have been evaluated against relevant and established criteria.","output":"Review of Mobile Apps for Women With Anxiety in Pregnancy: Maternity Care Professionals Guide to Locating and Assessing Anxiety Apps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this research is to explore the spread dynamics of a novel coronavirus outbreak, or 2019-nCOV via a fractional approach of type fractal-fractional (FF) derivative.

Some of the variants are still under investigation, while some have become a reason of grave concern. One such variant is B.1.617.2, known as the Delta variant, which was first detected in India. A comprehensive analysis and comparison of this particular variant have been done to the original Wuhan strain, and the possible reasons behind rapid mutation have also been discussed. A comprehensive literature search was done to summarize the information on the variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the reasons behind their mutation, with a significant focus on the B.1.617.2 variant. Data were collected from various online sources such as PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Worldometer, WHO, CDC, and GISAID. In addition, 3D structures of spike proteins were obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB). The data shows that the spike protein of the B.1.617.2 strain is highly mutated and has accumulated eight amino acid changes. Besides spike protein, changes in non-structural proteins (nsP2, nsP3, nsP4, nsP12, and nsP15), other structural proteins (nucleocapsid and membrane protein), and accessory proteins (ns3, ns7a) have been observed as well. Furthermore, in almost all the variants of SARS-CoV-2, D614G mutation occurs, suggesting its role in increased infectivity and transmission. New variants are continuously emerging on which we have no control. Spike mutations are more favored and essential in the evolution of new variants because it increases the transmissibility and infectivity of the virus. Therefore, to maximally protect public health, knowledge of different variants is essential.

This research examined the feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of delivering a 6-week yoga-based meditation intervention to clinical teams of hospice professionals (HPs) at a large non-profit hospice organization. The intervention was designed to increase mind-body integration and combat burnout. This article was written for different audiences, including research scientists who study interoception, burnout, meditation, or yoga, designers of meditation interventions, and hospice organizations looking for ways to mitigate HP burnout. (2) Methods. The intervention was launched within clinical teams, beginning with a half-hour online introduction to the program and exposure to the week 1 meditation at each team's monthly all-staff meeting. Throughout the program, HPs could access the meditations on their own via their workplace computers, tablets, and smartphones. Online pre- and post-intervention surveys were submitted by 151 HPs, 76 of whom were exposed to the intervention and completed both surveys. The surveys assessed burnout using the Professional Fulfillment Index and mind-body integration using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness scales. (3) Results. Two-thirds of HPs who were present at a staff meeting where the program was introduced went on to do a meditation on their own at least once. Half of HPs expressed a desire to continue with access to the meditations after the 6-week program ended. Due to COVID-19 work from home restrictions, three-fourth of HPs did a meditation at home, 29% in a car between patient visits (not while driving), and 23% at the office. Higher interoceptive awareness was significantly related to lower burnout, particularly lower work exhaustion. Meditation frequency was significantly related to higher interoceptive awareness but not to burnout. Interpersonal disengagement was rare and temporary. (4) Conclusions. Findings showed that the yoga-based meditation intervention was feasible and acceptable and associated with higher interoceptive awareness.

International UN- and WHO-led efforts, such as COVAX, have provided SARS-CoV-2 vaccines but half of African countries have less than 2% vaccinated in their population, and only 15 have reached 10% by October 2021, further disadvantaging local economic recovery. Key for this implementation and preventing further mutation and spread is the frequency of voluntary [asymptomatic] testing. It is limited by expensive PCR and LAMP tests, uncomfortable probes deep in the throat or nose, and the availability of hardware to administer in remote locations. There is an urgent need for an inexpensive end-to-end system to deliver sensitive and reliable, non-invasive tests in resource-poor and field-test conditions. We introduce a non-invasive saliva-based LAMP colorimetric test kit and a $51 lab-in-a-backpack system that detects as few as 4 viral RNA copies per L. It consists of eight chemicals, a thermometer, a thermos bottle, two micropipettes and a 1000C4000 rcf electronically operated centrifuge made from recycled computer hard drives (CentriDrive). The centrifuge includes a 3D-printed rotor and a 12 V rechargeable Li-ion battery, and its 12 V standard also allows wiring directly to automobile batteries, to enable field-use of this and other tests in low infrastructure settings. The test takes 90 minutes to process 6 samples and has reagent costs of $3.5 per sample. The non-invasive nature of saliva testing would allow higher penetration of testing and wider adoption of the test across cultures and settings (including refugee camps and disaster zones). The attached graphical procedure would make the test suitable for self-testing at home, performing it in the field, or in mobile testing centers by minimally trained staff.","output":"End-to-end system for rapid and sensitive early-detection of SARS-CoV-2 for resource-poor and field-test environments using a $51 lab-in-a-backpack"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Ausgabe 1/2020 der ZPTh hat Frank Nullmeier umfangreiche Beobachtungen zur Covid 19-Pandemie und daran anknpfende politisch-theoretische berlegungen fr den Umgang mit ihr angestellt.

Regarding freedom, the text challenges the interpretation of uncertainty as lack of freedom. Furthermore, it shows that the suggested alternative, social freedom, has unexpected ethical consequences. If eliminating uncertainty is the goal, the distinction between positive and negative ethical duties can no longer be observed.

We sought to identify the effects of this unprecedented change by examining the psychological well-being, changes to normal routines, and return-to-play considerations of current student-athletes in order to guide support for both current and future student-athletes who may face similar situations. METHODS: We utilized a phenomenological approach to interview a purposeful sample of eighteen collegiate student-athletes (7 males, 11 females; mean age = 20 years) from across the United States. The participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol, which was audio recorded and transcribed verbatim using Zoom. The data were then analyzed and coded by a 3-person team via the consensual qualitative research tradition. RESULTS: Four domains emerged after data analysis: 1) ambiguity, 2) perspective, 3) bonding and cohesion, and 4) resource utilization. Participants discussed ambiguity in terms of eligibility and participation questions, academic changes, and varying COVID-19 policies. Participants shared a wide range of perspectives, from apprehension at the onset of the pandemic, to excitement when returning to campus and competition. They shared how bonding and team development were affected due to a lack of socialization and that support system dynamics between family, coaches, and teammates were strengthened. When describing resource utilization, participants discussed the use of personnel and supplies to help them adjust to changes in facility and space availability. The identification and utilization of resources enabled them to establish a new normal for their academics, workouts, and hobbies during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Collegiate student-athletes realized the seriousness of the pandemic and utilized their resources and support systems to adjust their routines and keep a positive attitude during COVID-19. At the same time, some student-athletes struggled with these changes.

Small island developing states (SIDS) have limited absolute resources for responding to national disasters, including health emergencies. Since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Caribbean on 1st March 2020, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been widely used to control the resulting COVID-19 outbreak. We document the variety of government measures introduced across the Caribbean and explore their impact on aspects of outbreak control. Methods. Drawing on publically available information, we present confirmed cases and confirmed deaths to describe the extent of the Caribbean outbreak. We document the range of outbreak containment measures implemented by national Governments, focussing on measures to control movement and gatherings. We explore the temporal association of containment measures with the start of the outbreak in each country, and with aggregated information on human movement, using smartphone positioning data. We include a set of comparator countries to provide an international context. Results. As of 25th May, the Caribbean reported 18,755 confirmed cases and 631 deaths. There have been broad similarities but also variation in the number, the type, the intensity, and particularly the timing of the NPIs introduced across the Caribbean. On average, Caribbean governments began controlling movement into countries 27 days before their first confirmed case and 23 days before comparator countries. Controls on movement within country were introduced 9 days after the first case and 36 days before comparators. Controls on gatherings were implemented 1 day before the first confirmed case and 30 days before comparators. Confirmed case growth rates and numbers of deaths have remained low across much the Caribbean. Stringent Caribbean curfews and stay-at-home orders coincided with large reductions in community mobility, regularly above 60%, and higher than most international comparator countries. Conclusion. Stringent controls to limit movement, and specifically the early timing of those controls has had an important impact on containing the spread of COVID-19 across much of the Caribbean. Very early controls to limit movement into countries may well be particularly effective for small island developing states. With much of the region economically reliant on international tourism, and with steps to open borders now being considered, it is critical that the region draws on a solid evidence-base to balance the competing demands of economics and public health.","output":"COVID-19 containment in the Caribbean: the experience of Small Island Developing States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, spreads swiftly in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, leading to a high degree of lethality.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to analyze COVID-19 epidemiology among healthcare staff based in the Seville healthcare district (Spain) and evaluate its role in outbreaks in nursing homes. METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive study of 88 assisted living facilities located in the city of Seville from March 1 to May 23, 2020. Data were obtained via epidemiological surveys on staff at centers where there were outbreaks (n=732 in 14 nursing homes). The cumulative incidence (CI), epidemic curves, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and delays in isolation and notification of cases were calculated. For the statistical analysis, measures of central tendency and dispersion were used as well as confidence intervals and statistical hypothesis tests. RESULTS: There were 124 cases in staff members (CI 16.9%), 78.6% of which were in women. The majority presented with mild symptoms (87.1%). The most common symptoms were fever (50%) and cough (32.3%). The median number of days from onset of symptoms to isolation was three.

Since the axes represent distinct dimensions, i.e. frequency and time, we argue that a better approach is to separate the attention dedicated to each axis. To this end, we propose the Separable Transformer (SepTr), an architecture that employs two transformer blocks in a sequential manner, the first attending to tokens within the same frequency bin, and the second attending to tokens within the same time interval. We conduct experiments on three benchmark data sets, showing that our separable architecture outperforms conventional vision transformers and other state-of-the-art methods.

Some of these are generic for the diagnostic accuracy paradigm, whereas others are more specific for tests for viruses.

Furthermore, mutations near the 5' end of the pseudoknot can increase frameshifting by nearly 300%, possibly by modifying ribosomal contacts.

Data Extraction and Synthesis Data screening and extraction were performed independently by 2 reviewers based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. Random-effects models with the inverse variance method were used for pooled analyses. The presence of potential heterogeneity was evaluated with the I2 index. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was cognitive decline. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cerebrovascular events, serious adverse events, and all-cause mortality. Results From 7755 citations, we identified 16 publications from 5 trials with 17 396 participants (mean age, 65.7 years [range, 63.0-80.5 years]; 10 562 [60.5%] men) and 2 additional ongoing trials. All 5 concluded trials included in quantitative analyses were considered at unclear to high risk of bias. The mean follow-up duration was 3.3 years (range, 2.0 to 4.7 years). Intensive BP reduction was not significantly associated with global cognitive performance (standardized mean difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.06; I2 = 0%; 4 trials; 5246 patients), incidence of dementia (risk ratio [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.32 to 3.67; I2 = 27%; 2 trials; 9444 patients) or incidence of MCI (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.14; I2 = 74%; 2 trials; 10 774 patients) when compared with standard treatment. However, a reduction of cerebrovascular events in the intensive group was found (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.93; I2 = 0%; 5 trials; 17 396 patients) without an increased risk of serious adverse events or mortality. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, there was no significant association between BP reduction and lower risk of cognitive decline, dementia, or MCI. The certainty of this evidence was rated low because of the limited sample size, the risk of bias of included trials, and the observed statistical heterogeneity. Therefore, current available evidence does not justify the use of lower BP targets for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia.","output":"Evaluation of Intensive vs Standard Blood Pressure Reduction and Association With Cognitive Decline and Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: SARS CoV19 infection can predispose to many autoimmune and neurological conditions, thymomatous myasthenia gravis being one of them.

A methodology for testing the attainability of concordance signatures using linear optimization and convex analysis is provided.

Neuroendocrine tumour (NET) services are delivered in a highly specialised setting, typically delivered in a small number of centres that fulfil specific criteria as defined by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS). We aimed to address the COVID-19-related impact on specialist NET tumour services in England and other countries. METHODS: Electronic survey addressing patient access and delivery of care distributed to all ENETS Centres of Excellence (CoE) in England and matching number of ENETS CoE elsewhere. Semi-quantitative and qualitative analyses of survey responses were performed. RESULTS: Survey response of ENETS CoE in England was 55% (6/11). Responses from six non-UK ENETS CoE elsewhere were received and analysed in a similar manner. Relevant disruption of various NET services was noted across all responding Centres, which included delayed patient appointments and investigations, reduced availability of treatment modalities including delayed surgical treatment and a major negative impact on research activities. The comparison between English and non-UK ENETS CoE suggested that the former had significantly greater concerns related to future research funding (p = 0.014), whilst having less disruption to multidisciplinary meetings (p = 0.01). A trend was also noted towards virtual patient appointments in ENETS CoE in England vs. elsewhere (p = 0.092).

Multiple pathways of RNA decay work together to establish and maintain heterochromatin in fission yeast, including a recently identified role for a conserved RNA-degradation complex known as the rixosome or RIX1 complex4-6. Whether RNA degradation also has a role in the stability of mammalian heterochromatin remains unknown. Here we show that the rixosome contributes to silencing of many Polycomb targets in human cells. The rixosome associates with human PRC complexes and is enriched at promoters of Polycomb target genes. Depletion of either the rixosome or Polycomb results in accumulation of paused and elongating RNA polymerase at Polycomb target genes. We identify point mutations in the RING1B subunit of PRC1 that disrupt the interaction between PRC1 and the rixosome and result in diminished silencing, suggesting that direct recruitment of the rixosome to chromatin is required for silencing. Finally, we show that the RNA endonuclease and kinase activities of the rixosome and the downstream XRN2 exoribonuclease, which degrades RNAs with 5' monophosphate groups generated by the rixosome, are required for silencing. Our findings suggest that rixosomal degradation of nascent RNA is conserved from fission yeast to human, with a primary role in RNA degradation at facultative heterochromatin in human cells.","output":"Rixosomal RNA degradation contributes to silencing of Polycomb target genes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In this study, we examined the validity and reliability of the Compassion Competence Scale (CCS) by adapting it to Turkish.

Objective: This study aims to examine the associations between family care, economic stress, and depressive symptoms among Chinese adults in urban and rural areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Based on cross-sectional data collected through online surveys from February 1st to 10th 2020 in China the present study recruited 2,858 adults. It used multiple linear regression to examine the association between family care and depressive symptoms, while economic stress was examined as moderators on the above relationship. Results: The results showed that caring for both the elderly and children was significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms compared with non-caregivers (B = 2.584, 95%CI: 1.254, 3.915), and a similar result was also found in urban areas. Also, caring for the elderly only was also had a higher level of depressive symptoms than non-caregivers in rural areas (B = 3.135, 95%CI: 0.745, 5.525). Meeting the care needs was significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms compared with unmet care needs, while for rural caregivers, the results were not significant. Besides, economic stress strengthened the effect of family care needs on depressive symptoms for sandwich-generation caregivers who provide care to both the elderly and children (B = 0.605, 95%CI: 0.077, 1.134). While in rural areas, the moderation effects of economic stress were only found for elderly caregivers (B = 1.106, 95%CI: 0.178, 2.035). Conclusion: These findings suggest that we should pay more attention to the family caregiver's mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.

It is hard to predict which patients with a bacterial infection will develop sepsis, and accurate and timely diagnosis as well as assessment of prognosis is difficult. Aside from antibiotics-based treatment of the causative infection and supportive measures, treatment options have remained limited. Better understanding of the immuno-pathophysiology of sepsis is expected to lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. Functional activity of the innate (inflammatory) and adaptive immune response is controlled by a dedicated set of cellular signal transduction pathways, that are active in the various immune cell types. To develop an immune response-based diagnostic assay for sepsis and provide novel therapeutic targets, signal transduction pathway activities have been analyzed in whole blood samples from patients with sepsis. Methods: A validated and previously published set of signal transduction pathway (STP) assays, enabling determination of immune cell function, was used to analyze public Affymetrix expression microarray data from clinical studies containing data from pediatric and adult patients with sepsis. STP assays enable quantitative measurement of STP activity on individual patient sample data, and were used to calculate activity of androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER), JAK-STAT1/2, JAK-STAT3, Notch, Hedgehog, TGF, FOXO-PI3K, MAPK-AP1, and NFB signal transduction pathways. Results: Activity of AR and TGF pathways was increased in children and adults with sepsis. Using the mean plus two standard deviations of normal pathway activity (in healthy individuals) as threshold for abnormal STP activity, diagnostic assay parameters were determined. For diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, the AR pathway assay showed high sensitivity (77%) and specificity (97%), with a positive prediction value (PPV) of 99% and negative prediction value (NPV) of 50%. For prediction of favorable prognosis (survival), PPV was 95%, NPV was 21%. The TGF pathway activity assay performed slightly less for diagnosing sepsis, with a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 98% (PPV 99%, NPV 39%). Conclusion: The AR and TGF pathways have an immunosuppressive role, suggesting a causal relation between increased pathway activity and sepsis immunopathology. STP assays have been converted to qPCR assays for further evaluation of clinical utility for sepsis diagnosis and prediction of prognosis, as well as for prediction of risk at developing sepsis in patients with a bacterial infection. STPs may present novel therapeutic targets in sepsis.","output":"Androgen Receptor Pathway Activity Assay for Sepsis Diagnosis and Prediction of Favorable Prognosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Midlife Black women suffer disproportionately from heart disease and stroke in comparison to White women of similar age and demographic.

Near perfect complementarity between a target RNA and the Cas13-associated guide RNA is required for activation of Cas13 ribonuclease activity. Nonetheless, the specificity of Cas13 effectors in eukaryotic cells has been debated as the Cas13 nuclease domains can be exposed on the enzyme surface, providing the potential for promiscuous cleavage of nearby RNAs (so-called collateral damage). Here, using co-transfection assays in Drosophila and human cells, we found that the off-target effects of RxCas13d, a commonly used Cas13 effector, can be as strong as the level of on-target RNA knockdown. The extent of off-target effects is positively correlated with target RNA expression levels, and collateral damage can be observed even after reducing RxCas13d/guide RNA levels. The PspCas13b effector showed improved specificity and, unlike RxCas13d, can be used to deplete a Drosophila circular RNA without affecting the expression of the associated linear RNA. PspCas13b nonetheless still can have off-target effects and we notably found that the extent of off-target effects for Cas13 effectors differs depending on the cell type and target RNA examined.

This study, for the first time, estimated the gross disbursement of Japans DAH from 2012 to 2016 and clarified its flows, including source, aid type, channel, target region, and target health focus area. METHODS: Data on Japan Tracker, the first data platform of Japans DAH, were used. The DAH definition was based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments (OECD) sector classification. Regarding core funding to non-health-specific multilateral agencies, we estimated DAH and its flows based on the OECD methodology for calculating imputed multilateral official development assistance (ODA). RESULTS: Japans DAH was estimated at 1472.94 (2012), 823.15 (2013), 832.06 (2014), 701.98 (2015), and 894.57 million USD (2016) in constant prices of 2016.

One of the main research interests in the study of the spontaneous motor tempo relates to factors affecting its pace.

This study aimed at investigating these effects in participants everyday life by measuring their SMT four times a day over seven consecutive days, using an experience sampling method. The pace of the SMT was assessed with a finger-tapping paradigm in a self-developed web application. Measured as the inter-tap interval, the overall mean SMT was 650 ms (SD = 253 ms). Using multi-level modelling (MLM), results show that the pace of the SMT sped up over the course of the day, and that this effect depended on the participants chronotype, since participants tending towards morning type were faster in the morning compared to participants tending towards evening type. During the day, the pace of the SMT of morning types stayed relatively constant, whereas it became faster for evening-type participants. Furthermore, higher arousal in participants led to a faster pace of the SMT. Musical sophistication did not influence the SMT. These results indicate that the circadian rhythm influences the internal tempo, since the pace of SMT is not only dependent on the time of the day, but also on the individual entrainment to the 24-h cycle (chronotype).

Households having a higher estimated monthly income, AOR = 1.5 (1.23, 3.47), older age greater than 45 years, AOR = 1.69 (1.08, 2.64), fetching water twice a day, AOR = 2.8 (1.21, 9.17), weekly washing of the water storage container, AOR = 0.3 (0.11, 0.83), and using the dipping technique to draw water from the collection jar, AOR = 1.67 (1.14, 2.42) were significant factors in the practice of household water treatment in the study. CONCLUSIONS: The household water treatment practice was low. Higher estimated monthly income, older household heads, fetching water twice per day, washing the water storage container weekly, and dipping techniques to draw water from water storage containers were significant factors of household water treatment practices. Thus, proper hygiene of water storage, and engaging the community in income-generating activities were recommended.","output":"Household Water Treatment Practice and Associated Factors in Rural Households of Sodo Zuria District, Southern Ethiopia: Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider a retail firm selling a durable product in a volatile market where the demand is price-sensitive and random but its distribution is unknown. The firm dynamically replenishes inventory and adjusts prices over time and learns about the demand distribution. Assuming that the demand model is of the multiplicative form and unmet demand is partially backlogged, we take the empirical Bayesian approach to formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program. We first identify a set of regularity conditions on demand models and show that the state-dependent base-stock list-price policy is optimal. We next employ the dimensionality reduction approach to separate the scale factor that captures observed demand information from the optimal profit function, which yields a normalized dynamic program that is more tractable. We also analyze the effect of demand learning on the optimal policy using the system without Bayesian update as a benchmark. We further extend our analysis to the case with unobserved lost sales and the case with additive demand.","output":"Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management with Demand Learning: A Bayesian Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus, remains a largely unsolved mystery for researchers around the world as its global onslaught upon mankind continues unabated. To make matters worse, an upcoming and alarming trend that is increasingly being noticed as a post-COVID sequel is that of pulmonary fibrosis. Given the scale of the pandemic, the magnitude of this problem is likely to be high. Extrapolated conclusions from previous studies discussing the beneficial role of antifibrotics in progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases provide some hope that these medicines might have a potentially useful role in COVID-19 related lung fibrosis as well. Increased serum levels of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators in COVID-19 patients, similar cytokine profiles in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19, and broad anti-fibrotic activity of approved antifibrotics irrespective of the underlying etiology, are some of the proposed mechanisms favoring the argument. However, no studies currently support or refute the use of antifibrotics in patients developing post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. In view of such uncertainties, it is critically important for lung fibrosis networks to conduct well-designed prospective clinical trials addressing this issue to find conclusive answers.","output":"Antifibrotics for COVID-19 related lung fibrosis: Agents with benefits?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prior to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), telemental health to support mental health services was primarily designed for individuals with professional clinical degrees, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, registered nurses, and licensed clinical social workers. For the first the time in history, peer support specialists are offering Medicaid-reimbursable telemental health services during the COVID-19 crisis; however, little effort has been made to train peer support specialists on telehealth practice and delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists capacity to use digital peer support technology. METHODS: The Digital Peer Support Certification was co-produced with peer support specialists and included an education and simulation training session, synchronous and asynchronous support services, and audit and feedback. Participants included 9 certified peer support specialists between the ages of 25 and 54 years (mean 39 years) who were employed as peer support specialists for 1 to 11 years (mean 4.25 years) and had access to a work-funded smartphone device and data plan. A pre-post design was implemented to examine the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists capacity to use technology over a 3-month timeframe. Data were collected at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. RESULTS: Overall, an upward trend in peer support specialists capacity to offer digital peer support occurred during the 3-month certification period. CONCLUSIONS: The Digital Peer Support Certification shows promising evidence of increasing the capacity of peer support specialists to use specific digital peer support technology features. Our findings also highlighted that this capacity was less likely to increase with training alone and that a combinational knowledge translation approach that includes both training and management will be more successful.","output":"Strategies to Increase Peer Support Specialists Capacity to Use Digital Technology in the Era of COVID-19: Pre-Post Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a great deal of anxiety for many individuals.

However, uptake of the vaccine has been slow in the Centre region as opposed to other regions in the country. We therefore sought to describe vaccinators' perception of HPV vaccination in Saa health district. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire with both open-ended and closed questions was used to assess the perception of HPV vaccination among 24 vaccinators from the Saa health district. Quantitative data were summarised as proportions while qualitative data were deductively and inductively coded and thematically analysed. Results: Most vaccinators (75%, n = 18) had a good knowledge about cervical cancer and HPV vaccination. Fourteen (58.3%, n = 14) vaccinators correctly reported the target group, number and spacing of doses for the HPV vaccine. Fourteen (58.3%) vaccinators favoured HPV vaccination while the others (n = 10) were sceptical. Sceptics felt manufacturers hadn't given enough proof of the safety of the vaccine and lacked confidence in government's assessment of the epidemiological situation. The COVID 19 pandemic, fear of infertility and the negative influence of social media were perceived as the main reasons for community hesitancy. Vaccinators criticised health authorities for failing to sensitise the population about the HPV vaccine before its introduction. Conclusion: Vaccinators' perceptions of HPV vaccination may influence the offer of HPV vaccination services.

Internet hospitals have emerged as a critical technology to bring epidemic-related web-based services and medical support to the public. However, only a few very recent scientific literature reports have explored the effects of internet hospitals on psychological burden and disease knowledge in major public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the role of internet hospitals in relieving psychological burden and increasing disease knowledge during the early outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted from January 26 to February 1, 2020, during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The platform used for the consultation was the WeChat public account of our hospital. To participate in the study, the patient was required to answer a list of questions to exclude the possibility of COVID-19 infection and confirm their willingness to participate voluntarily. Next, the participant was directed to complete the self-report questionnaire. After the internet consultation, the participant was directed to complete the self-report questionnaire again. The questionnaire included sections on general information, the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and the participants worries, disease knowledge, and need for hospital treatment. RESULTS: The total number of internet consultations was 4120. The consultation topics mainly included respiratory symptoms such as cough, expectoration, and fever (2489/4120, 60.4%) and disease knowledge, anxiety, and fear (1023/4120, 24.8%). A total of 1530 people filled out the questionnaires before and after the internet consultation. Of these people, 1398/1530 (91.4%) experienced psychological stress before the internet consultation, which significantly decreased after consultation (260/1530, 17.0%) ((2)(1)=1704.8, P<.001). There was no significant difference in the number of people who expressed concern about the COVID-19 pandemic before and after the internet consultation ((2)(1)=0.7, P=.43). However, the degree of concern after the internet consultation was significantly alleviated (t(2699)=90.638, P<.001). The main worries before and after consultation were the dangers posed by the disease and the risk of infection of family members. The scores of the self-assessment risk after the internet consultation were significantly lower than those before consultation (t(3058)=95.694, P<.001). After the consultation, the participants knowledge of the symptoms, transmission routes, and preventive measures of COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the consultation (t(3058)=C106.105, C80.456, and C152.605, respectively; all P<.001). The hospital treatment need score after the internet consultation decreased from 3.3 (SD 1.2) to 1.6 (SD 0.8), and the difference was statistically significant (t(3058)=45.765, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the early outbreak of COVID-19, internet hospitals could help relieve psychological burdens and increase disease awareness through timely and rapid spread of knowledge regarding COVID-19 prevention and control.

Nevertheless, detrimental aspects of the lockdown for older people are a reduction in physical activity and limited access to physiotherapy, which are likely to have a negative impact on the health status. This study examined the feasibility of video-based physiotherapy (VT) and the subjective rating of VT by patients and therapists. METHODS: From April to June 2020, 4 facilities with 9 patients (6 women, 64-82 years old) participated in the study and were provided with technical equipment. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted in eight patients to assess physical activity, functional ability and participation before and during the restrictions. Both patients and therapists were asked about their subjective experiences with VT. RESULTS: A total of 92 VT sessions took place. Performance of the exercises and comprehension of instructions were rated as good to very good. The level of acceptance was high. Of the patients four described a perceived reduction in their physical activities due to the public restrictions; however, in the questionnaires no substantial differences in participation and physical activity were found. DISCUSSION: The use of VT is feasible in older patients. Only minor technical support is needed. In pandemic situations or in other contexts VT appears to be a promising supplement or alternative to normal physiotherapy. Further studies are needed to identify suitable patient groups, to prove efficacy and to develop further content-related aspects of VT.","output":"[Feasibility and acceptance of video-based physiotherapy : New medical care provision for older people during the COVID-19 pandemic]./ Machbarkeit und Akzeptanz videobasierter Physiotherapie : Neues Versorgungsangebot fr ?ltere Menschen w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article offers theoretical reflections on the study of religion and the Internet by critically discussing the notion of digital religion (Campbell 2012).

However, there is a lack of in-depth characterization of the structural and functional impacts of the SNPs located at the TP63 gene. The current study was designed for the comprehensive characterization of the coding and non-coding SNPs in the human TP63 gene for their functional and structural significance. The functional and structural effects of the SNPs were investigated using a wide variety of computational tools and approaches, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The deleterious impact of eight nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) affecting protein stability, structure, and functions was measured by using 13 bioinformatics tools. These eight nsSNPs are in highly conserved positions in protein and were predicted to decrease protein stability and have a deleterious impact on the TP63 protein function. Molecular docking analysis showed five nsSNPs to reduce the binding affinity of TP63 protein to DNA with significant results for three SNPs (R319H, G349E, and C347F). Further, MD simulations revealed the possible disruption of TP63 and DNA binding, hampering the essential protein function.

Research is needed for the impact of liver abscess severity as well as abscess duration on steer performance and carcass characteristics. Holstein steers (n = 64; initial body weight (BW) = 372.5  2.41 kg) consuming a finishing diet for 188 d were used in a completely randomized design where treatments included: TYL (tylosin phosphate 90 mg/d; n = 32) or IGY (2.5 g/d; n = 32) and steer was the experimental unit. Feed intake was recorded daily while BW and liver ultrasound outcome (normal or abnormal) was recorded every 28 d until slaughter to estimate duration of abscess presence (DUR). Continuous variables of animal growth performance and carcass characteristics were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Categorical quality grade and liver data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. Treatment did not affect live or carcass-adjusted growth performance (P  0.131). However, steers fed TYL had greater (P = 0.042) empty body fat (EBF) % and a greater proportion of carcasses grading premium choice than steers fed IGY (P = 0.030). Treatment did not affect prevalence of abscessed livers, abscess severity or estimated abscess duration (P  0.213) but datasets with greater experimental units are needed to substantiate this outcome. Increasing abscess severity tended (P  0.10) to linearly reduce carcass-adjusted gain to feed (G:F), fat thickness, and EBF.

We collected 710 serum samples (174 samples after BNT162b2 and 536 samples after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). Venous blood was obtained 3 weeks after first and second vaccinations. In both vaccines, sCOVG, CoV-2 IgG II, and cPASS showed a high seropositive rate (>95.7%) except for cPASS after the first vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (68.8%). Using sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II, the ratios of antibody value (second/first) increased 10.6- and 11.4-fold in BNT162b2 (first 14.1, second 134.8 U/ml; first 1,416.2, second 14,326.4 AU/ml) and 2.3- and 2.0-fold in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (first 4.0, second 9.1 U/ml; first 431.0, second 9,744.0 AU/ml). cPASS-positive results indicated a very high concordance rate with sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II (>98%), whereas cPASS-negative results showed a relatively low concordance rate (range of 22.2% to 66.7%). To predict cPASS positivity, we suggested additional cutoffs for sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II at 2.42 U/ml and 284 AU/ml, respectively. In conclusion, BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 evoked robust humoral responses. sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II showed a very strong correlation with cPASS. sCOVG and CoV-2 IgG II may predict the presence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS A total of 48 patients underwent LTG for gastric cancer by the same surgeon. Four types of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomies have been applied after LTG: type A, a conventional anvil head method; type B, an OrVil? system method; type C, a hemi-double stapling technique with anvil head; and type D, side-to-side esophagojejunostomy with linear stapler. We describe and review these types of esophagojejunostomy using a step-by-step approach. RESULTS The mean reconstruction times were longer for types A and B than for types C and D (p < 0.05). In terms of complications, there were five cases (10.4%) of anastomosis leakage, which was more common in types A and B: two cases in each of type A and B and one case in type C. Moreover, anastomosis stricture requiring intervention was more common in types A and B (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS To date, there are no reliable reconstruction methods after LTG.

In Ethiopia, the number of cases and related deaths are increasing exponentially. Prevention is currently available effective management, and its implementation has not been assessed adequately. Objective: To assess the COVID-19 prevention practices in three zones of Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Bench Sheko, Kafa, and West Omo zones. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select 845 study participants. The data collection tool was adapted from the WHO resources and related literature. SPSS version 20 was used to analyze the data. Participants who scored at least a mean score of practice questions were categorized as having good practice. Binary logistic regression was fitted to identify factors associated with the practice. Results: In this study, 803 participants participated. About two-thirds (64.7%) of the respondents had a history of going to crowded places, while only 30.3% of the participants had a history of wearing a mask when leaving home. Two-thirds of the respondents had a history of maintaining their distance at 2 meters (64.4%) and washing their hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers (64.8%). Generally, less than two-thirds (59.4%) of study participants had a good practice of COVID-19 prevention methods.

The aim of this review is to explore the literature, summarize potential predisposing factors to secondary infections and their incidence. It also summarizes a variety of healthcare scenarios in which different kinds of secondary infections occur. RECENT FINDINGS: Apart from immune dysregulation, severe resource limitations in healthcare settings have made COVID-19 units conducive to a variety of secondary infections. Long-term effect of excess antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients is yet to be studied. Very few studies have assessed secondary infections as the primary outcome measure making it difficult to know the true incidence. Mortality attributable to secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is also unclear. SUMMARY: Incidence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is likely higher than what is reported in the literature. Well designed studies are needed to understand the incidence and impact of secondary infections in this patient population. Many of these may be preventable especially now, as personal protective equipment and other healthcare resources are recovering.

METHODS: : We retrospectively analyzed 50 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection who had received chest CT between March and July 2020. Pulmonary opacifications were automatically evaluated by an AI-driven software and correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters using Spearman-Rho and linear regression analysis. We divided the patients into subcohorts with or without necessity of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Subcohort differences were evaluated employing Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test. RESULTS: : We included 50 CT examinations (mean age, 57.24 years), of whom 24 (48%) had an ICU stay. Extent of COVID-19 like opacities on chest CT showed correlations (all P<0.001 if not otherwise stated) with occurrence of ICU stay (R=0.74), length of ICU stay (R=0.81), lethal outcome (R=0.56) and length of hospital stay (R=0.33, P<0.05).

National and regional experiences with COVID-19 have been hugely variable across the globe, reflecting ethnic, governmental, cultural, economic and healthcare differences. This thematic analysis was performed to identify scientific and clinical literature relating to the impact of COVID-19 on children with cancer and treatment. METHODS: The NHS Evidence portal was used to conduct a healthcare database advanced literature search. Duplicates were removed. Remaining results were screened using clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: 172 results were identified and data extracted. Literature was identified from all 5 continents, with lower and middle income countries well represented. Key themes identified included: 1: Impact on patients already diagnosed, including decreased treatment regimens, impact on outpatient clinics, COVID susceptibility and travel restrictions; 2: Delays in presentation and diagnosis, and national screening programs; 3: The impact of COVID on healthcare professionals; 4: Impact on current and future research; 5: Consequence of global economic crisis on childhood cancer care; 6: Impact on long-term survivorship, late effects and surveillance monitoring. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a profound effect on health care, and the literature reflects the extent to which communities involved in childhood cancer care have worked together to minimise the impact. It is inevitable that there have been consequences of the pandemic on the treatment of existing patients, and the diagnosis of new ones, but evidence suggest these effects in the short term are minimal.

This study aimed to estimate the long-term impacts of the pandemic on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada using a mathematical model. MethodsWe developed a stochastic microsimulation model to estimate the cancer care disruptions and its long-term impact on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada. The model reproduces cancer incidence, survival, and epidemiology in Canada, by using cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis and survival data from the Canadian Cancer Registries. We modeled reported declines in cancer diagnoses and treatments recorded in provincial administrative datasets from March 2020-June 2021. We assumed that diagnostic and treatment delays lead to an increased rate of death. Based on the literature, we assumed each 4-week delay in diagnosis and treatment would lead to a 6% to 50% higher rate of cancer death. Results are the median predictions of 10 stochastic simulations. FindingsThe model predicts that cancer care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to 21,247 (2{middle dot}0%) more cancer deaths in Canada in 2020-2030, assuming treatment capacity is recovered to 2019 pre-pandemic levels in 2021. This represents 355,172 life years lost expected due to pandemic-related diagnostic and treatment delays. The highest absolute expected excess cancer mortality was predicted in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, and in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Diagnostic and treatment capacity in 2021 onwards highly influenced the number of predicted cancer deaths over the next decade. InterpretationCancer care disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to significant life loss; however, most of these could be mitigated by increasing diagnostic and treatment capacity in the post-pandemic era to address the service backlog. FundingCanadian Institutes of Health Research Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe performed a review of modeling studies predicting the impact of pandemic-induced disruptions to cancer care on cancer survival outcomes. We searched MEDLINE on 2 July 2021 for records published from 1 January 2020 with no language restrictions. Our search consisted of index keywords [Cancer AND COVID-19 AND [(delay AND diagnosis) OR (delay AND screening) OR (delay AND treatment)] AND outcomes AND modelling study]. We identified 14 studies that model the long-term effect of disruptions to cancer screening programs, diagnostic intervals, and to treatment intervals for common cancers. Most studies (9/14) assessed the impact of cancer screening disruptions but did not assume any treatment disruptions. Disruptions to cancer screening services in high income health systems were estimated to lead to small increases in cancer incidence and mortality, even with immediate resumption of screening to services after disruption periods. Fewer studies examined the impact of diagnostic referral and treatment disruptions; these are similarly predicted to lead to increases in cancer incidence and mortality, with varying impacts depending on cancer site. Due to difficulties in obtaining real-time healthcare data, previous studies have relied on assumptions regarding the duration of health care disruptions (1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, to 24-months) rather than on empirical data. All studies restricted their analysis to the impact on a single or a few cancer sites. Added value of this studyOur stochastic microsimulation model is the first to assess the population-level impact of diagnostic and treatment disruptions on overall cancer mortality across all sites. Using Canadian cancer statistics and expert validation of treatment modalities, we constructed a model that reproduced pre-pandemic cancer mortality data. An important added value of this analysis compared to previous studies was that we were able to integrate empirical data on cancer-related procedures during the pandemic era to model disruptions to cancer care. Implications of all the available evidenceWe estimate there could be a 2{middle dot}0% increase over expected cancer mortality between 2020-2030 in Canada due to pandemic-related disruptions to diagnostic and treatment intervals. Our results identified that a 10-20% increase in cancer care service capacity over pre-pandemic levels could prevent a considerable amount of the predicted excess cancer-related deaths by reducing diagnostic and treatment backlogs. By stratifying our reported outcomes by sex, age, province, and cancer site, we provide a long-term perspective that can inform post-pandemic public health policy or aid in prioritization of patients in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19. While our model is specific to Canada, it could be applied to countries that have experienced comparable COVID-19-related healthcare disruptions.","output":"Predicted long-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related care delays on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), emerged late December 2019 in China, is now rapidly spreading across the globe.

However, currently, no review has systematically examined challenges unique to LMICs and offered insights into the underlying contextual factors that influence these interventions. We adopted an implementation research perspective to systematically synthesize the implementation barriers and facilitators in LMICs. METHODS: We conducted literature searches in five electronic databases and identified studies that involved the implementation of behavior change interventions to improve appropriate antibiotic use in prescribers and users in LMICs and reported implementation barriers and facilitators. Behavior change interventions were defined using the behavior change wheel, and the coding and synthesis of barriers and facilitators were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). RESULTS: We identified 52 eligible studies, with the majority targeting prescribers practicing at tertiary facilities (N=39, 75%). The most commonly reported factors influencing implementation were found in the inner setting domain of the CFIR framework, particularly related to constraints in resources and the infrastructure of the facilities where interventions were implemented. Barriers related to the external policy environment (e.g., lack of national initiatives and policies on antibiotic use), and individual characteristics of target populations (e.g., reluctance to change prescribing behaviors) were also common, as well as facilitators related to intervention characteristics (e.g., embedding interventions in routine practice) and process (e.g., stakeholder engagement). We also provided insights into the interrelationships between these factors and the underlying causes contributing to the implementation challenges in LMICs. CONCLUSION: We presented a comprehensive overview of the barriers and facilitators of implementing behavior change interventions to promote rational antibiotic use in LMICs. Our findings suggest that facilitating the implementation of interventions to improve rational antibiotic use needs comprehensive efforts to address challenges at policy, organizational, and implementation levels. Specific strategies include (1) strengthening political commitment to prompt mobilization of domestic resources and formulation of a sustainable national strategy on AMR, (2) improving the infrastructure of health facilities that allow prescribers to make evidence-based clinical decisions, and (3) engaging local stakeholders to improve their buy-in and facilitate contextualizing interventions.

While 12-15 mmHg is generally recommended as a standard pressure, the benefits of lower intra-abdominal pressure are unclear. We thus studied whether the low intra-abdominal pressure compared with the standard pressure improves cardiopulmonary dynamics during laparoscopic surgery. METHODS Patients were randomized according to the intra-abdominal pressure and neuromuscular blocking levels during laparoscopic colorectal surgery: low pressure (8 mmHg) with deep-block (post-tetanic count 1-2), standard pressure (12 mmHg) with deep-block, and standard pressure with moderate-block (train-of-four count 1-2) groups. During the laparoscopic procedure, we recorded cardiopulmonary variables including cardiac index, pulmonary compliance, and surgical conditions. We also assessed postoperative pain intensity and recovery time of bowel movement. The primary outcome was the cardiac index 30 min after onset of laparoscopy. RESULTS Patients were included in the low pressure with deep-block (n = 44), standard pressure with deep-block (n = 44), and standard pressure with moderate-block (n = 43) groups. The mean (SD) of cardiac index 30 min after laparoscopy was 2.7 (0.7), 2.7 (0.9), and 2.6 (1.0) L min-1 m-2 in each group (P = 0.715). The pulmonary compliance was higher but the surgical condition was poorer in the low intra-abdominal pressure than the standard pressure (both P < 0.001). Other variables were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION We observed few cardiopulmonary benefits but poor surgical conditions in the low intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopy. Considering cardiopulmonary dynamics and surgical conditions, the standard intra-abdominal pressure may be preferable to the low pressure for laparoscopic surgery.","output":"Lower intra-abdominal pressure has no cardiopulmonary benefits during laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How are the work trajectories of Chilean women?

OBJECTIVES: Our retrospective study utilized respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) results in patients with SARS-CoV-2 to determine if coinfection (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 positivity with an additional respiratory virus) was associated with more severe presentation and outcomes. METHODS: All patients with negative influenza/respiratory syncytial virus testing who underwent RPP testing within 7 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test at a large, academic medical centre in New York were examined. Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a negative RPP were compared with patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and positive for a virus by RPP in terms of biomarkers, oxygen requirements and severe COVID-19 outcome, as defined by mechanical ventilation or death within 30 days. RESULTS: Of the 306 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with RPP testing, 14 (4.6%) were positive for a non-influenza virus (coinfected). Compared with the coinfected group, patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a negative RPP had higher inflammatory markers and were significantly more likely to be admitted (P = 0.01). Severe COVID-19 outcome occurred in 111 (36.3%) patients in the SARS-CoV-2-only group and 3 (21.4%) patients in the coinfected group (P = 0.24).

Recent studies found that in fact poor governance and transparency correlate more strongly with AMR than factors such as antibiotic use. While many African countries now have national action plans (NAPs) on AMR, it is unclear whether information is publicly available on their implementation, surveillance and financing. METHODS: Here, the transparency of information related to AMR national action plans in 15 African countries is assessed, based on a governance framework for AMR action plans. Public availability is assessed for AMR documents, progress reports, AMR surveillance data, budget allocations, as well as bodies and persons responsible for implementation of NAPs. Government websites and search engines were perused using search terms related to the studied criteria and countries. RESULTS: Results show that most countries have a national action plan publicly available. AMR surveillance data was available for a few countries, but systematic progress reports and funding allocations were absent in all but one country. Information on a body mandated to coordinate NAP implementation was available for most countries, but their functionality remain unclear. Most countries have nominated at least one person responsible for AMR nationally. In general, information was often fragmented and frequently available on external, non-government websites. It appears that commitments on AMR made in the often comprehensive NAPs are rarely met in a timely manner, exhibiting rather weak accountability for AMR results. The article provides concrete policy recommendations on how transparency and accountability may be improved with little effort. CONCLUSIONS: Making information available can enable stakeholders such as civil society to demand accountability for results and lead to much needed specific actions on curbing AMR in countries.

By sequencing, a unique mutation, synonymous 28948C > T, was found in the N-negative B.1.177.75 strains.

We aimed to characterize the humoral response after three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients treated with either maintenance hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 69 French patients (38 HD and 31 PD) treated at a single center who received three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. FINDINGS: Humoral response was evaluated using plasma levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 immunoglobulin measured after the second dose and at least three weeks after the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Patients (median age 68 [IQR, 53-76] years, 65% men) had a median anti-S1 antibody level of 284 [IQR, 83-1190] AU/mL after the second dose, and 7554 [IQR, 2268-11736] AU/mL after the third dose. Three patients were non-responders (anti-S1 antibody level < 0.8 AU/mL) and 12 were weak responders (anti-S1 antibody level 0.8-50 AU/mL) after the second vaccine dose. After the third dose, one of the three initial non-responders produced anti-spike antibody and all the 12 initial weak responders increased their antibody levels. Patients with a greater increase in anti-S1 antibody levels after a third dose had lower antibody levels after the second dose, and a longer time interval between the second and the third dose.

We find that the early growth rates of COVID-19 are higher in China than the other countries, which is consistent with previous reports.

Among socio-economic factors, GDP per capita is most important showing negative relationships in China, while positive in the other countries. However, the predicability of early growth rates by socio-economic and climate variables is at least 1.6 times higher in China's provinces than the other countries, which is further supported by metapopulation network model.

MERS has been endemic to Saudi Arabia since 2012. The reservoir of MERS-CoV is the dromedary camel, suggesting that MERS is primarily a zoonotic disease. MERS-CoV is common in dromedaries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa as evidenced by neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV; however, human cases have remained limited to the Middle East. To better understand the cause of this difference, the virological properties of African camel MERS-CoV were analyzed based on the spike (S) protein in Ethiopia. Nasal swabs were collected from 258 young dromedaries ( 2 years old) in the Afar region of Ethiopia, of which 39 were positive for MERS-CoV, as confirmed by genetic tests. All positive tests were exclusive to the Amibara woreda region. Using next-generation sequencing, two full-length genomes of Amibara isolates were successfully decoded; both isolates belonged to the C2 clade based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length and S protein sequences. Recombinant EMC isolates of MERS-CoV, in which the S protein is replaced with those of Amibara isolates, were then generated to test the roles of these proteins in viral properties. Amibara S recombinants replicated more slowly in cultured cells than in EMC S recombinants. In neutralizing assays, Amibara S recombinants were neutralized by lower concentrations of sera from both Ethiopian dromedaries and EMC isolate (wild-type)-immunized mouse sera, relative to the EMC S recombinants, indicating that viruses coated in the Amibara S protein were easier to neutralize than the EMC S protein. Neutralization experiments performed using S1/S2 chimeric recombinants of the EMC and Amibara S proteins showed that the neutralization profile was dependent on the S1 region of the S protein. These results suggest that the slower viral replication and the ease of neutralization seen in the Ethiopian MERS-CoV are due to strain-specific differences in the S protein and may account for the absence of human MERS-CoV cases in Ethiopia.","output":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Dromedaries in Ethiopia Is Antigenically Different From the Middle East Isolate EMC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread rapidly, evolving into a full-blown pandemic.

Volume nadir occurred an average of 32 days after each state-of-emergency declaration and 12 days after each stay-at-home order. At nadir, the projected volume loss was 38,043 CTs per day (of 71,626 CTs per day; 53% reduction). Over the entire study period, there were 3,689,874 fewer CT examinations performed than predicted (of 18,947,969; 19% reduction). There was less reduction in states with smaller population density (15% [169,378 of 1,142,247; quartile 1] versus 21% [1,894,152 of 9,140,689; quartile 4]) and less reduction in states with a lower insured unemployed proportion (13% [279,331 of 2,071,251; quartile 1] versus 23% [1,753,521 of 7,496,443; quartile 4]). By September 30, CT volume had returned to 84% (59,856 of 71,321) of predicted; recovery of CT volume occurred as positive COVID-19 tests rose and deaths were in decline. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 substantially reduced US CT volume, reflecting delayed and deferred care, especially in states with greater unemployment. Partial volume recovery occurred despite rising positive COVID-19 tests.","output":"CT Volumes from 2,398 Radiology Practices in the United States: A Real-Time Indicator of the Effect of COVID-19 on Routine Care, January to September 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is the basis of a vaccine against Ebola and VSV strains are developed as oncolytic viruses.

VSV activates innate immunity via retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a sensor for viral RNA. Our results show that VSV needs to replicate for a robust interferon response. Analysis of RIG-I-associated RNA identified a copy-back defective-interfering (DI) genome and full-length viral genomes as main trigger of RIG-I. VSV stocks depleted of DI genomes lost most of their interferon-stimulating activity. The remaining full-length genome and leader-N-read-through sequences, however, still triggered RIG-I. Awareness for DI genomes as trigger of innate immune responses will help to standardize DI genome content and to purposefully deplete or use DI genomes as natural adjuvants in VSV-based therapeutics.","output":"Defective Interfering Genomes and the Full-Length Viral Genome Trigger RIG-I After Infection With Vesicular Stomatitis Virus in a Replication Dependent Manner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging new viral pathogen that causes severe respiratory disease SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide As there are no confirmed antiviral drugs or vaccines currently available for the treatment of COVID-19, discovering potent inhibitors or vaccines are urgently required for the benefit of humanity The glycosylated Spike protein (S-protein) directly interacts with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S-protein As the S-protein is exposed to the surface and is essential for entry into the host, the S-protein can be considered as a first-line therapeutic target for antiviral therapy and vaccine development In silico screening, docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed to identify repurposing drugs using DrugBank and PubChem library against the RBD of S-protein The study identified a laxative drug, Bisoxatin (DB09219), which is used for the treatment of constipation and preparation of the colon for surgical procedures It binds nicely at the S-proteinCACE2 interface by making substantial - interactions with Tyr505 in the Site 1 hook region of RBD and hydrophilic interactions with Glu406, Ser494, and Thr500 Bisoxatin consistently binds to the protein throughout the 100 ns simulation Taken together, we propose that the discovered molecule, Bisoxatin may be a promising repurposable drug molecule to develop new chemical libraries for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host","output":"Identification of a repurposed drug as an inhibitor of Spike protein of human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by computational methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of the Covid-19 epidemic in the Campania region, less relevant than in the central and northern regions in terms of number of infections and specific mortality per 1,000 inhabitants, however, had an impact which, measured on the basis of income production and occupation, they came already profiling at the conclusion of the lockdown imposed on the population and production activities, extremely serious.

People who have experienced loss during this special period may find it difficult to adapt to life after loss, and may even suffer from prolonged grief disorder or other mental health problems. However, there is a huge gap of grief research in China, with almost no comprehensive grief intervention training system or very few professional grief consultants. Considering the large number of bereaved individuals who are suffering from grief and other mental health problems, it is significant to develop a suitable and effective intervention protocol immediately. This article illustrates a study protocol initiated by a Chinese university to investigate the mental health of bereaved individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and train grief counselors to provide grief counseling to the bereaved, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the grief counseling. The method is as follows: (1) 300 psychological counselors will be recruited to attend the grief counseling training. Assessments will be conducted at three time points: baseline (T0), after the basic training (T1), and after the advanced training (T2); (2) 500 bereaved Chinese will be recruit to join the online survey and will be assessed at two time points with a six-month interval; and (3) a two-armed (grief counseling versus wait-list controls) RCT (random control trials) will be conducted with 160 bereaved individuals. Assessments will be conducted at three time points: before randomization (baseline, T0), at the post-counseling (T1), and three months after the post-counseling (T2). Primary outcomes will be assessed by the Prolonged Grief Questionnaire (PG-13), the 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI).

We used gene annotations to align orthologous sequences for total evidence analysis under the parsimony optimality criterion. Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus were set as outgroups to understand spillovers of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus among ten orders of animals. We corroborated that Chiroptera-hosted viruses are the sister group of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-related viruses. Other zoonotic events were qualified and quantified to provide a comprehensive picture of the risk of coronavirus emergence among humans. Finally, we used a 250 SARS-CoV-2 genomes dataset to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses.","output":"Fundamental evolution of all Orthocoronavirinae including three deadly lineages descendent from Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of Jiuwei Zhuhuang Powder (JWZH), a Tibetan patent medicine in treating upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) associated cough in children. METHODS: The study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial. A total of 142 children aged 2 to 14 years old, with URTI-associated cough within 48 h of onset, were randomly assigned to two groups at a 1:1 ratio by computer-generated randomization sequence. Children were treated with JWZH (1 to 1.5 g, twice to thrice daily) in the treatment group or conventional treatment (Pediatric Paracetamol, Artificial Cow-bezoar and Chlorphenamine Maleate Granules, 0.25 to 1 g, thrice daily) in the control group for 5 days. The primary endpoints were the time to cough resolution and 4-day cough resolution rate. The secondary endpoints were the daily improvement in symptom scores and cough resolution rate during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 138 children were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, with 71 cases in the treatment group and 67 cases in the control group. Compared with the conventional treatment, the children receiving JWZH had a shorter time to cough resolution [hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29C3.40; P=0.003]. The median time to cough resolution for children receiving JWZH was shorter than that of the conventional treatment (2 days vs. 3 days; P<0.001). The 4-day cough resolution rate in the JWZH group was higher than that of the control group (94.4% vs. 74.6%; risk difference: 19.8%, 95% CI: 8.1%C31.5%; relative risk: 1.265, 95% CI: 1.088C1.470; P=0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the improvement of other symptoms caused by URTI (P>0.05).

The AMBER was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 295 participants stratified by local serum potassium measurement (4.3 to < 4.7 mmol/L vs 4.7 to 5.1 mmol/L) and history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The focus was on enabling participants with resistant hypertension to achieve blood pressure goals by using spironolactone. Additionally, the ongoing Patiromer for the Management of Hyperkalemia in Subjects Receiving RAASi Medications for the Treatment of Heart Failure (DIAMOND) trial is designed to demonstrate how patiromer is an \\"enabler\\" of therapies that are needed to either control resistant hypertension or reduce mortality in heart failure but generate hyperkalemia.

Methods: A multicenter prospective observational study during SeptemberCNovember 2020, of COVID-19, confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Data were obtained 4C8 weeks after diagnosis. Blood samples were collected to investigate the humoral response, using three different serological methods. Results: A total of 111 patients were included (98 symptomatic), 8 were admitted to hospital, none required an Intensive Care Unit visit. Median age: 88 months (IQR: 24C149). Median time between diagnosis and serological test: 37 days (IQR: 34C44).

They also need to understand the current methods of composite recycling and disposal and their impact on the end-of-life costs. A comprehensive literature review indicated that there is no such tool to estimate CFRP recycling costs without any prior knowledge and expertise. Therefore, this research paper proposed a novel knowledge-based system for the cost modelling of recycling CFRP that does not require in-depth knowledge from a user. A prototype of a cost estimation system has been developed based on existing CFRP recycling techniques such as mechanical recycling, pyrolysis, fluidized bed, and supercritical water. The proposed system has the ability to select the appropriate recycling techniques based on a users needs with the help of an optimization module based on the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Estimating recycling costs has taken into consideration various factors such as different material types in different industries, transportation, and dismantling costs.

The 1,2,4-triazole scaffold was selected as a privilege ring system that is embedded in core structures of a variety of anticancer drugs which are either in clinical use or still under clinical trials. The designed 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were synthesized by linking the triazole-thione moiety through amide hydrophilic linkers with diverse lipophilic fragments. In silico study to predict cytotoxicity of the new hybrids against different kinds of human cancer cell lines as well as the non-tumor cells was conducted. The multidrug-resistant human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) was found most susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of synthesized compounds and hence were selected to evaluate the in vitro anticancer activity. Four of the designed derivatives showed promising cytotoxicity effects against selected cancer cells, among which compound 12 showed the highest potency (IC50 = 3.61 M), followed by 21 which displayed IC50 value of 3.93 M. Also, compounds 14 and 23 revealed equipotent activity with the reference cytotoxic agent doxorubicin.

Despite similar proportions of new consults, there was an increase in the proportion of follow-up visits and medical decision-making complexity evaluation and management CPT codes (e.g. 99214/99215) after the conversion (17.2% versus 24.6%, RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.26-163, p < 0.0001). There were no differences between amniocentesis procedures performed between the two time periods (0.3% versus 0.2%, p = 0.5805). CONCLUSION The rapid conversion of an MFM platform from convention medical treatment to telemedicine platform in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic resulted in protection of healthcare personnel and MFM patients, with only a modest decrease in clinical productivity during the initial roll-out. Due to the ongoing threat from the novel coronavirus-19, an MFM telemedicine platform is a practicable and innovative solution and merits the continued support of CMS and health care administrators.","output":"Maintaining access to maternal fetal medicine care by telemedicine during a global pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to describe the presentations and biochemical characteristics of sepsis-like syndrome (SLS) in infants aged <2 months who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-in comparison to those in the same age group who were SARS-CoV-2-negative. Background: COVID-19 presents with a spectrum of manifestations, and children seem to have a favorable clinical course compared to other age groups. Limited data are available for symptomatic infants. Design: This was a case-controlled single-institution retrospective study on infants aged <2 months admitted with SLS between 1 April 2020 and 1 July 2020. These infants were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (n = 41), infants with positive nasal/oropharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2; and Group 2 (n = 40), infants with negative PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 (control group). Details between both groups were reviewed and analyzed. Outcome: The clinical and laboratory data for SARS-CoV-2 -positive infants who presented with SLS may differ from those for infants with SLS who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Overall, 105 infants were admitted with clinical sepsis: 41 were SARS-CoV-2-positive, and 64 were negative. Fever was present in 90% of SARS-CoV-2-positive infants vs. 80% of the negative group. SARS-CoV-2-positive infants had a higher incidence of nasal congestion and cough (39 and 29%, respectively) compared to the SARS-CoV-2-negative group (20 and 3%, respectively) (P < 0.05). Poor feeding and hypoactivity occurred more frequently in the SARS-CoV-2-negative group (58 and 45%, respectively) than in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (22 and 12%, respectively, P < 0.004). Sepsis workup, including lumbar puncture, was performed in 67% and partial septic workup was performed in 23% of the SARS-CoV-2-positive infants. Full sepsis workup was performed in 92% of the SARS-CoV-2-negative group. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were negative in 26/27SARS-CoV-2-positive infants (an infant had Klebsiella meningitis). All the SARS-CoV-2-negative infants had negative CSF cultures. Blood culture was negative in both groups. Urine culture showed bacterial growth in 9 infants with SARS-CoV-2-negative sepsis. Conclusions: Our study showed that respiratory symptoms (cough and nasal congestion) were more prominent in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group, while poor feeding and hypoactivity were reported more frequently in the negative group. However, the clinical differentiation between COVID-19 disease and sepsis in such age groups is difficult. Therefore, screening young infants with SLS for SARS-CoV-2- is necessary during this pandemic.","output":"Neonates and Young Infants With COVID-19 Presented With Sepsis-Like Syndrome: A Retrospective Case Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increasing use of emergency departments (EDs) by patients with low urgency, combined with limited availability of medical staff, results in extended waiting times and delayed care. Technological approaches could possibly increase efficiency by providing urgency advice and symptom assessments. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of urgency advice provided by a symptom assessment app, Ada, in an ED. METHODS: The study was conducted at the interdisciplinary ED of Marburg University Hospital, with data collection performed between August 2019 and March 2020. This study had a single-center cross-sectional prospective observational design and included 378 patients. The apps urgency recommendation was compared with an established triage concept (Manchester Triage System [MTS]), including patients from the lower 3 MTS categories only. For all patients who were undertriaged, an expert physician panel assessed the case to detect potential avoidable hazardous situations (AHSs). RESULTS: Of 378 participants, 344 (91%) were triaged the same or more conservatively and 34 (8.9%) were undertriaged by the app. Of the 378 patients, 14 (3.7%) had received safe advice determined by the expert panel and 20 (5.3%) were considered to be potential AHS. Therefore, the assessment could be considered safe in 94.7% (358/378) of the patients when compared with the MTS assessment. From the 3 lowest MTS categories, 43.4% (164/378) of patients were not considered as emergency cases by the app, but could have been safely treated by a general practitioner or would not have required a physician consultation at all. CONCLUSIONS: The app provided urgency advice after patient self-triage that has a high rate of safety, a rate of undertriage, and a rate of triage with potential to be an AHS, equivalent to telephone triage by health care professionals while still being more conservative than direct ED triage. A large proportion of patients in the ED were not considered as emergency cases, which could possibly relieve ED burden if used at home. Further research should be conducted in the at-home setting to evaluate this hypothesis.

Traditional surveillance systems are adversely affected by data quality issues, underreporting of cases, and reporting delays, resulting in missed prevention opportunities to respond to trends in disease prevalence. Search engine data can potentially facilitate an efficient and economical enhancement to surveillance reporting systems established for STIs. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and train a predictive model using reported STI case data from Chicago, Illinois, and to investigate the models predictive capacity, timeliness, and ability to target interventions to subpopulations using Google Trends data. METHODS: Deidentified STI case data for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and primary and secondary syphilis from 2011-2017 were obtained from the Chicago Department of Public Health. The data set included race/ethnicity, age, and birth sex. Google Correlate was used to identify the top 100 correlated search terms with STD symptoms, and an autocrawler was established using Google Health Application Programming Interface to collect the search volume for each term. Elastic net regression was used to evaluate prediction accuracy, and cross-correlation analysis was used to identify timeliness of prediction. Subgroup elastic net regression analysis was performed for race, sex, and age. RESULTS: For gonorrhea and chlamydia, actual and predicted STI values correlated moderately in 2011 (chlamydia: r=0.65; gonorrhea: r=0.72) but correlated highly (chlamydia: r=0.90; gonorrhea: r=0.94) from 2012 to 2017. However, for primary and secondary syphilis, the high correlation was observed only for 2012 (r=0.79), 2013 (r=0.77), 2016 (0.80), and 2017 (r=0.84), with 2011, 2014, and 2015 showing moderate correlations (r=0.55-0.70). Model performance was the most accurate (highest correlation and lowest mean absolute error) for gonorrhea. Subgroup analyses improved model fit across disease and year. Regression models using search terms selected from the cross-correlation analysis improved the prediction accuracy and timeliness across diseases and years. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating nowcasting with Google Trends in surveillance activities can potentially enhance the prediction and timeliness of outbreak detection and response as well as target interventions to subpopulations.

Apart from death because of coronavirus infection, the pandemic brought unbearable psychological pressure to all. We assessed the psychological pressure on college and university students in India through cluster sampling. Methods: The students responded (n = 209) to an online questionnaire following the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) with some other basic information. Results: According to GAD-7 scoring, we found the respondent students had severe anxiety (1.44%), moderately severe anxiety (14.35%), moderate anxiety (36.36%) and mild anxiety (47.85%). Following HAM-A scoring, anxiety level among the students could be scaled as severe (0.96%), high (4.31%), moderate (13.40%) and mild anxiety (34.93%) level. Age of the students was a confounding factor (p = 0.049, HAM-A) of experiencing anxiety, students <20 years of age were more anxious. We found female students to be more anxious than the males following the HAM-A scoring tool. Academic delays (R2 = 0.996, p = 0.036) and impact on daily life (R2 = 0.996, p = 0.117) were positively associated with anxiety symptoms, while social support was marginally correlated (R2 = 0.726, p = 0.069) with the anxiety level.

We sought to demonstrate that a screen-based or virtual escape room approach was feasible, flexible in terms of content and format, and engaging for learners collaborating in small group teams. Cohort 1 of students from the Interprofessional Quality Improvement and Patient Safety course included 510 students on 88 teams.

AIM: To explore the practice of telemedicine by Nigerian health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of the Nigerian HCWs on telemedicine practice in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Recruitment of respondents was done through dedicated WhatsApp and Telegram social media platforms for HCWs over a period of 40 days (May 1st and June 10th, 2020). RESULTS: A total of 481 HCWs participated in the study consisting of 153(31.8%) doctors, 150(31.2%) nurses and 178(37%) other HCWs.

There is open discussion regarding whether low D3 is caused by the infection or if deficiency negatively affects immune defense. The aim of this study was to collect further evidence on this topic. Methods Systematic literature search was performed to identify retrospective cohort as well as clinical studies on COVID-19 mortality rates vs. D3 blood levels. Mortality rates from clinical studies were corrected for age, sex and diabetes. Data was analyzed using correlation and linear regression. Results One population study and seven clinical studies were identified, which reported D3 blood levels pre-infection or on the day of hospital admission. They independently showed a negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and mortality risk (r(17)=-.4154, p=.0770/r(13)=-.4886, p=.0646). For the combined data, median (IQR) D3 levels were 23.2 ng/ml (17.4 - 26.8), and a significant Pearson correlation was observed (r(32)=-.3989, p=.0194). Regression suggested a theoretical point of zero mortality at approximately 50 ng/ml D3. Conclusions The two datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is a predictor rather than a side effect of the infection. Despite ongoing vaccinations, we recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/ml to prevent or mitigate new outbreaks due to escape mutations or decreasing antibody activity.","output":"COVID-19 mortality risk correlates inversely with vitamin D3 status, and a mortality rate close to zero could theoretically be achieved at 50 ng/ml 25(OH)D3: Results of a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An actively controlled Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (actSIS) contagion model is presented for studying epidemic dynamics with continuous-time feedback control of infection rates.

Accounting for a time lag in observations and categorizing individuals into distinct sub-populations based on their risk profiles, we show that the actSIS model manifests qualitatively different features as compared with the SIS model. In a homogeneous population of risk-averters, the endemic equilibrium is always reduced, although the transient infection level can exhibit overshoot or undershoot. In a homogeneous population of risk-tolerating individuals, the system exhibits bistability, which can also lead to reduced infection.

Followed by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses in 2003 SARS-CoV, in 2012 MERS-CoV, now in 2019 pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, is associated with a global pandemic situation. In humans, the effects of these viruses are correlated with viral pneumonia, severe respiratory tract infections. It is believed that interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor and viral Spike protein mediates the coronavirus entry into human respiratory epithelial cells and establishes the host tropism. ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in airway epithelial cells. Along with viral-receptor interaction, proteolytic cleavability of S protein has been considered as the determinant of disease severity. Several studies highlight the occurrence of impaired host immune response and expression of excessive inflammatory response especially cytokines against viral infection. The mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced acute lung injury are still undefined; however, the term cytokine storm has now been recognized to be closely associated with COVID-19. The levels of inflammatory mediators from cytokine storm cause damage to the host cells. In particular, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 appears to be the key mediator in early phase of virus-receptor interaction; however, secreted IL-6 might not be representative of lung inflammation. Understanding the cellular, and molecular factors involved in immune dysregulation and the high virulence capacity of COVID-19 will help in potential targeted therapy against it. Drug repurposing and molecular docking analysis is considered as an attractive alternative approach in analyzing suitable drug candidates to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Globally, extensive research is in progress to discover a new vaccine for novel COVID-19. Moreover, our review mainly focuses on the most state-of-the-art therapeutic approach mediated by Mannose-binding lectin (MBL). One of the most significant molecules of innate immunity is MBL.

The health and economic consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic provide a poignant case. Here we point out that since they are based on differential equations, the most widely used models of epidemic spread are plagued by an approximation that is not justified in the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Taking the example of data from New York City, we show that currently used models significantly underestimate the initial basic reproduction number ($R_0$). The correct description, based on integral equations, can be implemented in most of the reported models and it much more accurately accounts for the dynamics of the epidemic after sharp changes in $R_0$ due to restrictive public congregation measures. It also provides a novel way to determine the incubation period, and most importantly, as we demonstrate for several countries, this method allows an accurate monitoring of $R_0$ and thus a fine-tuning of any restrictive measures. Integral equation based models do not only provide the conceptually correct description, they also have more predictive power than differential equation based models, therefore we do not see any reason for using the latter.","output":"Why integral equations should be used instead of differential equations to describe the dynamics of epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac disease has emerged as a leading cause of mortality in Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the current era.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12-31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57-82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures-such as many low-income countries-the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.","output":"Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric disorder, developed in response to the exposure to one or more traumatic events, and characterized by typical disabling symptoms, chronic course, significant deterioration in the quality of life and a high suicidal risk [1] Healthcare emergency personnel are a high-risk category for the development of PTSD, due to the repeated exposure to stressful and traumatic experiences during their work activities [2] In such healthcare professionals can frequently occur also a Burnout Syndrome, that is a condition resulting from a work-related stress-causing process, determining a combination of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and a reduction of personal abilities [3] PTSD and Burnout present a complex, and not fully explored, relationship, because of the shared risk factors and overlapping symptomatic manifestations [4] Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate PTSD, post-traumatic stress spectrum symptoms, Burnout Syndrome, and their relationship, in a sample of emergency operators of a major University Hospital of Italy Methods: The study sample included 110 emergency operators (Emergency Room, Emergency Medicine, Intensive Care Unit) of the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana (A O U P , Pisa, Italy) Participants were administered the Trauma and Loss Spectrum - Self Report (TALS-SR), to investigate full or partial DSM-5 PTSD and posttraumatic stress spectrum symptoms related to the work activity, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale - Revision IV (ProQOL R-IV), to examine Compassion satisfaction, Burnout and Compassion fatigue related to work We used the Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples to evaluate the differences in ProQOL scales between subjects with full PTSD, partial PTSD and without PTSD Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to verify the possible associations between the TALS-SR symptomatological domains and the three dimensions of ProQOL Results: Fifteen subjects reported a full (15 05%) and 25 a partial (26 88%) symptomatological DSM-5 PTSD The ProQOL Compassion Satisfaction subscale mean score did not show statistically significant differences between the three groups Healthcare operators with PTSD reported higher scores with respect to individuals without PTSD in the ProQOL Burnout and the Compassion Fatigue subscales (18 64 9 versus 13 94 4, p=0 014;and 14 384 073 versus 9 93 9, p=0 001 respectively) Pearson's linear correlation between the TALS-SR symptomatological domains, and the ProQOL subscales highlighted significant relationships between Burnout and Reactions to losses or upsetting events (r=0 236, p=0 035), Re-experiencing (r=0 248, p=0 027) or Avoidance and numbing (r=0 319, p=0 004);and between Compassion fatigue and Reactions to losses or upsetting events (r=0 293, p=0 008), Re-experiencing (r=0 359, p=0 001) or Avoidance and numbing (r=0 406, p&lt;0 001) Conclusions: This work underlines a positive correlation between Burnout Syndrome and Post-traumatic stress spectrum symptoms in emergency operators, highlighting the clinical importance of a deeper assessment of work-related trauma and post-traumatic stress manifestations in these subjects to improvethe well-being and to prevent Burnout Syndrome In this regard, increasing attention is required particularly in healthcare emergency operators due to COVID-19 pandemic, in order to strengthen the training of psychological skills aimed at mitigating the impact of a such stressful and traumatic event [5] No conflict of interest","output":"P.602 Burnout and post-traumatic stress spectrum in 110 emergency operators in Italy: a preliminary report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies of crisis communication have increasingly used a critical approach to shift the focus of research from how crises are managed to the role of social power and ideology, but little is known about the discursive construction of resistance in response to global health crises. To fill this niche, this article uses critical discourse analysis to investigate how Chinas state-run media resisted what it deemed to be undue foreign hostility towards China over the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on an analysis of 63 reports in Chinas English-language news media, the article finds that the Chinese media developed a discourse of resistance via three main strategies: enemification, victimisation and heroisation. These strategies draw on a variety of linguistic mechanisms, specifically argumentative topoi, nominations, predications and metaphors. The discourse of resistance constructed by the Chinese media has implications for how nationalism and humanitarianism are practised and promoted in China. The article shows that the state-run media constructed a discourse of resistance as part of Chinas response to the COVID crisis, to help shape Chinas national image and to convey its geopolitical messages to the world.

Indeed, the number of antiviral mAbs developed in recent years has grown exponentially. Although their direct effects on viral blunting have been studied in detail, their potential immunomodulatory actions have been overlooked until recently. The ability of antiviral mAbs to modulate antiviral immune responses in infected organisms has recently been revealed. More specifically, upon recognition of their cognate antigens, mAbs form immune complexes (ICs) that can be recognized by the Fc receptors expressed on different immune cells of infected individuals. This binding may be followed by the modulation of the host immune responses. Harnessing this immunomodulatory property may facilitate improvements in the therapeutic potential of antiviral mAbs. This review focuses on the role of ICs formed with different viral determinants and mAbs in the induction of antiviral immune responses in the context of both passive immunotherapies and vaccination strategies. Potential deleterious effects of ICs on the host immune response are also discussed.","output":"Converting monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapies from passive to active: bringing immune complexes into play"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002, which had a high morbidity rate and caused worldwide alarm, remains untreated today even though SARS was eventually isolated and controlled. Development and high-throughput screening of efficacious drugs is therefore critical. However, currently there remains a lack of such a safe system. Here, the generation and characterization of the first selectable, SARSCcoronavirus (SARSCCoV)-based replicon cell line which can be used for screening is described. Partial SARSCCoV cDNAs and antibiotic resistance/reporter gene DNA were generated and assembled in vitro to produce the replicon transcription template, which was then transcribed in vitro to generate the replicon RNA. The latter was introduced into a mammalian cell line and the transfected cells were selected for by antibiotic application. For the antibiotic-resistant cell lines thus generated, the expression of reporter gene was ensured by continued monitoring using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. The suitability of this replicon cell line in drug screening was demonstrated by testing the inhibitory effect of several existing drugs and the results demonstrate that the SARSCCoV replicon cell lines provide a safe tool for the identification of SARSCCoV replicase inhibitors. The replicon cell lines thus developed can be applied to high-throughput screening for anti-SARS drugs without the need to grow infectious SARSCCoV.","output":"Derivation of a novel SARSCcoronavirus replicon cell line and its application for anti-SARS drug screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Astroviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.

METHODS Witnessed non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients (n=108) were randomized to receive standard care with (n=53) or without pharyngeal cooling (n=55). In the emergency room, pharyngeal cooling was initiated before or shortly after return of spontaneous circulation by perfusing physiological saline (5 C) into a pharyngeal cuff for 120 min. RESULTS There was a significant decrease in tympanic temperature at 40 min after arrival (P=0.02) with a maximum difference between the groups at 120 min (32.9  1.2C, pharyngeal cooling group vs. 34.1  1.3C, control group; P<0.001). The return of spontaneous circulation (70% vs. 65%, P=0.63) and rearrest (38% vs. 47%, P=0.45) rates were not significantly different based on the initiation of pharyngeal cooling. No post-treatment mechanical or cold-related injury was observed on the pharyngeal epithelium by macroscopic observation. The thrombocytopaenia incidence was lower in the pharyngeal cooling group (P=0.001) during the 3-day period after arrival.

Legionnaire's disease can be differentiated from typical CAPs and from other atypical CAPs based on its characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement. The first clinically useful diagnostic weighted point score system for the clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was developed by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital in the 1980s. It has proven to be diagnostically accurate and useful for more than two decades, but was time-consuming. Because Legionella spp. diagnostic tests are time-dependent and problematic, a need was perceived for a rapid, simple way to render a clinical, syndromic diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease pending Legionella test results. During the herald wave of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic in the New York area, our hospital, like others, was inundated with patients who presented to the Emergency Department with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) for H1N1 testing/evaluation. Most patients with ILIs did not have swine influenza. Hospitalized patients with ILIs who tested positive with rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) were placed on influenza precautions and treated with oseltamivir. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of adult patients admitted with an ILI had negative RIDTs. Because the definitive laboratory diagnosis of H1N1 pneumonia by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), testing was restricted by health departments, resulted in clinical and infection control dilemmas in determining which RIDT-negative patients did, in fact, have H1N1 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, a diagnostic weighted point score system was developed for H1N1 pneumonia patients, based on RT-PCR positivity by the Infectious Disease Division at Winthrop-University Hospital. This diagnostic point score system for hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs was time-consuming. As the pandemic progressed, a simplified diagnostic swine influenza (H1N1) triad was developed for the rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia, which also differentiated it from its mimics as well as from bacterial pneumonia, eg, Legionnaires' disease. During the herald wave of the H1N1 pandemic, we noticed an unexplained increase in Legionnaires' disease CAPs. Because clinical resources were stressed to the maximum during the pandemic, it was critically important to rapidly identify patients rapidly with Legionnaire's disease who did not require influenza precautions or oseltamivir, but who did require anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: Based on the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division's diagnostic weighted point score system for Legionnaires' disease (modified), key indicators were identified and became the basis for the diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad was used to make a clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease until the results of Legionella diagnostic tests were reported. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad diagnosed Legionnaires' disease in hospitalized adults with CAPs with extrapulmonary findings (atypical CAP) and relative bradycardia, accompanied by any three (ie, a triad) of the following: otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, early/mildly elevated serum transaminases (SGOT/SGPT), highly increased ferritin levels (2  n), or hypophosphatemia. The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad provides clinicians with a rapid way to clinically diagnose Legionnaires' disease, pending Legionella test results. RESULTS: The accuracy of the diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad was confirmed in our 9 cases of Legionnaires' disease by subsequent Legionella diagnostic testing. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic Legionnaires' disease triad is particularly useful in situations where a rapid clinical syndromic diagnosis is needed, ie, during an H1N1 pandemic.","output":"Rapid clinical diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease during the herald wave of the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic: The Legionnaires' disease triad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 39-year-old, previously healthy, white male with no personal or family history of mental illness presented with new, first-time psychotic symptoms.

We also review clinical recommendations on inpatient care, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapeutic interventions for people with AUD/OUD and co-occurring suicidal ideation and behavior. RECENT FINDINGS: Among people with an underlying vulnerability to risk-taking and impulsive behaviors, chronic alcohol intoxication can increase maladaptive coping behaviors and hinder self-regulation, thereby increasing the risk of suicide. Additionally, chronic opioid use can result in neurobiological changes that lead to increases in negative affective states, jointly contributing to suicide risk and continued opioid use. Despite significantly elevated suicide risk in individuals with AUD/OUD, there is a dearth of research on pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for co-occurring AUD/OUD and suicidal ideation and behavior.

The epidemic spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas. Reanalysis of all available epidemiological data resulted in a total of 5327 probable cases of SARS, of whom 343 died. The resulting case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4% was less than half of that in other SARS-affected countries or areas, and this difference could only partly be explained by younger age of patients and higher number of community acquired infections. Analysis of the impact of interventions demonstrated that strong political commitment and a centrally coordinated response was the most important factor to control SARS in mainland China, whereas the most stringent control measures were all initiated when the epidemic was already dying down. The long-term economic consequence of the epidemic was limited, much consumption was merely postponed, but for Beijing irrecoverable losses to the tourist sector were considerable.

Ag-RDTs are more rapid, but less reliable in terms of sensitivity, and real-life data on their performance in comparison with the real time RT-PCR test are lacking. Methods: We aimed at assessing the diagnostic performance of the third-generation antigenic swab LumiraDx?compared with real time RT-PCR in a retrospective cohort study at the Infectious Diseases Unit of Padua. All of the patients who were consecutively tested for SARS-CoV-2 in our centre (by both real time RT-PCR and Ag-RTD LumiraDxTM) from 19 January to 30 May 2021, were included. Cycle-threshold (Ct) values of positive real time RT-PCR were recorded as well as the number of days from symptoms' onset to testing. Results: Among the 282 patients included, 80.9% (N = 228) tested positive to real time RT-PCR, and among these, 174 tested positive also to LumiraDx?. Compared with real time RT-PCR, which is considered as the gold standard for the assessment of the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, LumiraDx?showed an overall sensitivity of 76.3% and specificity of 94.4%. Sensitivity increased to 91% when testing was performed <10 days from symptoms' onset, and to 95% when considering Ct < 25. Multivariable binomial logistic regression showed that false negative LumiraDx?results were significantly associated with high Ct values, and with further testing from symptoms' onset. Conclusions: The results of our study suggested that the LumiraDx?SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay may be appropriate for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in its early phase when the test largely meets the performance requirements of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).","output":"Rapid Antigen Test LumiraDxTM vs. Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for the Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has forced us to stay home, but have we been home long enough to tackle the way it has exacerbated the reality that some humans remain more equal than others?

The contagious disease infected a large proportion of the world population, resulting in long-term health issues and an excessive mortality rate. The SARS CoV-2 virus can spread as small aerosols and enters the respiratory systems through the oral (nose or mouth) airway. The SARS CoV-2 particle transport to the mouth-throat and upper airways is analyzed by the available literature. Due to the tiny size, the virus can travel to the terminal airways of the respiratory system and form a severe health hazard. There is a gap in the understanding of the SARS CoV-2 particle transport to the terminal airways. The present study investigated the SARS CoV-2 virus particle transport and deposition to the terminal airways in a complex 17-generation lung model. This first-ever study demonstrates how far SARS CoV-2 particles can travel in the respiratory system. ANSYS Fluent solver was used to simulate the virus particle transport during sleep and light and heavy activity conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that a higher percentage of the virus particles are trapped at the upper airways when sleeping and in a light activity condition. More virus particles have lung contact in the right lung than the left lung. A comprehensive lobe specific deposition and deposition concentration study was performed.

Many educators are hesitant to give authority to an automated system, especially in assessment tasks such as grading constructed response items. However, evaluating free-response text can be time and labor costly for one rater, let alone multiple raters. In addition, some degree of inconsistency exists within and between raters for assessing a given task. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing have resulted in subsequent improvements for technologies that rely on artificial intelligence and human language. New, state-of-the-art models such as BERT, an open source, pre-trained language model, have decreased the amount of training data needed for specific tasks and in turn, have reduced the amount of human annotation necessary for producing a high-quality classification model. After training BERT on expert ratings of constructed responses, we use subsequent automated grading to calculate Cohens Kappa as a measure of inter-rater reliability between the automated system and the human rater. For practical application, when the inter-rater reliability metric is unsatisfactory, we suggest that the human rater(s) use the automated model to call attention to ratings where a second opinion might be needed to confirm the raters correctness and consistency of judgement.","output":"Exploring Automatic Short Answer Grading as a Tool to Assist in Human Rating"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective The current study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of stroke development during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and analyze the related characteristics, such as etiology, age group, associated comorbidities, and prognosis Methods A narrative was performed using the descriptors [?novel coronavirus?] AND [?stroke?] in the PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Lilacs, and Biblioteca Virtual em Sade (BVS) databases, including studies published between December 1, 2019, and April 28, 2020 Results A total of 142 articles were identified, with 89 of them in the PubMed database, 46 in Science Direct, and 7 in Google Scholar No articles were found using the defined keywords in the Lilacs and BVS databases A total of 22 articles were included for final evaluation We observed that infection by the novel coronavirus caused a greater risk of the occurrence of stroke, with several studies suggesting etiological mechanisms, such as the involvement of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, viral invasion, and hypoxia as well as the increase in D-dimer and the reduction in platelets, which had been commonly observed in COVID-19 cases The most common complication of stroke was found among the elderly with preexisting comorbidities, mainly cardiovascular disease We detected reports of strokes among young people with no preexisting risk factors for thromboembolic events, in which the mechanism related to the viral infection was the most probable cause In this review, we confirmed that stroke is part of the spectrum of clinical manifestations resulting from COVID-19 and is associated with a worse prognosis Cerebrovascular lesions resulting from complications of the infection by the novel coronavirus occurred as a result of ischemic, hemorrhagic, and/or thromboembolic etiologies Conclusion The occurrence of stroke during the pandemic as a result of the novel coronavirus has a multifactorial character, and emergency physicians should focus on systematic measures for its screening and accurate diagnosis as well as on appropriate interventions based on early decisionmaking that may have a favorable impact on reducing damage and saving lives","output":"Stroke in patients infected by the novel coronavirus and its causal mechanisms: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the main problems in controlling COVID-19 epidemic spread is the delay in confirming cases.

In theory, targeting human proteins should provide an advantage over targeting viral proteins in terms of drug resistance, which is commonly a problem in treating RNA viruses. This paper focuses on the human protein TMPRSS2, which supports coronavirus life cycles by cleaving viral spike proteins. The three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 is not known and so we have generated models of the TMPRSS2 in the apo state as well as in complex with a peptide substrate and putative inhibitors to aid future work. Importantly, many related human proteases have 80% or higher identity with TMPRSS2 in the S1-S1' subsites, with plasminogen and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) having 95% identity. We highlight 376 approved, investigational or experimental drugs targeting S1A serine proteases that may also inhibit TMPRSS2. Whilst the presence of a relatively uncommon lysine residue in the S2/S3 subsites means that some serine protease inhibitors will not inhibit TMPRSS2, this residue is likely to provide a handle for selective targeting in a focused drug discovery project.

Reports on cognitive assessment of patients with COVID-19 are often limited to orientation alone. Further assessment may seem to create an inappropriate burden for patients with acute COVID-19, which is characterized by fatigue and confusion, and may also compromise examiner safety. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess cognition in patients with COVID-19 as comprehensively as possible in a brief format, while observing safety precautions, and to establish a clear face value of the external validity of the assessment. METHODS: We adapted a brief cognitive assessment, previously applied to liver transplant candidates and medical/surgical inpatients, for remote use in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment. Collecting quality assurance data from telephone-administered assessments, this report presents a series of 6 COVID-19 case vignettes to illustrate the use of this 5-minute assessment in the diagnosis and treatment of brain effects. Primary medical teams referred the cases for neuropsychiatric consultation. RESULTS: The age of the patients varied over four decades, and none of them were able to engage meaningfully with their surroundings on admission. On follow-up examination 6 to 10 days later, 4 of the 6 patients had recovered working memory, and only 1 had recovered calculation ability. Of the 6 patients, 2 were capable of complex judgment responses, while none of the cases completed frontal executive function testing in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive assessment in patients with COVID-19 using this remote examination reveals patterns of cognitive recovery that vary among cases and are far more complex than loss of orientation. In this series, testing of specific temporal, parietal, and frontal lobe functions suggests that calculation ability, judgment, and especially frontal executive functions may characterize the effects of COVID-19 on the brain. Used widely and serially, this examination method can potentially inform our understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on the brain and of healing from the virus.","output":"A 5-Minute Cognitive Assessment for Safe Remote Use in Patients With COVID-19: Clinical Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among Italy, Spain, and Japan, the age distributions of COVID-19 mortality show only small variation even though the number of deaths per country shows large variation. To understand the determinant for this situation, we constructed a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics and natural history of COVID-19 and analyzed the dataset of mortality in Italy, Spain, and Japan. We estimated the parameter which describes the age-dependency of susceptibility by fitting the model to reported data, including the effect of change in contact patterns during the epidemics of COVID-19, and the fraction of symptomatic infections. Our study revealed that if the mortality rate or the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases does not depend on age, then unrealistically different age-dependencies of susceptibilities against COVID-19 infections between Italy, Japan, and Spain are required to explain the similar age distribution of mortality but different basic reproduction numbers (R(0)). Variation of susceptibility by age itself cannot explain the robust age distribution in mortality by COVID-19 infections in those three countries, however it does suggest that the age-dependencies of (i) the mortality rate and (ii) the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases determine the age distribution of mortality by COVID-19.","output":"The age distribution of mortality from novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests no large difference of susceptibility by age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ISUP (Internal Society of Urologic Pathology) recently adopted a five-tiered prognostication system.

A systematic search of the literature for all studies examining the heterogeneity of the ISUP grade group 4 was conducted. Available studies were combined with meta-analysis to evaluate prognostic differences within the ISUP grade group 4 measured by all-cause mortality (ACM) and the prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Eight studies were identified and utilised a variety of outcome measures to answer the question of heterogeneity within the ISUP grade group 4. Four of these studies examined prognosis using both ACM and PCSM. These were combined into a meta-analysis. The combined group of 5 + 3/3 + 5 had statistically significant higher ACM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% confidence internal [Cl] 1.08-1.41) when compared to the 4 + 4 group. There was no difference in the PCSM between the two groups (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89-2.01). However, heterogeneity was high for this analysis secondary to a range of methodological differences.

In stroke, delayed or avoided care may translate to substantial morbidity. We sought to determine the effect of the pandemic on patterns of stroke patient presentation and quality of care. METHODS: We analyzed data from 25 New England hospitals: one urban, academic comprehensive stroke center and telestroke hub, and 24 spoke hospitals in the telestroke network. We included all telestroke consultations from the 24 spokes, and all stroke admissions to the comprehensive stroke center hub from November 1, 2019 through April 30, 2020. We compared rates of presentation, timeliness presentation, and quality of care pre- versus post-March 1, 2020. We examined trends in patient demographics, stroke severity, timeliness, diagnoses including large vessel occlusion, alteplase use, and endovascular thrombectomy among eligible subjects. We compared proportions and bivariate comparisons to examine for changes pre- versus post-March 1, 2020 and used linear regression to examine trends over time. RESULTS: Among 1248 patient presentations (844 telestroke consultations, 404 comprehensive stroke center admissions), telestroke consultations and ischemic stroke patient admissions decreased among the spokes and hub. Age and stroke severity were unchanged over the study period. We found no change in alteplase administration at telestroke spoke hospitals but did note a decrease in both alteplase use and thrombectomy at our comprehensive stroke center. Time metrics for patient presentation and care delivery were unchanged; however, rates of adherence for the quality measures dysphagia screening, early antithrombotic initiation, and early venous thromboembolism prophylaxis were reduced during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In this regional analysis, we found decreasing telestroke consultations and ischemic stroke admissions, and reduced performance on stroke quality of care measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to prior reports, we did not find an increase in thrombectomy nor decrease in clinical severity that might be expected if patients with milder symptoms avoided hospitalization.","output":"Regional Changes in Patterns of Stroke Presentation During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the time of its appearance until present, COVID-19 has spread worldwide, with over 71 million confirmed cases and over 1.6 million deaths reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Herein, we report the evaluation of several thiazole/thiadiazole/benzothiazole based thiazolidinone derivatives which were chosen from 112 designed derivatives by docking as potential molecules to inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The contained experimental data revealed that among the fifteen compounds chosen, five compounds (k3, c1, n2, A2, A1) showed inhibitory activity with IC50 within the range of 0.01C34.4 ̦. By assessing the cellular effects of these molecules, we observed that they also had the capacity to affect the cellular viability of human normal MRC-5 cells, albeit with a degree of variation.

A common rationale for these types of experiments is to identify therapeutic targets based on the assumption that microbial or host factors that confer extreme animal model survival phenotypes represent critical virulence and host defense factors. Yet null mutant strains of microbial (or host) factors often yield extreme survival curve phenotypes because they fail to establish an infection. The lack of infection and disease establishment prevents true assessment of the given factors role(s) in disease progression. Here, we posit that the emphasis on extreme survival curve phenotypes in fungal infectious disease models is leading to missed opportunities to identify new fungal and host factors critical for disease progression. We simply do not yet have a sufficient understanding of fungal virulence and host defense mechanisms throughout the temporal course of an infection. We propose that there is a need to develop new approaches and to revisit tried and true methods to define infection site biology beyond the analysis of survival curve phenotypes. To stimulate these new approaches, we propose the (new) terms disease initiation factor and disease progression factor to distinguish functional roles at distinct temporal stages of an infection and give us targets to foster new discoveries.","output":"Is It Time To Kill the Survival Curve?

Such a transition has faced many challenges. Profit-driven practices in hospitals designated to tuberculosis and an absence of adequate tuberculosis-related training for health professionals are partially jeopardising the quality of tuberculosis care. In addition, primary health-care providers are not incentivised to make referrals and manage cases effectively. The CDC does not have the administrative power to influence hospital practices or deploy resources to support community-based tuberculosis control activities.

These are waves of huge social energy. Often they are of destructive character, a kind of information tsunami. However, they can also carry positive improvements in human society, as waves of decision-making matching rational recommendations of societal institutes. The main distinguishing features of these waves are their high amplitude, coherence (homogeneous character of social actions generated by them), and short time needed for their generation and relaxation. Such waves can be treated as large-scale exhibitions of the bandwagon effect. We show that this socio-psychic phenomenon can be modeled based on the recently developed social laser theory. This theory can be used to model stimulated amplification of coherent social actions. Actions are treated very generally, from mass protests to votes and other collective decisions, such as, e.g., acceptance (often unconscious) of some societal recommendations. In this paper, we concentrate on the theory of laser resonators, physical vs. social. For the latter, we analyze in detail the functioning of Internet-based echo chambers. Their main purpose is increasing of the power of the quantum information field as well as its coherence. Of course, the bandwagon effect is well known and well studied in social psychology.

A relationship between COVID-19 and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) has been suggested, but to our knowledge, there have been no case reports strongly describing this association. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for asthma presented to our hospital with severe asthma exacerbation. The patient was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). During her ICU admission, she was found to have COVID-19 pneumonia. On day 16 of hospitalization, she was diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient also had encephalopathy and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging on day 24 which revealed innumerable acute embolic infarcts. On day 27, the patient was diagnosed with an acute deep vein thrombosis in her left lower extremity, but she was not started on anticoagulation due to concern of a lower gastrointestinal bleed. Laboratory workup revealed elevated anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL), both IgG and IgM, and elevated lupus anticoagulant. She was diagnosed with CAPS and received 4 sessions of plasmapheresis and was also started on methylprednisolone and intravenous heparin. Our patient had no improvement in mental status with initiation of therapy. On day 39, she underwent repeat head computed tomography scans, which showed right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage. Patient was provided comfort care and died on day 41 of hospitalization. DISCUSSION: CAPS is a severe form of APL. IgG aCL is seen in 81% of patients;IgM aCL was identified in 49% and lupus anticoagulant in 83%. [1, 2]. Triggering factors were identified in 65% of the CAPS flares. The most common triggers were infections, (49% of episodes) and the most common site for infections was pulmonary (33%). Infections included viruses, bacteria and parasites. [1, 2]. Other differentials were considered for our patient, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation, but were less likely given the negative hemolysis workup. Although this patient had no known history of previous positive APL antibodies or histopathological evidence of small vessel occlusion, she was diagnosed with CAPS based on evidence of multiple thrombotic events in 3 different organs within <2 weeks, along with positive aPLs. CONCLUSIONS: This case represents a potential link between COVID-19 and CAPS. We hope to raise awareness of the need for continued workup for hypercoagulable states in patients with COVID-19 and suggest that CAPS should be considered as one possible cause. We also hope to raise concern for the possibility of CAPS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who show evidence of repeated incidence of thromboses in multiple organs, as this is a potentially treatable condition.

Although thyroidectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures, the safest, most efficient, and cost-effective way to achieve hemostasis is hotly debated. DATA SOURCES We searched the electronic databases Medline and the Cochrane Library using relevant search strategies. REVIEW METHODS Two reviewers (G.W., T.E.) independently assessed titles and abstracts of 72 identified studies. Twelve prospective randomized controlled studies were considered relevant and included in this meta-analysis (1153 patients). RESULTS In all studies, operating time was reduced by using the harmonic scalpel. Compared with surgical hemostasis by suture ligation or suture/clip ligation combined with electrocauterization or electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (n = 602), the mean operating time reduction for the harmonic scalpel was equivalent to 22.67 minutes (95% CI, -27.98; -17.37, P < 0.00001) or nearly 25 percent of the total operating room time. When harmonic scalpel was used, blood loss was reduced significantly by 20.03 mL (95% CI, -27.83; -12.22, P < 0.00001), and a mean reduction in postoperative pain (0.86 points [95% CI, -1.60; -0.13, P = 0.02]) was measured.

The causes of CAP vary depending on individual susceptibility, the epidemiological characteristics of the community, and the season. We performed this study to establish a nationwide surveillance network system and identify the causative agents for CAP and antibiotic resistance in Korean children with CAP. METHODS: The monitoring network was composed of 28 secondary and tertiary medical institutions. Upper and lower respiratory samples were assayed using a culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from August 2018 to May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1023 cases were registered in patients with CAP, and PCR of atypical pneumonia pathogens revealed 422 cases of M. pneumoniae (41.3%). Respiratory viruses showed a positivity rate of 65.7% by multiplex PCR test, and human rhinovirus was the most common virus, with 312 cases (30.5%). Two hundred sixty four cases (25.8%) were isolated by culture, including 131 cases of S. aureus (12.8%), 92 cases of S. pneumoniae (9%), and 20 cases of H. influenzae (2%). The cultured, isolated bacteria may be colonized pathogen. The proportion of co-detection was 49.2%. The rate of antibiotic resistance showed similar results as previous reports.

METHOD: A population-based comparative cohort study was conducted using the national claims database. Individuals aged 65 years with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 10, 2020 were assessed. The endpoints for evaluating mortality for all participants were death, 21 days after diagnosis, or April 10, 2020. The risk of mortality associated with mental disorders was estimated using Cox hazards regression. RESULTS: We identified 814 elderly COVID-19 patients (255 [31.3%] with mental disorder and 559 [68.7%] with non-mental disorder). Individuals with mental disorders were found more likely to be older, taking antithrombotic agents, and had diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and urinary tract infections than those without mental disorders. After propensity score stratification, our study included 781 patients in each group (236 [30.2%] with mental disorder and 545 [69.8%] with non-mental disorder). The mental disorder group showed higher mortality rates than the non-mental disorder group (12.7% [30/236] versus 6.8% [37/545]). However, compared to patients without mental disorders, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in elderly COVID-19 patients with mental disorders was not statistically significant (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 0.95-2.56). CONCLUSION: Although the association between mental disorders in elderly individuals and mortality in COVID-19 is unclear, this study suggests that elderly patients with comorbid conditions and those taking psychiatric medications might be at a higher risk of COVID-19.","output":"Risk of mortality in elderly COVID-19 patients with mental health disorders: a nationwide retrospective study in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between weather and COVID-19 fatality rates during US stay-at-home orders. METHODS: With a county-level longitudinal design, this study analyzed COVID-19 deaths from public health departments' daily reports and considered exposure as the 18 to 22 day-period before death. Models included state-level social distancing measures, Census Bureau demographics, daily weather information, and daily air pollution. The primary measures included minimum and maximum daily temperature, precipitation, ozone concentration, PM2.5 concentrations, and U.V. light index. RESULTS: A 1a??F increase in the minimum temperature was associated with 1.9% (95% CI, 0.2% to 3.6%) increase in deaths 20a??days later. An ozone concentration increase of 1a??ppb (part per billion) decreased daily deaths by 2.0% (95% CI, 0.1% to 3.6%); ozone levels below 38a??ppb negatively correlated with deaths.

Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) has attracted attention. The aim of this review was evidence synthesis on the effect of BCG vaccine in preventing severe infectious respiratory disease including COVD-19, but not tuberculosis. We considered studies conducted on human participants of any study design from any country setting that were published in Enlgish. We did a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Scopus and Google scholar databases and a free search on Google. The identified studies were appraised and relevant data were extracted using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. The extracted findings were synthesized with tables and narrative summary. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicated that BCG vaccine has a strong protective effect against both upper and lower acute respiratory tract infections. For instance in countries with universal BCG vaccination policy, the incidence of COVID-19 was lower compared to the counterparts. Addtionally, BCG vaccine was found to protect against infections like lethal influenza A virus, pandemic influenza (H1N1), and other acute respiratory tract infections. BCG improved the human body's immune response involving antigen-specific T cells and memory cells. It also induced adaptive functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects against different respiratory infections other than tuberculosis. In countries with universal BCG vaccination, the incidence and death from acute respiratory viral infection including COVID - 19 is significantly low. However, there is an urgent need for further evidence from well-designed studies to understand the possible role of BCG vaccination over time and across age groups, its possible benefits in special populations such as health workers and cost-savings related to a policy of universal BCG vaccination.","output":"The effect of Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination in preventing severe infectious respiratory diseases other than TB: Implications for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) still remains a key procedure to appropriately stage melanoma patients and to select those who are candidate to novel treatments with immunotherapy and targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting. The impact of timing of SNB on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) is still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted at 6 Italian Melanoma Intergroup (IMI) centres and included 8953 consecutive clinical stage I-II melanoma patients who were diagnosed, treated, and followed up between November 1997 and March 2018. All patients were prospectively included in dedicated IMI database. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate how baseline characteristics and time interval until SNB are related to DFS and OS. RESULTS: Considering the whole population, at multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, Breslow thickness, site, ulceration, and the SNB status, a delay in the timing of SNB was associated with a better DFS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR, delayed versus early SNB] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97C0.99, p < 0.001) and OS (aHR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97C0.99, p = 0.001). Specifically, in patients with a negative SNB status, a beneficial impact of delayed SNB (i.e. at least 32 days after primary excision) was confirmed for DFS (aHR 0.70, 95%CI 0.63C0.79, p < 0.001) and OS (aHR 0.69, 95%CI 0.61C0.78, p < 0.001), whereas in those with a positive SNB status, DFS (aHR 0.96, 95%CI 0.84C1.09, p = 0.534) and OS (aHR 0.94 95%CI 0.81C1.08, p = 0.374) were not significantly different in patients with early or delayed SNB. CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not support a strict time interval for SNB.

However, the world breathed a sigh of relief when a few countries announced the development of a vaccine and gradually began to distribute it. Nevertheless, the emergence of another wave of this pandemic returned us to the starting point. At present, early detection of infected people is the paramount concern of both specialists and health researchers. This paper proposes a method to detect infected patients through chest x-ray images by using the large dataset available online for COVID-19 (COVIDx), which consists of 2128 X-ray images of COVID-19 cases, 8,066 normal cases, and 5,575 cases of pneumonia. A hybrid algorithm is applied to improve image quality before undertaking neural network training. This algorithm combines two different noise-reduction filters in the image, followed by a contrast enhancement algorithm. To detect COVID-19, we propose a novel convolution neural network (CNN) architecture called KL-MOB (COVID-19 detection network based on the MobileNet structure). The performance of KL-MOB is boosted by adding the KullbackCLeibler (KL) divergence loss function when trained from scratch. The KL divergence loss function is adopted for content-based image retrieval and fine-grained classification to improve the quality of image representation. The results are impressive: the overall benchmark accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision are 98.7%, 98.32%, 98.82% and 98.37%, respectively. These promising results should help other researchers develop innovative methods to aid specialists. The tremendous potential of the method proposed herein can also be used to detect COVID-19 quickly and safely in patients throughout the world.","output":"KL-MOB: automated COVID-19 recognition using a novel approach based on image enhancement and a modified MobileNet CNN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School leaders will face great challenges balancing health considerations of students and school staff with powerful political forces demanding that schools reopen as early as possible In order to navigate this new educational landscape, school leaders will need to work with medical and public health officials to acquire health literacy This will enable them to understand medically accurate information while rejecting politically inspired misinformation they will receive in the coming year Health literacy will be an important skill needed by educational leaders to make the best possible decisions during this unprecedented pandemic ? 2020 All Rights Reserved","output":"Educational Leaders Need for Health Literacy During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of engineers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in the elimination of health disparities, while not always visible, has important implications for the attainment of impactful solutions.

Four literature databases were searched for English-language articles reporting results from cohort studies and clinical trials, published from 2015 until March 2021. Moreover, registered private eHealth clinics in Denmark were evaluated with reference to a recent national audit of patient safety issues in eHealth. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved four intervention studies. The studies did not identify any particular patient safety risks associated with the use of eHealth. Many different authorized healthcare providers (preferably, doctors) apply eHealth in various contexts. eHealth is being used as the only form of contact between the healthcare provider and the patient, as a supplement to patient visitations in an outpatient clinic, or as a tool for communicating between two or more healthcare providers. The regulation of eHealth involves patient safety issues but also has interfaces to marketing, IT systems, and infrastructure. Supervision of eHealth includes the organization of clinics, handling patient charts, prescription medicine, patient legal rights, and patient transition. However, there are many interfaces in the division of responsibilities among the various governmental players.

SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry to host cells in the respiratory tract epithelium. Clinical features post viral infection include symptoms of viral pneumonia, fever, cough, chest discomfort, and in severe cases dyspnea and bilateral lung infiltration. Adults with any age are at risk of getting COVID-19, however co-morbidities like hypertension, COPD, smoking, type 2 diabetes, asthma, obesity etc. increase infection susceptibility. Modern day therapeutics to control aforementioned health conditions include angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEi), and anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine. Since binding of viral spike protein with receptor ACE2 initiates viral entry in the host, hence ACE2 has been one of the main candidates to understand the mechanism of viral infection. In this study our aim was to investigate if ACE2 expression levels can be modulated with therapeutic interventions. Methods: In an in vitro model of monolayer cultures, human airway epithelial (1HAEo-) cell lines were treated with losartan and telmisartan (ARB), captopril (ACEi), and hydroxychloroquine at half-log concentrations from 1 to 100 M, and fluticasone, ciclesonide, and dexamethasone (steroids) at half-log concentrations from 0.3 to 10 M. Whole cell lysates were obtained at 24hr post-treatment to quantify ACE2 expression via western blotting. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Results: The in vitro experiments have shown that total ACE2 protein expression in 1HAEo-cells is modulated in response to certain drugs. Compared to untreated control cells, losartan treatment showed 45 % significant increase in ACE2 expression at both 3 M and 10 M concentrations (p&lt; 0.01), whereas dexamethasone showed  40% significant increase at 10 M dose (p&lt; 0.001). Captopril treatment showed 35% decrease at 30 and 100 M (p&lt;0.01), whereas ciclesonide treatment demonstrated statistically significant decrease in ACE2 expression with all tested concentrations. No difference in ACE2 expression was observed with telmisartan and hydroxychloroquine treatments. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that daily medications like losartan, captopril, dexamethasone and ciclesonide for certain pre-existing conditions may modulate ACE2 protein levels in airway epithelium hence possibly priming for COVID19 infections if exposed. This affect susceptibility for COVID19 infection and severity of illness in vulnerable populations. Hence basic understanding of mechanism of action for daily standard of care prophylactic therapies can reduce or prevent SAR-CoV-2 infection in at-risk individuals.","output":"Effect of therapeutics on the modulation of ACE2 expression in airway epithelium: Implications for covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mounting evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involves a hyperinflammatory response predisposing patients to thromboembolic disease and acute respiratory distress.

The pandemic, highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has indeed caused considerable morbidity and mortality and drastically changed our everyday lives. As we continue to become acquainted with the seventh coronavirus known to infect our species, a number of its characteristics keep surprising us. Among those is the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations of the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which ranges from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. MAIN BODY: Data, now from patient populations, are beginning to accumulate on human genetic factors that may contribute to the observed diversified disease severity. Therefore, we deemed it prudent to review the associations between specific human genetic variants and clinical disease severity or susceptibility to infection that have been reported in the literature to date (at the time of writing this article in early August 2020 with updates in mid-September). With this work, we hope (i) to assist the fast-paced biomedical research efforts to combat the virus by critically summarizing current knowledge on the potential role of host genetics, and (ii) to help guide current genetics and genomics research towards candidate gene variants that warrant further investigation in larger studies. We found that determinants of differing severity of COVID-19 predominantly include components of the immune response to the virus, while determinants of differing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 mostly entail genes related to the initial stages of infection (i.e., binding of the cell surface receptor and entry). CONCLUSION: Elucidating the genetic determinants of COVID-19 severity and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection would allow for the stratification of individuals according to risk so that those at high risk would be prioritized for immunization, for example, if or when safe and effective vaccines are developed. Our enhanced understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms could also guide personalized therapeutics. Such knowledge is already beginning to provide clues that help explain, at least in part, current epidemiologic observations regarding the typically more severe or benign disease course in older males and children, respectively.","output":"Human genetic factors associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on fine-grained data on short-term accommodations for the city of Barcelona, we review the uneven impact of the pandemic on the short-term market, differentiating the supply by type of accommodation: single room versus entire flat/house, and type of host: professionalized versus non-professionalized. Using a fixed effects approach at property level, we estimate an average decrease in prices of 11.3% in entire flat/house and 4.7% in single rooms. For professionalized supply, the effect arrived to 13.6% and 9.8%, respectively. Finally, a growth in minimum stay was experienced by all types, but with a stronger effect on professionalized accommodations.

In addition, the type of short-term supply that experienced the strongest drop in occupancy was the non-professionalized segment, loosing around 41% of their bookings between April 2020 and January 2021.","output":"The effect of COVID-19 on the peer-to-peer rental market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical condition in children In the UK, appendicectomy is the most common treatment with non-operative management unusual Due to concerns about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during surgical procedures, surgeons were advised to consider non-operative treatment and avoid laparoscopy where possible This study aims to report management and outcomes, to date, of children with appendicitis in the UK and Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic Design Survey of consultant surgeons who treat children with appendicitis that informed a prospective multicentre observational cohort study Setting Data were collected from centres in the UK and Ireland for cases admitted between 1 April and 31 May 2020 (first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic) at both general surgical and specialist paediatric surgical centres Participants The study cohort includes 838 children with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of acute appendicitis of which 527 (63%) were male Main outcomes measured Primary outcome was treatment strategy used for acute appendicitis Other outcomes reported include change in treatment strategy over time, use of diagnostic imaging and important patient outcomes to 30 days following hospital admission Results From very early in the pandemic surgeons experienced a change in their management of children with appendicitis and almost all surgeons who responded to the survey anticipated further changes during the pandemic Overall, 326/838 (39%) were initially treated non-operatively of whom 81/326 (25%) proceeded to appendicectomy within the initial hospital admission Of cases treated initially surgically 243/512 (48%) were performed laparoscopically Diagnostic imaging was used in 445/838 (53%) children Cases treated non-operatively had a shorter hospital stay than those treated surgically but hospital readmissions within 30 days were similar between groups In cases treated surgically the negative appendicectomy rate was 4 5% There was a trend towards increased use of surgical treatment and from open to laparoscopic appendicectomy as the pandemic progressed Conclusion Non-operative treatment of appendicitis has been widely used for the first time in children in the UK and Ireland and is safe and effective in selected patients Overall patient outcomes do not appear to have been adversely impacted by change in management during the pandemic thus far","output":"Management and early outcomes of children with appendicitis in the UK and Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey of surgeons and observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Little is known about the views of U.S. youth on COVID-19 or their use of face coverings. Closing this gap could facilitate messaging to promote COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. METHODS: In July 2020, a five-question text message survey was sent to 1,087 youth aged 14-24 years. Questions assessed youths' perceptions regarding the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, the potential impact of contracting COVID-19 on their lives, the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to others, and their use of face coverings around others with whom they do not live. Coding was conducted to assign responses to discrete categories and to identify common themes. RESULTS: Of 1,087 eligible participants, 797 (73.3%) were included in analyses. Of these participants, 27.3% believed they would likely contract COVID-19 in the next few months, 90.3% believed contracting COVID-19 would have a moderate or significant impact on their lives, 86.0% were moderately or very concerned about spreading COVID-19, and 89.2% reported wearing face coverings all or most of the time. Factors affecting face covering use included the desire to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19, peer influence, and policy mandates. CONCLUSIONS: Youths' perceptions regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 varied, but most believed their lives would be adversely impacted if this occurred. Most youth were concerned about spreading COVID-19 and wore face coverings, but many made exceptions to face covering use when around close contacts. Public health campaigns may be most effective if they leverage positive peer influence and appeal to youths' desire not to spread COVID-19 to others.","output":"Views on COVID-19 and Use of Face Coverings Among U.S. Youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 develop acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently, yet gaps remain in understanding why adults seem to have higher rates compared to children. Our objectives were to evaluate the epidemiology of SARS-CoV2-related AKI across the age spectrum and determine if known risk factors such as illness severity contribute to its pattern. METHODS: Secondary analysis of ongoing prospective international cohort registry. AKI was defined by KDIGO-creatinine only criteria. Log-linear, logistic and generalized estimating equations assessed odds ratios (OR), risk differences (RD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for AKI and mortality adjusting for sex, pre-existing comorbidities, race/ethnicity, illness severity, and clustering within centers. Sensitivity analyses assessed different baseline creatinine estimators. RESULTS: Overall, among 6874 hospitalized patients, 39.6% (n = 2719) developed AKI. There was a bimodal distribution of AKI by age with peaks in older age (60 years) and middle childhood (5C15 years), which persisted despite controlling for illness severity, pre-existing comorbidities, or different baseline creatinine estimators. For example, the adjusted OR of developing AKI among hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 was 2.74 (95% CI 1.66C4.56) for 10C15-year-olds compared to 30C35-year-olds and similarly was 2.31 (95% CI 1.71C3.12) for 70C75-year-olds, while adjusted OR dropped to 1.39 (95% CI 0.97C2.00) for 40C45-year-olds compared to 30C35-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV2-related AKI is common with a bimodal age distribution that is not fully explained by known risk factors or confounders. As the pandemic turns to disproportionately impacting younger individuals, this deserves further investigation as the presence of AKI and SARS-CoV2 infection increases hospital mortality risk.

METHODS: A total of 95 paired DBS and serum samples were collected from 74 participants (aged 1-63 years) as part of a household cohort study in Melbourne, Australia. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies specific for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1 proteins between serum and eluates from DBS specimens were compared using an FDA-approved ELISA method. RESULTS: Among the 74 participants, 42% (31/74) were children and the rest were adults. A total of 16 children and 13 adults were SARS-CoV-2 positive by polymerase chain reaction. The IgG seropositivity rate was similar between serum and DBS specimens (18.9% (18/95) versus 16.8% (16/95)), respectively. Similar RBD and S1-specific IgG levels were detected between serum and DBS specimens. Serum IgG levels strongly correlated with DBS IgG levels (r = 0.99, P < 0.0001) for both SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Furthermore, antibodies remained stable in DBS specimens for >3 months. CONCLUSIONS: DBS specimens can be reliably used as an alternative to serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 1) determine the extent of disruption in provision and utilization of health and nutrition services induced by the pandemic in Uttar Pradesh, India; and 2) identify how adaptations were made to restore service provision in response to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal surveys with frontline workers (FLWs, n = 313) and mothers of children <2 y old (n = 659) in December 2019 (in-person) and July 2020 (by phone). We also interviewed block-level managers and obtained administrative data. We examined changes in service provision and utilization using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared with prepandemic, service provision reduced substantially during lockdown (83C98 percentage points, pp), except for home visits and take-home rations (30%). Most FLWs (68%C90%) restored service provision in July 2020, except for immunization and hot cooked meals (<10%). Administrative data showed similar patterns of disruption and restoration. FLW fears, increased workload, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and manpower shortages challenged service provision. Key adaptations made to provide services were delivering services to beneficiary homes (40%C90%), social distancing (80%), and using PPE (40%C50%) and telephones for communication (20%). On the demand side, service utilization reduced substantially (40C80 pp) during the lockdown, but about half of mothers received home visits and food supplementation. Utilization for most services did not improve after the lockdown, bearing the challenges of limited travel (30%), nonavailability of services (26%), and fear of catching the virus when leaving the house (22%) or meeting service providers (14%).

To properly design such policy measures, it is important to quantify their effects in real-time. However, data on the relevant outcomes at the micro level is usually only available with considerable time lags. In this paper, we propose a novel method to assess the distributional consequences of macroeconomic shocks and policy responses in real-time and provide the first application to Germany in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our approach combines different economic models estimated on firm- and household-level data: a VAR-model for output expectations, a structural labor demand model, and a tax-benefit microsimulation model. Our findings show that as of September 2020 the COVID-19 shock translates into a noticeable reduction in gross labor income across the entire income distribution. However, the tax benefit system and discretionary policy responses to the crisis act as important income stabilizers, since the effect on the distribution of disposable household incomes turns progressive: the bottom two deciles actually gain income, the middle deciles are hardly affected, and only the upper deciles lose income.

The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN,the accuracy increased to 95%.

This paper draws upon a study of 506 parents of children aged 1-10 years in Ireland who completed the online Play and Learning in the Early Years (PLEY) Survey during lockdown in May and June 2020. Parents responded to a series of questions about their child's play, learning and development during lockdown, and described the impact of the restrictions on their children's lives. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Findings indicate that most children missed their friends, playing with other children, and the routine and structure of ECEC and school settings. Parents described the negative impact of the closure of these settings on their children's social and emotional well-being, which they suggested, resulted in tantrums, anxiety, clinginess, boredom, and under-stimulation. However, some parents did report positive aspects of lockdown for their children and the family, including more time to play with siblings and a break from the usual routine. While the findings of the PLEY study indicate that children's socio-emotional development was severely disrupted during lockdown, with a variety of negative impacts, this experience was not universal. Moreover, the findings suggest that families missed the nurturing environment provided by ECEC programs that supported their children's socio-emotional development, as well as the structure and routine afforded by their children's participation in early childhood programs.","output":"Missing Early Education and Care During the Pandemic: The Socio-Emotional Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis on Young Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antihyperglycemic activity of ethanolic extract from Salvia polystachya (EESpS) and its products was evaluated using in vivo, ex vivo and in silico assays; additionally, an acute toxicity assay was evaluated.

Results: We demonstrated the impact of asymptomatic transmission in this outbreak and showed the effectiveness of city lockdown to halt virus spread within a city. We further illustrated that sudden emergence of a large number of cases could overwhelm the city medical system, and external medical aids are critical to not only containing the further spread of the virus but also reducing fatality.

The main message from this consensus conference is that both simultaneous pancreas\\\\kidney transplantation (SPK) and pancreas transplantation alone can improve long\\\\term patient survival, and all types of pancreas transplantation dramatically improve the quality of life of recipients. Pancreas transplantation may also improve the course of chronic complications of diabetes, depending on their severity. Therefore, the advantages of pancreas transplantation appear to clearly surpass potential disadvantages. Pancreas after kidney transplantation increases the risk of mortality only in the early period after transplantation, but is associated with improved life expectancy thereafter. Additionally, preemptive SPK, when compared to SPK performed in patients undergoing dialysis, appears to be associated with improved outcomes. Time on dialysis has negative prognostic implications in SPK recipients. Increased long\\\\term survival, improvement in the course of diabetic complications, and amelioration of quality of life justify preferential allocation of kidney grafts to SPK recipients.

In the present study, we aimed to develop a real-time RT-PCR method for detection of BVDV-1 in aerosol samples. METHODS: A pair of primers specific for highly conserved regions of the BVDV-1 5'-UTR was designed. The standard curve and sensitivity of the developed assay were assessed based on 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA molecular standard. The specificity of the assay was evaluated with other pestiviruses and infectious bovine viruses. The clinical performance was examined by testing 169 aerosol samples. RESULTS: The results showed that a good linear relationship existed between the standard curve and the concentration of template. The lowest detection limit was 5.2 RNA molecules per reaction. This assay was specific for detection of BVDV-1, and no amplification was found for other pestiviruses such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), and common infectious bovine viruses, including BVDV-2, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) and bovine coronavirus (BcoV). The assay was highly reproducible with low variation coefficient values (CVs) for intra-assay and inter-assay. A total of 169 aerosol samples collected from six dairy herds were tested using this method. The results showed that the positive detection rate of BVDV-1 was 17.2% (29/169), which was significantly higher compared with the conventional RT-PCR. Additionally, the positive samples (n = 29) detected by real-time RT-PCR were verified by BVDV RPA-LFD, and a concordance rate of 100% was obtained between them. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we developed a real-time RT-PCR assay for quantitative analysis of BVDV-1 in aerosol samples, and our finding provided valuable insights into the risk on aerosol transmission of BVDV-1.","output":"Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus genotype 1 in aerosol by a real time RT-PCR assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diante da pandemia causada pelo novo Coronavrus, o mundo est construindo a??es emergenciais para atender as mais variadas demandas.

However, chemotherapy is often omitted either because of physician bias or because of its underlying comorbidity, thus compromising their survival. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is compounding this issue because of the fear of immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy on the elderly which makes them more vulnerable to the virus. SUMMARY: Immunotherapy has less effect on the patient bone marrow compared to chemotherapy. The potential synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy may improve local control and survival for older patients with selected cancer. Preliminary data are encouraging because of better survival and local control in diseases which are traditionally resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.

It has already been used in China's vaccination program, while 21 other countries (including Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil) also granted emergency use authorization for this vaccine. In Turkey, on January 14, 2021, healthcare workers (HCWs) started to be vaccinated with CoronaVac as the priority group in vaccination. An important question that arose at this time was about how the vaccination schedule would be for people who had previously had Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that those who have had a previous COVID-19 infection can be vaccinated regardless of their previous infection. CDC guidelines also mention that \\"if antibody (Ab) testing was done after the first dose of an mRNA vaccine, the vaccination series should be completed regardless of the Ab test result\\". It should be noted here that this statement applies particularly to mRNA type vaccines, whereas CoronaVac jab is an inactivated type two-dose regimen vaccine. The aim of this study was to present interim results of our ongoing study to compare the effect of two doses of inactivated CoronaVac vaccine on humoral immunity of people who had previously severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and those people who did not have the infection. In our study, CoronaVac jab containing 600 SU inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen was administered as 0.5 ml to 62 HCWs in Yeditepe University Hospital (Istanbul, Turkey), in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Ab levels against spike receptor binding region of SARS-CoV-2 were measured quantitatively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay were performed using Abbott Architect i2000 instrument (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Ab titers were measured before vaccination (Ab0), one month after the first vaccination (Ab1), and one month after the second vaccination (Ab2). The Ab responses of 62 HCWs before and after CoronaVac vaccination were determined. Two groups were created. Group 1 consisted of 18 females and 15 males who were tested as COVID-19 positive, previously. Group 2 consisted of 20 females and 9 males who never had the infection. Minimum, median and maximum Ab0 values of Group1 were 1.6, 180.8 and 5582.6, respectively and Ab1 values were 26.3, 1005.7 and 3923.1; Ab2 values were 202.1, 1119.1 and 2885.9, (in au/mL) respectively. On the other hand, minimum, median and maximum Ab0 values of Group 2 were 0.1, 1.8, and 37.2, Ab1 values were 4.7, 72.7, 470.2, and Ab2 values were 270.3, 746.2 and 5554.1, respectively. In Group 1, 20 of the HCWs showed lower Ab2 titers, while 13 of the HCWs showed higher Ab2 titers than the Ab1 titers. Whereas in Group2 all HCWs had higher Ab2 titers than the Ab1 titers. When the increasing and decreasing Ab2 titers of both groups were evaluated with the 22 contingency table and Fisher's exact chi-square test, a statistically significant difference was found between the groups (p<0.001). As a result, we think that a single dose of CoronaVac vaccine similarly to mRNA vaccines can be administered to people who have had COVID-19 due to the possibility that the Ab levels measured after the first dose of vaccine will decrease after the second dose of vaccine.","output":"[The Second Shot of CoronaVac Vaccine May Cause Reduction of Antibody Levels in People who Previously had COVID-19]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The BNT162b mRNA vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), mimics the immune response to natural infection. Few studies have predicted the adverse effects (AEs) after the second-dose vaccination. We present a predictive model for AEs and immune response after the second-dose of the BNT162b mRNA vaccine. METHODS: To predict AEs, 282 healthcare workers (HCWs) were enrolled in this prospective observational study. The classification and regression tree (CART) model was established, and its predictive efficacy was assessed. To predict immune response, 282 HCWs were included in the analysis. Moreover, the factors affected by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD antibody (s-IgG) were evaluated using serum samples collected 2 months after the second-dose vaccination. The s-IgG level was assessed using Lumipulse G1200. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to evaluate variables associated with anti-s-IgG titer levels. RESULTS: The most common AEs after the second-dose vaccination were pain (87.6%), redness (17.0%) at the injection site, fatigue (68.8%), headache (53.5%), and fever (37.5%). Based on the CART model, headache after the first-dose vaccination and age < 30 years were identified as the first and second discriminators for predicting the headache after the second-dose vaccination, respectively. In the multiple linear regression model, anti-s-IgG titer levels were associated with age, female sex, and AEs including headache and induration at the injection site after the second-dose vaccination. CONCLUSION: Headache after the first-dose vaccination can be a predictor of headache after the second-dose vaccination, and AEs are indicators of immune response.","output":"Predictive Model for Adverse Events and Immune Response Based on the Production of Antibodies After the Second-Dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is an attractive target for the development of antiSARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) drugs.

However, recent studies have revealed that fatigue, slow processing speed, and memory impairment are the top variables impacting employment status for MS patients. These suggest that cognitive effects may have a greater impact on productivity, lifestyle, and quality of life than do disease-related motor deficits. However, these debilitating non-locomotive effects have been largely overlooked in rodent models of the disease, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We hypothesized that murine EAE can also be used to assess non-locomotive dysfunctions (mood, sociability, muscle strength, and balance), as well as potential biases in these dysfunctions due to sex and/or strain. We actively immunized male and female C57BL/6 (B6) and SJL mice for EAE and evaluated their performance on the Deacon's weight grip test, Kondziela's inverted screen test, Hall's rope grip test, manual von Frey test for somatic nociception, and a three-chamber social preference paradigm. We hypothesized that EAE progression is associated with changes in muscle strength, balance, pain, and sociability and that these variations are linked to sex and/or strain. Our results indicate that strain but not sex influenced differences in muscle strength and balance during EAE, and both sex and strain have an impact on mechanical nociception, regardless of EAE disease status. Furthermore, both sex and strain had complex effects on differences in sociability. In conclusion, testing these additional modalities during EAE helps to unveil other signs and symptoms that could be used to determine the efficacy of a drug or treatment in the modulation of a MS-like behavior.","output":"Strain and sex differences in somatosensation and sociability during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: During the last decade, canine circovirus (CaCV) has been repeatedly reported in domestic dogs with and without acute enteritis. Here we report the detection and full genome characterization of CaCV strains from non-diarrheic dogs in Iran. The results showed the circulation of the virus in this country, with Iranian strains segregating from the CaCVs detected in other countries. ABSTRACT: Canine circovirus (CaCV) is a single-stranded DNA virus that globally circulates in dogs and wild carnivores. Although the pathogenic potential of the virus has not been fully understood yet, CaCV has been suggested to exacerbate the clinical course of other canine viral infections but also to circulate in dogs without clinical signs. In this study, we carried out real-time PCR assays to detect enteric pathogens from 156 canine rectal swabs collected from dogs without enteritis in 3 different regions in Iran. A total of 14 samples tested positive for CaCV and full-length genome sequences were obtained from 6 of the detected strains. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that, despite the distance between the different sample collection sites, all Iranian CaCV strains were closely related and formed a separate clade from extant CaCVs. The present study shows that CaCV is circulating in non-diarrheic dogs in Iran, thus highlighting the need for further epidemiological investigations in Iranian domestic and wild carnivores.","output":"Detection and Genomic Characterization of Canine Circovirus in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as one of the greatest problems of the 21st century worldwide.

Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock, and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus, we demonstrate that, in addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage to the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and RaTG13 identified distinct tropisms, with the 2 human viruses being more closely aligned. Finally, using bioinformatics, structural data, and targeted mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues within the Spike-ACE2 interface, which may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock, and wildlife.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has a broad tropism for mammalian ACE2 proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1 Before covid-19 the science community had warned of the damage that Brexit would do to the UKs science base in terms of lost research funding and collaborative opportunities, as well as difficulties in recruiting top scientists 2 Robert Lechler, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said that the roadmap provided welcome recognition of the critical role that research and innovation played in the UKs future and the global recovery from covid-19 Ambition Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said, The ambition for Britain to be a science superpower is exactly the direction we need to take as we leave the EU and emerge from the pandemic A UK R&D Place Strategy to maximise local growth and societal benefit from R&D around the UK as part of the governments levelling up agenda will be published later this year, the plan says, and an Innovation Expert Group will be established to review how the government supports research through all stages of development 1 Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy","output":"Government unveils roadmap for making UK a science superpower"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe Covid-19 outbreak has presented many challenges to governments and healthcare systems, including observations of symptoms that persist beyond acute infection labelled as post Covid-19 condition.

MethodsWe searched Medline and Embase (Jan 2021-Aug 12 2021 [KQ1], and Jan 2020-Jul 28, 2021 [KQ2]), Clinicaltrials.gov, organizational websites, and reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles against a priori inclusion criteria, and disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer. One investigator abstracted data and assessed risk of bias using design-specific criteria, and a second investigator checked data abstraction and assessments for completeness and accuracy. Meta-analysis was performed when there was sufficient clinical and methodological similarity in an exposure-outcome comparison, based on prespecified variables. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE). A relative effect/association of 0.75-1.49 was considered as \\"little-to-no\\", whereas 0.50-0.74/1.5-1.99 was \\"small-to-moderate\\" and <0.50/ []2.00 was \\"large\\" for fewer/benefit or more/harm, respectively ResultsFrom 4,672 (KQ1) and 3,781 (KQ2) citations we included 17 and 18 studies, though 4 studies were included for both KQs. We found small-to-moderate associations between female sex and higher non-recovery, fatigue, and dyspnea (moderate certainty). Severe or critical acute-phase Covid-19 severity (versus not) has probably (moderate certainty) a large association with increased cognitive impairment, a small-to-moderate association with more non-recovery, and a little-to-no association with dyspnea. There may be (low certainty) large associations between hospitalization during the acute illness and increased non-recovery, increased dyspnea, and reduced return to work. There may be small-to-moderate associations between several other risk factors and post Covid-19 condition outcomes, including age []60 versus <60 (functional incapacity), non-White people (lower return to work), children age >6 versus <2 years (non-recovery), having []1 versus no comorbidities (non-recovery), chronic pulmonary disease (fatigue), rheumatologic disorder (depression/anxiety), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hypertension (cognitive impairment). Several other risk factors had low certainty for little-to-no association with one or more outcomes (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease) or very low certainty. Interventions to prevent post Covid-19 condition included medications (standard and traditional/ayurvedic), stem cell therapy, rehabilitation or similar therapies, and screening/referrals at either acute phase (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or early post-acute phase (4-8 week), with short (12-16 weeks) or longer (>16 weeks) follow-up for outcomes. We are very uncertain about the effects of preventive interventions, mainly due to risk of bias, inconsistency/lack of consistency (single studies), and in some cases imprecision. ConclusionsGuidelines in relation to surveillance, screening services, and other services such as access to sickness and disability benefits, might need to focus on females and those with previously severe Covid-19 illness. Interventions targeting fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive impairment (especially in those who had severe Covid-19) may be good to prioritize for development and evaluation to provide evidence on their effects. Inputs from patients and primary care providers should be taken into account when developing new care pathways and some tailoring to individual needs will likely be paramount. Continuous assessment of the rapidly emerging evidence is important to better shape our understanding as the body of evidence grows.

RESULTS: COVID-19 was raised by participants in 12/44 interviews conducted after the UK's first confirmed COVID-19 case. Key themes included loss of vital social support, disruption to services important to families, and additional psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Continued delivery of child- and family-centred palliative care requires innovative assessment and delivery of psycho-social support. Disruptions within treatment and care providers may compound support needs, requiring co-ordination for families facing multi-agency delays.","output":"COVID-19: impact on pediatric palliative care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In times of coronavirus, a patient with respiratory symptoms whose chest CT scan reveals ground-glass opacities, COVID-19 may seem an obvious diagnosis.

Here, combining structural data from cryo-EM and structure prediction, we constructed bottom-up Martini coarse-grained models of intact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations were performed, allowing us to explore their dynamics and supramolecular organization. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes present a spherical morphology with structural proteins forming multiple string-like islands in the membrane and clusters between heads of spike proteins. Critical differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes are the interaction pattern between spike proteins and the flexibility of spike proteins. Our models provide structural and dynamic insights in the SARS virus envelopes, and could be used for further investigation, such as drug design, and fusion and fission processes.","output":"The supramolecular organization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virions revealed by coarse-grained models of intact virus envelopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL) represents a rare group of diseases with considerable difficulties in their correct diagnostic workup and therapy. The major challenges lie in their distinction from reactive (including autoimmune) lymphoproliferations. Moreover, monoclonal LGL proliferative diseases are in fact a heterogeneous group of disorders, as recognized by the three subtypes in the current WHO classification. It distinguishes two chronic forms (the focus of this case series), namely T-LGLL and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of Natural Killer cells (CLPD-NK) as well as aggressive NK-cell leukemia. In the clinical routine, the variable presentations and phenotypes of T-LGLL and CLPD-NK are underappreciated. The relevant differential diagnoses range from benign reactive T-cell expansions to other mature T-cell leukemias to highly aggressive æ-lymphomas. T-LGLL or CLPD-NK patients suffer from a wide variety of symptoms often including, but not limited to, cytopenias or classical autoimmune phenomena. They receive treatments ranging from mere supportive measures (e.g. antibiotics, growth factors, transfusions) over strategies of immunosuppression up to anti-leukemic therapies. The diagnostic pitfalls range from recognition of the subtle T-cell proliferation, repeated establishment of monoclonality, assignment to a descript immunophenotypic pattern, and interpretations of molecular aberrancies. Here, we report a series of selected cases to represent the spectrum of LGLL. The purpose is to raise awareness among the scientifically or practically interested readers of the wide variety of clinical, immunological, and phenotypic features of the various forms of LGLL, e.g. of T-cell type, including its æ forms or those of NK-lineage. We highlight the characteristics and courses of four unique cases from two academic centers, including those from a prospective nationwide LGLL registry. Each case of this instructive catalogue serves to transport a key message from the areas of (chronic inflammatory) contexts in which LGLL can arise as well as from the fields of differential diagnostics and of various treatment options.

This review established that, the country has rich indigenous knowledge potential for rangeland management and biodiversity conservation. Traditional enclosures and pastoral mobility are among the important indigenous practices used for rehabilitation of degraded rangelands and conservation of fragile ecosystems. The coexistence of local communities with complex ecosystems offers them excellent experiences on rangelands biodiversity conservation. However, increasingly loss of rangelands biodiversity in the country is attributed to ignoring the contribution of local communities which are rich in indigenous knowledge and skills on rangelands management. Among of the challenges hindering the adoption and involvement of indigenous knowledge to conservation are; scientific bias toward pastoral communities, loss of local expertise, poor knowledge inheritance systems, poverty, conflicts and emergence of pandemic diseases. For effective and sustainable utilisation of indigenous knowledge, the following are recommended; fully engagement of local communities in conservation process, empowering local communities to reduce poverty and conflicts, mainstreaming the indigenous knowledge to conservation education, emphasising on livelihoods diversification to reduce reliance on biological resources and promoting studies to document existing indigenous knowledge.","output":"Indigenous knowledge and rangelands biodiversity conservation in Tanzania: success and failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Understanding gender differences in responses of health-care workers (HCWs) to COVID-19 outbreak is an effective way to promote customized supports.

One strategy is to directly prioritize groups that are likely to experience medical complications due to COVID-19, such as older adults. A second strategy is to limit community spread by reducing importations, for example by vaccinating members of the mobile labour force, such as rotational workers. This second strategy may be appropriate for regions with low disease prevalence, where importations are a substantial fraction of all cases and reducing the importation rate reduces the risk of community outbreaks, which can provide significant indirect protection for vulnerable individuals. Current studies have focused on comparing vaccination strategies in the absence of importations, and have not considered allocating vaccines to reduce the importation rate. Here, we provide an analytical criteria to compare the reduction in the risk of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission over four months when either older adults or rotational workers are prioritized for vaccination. Vaccinating rotational workers (assumed to be 6,000 individuals and about 1% of the Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) population) could reduce the average risk of hospitalization and ICU admission by 42%, if no community spread is observed at the time of vaccination, because epidemic spread is reduced and vulnerable individuals are indirectly protected. In contrast, vaccinating all individuals aged 75 and older (about 43,300 individuals, or 8% of the NL population) would lead to a 24% reduction in the average risk of hospitalization, and to a 45% reduction in the average risk of ICU admission, because a large number of individuals at high risk from COVID-19 are now vaccinated. Therefore, reducing the risk of hospitalization and ICU admission of the susceptible population by reducing case importations would require a significantly lower number of vaccines. Benefits of vaccinating rotational workers decrease with increasing infection prevalence in the community. Prioritizing members of the mobile labour force should be considered as an efficient strategy to indirectly protect vulnerable groups from COVID-19 exposure in regions with low disease prevalence.","output":"Rotational worker vaccination provides indirect protection to vulnerable groups in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A physical symptom score (PSS) for the mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorders has been developed to quantitate the somatic burden of disease across multiple organ systems. Studies have demonstrated the sensitivity and its relationship to age, IQ and adaptive functioning of the PSS in older children. With the onset of newborn screening, there is an increased need to characterize the somatic symptoms in the earliest stages of life, especially for young children under 36 months of age. Consequently, a new scale, Infant Physical Symptom Score (IPSS), was developed to score physical symptoms in infants and toddlers. OBJECTIVE Part I. To create a measure to quantify somatic burden in patients with MPS disorders under 36 months of age. The IPSS assess outcomes and changes in somatic disease in individuals with MPS disorders diagnosed very early in life. Part II. To determine the relationship between IPSS and other measures to evaluate its validity and utility, a) we evaluated the relationship between the IPSS and PSS in the same patients with MPS I over time to determine if the two scales are measuring the same concepts, and b) we evaluated the association between IPSS and a functional adaptive measure over time with a focus on the age at first treatment (under 36 months) to determine if the IPSS has predictive value. METHODS Part I. The Infant Physical Symptom Score (IPSS) for the infant population in MPS disorders was established using data from 39 patients enrolled in the Lysosomal Disease Network longitudinal MPS I study (U54NS065768). All of these patients had Hurler syndrome (MPS IH) and underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at the University of Minnesota. Items for the IPSS were selected by reviewing CRFs prepared for the MPS I longitudinal study and examining medical records of these patients prior to HSCT based on the knowledge gained from the development of the PSS. Part II. Of those 39 patients, a subset of 19 were all seen 9 to 12 years post HSCT. Having retrospectively calculated their IPSS prior to HSCT, we categorized them by age at HSCT, and examined their most recent PSS along with Composite and Daily Living Skills scores on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales - Second Edition (VABS-II). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The total score on the IPSS collected prior to transplant differed by patient's age at transplant, as expected in this progressive condition. Those transplanted at 12 months of age had a mean score of 7.4, which was significantly lower, suggesting less somatic disease burden, compared to those transplanted at >12 to 24 months (mean 11.8) and > 24 to 36 months (mean 13.6). Higher IPSS reflects more evidence of somatic disease burden and lower IPSS reflects less evidence of disease burden. Nine to 12 years later, the severity level as measured by the PSS was comparable to severity on the IPSS suggesting that the two scales are measuring similar concepts. Retrospectively calculated pre-transplant IPSS were negatively associated with higher VABS-II Composite scores 9-12 years later (p value-0.015) and to a lesser extent Daily Living Skills scores (p value-0.081). We conclude that the IPSS appears to be a useful approach to quantifying the somatic disease burden of MPS IH patients under 36 months of age.","output":"Quantifying medical manifestations in hurler syndrome with the infant physical symptom score: Associations with long-term physical and adaptive outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face recognition has become essential in our daily lives as a convenient and contactless method of accurate identity verification.

An efficient carbon tax must consider not only how carbon taxes impact the current economy but also how the size of the tax should be adjusted across time due to external changes. To calculate the optimal industrial carbon tax for China which is subject to certain constraints, this paper investigates the economic and environmental effects of four possible industrial carbon tax rate models under carbon intensity constraints from 2021 to 2030 by a dynamic inputCoutput optimization model. The results show that the dynamic tax rate model leads to larger fluctuations in GDP growth than the other tax models, with a low initial tax rate in the beginning and a high tax rate exceeding 180/t in 2030. Second, a large quantity of capital stock is distributed across the energy-intensive industries, which leads the existing capital investment structure to be path-dependent. This offsets the performance of carbon taxes. Third, indirect energy-intensive industries such as construction and transport are insensitive to the industrial carbon tax. Finally, comparing the impacts of the four tax rate models, the optimal industrial carbon tax for China is found to be a fixed differentiated tax rate, in which energy-intensive sectors are taxed 75/t and low-carbon sectors are taxed 50/t.

One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms \\"telemedicine\\" and \\"COVID-19.\\" RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine.

A survey completion rate of at least 33% AND a valid response for the sex questionnaire item AND a valid response for age questionnaire item were required for inclusion in weighting and further analysis. Additional indices such as material and social deprivation index, and residential instability are generated using census and location data. Results As of June 14, 2021, over 58,000 residents of BC had participated in the survey of which 31,007 survey responses were eligible for analysis. Of the eligible participants, about 60% provided consent for monthly follow up and about 26% provided their personal health numbers for linkage with other healthcare utilization databases. Approximately 51% were females 39% were 55 years or older, 63% identified as white or not a visible minority and 48% had at least a university degree. Conclusion The pandemic response is best informed by surveillance systems capable of timely assessment of behaviour patterns. BC-Mix survey respondents represented a large cohort of British Columbians providing near real-time information on behavioural and contact patterns in BC.

Physical characteristics of inhaled particles and airway mucosal immunity determine which viruses and microbes will persist in the airways. Here we present the first metagenomic study of DNA viral communities in the airways of diseased and non-diseased individuals. We obtained sequences from sputum DNA viral communities in 5 individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 5 individuals without the disease. Overall, diversity of viruses in the airways was low, with an average richness of 175 distinct viral genotypes. The majority of viral diversity was uncharacterized. CF phage communities were highly similar to each other, whereas Non-CF individuals had more distinct phage communities, which may reflect organisms in inhaled air. CF eukaryotic viral communities were dominated by a few viruses, including human herpesviruses and retroviruses. Functional metagenomics showed that all Non-CF viromes were similar, and that CF viromes were enriched in aromatic amino acid metabolism. The CF metagenomes occupied two different metabolic states, probably reflecting different disease states. There was one outlying CF virome which was characterized by an over-representation of Guanosine-5-triphosphate,3-diphosphate pyrophosphatase, an enzyme involved in the bacterial stringent response. Unique environments like the CF airway can drive functional adaptations, leading to shifts in metabolic profiles. These results have important clinical implications for CF, indicating that therapeutic measures may be more effective if used to change the respiratory environment, as opposed to shifting the taxonomic composition of resident microbiota.","output":"Metagenomic Analysis of Respiratory Tract DNA Viral Communities in Cystic Fibrosis and Non-Cystic Fibrosis Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV2)- causing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), outbreak as a world health problem and was declared as a pandemic disease by the world health organization (WHO) in March 2020.

T. gondii has been linked to various diseases, such as cancer, mental disorders, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), etc. However, the effects of T. gondii infection on the risk of osteoporosis are unclear. Our study aimed to uncover evidence to determine whether patients exposed to T. gondii have an increased or decreased risk of osteoporosis in people with abnormal bone mineral density (BMD) by using case-control study. METHODS: A total of 729 patients, including 316 osteopenia and 413 osteoporosis patients of Han Chinese ancestry were selected in the study. Their blood samples were collected and the levels of specific IgG antibodies against T. gondii were measured using ELISA assay. We obtained some information about the patients from the medical record that included demographic indexes and clinical data. A logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the effects of T. gondii infection on femur osteoporosis, lumbar osteoporosis and compound osteoporosis. Potential interaction was analyzed using multifactor dimensionality reduction software 1.0.0 (MDR 1.0.0). RESULTS: 113 positive patients with T. gondii infections have been detected, including 80 cases of osteoporosis and 33 cases of osteopenia, the infection rates of T. gondii were 19.37% (80/413) and 10.44% (33/316), respectively. The patients with T.gondii infections were at a 2.60 times higher risk of suffering from compound osteoporosis than those without T. gondii infections (OR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.54-4.39, P < 0.001), but not associated with femur osteoporosis (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.43-2.34, P = 0.989) and lumbar osteoporosis (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.34-2.07, P = 0.705) after adjusting for the covariates. Moreover, a significantly higher risk of compound osteoporosis in the individuals with all two factors (T. gondii infection, Female) was observed compared with reference group (without T. gondii infection, male) under the interaction model (OR = 11.44, 95%CI = 5.44-24.05, P < 0.001). And the individuals with all two factors (T. gondii infection, over 70 years) exhibited a 8.14-fold higher possibility of developing compound osteoporosis compared with reference group (without T. gondii infection, under 70 years) (OR = 8.14, 95% CI 3.91-16.93, P < 0.001). We further stratified by age and sex, and found that women with T. gondii infection was more likely to develop compound osteoporosis than those without infection(OR = 3.12, 95% CI 1.67-5.81, P < 0.001), but we not found the association between T. gondii infection and compound osteoporosis in males (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 0.37-4.94, P = 0.645). CONCLUSIONS: T. gondii infection is a risk factor for osteoporosis, especially compound osteoporosis.

In 2018, most Australian jurisdictions implemented funded influenza vaccine programs targeted at improving vaccine uptake in this age group. Our aim was to determine how successful these programs were at improving self-reported seasonal influenza vaccine uptake at the community level by comparing vaccination rates in each Australian jurisdiction before and after the introduction of funded vaccines for children aged 6 months to less than 5 years, as well as other age groups. STUDY TYPE Volunteer observational cohort study. METHODS Flutracking is an email-based surveillance tool for influenza-like illness that collects information about symptoms and influenza vaccination. We used historical data from 2014 to 2017 to estimate baseline vaccination status before funding of childhood influenza vaccines was introduced. We compared self-reported vaccine uptake in children younger than 5 years, children aged 5-17 years and adults (18-64 years, and 65 years and older) in 2018 and 2019 by state or territory. Mixed effects logistic regressions were used to measure the association between vaccination and a number of predictors, including whether the child was eligible for free vaccines, and whether adults resided with children or not. RESULTS We found large increases in vaccine uptake for children younger than 5 years in 2018 in all jurisdictions except Western Australia (where vaccines were already funded) and the Northern Territory (where funded vaccines were not introduced until 2019) that coincided with vaccine policy changes. Self-reported vaccination rates for young children in 2018 increased 2.7-4.2-fold in jurisdictions that funded the vaccine (compared with the previous, unfunded period). Being eligible for the funded vaccine was associated with much higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 4.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.57, 4.79) of a young child being vaccinated. Older children and adults younger than 65 years were also more likely to receive the vaccine following policy changes. CONCLUSION The seasonal influenza vaccine is an important protective measure for those at risk of serious outcomes, including young children. Flutracking data demonstrates that government-funded vaccines can lead to an almost five-fold increase in self-reported vaccine uptake of the targeted age group, as well as previously unreported flow-on effects to older children. This suggests that funded vaccines for young children may encourage caregivers to also vaccinate themselves and their older children.","output":"Impact of funding on influenza vaccine uptake in Australian children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for nursing care will continue to rise, as will the need for qualified nursing staff.

Pre- COVID- 19, the AMPATH Multiple Myeloma Program had created support groups for myeloma survivors and their caregivers that regularly met for health education, emotional support, and social opportunities. With the enforcement COVID-19 prevention and control protocols physical support group meetings became impossible. The program shifted to the online platform to sustain peer to peer support for myeloma patients and caregivers. We aim to describe challenges faced with online patient support group meetings as this has not been well documented in a resource-constrained setting. Methods: Myeloma patients and caregivers at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital were contacted and a meeting date and time agreed. Participants were briefed on how to download and operate the zoom application in preparation for online meetings. A meeting link was shared with the expected attendees and a reminder sent two days before a meeting. Support group meetings were held for different groups among them myeloma survivors and caregivers. The meeting sessions were led by healthcare professionals - hematology consultants, social workers, nutritionist and psychosocial counsellors. Peer-to-peer sessions were also held. Results: Six online meeting sessions were held between June 2020 and December 2020. A total of 199 participants were expected to join the six different meetings but a low meeting turn-out of 25.6% was experienced.

We hypothesized that the prognostic relevance of hypoproteinemia could be related to its association with impaired cardiovascular function and organ perfusion during transition. OBJECTIVES To describe the plasma protein status and the measures of cardiovascular function according to the outcome in infants <32 weeks' gestation. METHODS One hundred and twenty-eight infants were prospectively included from birth to discharge. During the first 24 h of life, we assessed the cardiovascular function and systemic and organ blood flow by Doppler ultrasound, and monitored cerebral and renal regional oxygen saturation (cRSO2, rRSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy. These measures were analyzed in relationship to hypoproteinemia (total plasma protein level <40 g/L at 12 h of life) and severe adverse outcome (death or survival with severe neurological injury). RESULTS Hypoproteinemia was associated with a higher risk of a severe adverse outcome after adjustment of confounding variables (adjusted OR = 6.8; 95% CI 1.3-34). Compared to normoproteinemic infants and after adjustment for gestational age, hypoproteinemic ones had more significantly: hypotension (7 vs. 13%, p = 0.03), abnormal capillary refilling time (20 vs. 36%, p < 0.001), abnormal renal blood flow (resistive index 0.78  0.11 vs. 0.85  0.09, p = 0.04), lower rRSO2 (82.9  9.2 vs. 73.6  10.5%, p = 0.04), and lower systemic vascular resistance (0.155  0.058 vs. 0.108  0.037 mm Hg/L/kg; p = 0.04). The cRSO2 patterns were significantly decreased in infants with severe adverse outcome and independent from protein status. CONCLUSION Hypoproteinemia is associated with impaired cardiovascular function.

In the present study, we observed that the level of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), a potential activator of the PD-1 pathway, was upregulated in survivors of direct ARDS than in non-survivors. Administration of sPD-L1 in mice with direct ARDS relieved inflammatory lung injury and improved the survival rate, indicating the protective role of sPD-L1 in direct ARDS.

Critical cases of COVID-19 are characterized by the production of excessive amounts of cytokines and extensive lung damage, which is partially caused by the fusion of SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumocytes. Here, we found that cell fusion caused by the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein induced a type I interferon (IFN) response. This function of the S protein required its cleavage by proteases at the S1/S2 and the S2' sites. We further showed that cell fusion damaged nuclei and resulted in the formation of micronuclei that were sensed by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS and led to the activation of its downstream effector STING. Phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator IRF3 and the expression of IFNB, which encodes a type I IFN, were abrogated in cGAS-deficient fused cells. Moreover, infection with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 also induced cell fusion, DNA damage, and cGAS-STING-dependent expression of IFNB.

We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach (Test-to-Care Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households. Methods: This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers/CHWs and structured surveys among providers/CHWs. Results: Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79/83) were Latinx and 88% (65/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36/80) were uninsured and 55% (44/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over time - this resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement. Conclusions: The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by vulnerable populations.","output":"Evaluation of a novel community-based COVID-19 'Test-to-Care model' for low-income populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematics and statistics support (MSS) is now firmly embedded in the learning and teaching infra-structure of most UK universities and in many universities worldwide.

Anonymized individual data of the largest Czech health insurance company for 2019 are used (366,537 patients, 2,481,129 medical procedures). The data are aggregated at the district level (LAU 1). It has been identified that regions where patients travel outside their area of residence to access more than half of their healthcare needs are mostly in local/regional centres. Moreover, these patients increase the number of medical services provided in local/regional centres, often by more than 20%, which has been reflected in greater healthcare capacity in these centres. To assess regional differences, it is important to take the spatial healthcare accessibility into account and also consider why patients travel for healthcare. Reasons could be the insufficient local capacity, varied quality of health services or individual factors. In such cases, healthcare actors (health insurance companies, local government etc.) should respond to the situation and take appropriate action to reduce these dissimilarities.","output":"Spatial Healthcare Accessibility: A District-Level Analysis of Travel for Outpatient Diabetology in Czechia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the impact of Covid-19, and that of the MMLF program on US MMFs systemic risk through the CoVaR methodology.

METHODS: A network pharmacology-based method was utilized. First candidate compounds, targets of GX II were collected using PharmMapper, BATMAN-TCM, DrugBank and SwissTargetPrediction, and targets on CHD were mined from GeneCards, DisGenet, DrugBank and GEO. Afterwards, the big hub compounds and targets were chosen in the candidate compounds-direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (C-T) network and the direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (T-D) network. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed to identify the enriched terms. Finally, a molecular docking simulation strategy was adopted to verify the binding capacity between the big hub compounds and big hub targets on CHD. RESULTS: First, 114 candidate compounds were selected with the following criteria: OBa??30%, DLa??0.18, and HL a??4 h. Then, 1,035 targets of GX II were gathered, while 928 targets on CHD were collected. Afterwards, 196 common targets of compound targets and therapeutic targets on CHD were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on CHD. In addition, the contribution index (CI) in the C-T network was calculated, and 4 centrality properties, including degree, betweenness, closeness and coreness, in the T-D network, 4 big hub compounds, and 6 big hub targets were eventually chosen. Furthermore, the GO and KEGG analysis indicated that GX II acted on CHD by regulating the reactive oxygen species metabolism, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The docking results manifested excellent binding capacity between the 4 big hub compounds and 6 big hub targets on CHD.

Visual examination of the world map shows a wide variation of death tolls between countries. The main goal of our series is to determine the best predictors of such discrepancy. Methods: This is a retrospective study in which the rate of COVID-19 deaths was correlated with each of the following independent variables: total tests per 1 million population, gross domestic product (GDP), average temperatures per country, ultraviolet index, median age, average BMI per country, food supply, Bacille Calmette-Guerin compulsory status, and passenger traffic. Results: BMI per country proved to be the second best predictor of death rate with an R value of 0.43, and GDP being the best predictor with R = 0.65. Conclusion: This article shows a tight correlation between average BMI, food supply per country, and COVID-19-related deaths. Such predisposing factors might operate by upregulating the inflammation pathway in heavily struck countries, leading to easier triggering of the infamous cytokine storm syndrome.

To understand this association, recent population data is required which is representative of all the states and union territories of the country.Objective:We aimed to investigate the patterns of physical activity in India, stratified by zones, body mass index (BMI), urban, rural areas, and gender.Method:We present the analysis of physical activity status from the data collected during the phase 1 of a pan-India study. This (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata 2017) was a multicenter pan-India cluster sampled trial with dual objectives. A survey to identify all individuals at a high risk for diabetes, using a validated instrument called the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS), was followed by a two-armed randomized yoga-based lifestyle intervention for the primary prevention of diabetes. The physical activity was scored as per IDRS (vigorous exercise or strenuous at work = 0, moderate exercise at home/work = 10, mild exercise at home/work = 20, no exercise = 30). This was done in a selected cluster using a mobile application. A weighted prevalence was calculated based on the nonresponse rate and design weight.Results:We analyzed the data from 2,33,805 individuals;the mean age was 41.4 years (SD 13.4). Of these, 50.6% were females and 49.4% were males;45.8% were from rural areas and 54% from urban areas. The BMI was 24.7  4.6 kg/m2. Briefly, 20% were physically inactive and 57% of the people were either inactive or mildly active. 21.2% of females were found physically inactive, whereas 19.2% of males were inactive. Individuals living in urban localities were proportionately more inactive (21.7% vs. 18.8%) or mildly active (38.9% vs. 34.8%) than the rural people. Individuals from the central (29.6%) and south zones (28.6%) of the country were also relatively inactive, in contrast to those from the northwest zone (14.2%). The known diabetics were found to be physically inactive (28.3% vs. 19.8%) when compared with those unaware of their diabetic status.Conclusion:20% and 37% of the population in India are not active or mildly active, respectively, and thus 57% of the surveyed population do not meet the physical activity regimen recommended by the World Health Organization. This puts a large Indian population at risk of developing various NCDs, which are being increasingly reported to be vulnerable to COVID-19 infections.

Unfortunately, the world of small molecules escapes such 'resurrection' studies, which rely on ancestral sequence reconstruction. These studies implicitly assume that only the proteins evolve, whereas the small molecules are presumed to be identical now and in the past. Recent evolutionary analysis of biochemical pathways, however, as well as the impressive surge of metabolomics are changing this situation, and it is becoming possible to reconstruct ancient biochemical pathways. We can now begin to infer the chemical structures of key molecules that were present in the past, synthesize those molecules, and test their ability to interact with their cognate (ancient) protein partners. In this essay, we discuss the possibilities offered by these new methodological developments and provide key examples. We also highlight four principles that are important to consider when studying the evolution of small molecules: catalytic promiscuity, metabolic reconfiguration, coevolution and bidirectional interactions.

World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Subsequently on February 11, 2020 a new name was given to this disease i.e. COVID-19 by an expert group from WHO. As of April 12, 2020, 10:00 CET, GMT+2:00, 1,696,588 confirmed cases and 105,952 confirmed deaths have been reported to the WHO. (Coronavirus disease 2019, situation report 83). It possibly originated from a small animal market in Wuhan, China. A cluster of patients were admitted with unusual pneumonia not responding to treatment in various hospitals. Epidemiological, genomic analysis and correlation with other coronaviruses led to the isolation of new coronavirus, closely resembling the bat coronaviruses, from such patients in Wuhan. They were identified as the SARS-CoV-2. This virus infection presents as influenza like illness in the affected people. Fever, cough, respiratory distress with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms seen in adults. This may progress on to respiratory distress, hypoxia, need for oxygen supplementation and ventilator support as seen in patients in the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2003) in Guangdong, China. The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-1 was less as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it was well controlled with good public health efforts. The present COVID-19 epidemic is still in the acceleration phase of 3 and 4 in various countries.

These interactions mediate both the traffic of inflammatory cells and virus-associated immune responses. In the context of viral infections, the human C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receives great attention from the scientific community due to its role as an HIV-1 co-receptor. The genetic variant CCR5&#916;32 (32 base-pair deletion in CCR5 gene) impairs CCR5 expression on the cell surface and is associated with protection against HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Also, the genetic variant CCR5&#916;32 modifies the CCR5-mediated inflammatory responses in various conditions, such as inflammatory and infectious diseases. CCR5 antagonists mimic, at least in part, the natural effects of the CCR5&#916;32 in humans, which explains the growing interest in the potential benefits of using CCR5 modulators for the treatment of different diseases. Nevertheless, beyond HIV infection, understanding the effects of the CCR5&#916;32 variant in multiple viral infections is essential to shed light on the potential effects of the CCR5 modulators from a broader perspective.

The risk of not facing this situation head on is a potential exodus of seasoned professionals contemplating their future and selecting other career paths, thus draining the current institutional knowledge and potentially deterring future generations from healthcare. Leaders in the healthcare industry need to take a proactive stance in addressing this reemergence. Integrated, proactive programming is needed utilizing evidence-based resiliency training from professional organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as well as the existing Department of Defense programs. The Veterans Affairs has the backbone to develop and offer these programs and make a positive difference with Employee Whole Health efforts. Organized, evidence-based programming such as second victim education, mindfulness, and other personal skill building could be key to improving the lifelong well-being of our caregivers.","output":"Mitigating the Impact of Reemergence From a Pandemic on Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the opinion of the medical societies of hygiene and pediatrics undersigning the present statement, the analyses published to date regarding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the course of CoVid-19 show that children play a much less significant role in the spread of the virus than do adults. According to the findings available to date, not only do children and adolescents less frequently fall ill with CoVid-19, they also generally become less severely ill than do adults. The vast majority of infections in children and adolescents are asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic. Even the first analyses from China demonstrated that children and adolescents play a subordinate role in the transmission of the virus C not only to other children and adolescents, but also to adults. Taking into account regional infection rates and available resources, daycare centers, kindergartens and elementary schools promptly should be reopened. For children, this should be possible without excessive restrictions, such as clustering into very small groups, implementation of barrier precautions, maintaining appropriate distance from others or wearing masks. A factor more decisive than individual group size is the issue of sustaining the constancy of respective group members and the avoidance of intermixing. Children can be taught basic rules of hygiene such as handwashing and careful hygiene behavior when coming into contact with others during mealtimes and/or when using sanitary facilities. Independent of the prevention measures implemented for children and adolescents, the protection of teachers, educators and caregivers is crucial, (e.g., the maintenance of appropriate distance from others, use of medical masks, situation-dependent hand disinfection, when necessary, supported by regular pool testing). Children over the age of 10 and adolescents up to school graduation age are more capable of actively understanding and conforming to specific hygiene rules. For this group, maintaining appropriate distance from others (1.5 meters), wearing a mouth-and-nose protection (whenever they are not sitting in their assigned classroom seats) and consistent education regarding the basic rules of infection prevention may provide increased options for normalizing teaching activities. Children and adolescents suspected of infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be tested immediately in order to either confirm or rule out such an infection. Evidence of individual infections in children or students must not automatically lead to the closure of the entire daycare center or school. A detailed analysis of the chain of infection is a prerequisite for a balanced approach to infection control. The opening of schools and childrens facilities should be accompanied by specifically structured, model surveillance studies that further clarify outstanding questions about infectious disease events and hygiene control. These prospective, concomitant examinations will be essential for the purpose of evaluating and verifying the effectiveness of the required hygiene measures.","output":"Children and adolescents in the CoVid-19 pandemic: Schools and daycare centers are to be opened again without restrictions.

Aims This study aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitudes and practices of a sample of Sudanese residents towards COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted on 812 participants, including both sexes and aged 18 years and above, with the exclusion of health care workers. Considerable care was taken to include people with different education levels. Results Among the survey respondents (n=812), 45.8% were women, 40.4% held a bachelor's degree, 5.7% were uneducated, and 51.1% were aged 18-25 years.

Scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has forced them to conserve and reuse some of their PPE. The efficacy of these practices in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to first responders is unclear. There are limited data on the prevalence of antibodies specific for COVID-19 exposure in these front-line workers. AIM: Our objective was to determine the prevalence of positive immunoglobulin G antibody specific to COVID-19 among first responders in Lubbock, Texas. METHODS: Blood samples were collected on 683 asymptomatic first responders who work in Lubbock, Texas and the surrounding area, after informed consents were signed. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was measured using Abbott's SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Kit in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Calibrator Kit on the Abbott's ARCHITECT i1000SR analyzer. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was 0.73%, five of the 683 participants tested positive. Four of those who tested positive had no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure without adequate PPE. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was much lower than expected in our study population despite high sensitivity and specificity of the test reagent. The most likely explanations for this finding include limited exposure, inadequate time for a IgG response, possible clearance of COVID-19 infection locally by the respiratory tract IgA defense system without eliciting a systemic IgG response, and short persistence of IgG antibodies in mild or asymptomatic cases.","output":"Prevalence of Coronavirus Antibody Among First Responders in Lubbock, Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problem of equitable access to quality education in Indonesia is increase seen during the Covid-19.

We sought to examine the relationship between inflammatory status, coagulation effects, and observed bleeding and thrombosis in patients receiving venovenous (VV) ECMO for COVID-19 respiratory failure. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTINGS Quaternary care institution. PATIENTS The study period from April 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021, we included all patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received VV ECMO support. INTERVENTION None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Thirty-two patients were supported with VV ECMO during the study period, and 17 patients (53%) survived to hospital discharge. The ECMO nonsurvivors mean lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were markedly elevated in comparison to survivors (1046 u/L [IQR = 509, 1305] vs 489 u/L [385 658], p = 0.003). Platelet/fibrinogen dysfunction, as reflected by the low Maximum Amplitude (MA) on viscoelastic testing, was worse in nonsurvivors (65.25 mm [60.68, 67.67] vs 74.80 mm [73.10, 78.40], p = 0.01). Time-group interaction for the first seven days of ECMO support, showed significantly lower platelet count in the nonsurvivors (140 k/ul [103, 170] vs 189.5 k/ul [ 146, 315], p < 0.001) and higher D-dimer in (21 g/mL [13, 21] vs 14 g/mL [3, 21], p < 0.001) in comparison to the survivors. Finally, we found profound statistically significant correlations between the clinical markers of inflammation and markers of coagulation in the nonsurvivors group. The ECMO nonsurvivors experienced higher rate of bleeding (73.3% vs 35.3%, p = 0.03), digital ischemia (46.7% vs 11.8%, p = 0.02), acute renal failure (60% vs 11.8%, p = 0.01) and bloodstream infection (60% vs 23.5%, p = 0.03).

Among them, serological methods have been developed. Nevertheless, although these may present an interesting clinical performance, they are often directed against only one antigen. This study aims at evaluating the clinical performance of an innovative multiplex immunoassay (i.e., CoViDiag assay) detecting simultaneously the presence of antibodies directed against N, S1, S2, RBD and NTD antigens. Sensitivity was evaluated in 135 samples obtained from 94 rRT-PCR confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 132) collected before the COVID-19 pandemic with potential cross-reactions to the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay were included in the specificity analysis. The antibody signature was also studied in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. The specificity of the CoViDiag assay was excellent for all antibodies (99.2 to 100%) using adapted cut-offs. None of the false positive samples were positive for more than one antibody. The sensitivity obtained from samples collected 14 days since symptom onset varied from 92.0 to 100.0% depending on the antibody considered. Among samples collected more than 14 days after symptom onset, 12.8, 66.3, 3.5, 9.3, 5.8 and 2.3% were positive for 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0 antibodies, respectively. A trend toward higher antibody titers was observed in hospitalized patient in the early days since symptom onset. However, no significant difference was observed compared to non-hospitalized patients after 14 days since symptom onset. The clinical performance of the CoViDiag 5 IgG assay is sufficient to recommend its use for the detection and the characterization of the antibody signature following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A range of digital technologies including phone, web conferencing, and electronic survey platforms can be leveraged to support the conduct of cognitive interviewing in both children and adults. These technologies offer a potential solution to enrolling underrepresented populations, including those with rare conditions, functional limitations and geographic or socioeconomic barriers. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of digital technologies for qualitative interviewing will remain essential. However, there is limited guidance about adapting cognitive interviewing procedures to allow for remote data capture, especially with children. METHODS: Synthesizing the literature and our research experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine considerations for implementing digitally supported cognitive interviews with children, adolescents, and adults. We offer recommendations to optimize data quality and empirical rigor and illustrate the application of these recommendations in an ongoing cognitive interviewing study to develop and refine a new pediatric PRO measure. RESULTS: Good research practices must address participant and researcher preparation for study-related procedures and should anticipate and pre-emptively manage technological barriers. Field notes should detail interview context, audio/video cues, and any impact of technological difficulties on data quality. The approaches we recommend have been tested in an ongoing cognitive interviewing study that is enrolling children/adolescents with cGVHD ages 5C17 and their caregivers [NCT 04044365]. The combined use of telephone and videoconferencing to conduct cognitive interviews remotely is feasible and acceptable and yields meaningful data to improve the content validity of our new PRO measure of cGVHD symptom bother. CONCLUSION: Digitally supported cognitive interviewing procedures will be increasingly employed. Remote data collection can accelerate accrual, particularly in multi-site studies, and may allow for interviewer personnel and data management to be centralized within a coordinating center, thus conserving resources.

In this paper, we draw on the extensive experience of NHS (National Health Service) England to develop a practitioner perspective on the challenges of effectively implementing and sustaining such solutions. We argue that a properly sustainable approach requires a shift in both thinking and practice when it comes to the spread and adoption of such technologies. Our thinking needs to shift from a focus on the technology itself to how we bring about the changes needed to deliver more efficient and effective care for patients. In practical terms, this means focussing on the changes involved to integrate digital health solutions into the delivery of services. In particular, it requires greater attention to the motivations, constraints and specific contexts that influence users and patients. The technical expertise of innovators therefore needs to be complemented by other forms of insight into change processes, including clinical and behavioral insight, process engineering and knowledge management. In this paper, we show how these different pillars of the NHS Sustainable Healthcare approach help to ensure the effective implementation and use of digital solutions.

METHODS: Fifty first-year dental hygiene students were randomly divided into three groups using ultrasound toothbrushes with different frequencies (1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 MHz) twice a day (3-min sessions) for 8 weeks. Plaque index (PlI) and gingival index (GI) scores were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Changes in GI scores from baseline to 8 weeks tended to differ among the groups (p = 0.0862). The GI was significantly lower in the 3.2 and 4.8 MHz groups at 8 weeks (3.2 MHz group: p < 0.01, 4.8 MHz group: p < 0.05). At 4 weeks, the GI was significantly lower in the 3.2 MHz group (p < 0.05) and tended to be lower in the 4.8 MHz group (p = 0.07). The PlI was significantly lower in the 3.2 MHz group at 8 weeks (p < 0.01) and tended to be lower in the 1.6 and 4.8 MHz groups (1.6 MHz: p = 0.07, 4.8 MHz: p = 0.05). In addition, the PlI was significantly lower in the 4.8 MHz group at 4 weeks (p < 0.05). No significant differences in the changes in any measurements were observed among the groups.

The online version of this discussion was not exempted by the presence of misinformation campaigns, but, differently from what already witnessed in other debates, the COVID-19 -intentional or not- flow of false information put at severe risk the public health, possibly reducing the efficacy of government countermeasures. In this manuscript, we study the effective impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on the various discursive communities. In order to extract such communities, we start by focusing on verified users, i.e., accounts whose identity is officially certified by Twitter. We start by considering each couple of verified users and count how many unverified ones interacted with both of them via tweets or retweets: if this number is statically significant, i.e. so great that it cannot be explained only by their activity on the online social network, we can consider the two verified accounts as similar and put a link connecting them in a monopartite network of verified users. The discursive communities can then be found by running a community detection algorithm on this network. We observe that, despite being a mostly scientific subject, the COVID-19 discussion shows a clear division in what results to be different political groups. We filter the network of retweets from random noise and check the presence of messages displaying URLs. By using the well known browser extension NewsGuard, we assess the trustworthiness of the most recurrent news sites, among those tweeted by the political groups. The impact of low reputable posts reaches the 22.1% in the right and center-right wing community and its contribution is even stronger in absolute numbers, due to the activity of this group: 96% of all non reputable URLs shared by political groups come from this community.

Nine children received a KTx at our center between February and July 2020, eight boys and one girl, of median age of 10 years. Seven presented Doppler features suggesting arterial stenosis, with an unusual extensive pattern. For comparison, over the previous 5-year period, persistent spectral Doppler arterial anomalies (focal anastomotic stenoses) following KTx were seen in 5% of children at our center. We retrospectively evidenced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in five of seven children with arterial stenosis. The remaining two patients had received a graft from a deceased adolescent donor with a positive serology at D0. These data led us to suspect immune postviral graft vasculitis, triggered by SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract COVID-19 pandemic particularly affects older people and exposes them to a higher risk of mortality. Containment, social distancing and isolation measures have been implemented to limit viral transmission. While there is a clear rationale for reducing the contagiousness of the infection through this means, the adverse consequences of this social isolation, especially for this heterogeneous, aged and frail people, are difficult to apprehend. In particular, the disruption of the usual support and care ecosystems at home or in institutions may paradoxically increase the frailty of these people and lead to adverse events we wanted to avoid. On the other hand, the risk of a decrease in the older persons empowerment regarding his or her own health and social life decisions requires particular vigilance to prevent the risk of societal ageism. Regarding this population in particular, a possible conflict of values between individual and collective protection on one hand and respect for autonomy and independence on the other hand could exist. This article proposes an ethical reflection on the issue of containment of frail ageing people, based on medical ethics principles, in order to open up positive approaches of vulnerability that guarantee respect for the dignity of the person and equity in care access.","output":"Une approche thique de la question du confinement des personnes ages en contexte de pandmie COVID-19: la prvention des fragilits face au risque de vulnrabilit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case reports and retrospective cohort studies have reported an association between acute pancreatitis and COVID-19.

The aim of the study is to analyze efficacy of the mobile technology MedQuizBot for asthma monitoring, to estimate patient compliance to use such instruments of self-control via the bot and without it, and bot's functioning satisfaction. Methods. 6-month prospective observational comparative study in patients with asthma from 4 to 17 years old was conducted. All patients were divided into two groups: patients who have used MedQuizBot and patients who have used any other self-control tools. Patients had to enter peakflowmetry data daily and undergo asthma control tests monthly. Patients were able to communicate with their doctor remotely via the chat bot. Main study indicators: determining the efficacy of MedQuizBot in patients with asthma by estimating the compliance to self-control tools at using the bot. Secondary study indicators: estimation of patients satisfaction on using the MedQuizBot and determination of level of asthma control due to the obtained data results. Results. 41 patients have used MedQuizBot, 27 patients were in the control group. Patients who used the bot more often answered asthma control test questions. Patients over 12 years old have completed the asthma control test less often than young children: ACT was filled on average in 1.5 times,   1.8 times. 51% of patients filled in data on peakflowmetry via the new technology, patients from control group did not start the picflowmetry diary. Patients under 12 years old, who filled up the test with their parents, has entered picflowmetry data 7 times more often than adolescents. The asthma was under control in 70% of patients. The data was entered into the system 2.5 times more often during the lockdown period due to COVID-19 pandemic and during the tree flowering season in comparison to other periods of 2020.

Due to the extremely low amount of virus detected in the blood and remote organs (e.g., heart, brain and kidney) in a few cases, it is difficult to explain the mechanism by which the virus triggers NETosis, and there may be a different mechanism than in the lung. A large number of studies have found that the renin-angiotensin system regulates the NETosis at multiple levels in patients with COVID-19, such as endocytosis of SARS-COV-2, abnormal angiotensin II levels, neutrophil activation and procoagulant function at multiple levels, which may contribute to the formation of reticular structure and thrombosis.

First, we attempted to understand the association between the COVID-19 transmission rate, environmental factors (air pollution, weather, mobility), and socio-political parameters (Government Stringency Index, GSI). Second, we evaluated the efficiency of various strategies, including radical opening, intermittent lockdown, phase lift, and contact tracing, to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and get back to pre-pandemic conditions using a stochastic individual-based epidemiology model. Third, we used a deep learning approach and simulated the vaccination rate and the time for reaching herd immunity. The analysis was done based on the collected data from eight countries in Asia, including Iran, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, South Korea, and Russia (as a transcontinental country). Our findings in the first part highlighted a noninfluential impact from the weather-driven parameters and short-term exposure to pollutants on the transmission rate; however, long-term exposure could potentially increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality rates (based on 1998C2017 p.m.2.5 data). Mobility was highly correlated with the COVID-19 transmission and based on our causal analysis reducing mobility could curb the COVID-19 transmission rate with a 6-day lag time (on average). Secondly, among all the tested policies for exiting the COVID-19 pandemic, the contact tracing was the most efficient if executed correctly. With a 2-day delay in tracing the virus hosts, a 60% successful host tracing, and a 70% contact reduction with the hosts, a pandemic will end in a year without overburdening a healthcare system with 6000 hospital beds capacity per million.

Due to the large amount of money that smart contracts deal with, there is a surging demand for a method that can statically and formally verify them. This tool paper describes our type-based static verification tool Helmholtz for Michelson, which is a statically typed stack-based language for writing smart contracts that are executed on the blockchain platform Tezos. Helmholtz is designed on top of our extension of Michelsons type system with refinement types. Helmholtz takes a Michelson program annotated with a user-defined specification written in the form of a refinement type as input; it then typechecks the program against the specification based on the refinement type system, discharging the generated verification conditions with the SMT solver Z3. We briefly introduce our refinement type system for the core calculus Mini-Michelson of Michelson, which incorporates the characteristic features such as compound datatypes (e.g., lists and pairs), higher-order functions, and invocation of another contract.

Although nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) remains the gold standard for detecting and theoretically quantifying SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in various specimen types, antigen assays may be considered a suitable alternative, under specific circumstances. Rapid antigen tests are meant to detect viral antigen proteins in biological specimens (e.g. nasal, nasopharyngeal, saliva), to indicate current SARS-CoV-2 infection. The available assay methodology includes rapid chromatographic immunoassays, used at the point-of-care, which carries some advantages and drawbacks compared to more conventional, instrumentation-based, laboratory immunoassays. Therefore, this document by the International Federation for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Taskforce on COVID-19 aims to summarize available data on the performance of currently available SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid detection tests (Ag-RDTs), providing interim guidance on clinical indications and target populations, assay selection, and evaluation, test interpretation and limitations, as well as on pre-analytical considerations.

The aim of this study was to develop a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) as a potential tool for identification and differentiation between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. The nucleocapsid (N) proteins of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were expressed in an Escherichia coli system and used to immunize mice in order to obtain monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for each virus. Three specific MAbs to HCoV-NL63, one MAb specific to HCoV-229E, and four MAbs that recognized both viruses were obtained. After their characterization, three MAbs were selected in order to develop a differential DAS-ELISA.

Most BCCs are localized and can be fully treated by surgical removal or topical treatment. In the last decade, it has been found that the hedgehog pathway, a signaling pathway that regulates embryonic development, has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of BCC in adults. Therefore, two drugs that inhibit the hedgehog pathway have been developed. These drugs, indicated for metastatic or locally advanced BCC, may cause a rapid clinical and imaging response, but have an adverse reaction that includes muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia and fatigue, and often leads to drug discontinuation. Due to the high rates of treatment discontinuation, the possibility of administering the drug intermittently was examined and, indeed, a decrease in adverse reactions together with tumor response was observed. Additionally, it seems that patients who discontinue treatment may benefit from long-term remission. These cases indicate the possibility of changing the schedule of administration of the drug. We hereby report two cases of patients who were treated with radiation therapy for ringworm in their childhood and developed BCC. The patients were treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor with complete tumor regression. After treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions, no recurrence of the tumor was observed over a period of almost two years.","output":"[prolonged Complete Remission after a Short Course of Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors in Patients with Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma: an Alternative to Surgery?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Anesthesia trainees are expected to perform tasks under non-direct supervision as soon as possible in their clinical training Often they rely on only superficial rote learning, which might lead to medical errors We have developed a lesson plan that is based on this educational need using Gagn's Instructional Design for the example of teaching the complex preoperative management of diabetic patients Our aim was to use Gagne's approach successfully for the teaching of non-procedural skills Methods We implemented a comprehensive lesson plan that was developed on the example of a clinical pattern C the preoperative assessment of diabetic patients - using Gagn's systematic nine-step model of instruction design After the lesson, we analysed the trainees' opinions with the use of a standardized questionnaire Results Nine trainees with 2 1  0 8 years of anesthesia experience attended the lesson The assessment of knowledge revealed in 82% the correct answers to the treatment options, and the residents' overall view on the lecture concept were 4 8  0 3 for lecture concept and realization and 4 7  0 5 regarding motivation, participation and climate Conclusions Applying Gagn's Instructional Design model guides seems to effectively guide the development of a comprehensive lesson plan to teach non-procedural skills in a small group setting","output":"Using Gagn's Instructional Design to teach clinically applicable knowledge in small groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

As a typical RNA virus, FMDV follows a quasispecies dynamics, with the many biological implications of such a dynamics. Mutant spectra provide a reservoir of FMDV variants, and minority subpopulations may become dominant in response to environmental demands or as a result of statistical fluctuations in population size. Accumulation of mutations in the FMDV genome occurs upon subjecting viral populations to repeated bottleneck events and upon viral replication in the presence of mutagenic base or nucleoside analogs. During serial bottleneck passages, FMDV survive during extended rounds of replication maintaining low average relative fitness, despite linear accumulation of mutations in the consensus genomic sequence. The critical event is the occurrence of a low frequency of compensatory mutations. In contrast, upon replication in the presence of mutagens, the complexity of mutant spectra increases, apparently no compensatory mutations can express their fitness-enhancing potential, and the virus can cross an error threshold for maintenance of genetic information, resulting in virus extinction. Low relative fitness and low viral load favor FMDV extinction in cell culture. The comparison of the molecular basis of resistance to extinction upon bottleneck passage and extinction by enhanced mutagenesis is providing new insights in the understanding of quasispecies dynamics.

METHODS: Large-scale European genome-wide summary statistics for lipids and T2D were leveraged in our multi-stage analysis to estimate changes in either lipid levels or T2D risk driven by tissue-specific predicted gene expression. We incorporated tissue-specific predicted gene expression summary statistics to proxy therapeutic effects of three lipid control medications [i.e., statins, icosapent ethyl (IPE), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 inhibitors (PCSK-9i)] on T2D susceptibility using two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR). FINDINGS: IPE, as proxied via increased FADS1 expression, was predicted to lower triglycerides and was associated with a 53% reduced risk of T2D. Statins and PCSK-9i, as proxied by reduced HMGCR and PCSK9 expression, respectively, were predicted to lower LDL-C levels but were not associated with T2D susceptibility.

CTC detection was performed using CytoSorter(?) mesenchymal CTC kit (CSV). The correlation between CSV positive CTCs (CSV-CTCs) and LC patients clinicopathological characteristics would be evaluated, and diagnostic performances of CSV-CTCs and serum tumor markers for LC would be compared. RESULTS: CTC detection rates (average CTC count: range) in LC patients, patients with BLD and HD were 83.33% (2.47: 0-8), 47.62% (0.5: 0-3) and 0% (0: 0), respectively.

CSV-CTCs were correlated with cancer stage, lymph node involvement and distant metastasis (P = 0.0062, 0.0014 and 0.0021, respectively). With a CTC cut-off value of 2, CSV-CTCs would have a sensitivity and specificity of 0.67 and 0.87, respectively, for diagnosing LC. CSV-CTC positive rates showed statistical differences among HD, BLD patients and LC patients at different cancer stages (P < 0.0001).

Data from these surveillance systems showed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated in West Africa later than in other regions of the continent. METHODS: We contacted 11 West African countries to collect information about their influenza surveillance systems (number of sites, type of surveillance, sampling strategy, populations sampled, case definitions used, number of specimens collected and number of specimens positive for influenza viruses) for the time period January 2010 through December 2012. RESULTS: Of the 11 countries contacted, 8 responded: Burkina Faso, Cote dIvoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. Countries used standard World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or slight variations thereof. There were 70 surveillance sites: 26 SARI and 44 ILI. Seven countries conducted SARI surveillance and collected 3114 specimens of which 209 (7%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive SARI patients, 132 (63%) were influenza A [68 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 64 influenza A(H3N2)] and 77 (37%) were influenza B. All eight countries conducted ILI surveillance and collected 20,375 specimens, of which 2278 (11%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive ILI patients, 1431 (63%) were influenza A [820 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 611 influenza A(H3N2)] and 847 (37%) were influenza B. A majority of SARI and ILI case-patients who tested positive for influenza (72% SARI and 59% ILI) were children aged 0C4 years, as were a majority of those enrolled in surveillance. The seasonality of influenza and the predominant influenza type or subtype varied by country and year. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 continued to circulate in West Africa along with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B during 2010C2012. Although ILI surveillance systems produced a robust number of samples during the study period, more could be done to strengthen surveillance among hospitalized SARI case-patients. Surveillance systems captured young children but lacked data on adults and the elderly. More data on risk groups for severe influenza in West Africa are needed to help shape influenza prevention and clinical management policies and guidelines.

We investigated exercise capacity in patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 with and without self-reported exercise intolerance using magnetic resonance-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Methods and Results Sixty subjects were enrolled in this single-center prospective observational case-control study, split into 3 equally sized groups: 2 groups of age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched previously hospitalized patients following COVID-19 without clearly identifiable postviral complications and with either self-reported reduced (COVIDreduced) or fully recovered (COVIDnormal) exercise capacity; a group of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The COVIDreducedgroup had the lowest peak workload (79W [Interquartile range (IQR), 65-100] versus controls 104W [IQR, 86-148]; P=0.01) and shortest exercise duration (13.32.8 minutes versus controls 16.63.5 minutes; P=0.008), with no differences in these parameters between COVIDnormal patients and controls. The COVIDreduced group had: (1) the lowest peak indexed oxygen uptake (14.9 mL/minper kg [IQR, 13.1-16.2]) versus controls (22.3 mL/min per kg [IQR, 16.9-27.6]; P=0.003) and COVIDnormal patients (19.1 mL/min per kg [IQR, 15.4-23.7]; P=0.04); (2) the lowest peak indexed cardiac output (4.71.2 L/min per m2) versus controls (6.01.2 L/min per m2; P=0.004) and COVIDnormal patients (5.71.5 L/min per m2; P=0.02), associated with lower indexed stroke volume (SVi:COVIDreduced 3910 mL/min per m2 versus COVIDnormal 437 mL/min per m2 versus controls 4810 mL/min per m2; P=0.02). There were no differences in peak tissue oxygen extraction or biventricular ejection fractions between groups. There were no associations between COVID-19 illness severity and peak magnetic resonance-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing metrics. Peak indexed oxygen uptake, indexed cardiac output, and indexed stroke volume all correlated with duration from discharge to magnetic resonance-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing (P<0.05). Conclusions Magnetic resonance-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing suggests failure to augment stroke volume as a potential mechanism of exercise intolerance in previously hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Massive leakage of fluid from vascular space leads to lose of blood plasma and decrease of effective circulatory blood volume, resulting in formation of severe tissue edema, hypotension or even shock, especially in severe burn injury. Fluid resuscitation has been the only valid approach to sustain patients blood volume for a long time, due to the lack of overall and profound understanding of the mechanisms of vascular hyperpermeability response. There is an emerging concept in recent years that some so-called barrier stabilizing mediators play a positive role in preventing the increase of vascular permeability. These mediators may be released in response to proinflammatory mediators and serve to restore endothelial barrier function. Some of these stabilizing mediators are important even in quiescent state because they preserve basal vascular permeability at low levels. This review introduces some of these mediators and reveals their underlying signaling mechanisms during endothelial barrier enhancing process.","output":"Barrier stabilizing mediators in regulation of microvascular endothelial permeability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In aquaculture, fish species may experience stressful episodes caused by poor farming conditions.

Methods: We evaluated the clinical management and survival rate of HF patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel (March 2020CApril 2021). Results: The cohort included 6748 patients with a diagnosis of HF during the study period. During this period, 843 HF patients (12.5%) were infected with COVID-19, and 194 died from COVID-19, a 23% mortality rate. Patients infected with COVID-19 had a higher percentage of diabetes and obesity. Predictors of mortality included age, male sex, reduced functional capacity, renal dysfunction, and absence of reninCangiotensin system inhibition. During the pandemic, there was a marked decrease in the usage of medical services in the cohort. Cardiovascular hospitalizations, all hospitalization, and emergency room visits were significantly decreased compared to the two years prior to the pandemic, particularly during the lockdowns. There was also an initial decrease in HF clinic visits. Mortality rates were very similar during the pandemic compared to previous years. There was a decline in non-COVID-19 deaths, which were replaced with deaths due to COVID-19.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is expressed in many cell types, particularly in the lung, including endothelial cells. The initiation of a cytokine storm by the virus along with infection of endothelial cells leads to apoptosis and structural and functional changes that attenuate vascular integrity in many organs including the lungs, heart, liver and kidney. Endothelial damage also enhances the coagulation pathway leading to thrombus formation in major vessels and capillaries. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has an adverse outcome for individuals with particular comorbid diseases, e.g. hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

This understanding can help to inhibit virus replication, prolong adaptive immune response, accelerated virus clearance, and tissue recovery, a key milestone to combat coronaviruses (CoVs), e.g., Covid-19. An innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses against CoVs upon recognition of viruses. An appropriate defense against various coronavirus strains requires a deep understanding of the innate immune response system. Current deep learning approaches focus more on Covid-19 detection and pay no attention to understand the immune response once a virus invades. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based (GNN) model that exploits the interactions between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)to understand the human immune response system. PRRs are germline-encoded proteins that identify molecules related to pathogens and initiate a defense mechanism against the related pathogens, thereby aiding the innate immune response system. An understanding of PRR interactions can help to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to predict the activation requirements of each PRR. The immune response information of each PRR is derived from combining its historical PAMPs activation coupled with the modeled effect on the same from PRRs in its neighborhood. On one hand, this work can help to understand how long Covid-19 can confer immunity for a strong immune response. On the other hand, this GNN-based understanding can also abode well for appropriate vaccine development efforts against CoVs.

This multi-country survey aimed to assess the levels and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa between July and December 2021. The survey was conducted using computer-assisted telephone interviewing among adolescents in five sub-Saharan African countries, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania. A rural area and an urban area were included in each country (except Ghana, which only had a rural area), with approximately 300 adolescents in each area and 2803 in total. Sociodemographic characteristics and perceptions and attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines were measured. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as definitely not getting vaccinated or being undecided on whether to get vaccinated if a COVID-19 vaccine were available. Log-binomial models were used to calculate the adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between potential determinants and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The percentage of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 15% in rural Kersa, 24% in rural Ibadan, 31% in rural Nouna, 33% in urban Ouagadougou, 37% in urban Addis Ababa, 48% in rural Kintampo, 64% in urban Lagos, 76% in urban Dar es Salaam, and 88% in rural Dodoma.

To address the basis of Kex1p targeting to the Golgi apparatus, we examined the cellular location of a series of carboxy- terminal truncations of the protein. The results indicate that a cytoplasmically exposed carboxy-terminal domain is required for retention of this membrane protein within the Golgi apparatus. Deletions of the retention region or overproduction of wild-type Kex1p led to mislocalization of Kex1p to the vacuolar membrane. This unexpected finding is discussed in terms of models involving either the vacuole as a default destination for membrane proteins, or by endocytosis to the vacuole following their default localization to the plasma membrane.","output":"Yeast Kex1p is a Golgi-associated membrane protein: deletions in a cytoplasmic targeting domain result in mislocalization to the vacuolar membrane"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental disorders might be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. We aimed to assess the specific risks of COVID-19-related mortality, hospitalisation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission associated with any pre-existing mental disorder, and specific diagnostic categories of mental disorders, and exposure to psychopharmacological drug classes. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases between Jan 1, 2020, and March 5, 2021, for original studies reporting data on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with psychiatric disorders compared with controls. We excluded studies with overlapping samples, studies that were not peer-reviewed, and studies written in languages other than English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. We modelled random-effects meta-analyses to estimate crude odds ratios (OR) for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection as the primary outcome, and hospitalisation and ICU admission as secondary outcomes. We calculated adjusted ORs for available data. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was tested with Egger regression and visual inspection of funnel plots. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall strength of the evidence and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to assess study quality. We also did subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to assess the effects of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting, patient age, country, pandemic phase, quality assessment score, sample sizes, and adjustment for confounders. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021233984. FINDINGS: 841 studies were identified by the systematic search, of which 33 studies were included in the systematic review and 23 studies in the meta-analysis, comprising 1 469 731 patients with COVID-19, of whom 43 938 had mental disorders. The sample included 130 807 females (89% of the whole sample) and 130 373 males (88%). Nine studies provided data on patient race and ethnicity, and 22 studies were rated as high quality. The presence of any mental disorder was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR 200 [95% CI 158C254]; I(2)=9266%). This association was also observed for psychotic disorders (205 [137C306]; I(2)=8081%), mood disorders (199 [146C271]; I(2)=6832%), substance use disorders (176 [127C244]; I(2)=4790%), and intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders (173 [129C231]; I(2)=9015%) but not for anxiety disorders (107 [073C156]; I(2)=1105%). COVID-19 mortality was associated with exposure to antipsychotics (371 [174C791]; I(2)=9031%), anxiolytics (258 [122C544]; I(2)=9642%), and antidepressants (223 [106C471]; I(2)=9545%). For psychotic disorders, mood disorders, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics, the association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and other confounders. Mental disorders were associated with increased risk of hospitalisation (224 [170C294]; I(2)=8880%). No significant associations with mortality were identified for ICU admission. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions showed significant associations of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting (p=0013) and country (p<00001) with mortality. No significant associations with mortality were identified for other covariates. No evidence of publication bias was found. GRADE assessment indicated high certainty for crude mortality and hospitalisation, and moderate certainty for crude ICU admission. INTERPRETATION: Pre-existing mental disorders, in particular psychotic and mood disorders, and exposure to antipsychotics and anxiolytics were associated with COVID-19 mortality in both crude and adjusted models. Although further research is required to determine the underlying mechanisms, our findings highlight the need for targeted approaches to manage and prevent COVID-19 in at-risk patient groups identified in this study.

Clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid combination is the most commonly used dual antiplatelet therapy recommended by international guidelines and in Chinese clinical practice. Poor adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy or premature interruption of dual antiplatelet therapy is an important contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lethal cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid fixed-dose combination enhances adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy. Herein, we aimed to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel in fixed-dose combination compared with simultaneous administration of their individual formulations in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. METHODS This was a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-sequence, three-period, two-treatment, crossover study with a washout period of 10 days conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive Co-Plavix? (test formulation- fixed-dose combination of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) once and reference formulations (coadministration of individual formulations of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) twice during the study period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed for acetylsalicylic acid, its metabolite salicylic acid, clopidogrel, and its metabolite SR26334. As acetylsalicylic acid shows high intrasubject variability, the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) approach was implemented for acetylsalicylic acid analysis, while bioequivalence of clopidogrel was assessed using the average bioequivalence method. Point ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC, AUClast, and Cmax for acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were calculated. RESULTS In total, 171 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomized and 170 subjects were treated with test or reference formulation; 164 subjects completed the study. Regarding acetylsalicylic acid exposure, as reference within-subject standard deviation (SDW) was at least 0.294 for acetylsalicylic acid Cmax, AUClast, and AUC, the RSABE analysis method was used to assess bioequivalence for all three parameters. The point estimates were within the 0.80-1.25 range (1.19, 1.09, and 1.04, respectively), and upper one-sided 95% CIs of scaled average bioequivalence metric were at most 0 (- 0.30, - 0.14, and - 0.10, respectively). Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated with acetylsalicylic acid. Bioequivalence was also achieved with clopidogrel as the 90% CIs for geometric mean ratios of clopidogrel Cmax, AUClast, and AUC were within the bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25). CONCLUSION Application of the reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid in Chinese male and female healthy volunteers under fasting conditions demonstrated bioequivalence of test and reference formulations.

STUDY DESIGN: This study was designed as a non-concurrent case-control study on breastfeeding initiation practices, defined according to WHO, in women giving birth during lockdown, between March 8 and May 18, 2020, in the COVID-19 'hotspot' in Northeastern Italy (study group), with an antecedent puerperae-matched group (control group). Exclusive, complementary, and formula feeding practices were collected from maternal charts at hospital discharge, on the second day post-partum, when puerperae filled out the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS: The COVID-19 study group presented significantly lower exclusive breastfeeding rates than the control group who members gave birth the previous year (-15%, p = 0.003), as a consequence of the significantly higher prevalence of complementary feeding practices in the former (+20%, p = 0.002). Conversely, the COVID-19 study group showed significantly higher EPDS scores (8.03  4.88 vs. 8.03  4.88, p < 0.005) and higher anhedonia (0.56  0.65 vs. 0.18  0.38, p < 0.001) and depression (0.62  0.60 vs. 0.39  0.44, <0.001) subscale scores. In the general linear model analysis, women practicing exclusive breastfeeding showed significantly lower EPDS scores in comparison with those practicing complementary (p = 0.003) and formula feedings (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the highest EPDS scores were observed in women adopting formula feeding, mainly during the COVID-19 quarantine (p = 0.019).

However, the overall safety and efficacy of these agents compared with oral or systemic therapy remains controversial. METHODS Two 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled, multicenter studies compared the safety and efficacy profiles of diclofenac topical solution (TDiclo) with oral diclofenac (ODiclo). Each study independently showed that TDiclo had similar efficacy to ODiclo. To compare the safety profiles of TDiclo and ODiclo, a pooled safety analysis was performed for 927 total patients who had radiologically confirmed symptomatic OA of the knee. This pooled analysis included patients treated with TDiclo, containing 45.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and those treated with ODiclo. Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), recording of vital signs, dermatologic evaluation of the study knee, and clinical laboratory evaluation. RESULTS AEs occurred in 312 (67.1%) patients using TDiclo versus 298 (64.5%) of those taking ODiclo. The most common AE with TDiclo was dry skin at the application site (24.1% vs 1.9% with ODiclo; P < 0.0001). Fewer gastrointestinal (25.4% vs 39.0%; P < 0.0001) and cardiovascular (1.5% vs 3.5%; P = 0.055) AEs occurred with TDiclo compared with ODiclo. ODiclo was associated with significantly greater increases in liver enzymes and creatinine, and greater decreases in creatinine clearance and hemoglobin (P < 0.001 for all).

The objective was to investigate the link between the four-factor structure model of coping and mental health among those living in lockdown. Methods: The sample was comprised of 100 participants. The data was collected through purposive sampling. Mental health was measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and coping strategies from the Brief Cope Inventory. A personal information questionnaire was also used to gather information about the characteristics of participants, such as age, gender and education, in addition to questions related to other stressors. Linear regression was used to assess the association between variables. A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Overall, the results showed high levels of stress, anxiety and depression among participants. These findings revealed a significant association between active avoidance and religious/denial coping strategies and mental health problems. However, problem-focused and positive coping strategies were found to be insignificant for all three mental health problems. Other social and personal factors, such as being away from family (90%), having problems sleeping (86%), worrying about the future (85%), experiencing anger (83%), lacking emotional support (79%) and having fear of receiving bad news (72%), were reported often by participants.

In Denmark, some patients may not be eligible for hip-preserving surgery due to being overweight, hip osteoarthritis, age above 45 years, negative impingement test or not wishing to undergo surgery. These patients are left with no evidence-based treatment option. The patient perspective when not being eligible for surgery has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to explore the experiences of living with developmental dysplasia of the hip in adults not eligible for hip-preserving surgery. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In this qualitative study, we used a phenomenologicalChermeneutic approach to explore the experiences of living with developmental dysplasia of the hip. We conducted semistructured interviews with 17 purposefully selected patients (median age 37 (range 19C50) years). The patients were recruited from a population of 30 patients included in a larger feasibility study evaluating a 6-month exercise and patient education intervention. We used a ricoeur-inspired method to analyse and interpret the interview data. RESULTS: Three themes were identified. First, developmental dysplasia of the hip is more than just a joint disease. Second, living with pain is difficult when pain has its own life. Third, limitations imposed by hip problems challenge the perception of oneself as young, active and independent. Identity, meaningfulness, control over pain and coping with pain were areas of the patients lives that were influenced. CONCLUSION: Living with developmental dysplasia of the hip had a considerable impact on the patients of this study and their everyday life in several areas. Therefore, it may be relevant to approach patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip from a biopsychosocial point of view.

Therefore, there is a need to accurately predict the aggressiveness of the disease without taking an invasive biopsy. In this study, we develop a test that can predict whether a patient has prostate cancer and how aggressive that cancer is. This test combines clinical measurements, levels of four genes collected from a fraction of the urine, and levels of six peptides found in urine. We found that this test, deemed ExoSpec, has the potential to improve the pathway for men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer and could reduce the requirement for biopsies by 30%. ABSTRACT: There is a clinical need to improve assessment of biopsy-na?ve patients for the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we investigated whether the robust integration of expression data from urinary extracellular vesicle RNA (EV-RNA) with urine proteomic metabolites can accurately predict PCa biopsy outcome. Urine samples collected within the Movember GAP1 Urine Biomarker study (n = 192) were analysed by both mass spectrometry-based urine-proteomics and NanoString gene-expression analysis (167 gene-probes). Cross-validated LASSO penalised regression and Random Forests identified a combination of clinical and urinary biomarkers for predictive modelling of significant disease (Gleason Score (Gs)  3 + 4). Four predictive models were developed: MassSpec (CE-MS proteomics), EV-RNA, and SoC (standard of care) clinical data models, alongside a fully integrated omics-model, deemed ExoSpec. ExoSpec (incorporating four gene transcripts, six peptides, and two clinical variables) is the best model for predicting Gs  3 + 4 at initial biopsy (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77C0.88) and is superior to a standard of care (SoC) model utilising clinical data alone (AUC = 0.71, p < 0.001, 1000 resamples). As the ExoSpec Risk Score increases, the likelihood of higher-grade PCa on biopsy is significantly greater (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 2.1C3.7). The decision curve analyses reveals that ExoSpec provides a net benefit over SoC and could reduce unnecessary biopsies by 30%.","output":"A Model to Detect Significant Prostate Cancer Integrating Urinary Peptide and Extracellular Vesicle RNA Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Product-as-a-service business models have been strongly promoted to support a transition to a circular economy.

The goal of this study was to determine if the presence of a frontal brain tumour influences propofol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and existing PK-PD model performance. Methods Twenty patients with a frontal brain tumour and 20 control patients received a propofol infusion to achieve an induction-emergence-induction anaesthetic sequence. Propofol plasma concentration was measured every 4 min and at each transition of the conscious state. Bispectral index (BIS) values were continuously recorded. We used non-linear mixed-effects modelling to analyse the effects of the presence of a brain tumour on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol. Subsequently we calculated the predictive performance of Marsh, Schnider, and Eleveld models in terms of median prediction error (MdPE) and median absolute prediction error (MdAPE). Results Patients with brain tumours showed 40% higher propofol clearance than control patients. Performance of the Schnider model (MdPEpk -20.0%, MdAPEpk 23.4%) and Eleveld volunteer model (MdPEpk -8.58%, MdAPEpk 21.6%) were good.

METHODS: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory level, health regions, and local areas) (15 \\"overall\\" indicators), and for four vulnerable settings (long-term care and detention facilities, schools, and homeless shelters) and eight social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, healthcare worker status, occupational sector, income, and education) (180 \\"equity-related\\" indicators) as of December 31, 2020. Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. RESULTS: Overall, information was more complete for cases and deaths than for tests, hospitalizations, and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 58%, \\"D\\") than that for equity-related indicators (average score of 17%, \\"F\\"). Only British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario provided case-delimited data, with Ontario and Alberta providing case information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' immigration status, race/ethnicity, income, or education. Though several provinces reported on cases in long-term care facilities, only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for detention facilities and schools, and only Ontario reported on cases within homeless shelters and across occupational sectors.

METHODS Fifty-nine primary total ankle arthroplasties utilizing INBONE I or II implants were performed in fifty-nine patients (thirty-one men and twenty-eight women; mean age, 57.2 years) from 2008 to 2012. The AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society) ankle-hindfoot score and VAS (visual analog scale) pain score were recorded preoperatively and at the time of the latest follow-up. Weight-bearing radiographs were used to determine ankle motion and assess component alignment and subsidence. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, reoperations, and failures were evaluated. RESULTS All fifty-nine patients were available for follow-up at least two years after surgery; the mean follow-up duration was 35.0  11.9 months. The estimated survival rate at two years was 96.6% in the entire cohort (91.3% in the INBONE I group and 100% in the INBONE II group) when revision of the tibial and/or the talar component was used as the end point. The mean AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score improved from 44.1 to 87.3 at the time of the latest follow-up (p < 0.01), and the mean VAS pain score improved from 8.1 to 1.6 (p < 0.01). Mean total ankle motion improved from 29.0 to 38.0 (p < 0.01). Fourteen patients (24%) required a reoperation because of a postoperative complication. Five of these patients (four with INBONE I implants and one with INBONE II implants; 8% of the entire cohort) required revision surgery at a mean of 32.4 months (range, fifteen to fifty-eight months) because of symptomatic talar subsidence. Talar revisions utilized an INBONE II implant with a pegged talar sulcus for definitive management. The patients who underwent revision surgery had mean total ankle motion of 41.6, neutral alignment, and no further reoperations at the time of the latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Early results of INBONE intramedullary-fixation total ankle arthroplasty demonstrated improved patient-reported outcomes and increased ankle motion at a minimum follow-up of two years. Arthrofibrosis and talar subsidence were the main postoperative complications that required revision, and these predominantly affected the first-generation INBONE I implants.","output":"Early clinical and radiographic outcomes of intramedullary-fixation total ankle arthroplasty."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the oscillation of laboratory parameters among indoor patients infected with COVID-19 Methods: This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at Tertiary Care Institute, Rawalpindi from 01 March 2020 to 20 May 2020 Three hundred and ninety-two patients with mild to moderate illness, PCR positive for COVID 19 were included Prevalence of typical symptoms of coronavirus disease cough, fever, sore throat and shortness of breath was recorded PCR was repeated after seven days of admission, if declared negative, another executed on consecutive day Discharge Criteria was two consecutive negative PCR Results: A total of 392 patients enrolled in the study with age range 9-45 and mean 33 227 98 years A total of 8 (2%) patients were females and 384(98%) males 296(75 5%) did not have a cough whereas 96(24 5%) presented with the trait 296 (75 5%) patients did not have associated fever whereas 96(24 5%) manifested with fever Chest x-ray had a bilateral patch in 96 (24 5%) patients only Ferritin was raised in 96 (24 5%) patients however were recorded within normal limits in 296(75 5%) patients Coagulation Profile was deranged in 64(16 3%) patients whereas was within range in 328(83 7%) patients Serum Bilirubin, Serum Alkaline phosphatases, Serum Albumin, Serum Urea, Serum Potassium were essentially in typical tolls in 392(100%) patients However Serum Alanine Aminotransferase was raised in 32(8 2%), Serum C reactive Protein was elevated in 48(12 2%) An exaggerated values of serum creatinine and serum sodium were noticed in 24(6 1%) and 16(4 1%) respectively Conclusion: Routine haematological tests, biochemical tests, serological tests, and radiographic tests are crucial to conclusion, foundation and progression of ailment in COVID-19 contaminated patients","output":"Establishment of Diagnostic Protocols for COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological weapons achieve their intended target effects through the infectivity of disease-causing infectious agents.

It is aimed at creating casualties, terror, societal disruption, or economic loss, inspired by ideological, religious or political beliefs. The success of bioterroristic attempts is defined by the measure of societal disruption and panic, and not necessarily by the sheer number of casualties.

Users can choose from seven COVID-19 models, customize 23 parameters, examine trends in testing and hospitalization, and download forecast data. RESULTS: Our application accurately predicts the spread of COVID-19 across states and territories. Its hospital-level forecasts are in continuous use by our home institution and others. DISCUSSION: Our application is versatile, easy-to-use, and can help hospitals plan their response to the changing dynamics of COVID-19, while providing a platform for deeper study. CONCLUSION: Empowering healthcare responses to COVID-19 is as crucial as understanding the epidemiology of the disease. Our application will continue to evolve to meet this need. LAY SUMMARY: Hospitals have been continually faced with anticipating the resurgent spread of COVID-19 and its effects on visits, admissions, bed needs, and crucial supplies. However, few open source tools are available to aid hospitals in planning.

Users can choose from a suite of models to predict the spread of COVID-19, some of which explain > 99% of variation in COVID-19 cases within states. Users can modify a large set of inputs to obtain forecasts for their institution, examine variability in forecasts over time, download forecast data for further analysis, and explore trends in hospitalization and testing. We designed our application to be interactive, insightful, and easy to use for hospital leaders, healthcare workers, and government officials.

Before COVID, much of the emphasis in transport policy was on demand management, smart technological interventions and sustainable mobility. The public health crisis has necessitated an urgent reconsideration of transport and its contribution to post-COVID economic recovery. In recognition of the importance of individual behaviour and collective responsibility in protecting both personal and public health during the crisis, this think piece proposes a new concept of Responsible Transport to help inform and shape transport policy and practice responses to COVID. The novelty of this proposal lies in the fact that it incorporates not only environmental considerations with respect to sustainability but also encompasses considerations of individual and community health and wellbeing. Moreover, it stresses the role of the individual as a responsible autonomous actor in delivering socially desired transport outcomes.","output":"Responsible Transport: A post-COVID agenda for transport policy and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R(t)) in Wuhan declined from 235 (95% CI 115C477) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 105 (041C239) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R(t), assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to investigate the impact of students falling behind (as proxy for self-regulation failure) on their final course mark. The sample comprised students from four undergraduate modules offered at a South African university in a face-to-face setting (N = 1,604), as well as an ERT setting (N = 1,478). Students falling behind were measured as the days behind, relative to the academic program, using learning management system (LMS) log data.

B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering for surface accessibility, sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. RESULTS: From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. From 3730 (MHC-I) and 5045 (MHC-II) candidate ligands, 292 CD8+ and 284 CD4+ T cell epitopes were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we proposed a set of 22 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies. We curated a dataset of ~ 1000 observed T cell epitopes from convalescent COVID-19 patients across eight studies, showing 8/15 recurrent epitope regions to overlap with at least one of our candidate peptides. Of the 22 candidate vaccine peptides, 16 (n = 10 T cell epitope optimized; n = 6 B cell epitope optimized) were manually selected to decrease their degree of sequence overlap and then synthesized. The immunogenicity of the synthesized vaccine peptides was validated using ELISpot and ELISA following murine vaccination. Strong T cell responses were observed in 7/10 T cell epitope optimized peptides following vaccination. Humoral responses were deficient, likely due to the unrestricted conformational space inhabited by linear vaccine peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we find our selection process and vaccine formulation to be appropriate for identifying T cell epitopes and eliciting T cell responses against those epitopes. Further studies are needed to optimize prediction and induction of B cell responses, as well as study the protective capacity of predicted T and B cell epitopes.","output":"Landscape and selection of vaccine epitopes in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: A plethora of medicines have been repurposed or used as adjunctive therapies for COVID-19. We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China, Spain, and the USA. Design: International network cohort Setting: Hospital electronic health records from Columbia University Irving Medical Centre (NYC, USA), Stanford (CA, USA), Tufts (MA, USA), Premier (USA), Optum EHR (USA), department of veterans affairs (USA), NFHCRD (Honghu, China) and HM Hospitals (Spain); and nationwide claims from HIRA (South Korea) Participants: patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from January to June 2020 Main outcome measures: Prescription/dispensation of any medicine on or 30 days after hospital admission date Analyses: Number and percentage of users overall and over time Results: 71,921 people were included: 304 from China, 2,089 from Spain, 7,599 from South Korea, and 61,929 from the USA. A total of 3,455 medicines were identified. Common repurposed medicines included hydroxychloroquine (<2% in NFHCRD to 85.4% in HM), azithromycin (4.9% in NFHCRD to 56.5% in HM), lopinavir/ritonavir (<3% in all US but 34.9% in HIRA and 56.5% in HM), and umifenovir (0% in all except 78.3% in NFHCRD). Adjunctive medicines were used with great variability, with the ten most used treatments being (in descending order): bemiparin, enoxaparin, heparin, ceftriaxone, aspirin, vitamin D, famotidine, vitamin C, dexamethasone, and metformin. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increased rapidly in use in March-April but declined steeply in May-June. Conclusions: Multiple medicines were used in the first months of COVID-19 pandemic, with substantial geographic and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed medicines. Antithrombotics, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids were often used as adjunctive treatments.

Patient characteristics, knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, risk behaviour and mental state will differ between individuals. The primary aim of this study was to investigate these variables in patients visiting an emergency department in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Consecutive adult patients, visiting the emergency room at the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were asked to fill out questionnaires on the above-mentioned items on an iPad. The patients were either COVID-19 suspected or COVID-19 not suspected (control group). Findings: This study included a total of 159 patients, 33 (21%) tested positive, 85 (53%) negative and 41 (26%) were COVID-19 not suspected (control group). All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (p-value 0.04). COVID-19 suspected patients and patients with comorbidities had a significantly higher level of anxiety compared to COVID-19 not suspected patients (p-value < 0.001). There is thus no mass hysteria regarding COVID-19The higher the anxiety, the more seriously hygiene measures were followed. Interpretation: Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection. COVID-19 suspected patients and patients with comorbidities were significantly more anxious. Moreover, the higher the degree of fear, the more carefully hygiene measures were observed.

Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of TTSuV1. In this study, synonymous codon usage patterns and the key determinants in the coding region of 29 available complete TTSuV1 genome sequences were examined. By calculating the nucleotide content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of TTSuV1 coding sequences, we found that the preferentially used codons were mostly those ending with A or C nucleotides; less-used codons were mostly codons ending with U or G nucleotides, and these were mainly affected by composition constraints. Although there was a variation in codon usage bias among different TTSuV1 genomes, the codon usage bias and GC content in the TTSuV1 coding region was lower, which was mainly determined by the base composition in the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. Moreover, the results of correspondence analysis (COA) indicated that the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolated from different countries varied greatly and had significant differences. In addition, Spearmans rank correlation analysis and an ENC plot revealed that apart from mutation pressure, which was critical in determining the codon usage pattern, other factors were involved in shaping the evolution of codon usage bias in TTSuV1, such as natural selection. Those results suggested that synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes were the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. The information from this study not only provides important insights into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV1, but also helps to identify the main factors affecting codon usage by this virus.","output":"Analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote communication in ENT has been expanding, spurred by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Methods: The current is a cross-sectional study that included 8426 young adults. Socio-demographic and mental health data were collected through an online survey during May-June 2020 in Ecuador. Data on mobility was extracted from Google Mobility Reports. Four aspects of the participants mental health were evaluated: eating behavior (emotional eating), depression, sleep quality and sense of coherence using previously validated instruments. Data were analyzed using linear regression using R. Results: Mean age of the participants was 22.85 (SD = 4.43), most of whom were women (n = 5943, 70.53%). During mandatory confinement, mobility due to retail and recreation, to groceries and pharmacies, to parks, to transit stations, to workplaces were reduced by nearly 50%. In contrast, mobility to places of residence increased by nearly 20%. Less healthy eating behavior was associated with lower mobility to retail/recreation, residential or workplaces. Depression was associated with lower mobility to residential and workplaces. Worse quality of sleep was associated with lower mobility to retail/recreation, residential and workplaces. Higher sense of coherence was associated with higher mobility to residential and to workplaces. Women and youngsters more often showed depression, less healthy eating behavior, worse quality of sleep and lower sense of coherence.

Autophagy is a cell survival mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Citrullination is a post-translational modification catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes. Autophagy and citrullination may generate neoepitopes, evoking an autoimmune response. No previous studies have investigated the connection of these processes, and how BLM could affect them, in SLE. Ex vivo autophagy and protein citrullination were analyzed by western blot in lysates from 26 SLE patients PBMCs at baseline and after 2, 4, and 12 weeks of BLM administration, and from 16 healthy donors PBMCs. Autophagic PBMCs were identified by the immunofluorescent detection of the autophagy-associated proteins LC3B (LC3 puncta) and LAMP-1. Autophagosome accumulation was evaluated in CD14(?) (PBLs) and CD14(+) (monocytes) SLE cells. The presence of the BLyS receptors BAFF-R, BCMA, and TACI on SLE CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells and monocytes, as well as serum IL-18 levels, was also assessed. Following BLM administration, we observed a decrease in autophagy and citrullination, with a lowering of LC3-II, citrullinated vimentin, and PAD4 expression levels in PBMCs from SLE patients. LC3-II levels showed a correlation with the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) after 12 weeks of therapy. The LC3B/LAMP-1 analysis confirmed the reduction in autophagy. A lesser autophagosome accumulation occurred in PBLs and monocytes which, in turn, seemed to be the main cellular populations contributing to autophagy. A reduction in patients serum IL-18 concentrations occurred. CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells weakly expressed BAFF receptors; monocytes expressed only BAFF-R. BLM could impact on autophagy and citrullination, offering an opportunity for a deeper understanding of these mechanisms in SLE, and a possible tool for the clinical management of SLE.","output":"Belimumab Decreases Autophagy and Citrullination in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Oxygen is a drug with specific properties, a defined doseCeffect range and side effects. In 2015, in a sample of UK hospital patients, 14% were treated with oxygen, of which only 42% had a prescription. Health care workers are often uncertain about the relevance of hypoxemia, and there is limited awareness of the risks of hyperoxemia. Numerous randomized controlled trials on oxygen therapy have recently been published. METHODS: As part of the guideline program of the Working Group of Scientific Medical Societies e. V. (AWMF), this S3 guideline was developed with the participation of 10 medical societies on the basis of a literature search up to 02/01/2021. The system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) (The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence) was used to evaluate the literature. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), and a formal consensus process of recommendations was performed. RESULTS: The guideline contains 34 evidence-based recommendations on the indication, prescription, monitoring, and discontinuation of oxygen therapy in acute care. The indication for oxygen is mainly hypoxemia. Hypoxemia and hyperoxemia should be avoided, since both increase mortality. The guideline recommends target ranges of oxygen saturation for acute oxygen therapy without differentiating between different diagnoses. Target areas depend on the risk for hypercapnia and ventilation status. The guideline provides an overview of available oxygen delivery systems and contains recommendations for their selection based on patient safety and comfort. CONCLUSION: This is the first German guideline on the use of oxygen in acute care. It is aimed at medical professionals who use oxygen in and outside hospitals and is valid until June 30th, 2024.","output":"Sauerstoff in der Akuttherapie beim Erwachsenen: Kurzversion der S3-Leitlinie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The association of antihypertensive drugs with the risk and severity of COVID-19 remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv for publications before July 13, 2020. Cohort studies and case-control studies that contain information on the association of antihypertensive agents including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), ?-blockers, and diuretics with the risk and severity of COVID-19 were selected. The random or fixed-effects models were used to pool the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. The literature search yielded 53 studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria, which comprised 39 cohort studies and 14 case-control studies. These studies included a total of 2,100,587 participants. We observed no association between prior usage of antihypertensive medications including ACEIs/ARBs, CCBs, ?-blockers, or diuretics and the risk and severity of COVID-19.

Ironically, this coincides with an immediate need for research to comprehend the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the pathology of COVID-19. As the global crisis has already led to over 15,000 deaths out of 175,000 confirmed cases in New York City and Nassau County, NY alone, it is increasingly urgent to collect patient biospecimens linked to active clinical follow up.

Methods: The analytic sample comprised de-identified data from a consecutive cohort of 480 adults with heart disease (62% female, 27% non-white race/ethnicity, mean age 70.9  12.6 years) that completed an initial consultation for an evidence-based telebehavioral therapy program between March 23-April 11, 2020. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, race/ethnicity, U.S. region, marital status, living alone, employment status, self-rated health (from the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey), and psychological symptom severity (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21) were obtained through standardized assessment conducted by a licensed therapist. COVID-19 related concerns were abstracted from clinical notes and characterized using qualitative research methods. Associations between participant characteristics and the presence of a COVID-19 concern were evaluated using chi-square statistics and logistic regression. Results: Forty percent of participants (191/480) reported at least one COVID-19 related concern at their initial consultation.

This article presents an autoethnographic case study of a non-profit HSE programme in Philadelphia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The four authors of this article, all of them instructors on the front line of the youth crisis in adult education, explore the broader context of non-governmental organisation (NGO) management and privatised HSE exams. In their research and their reflections, they found that the pandemic exacerbated existing economic and social inequalities, with both pre-pandemic and current delivery of their HSE programme failing to address the survival needs of a population which has long been living in crisis. Juxtaposing relevant youth-in-crisis literature with narratives both from before the pandemic and whilst living through it, the authors of this article discuss the funding and institutional constraints around the environment in which they teach. Their case study sheds light on competing priorities within the non-profit education landscape, highlighting both pitfalls and successes in HSE curriculum and administration.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of maximizing algebraic connectivity in multilayer networks by allocating interlink weights subject to a budget while allowing arbitrary interconnections. For budgets below a threshold, we identify an upper-bound for maximum algebraic connectivity which is independent of interconnections pattern and is reachable with satisfying a certain regularity condition. For efficient numerical approaches in regions of no analytical solution, we cast the problem into a convex framework that explores the problem from several perspectives and, particularly, transforms into a graph embedding problem that is easier to interpret and related to the optimum diffusion phase. Allowing arbitrary interconnections entails regions of multiple transitions, giving more diverse diffusion phases with respect to one-to-one interconnection case. When there is no limitation on the interconnections pattern, we derive several analytical results characterizing the optimal weights by individual Fiedler vectors. We use the ratio of algebraic connectivity and the layer sizes to explain the results. Finally, we study the placement of a limited number of interlinks by greedy heuristics, using the Fiedler vector components of each layer.","output":"Maximizing the algebraic connectivity in multilayer networks with arbitrary interconnections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The aim of this study is to identify the frequency of stroke among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in Sakarya city, to find out the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with stroke and to contribute to the national database Material and Methods: This retrospective study was carried out with 783 cases diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 between April-June 2020 at the pandemic hospital in Sakarya city Patients were compared in terms of age, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), risk factors, radiological findings, inpatient treatment, intubation, and mortality rates Results: Out of 26 cases of ischemic stroke, 11 (42 3%) were male and 15 (57 7%) were female In terms of infarction localization, the cause was medial cerebral artery (MCA) in 4 (15 4%) patients, top of the basilar in 2 (7 7%) patients, basilar artery in 1 (3 8%) patient, lacunar in 9 (34 6%) patients and anterior system in 10 (38 5%) patients There was no significant difference in terms of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels according to disease severity (both p=0 262) Three (0 38%) patients presented with stroke findings and were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 Cryptogenic stroke was detected in 8 (30 8%) of the SARS-CoV-2 cases Stroke frequency was calculated as 3 3% among the SARS-CoV-2 cases in Sakarya city Conclusion: This is the first study to identify the frequency of stroke among SARS-CoV-2 patients in Sakarya city and Turkey Our study is important as it shows that preventing or treating ischemic stroke in SARS-CoV-2 cases contributes greatly to the reduction of mortality ? 2020, Duzce University Medical School All rights reserved","output":"Investigating the frequency of stroke in sars-cov-2 cases in Sakarya city, Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fikih Kebencanaan (Coping with Disaster) is a product of Muhammadiyah's ijtihad to respond to contemporary problems, especially geological and non-geological disasters, which later become the normative foundation for the mitigation of health disasters such as the Covid-19 pandemic.

Policies, suitable service provision, and training are needed to identify and treat psychological morbidity following a traumatic birth experience, but currently there is little insight into whether and what is provided in different contexts. The aim of this knowledge mapping exercise was to map policy, service and training provision for women following a traumatic birth experience in different European countries. METHODS: A survey was distributed as part of the COST Action Perinatal mental health and birth-related trauma: Maximizing best practice and optimal outcomes. Questions were designed to capture country level data; care provision (i.e., national policies or guidelines for the screening, treatment and/or prevention of a traumatic birth, service provision), and nationally mandated pre-registration and post-registration training for maternity professionals. RESULTS: Eighteen countries participated. Only one country (the Netherlands) had national policies regarding the screening, treatment, and prevention of a traumatic birth experience/CB-PTSD. Service provision was provided formally in six countries (33%), and informally in the majority (78%). In almost all countries (89%), women could be referred to specialist perinatal or mental health services. Services tended to be provided by midwives, although some multidisciplinary practice was apparent. Seven (39%) of the countries offered a few hours professional/pre-registration training, but none offered nationally mandated post-registration training.

The assay consists of a singleplex PCR step that amplifies a highly homologous DNA sequence which encodes for the RNA component of the large ribosome subunit. The amplicons of the two different parasites differ between them by single nucleotide variations, known as Single Nucleotide Fingerprint (SNF) markers. The SNF markers can be easily identified by naked eye using a novel micro Spin-Tube device \\"Spin-Tube\\", as each of them creates a specific spot pattern. Moreover, the direct use of ribosomal RNA without requiring the PCR pre-amplification step is also feasible, further increasing the simplicity of the assay. The molecular assay delivers sensitivity capable of identifying up to 8.7 copies per L with single mismatch specificity. The Spin-Tube thus represents an innovative solution providing benefits in terms of time, cost, and simplicity, all of which are crucial for the diagnosis of infectious disease in developing countries.","output":"A colorimetric strategy based on dynamic chemistry for direct detection of Trypanosomatid species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory diseases are one of the most common causes of death in the world and this recent COVID-19 pandemic is a key example.

The evolution of employment in this subsector in 2020, as a direct consequence of this crisis, was also analyzed considering data provided by producers. Results showed an intra-annual seasonal effect for milk prices in 2020 for both livestock species, as observed in previous years. However, a negative economic impact on goat milk prices due to the pandemic was checked during the confinement and post-confinement months. Sheep milk prices remained stable. Lamb and goat kid meat prices showed a similar trend in comparison with 2019 during the pre-COVID-19 period.

Though multiple gene signatures reflect the complex cellular response to hypoxia have been established in several cancer types such as head and neck, breast, and lung cancers, the hypoxic panorama in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly understood. METHODS: A hypoxic signature constituted by a total of 356 genes, including canonical hypoxia-responsive ADM, ANGPTL4, CA9, and VEGFA, was established based on systemic literature search. A total of 1,730 CRC samples across four independent cohorts were used for nonnegative matrix factorization clustering and subtyping. Prognosis, molecular signatures, pathways, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were compared between the subtypes. RESULTS: CRCs mainly fell into two subgroups, one indicated as hypoxia and the other one designated as normoxia. Hypoxia was correlated with poor outcomes in CRC and will increase the risk of a subset of stage II patients to the level of normoxic stage III. Additionally, hypoxia was closely associated with activation of RAS signaling pathway independent of KRAS mutation.

METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed in 23 eyes from 21 patients who underwent OCTA of neovascular complexes (NVCs) due to PDR. Eyes were imaged with the DRI Triton swept-source OCTA, Avanti RTVue XR or Cirrus HD-OCT 5000 as part of routine clinical examination. Segmentation was adjusted to include vasculature between the vitreous cavity and the internal limiting membrane (ILM). The presence of NVCs was confirmed by clinical examination and multimodal imaging such as color or red-free fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, multicolor imaging or near-infrared reflectance. RESULTS: Thirty-five NVCs were imaged, of which, 34% were neovascularization of the disc (NVD) and 66% were neovascularization elsewhere (NVE). On structural OCT B-scans, NVE appeared as medium to highly reflective tissue that breached the ILM, while NVD showed highly reflective tissue protruding from the disc in a sea fan configuration. Flow signal was seen on OCTA in all cases of NVE and in 67% of NVD lesions. Areas with minimal or absent retinal flow signal identified retinal nonperfusion areas and were found adjacent to 87% of NVE. Intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMAs) were noted next to 70% of NVE. Absent flow signal was seen in 4 NVD cases showing posterior shadowing and were considered inactive. CONCLUSION: OCTA appears useful for imaging NVCs, IRMAs, and retinal nonperfusion areas in eyes with diabetic retinopathy.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of anti-SARS-CoV-2antibody diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in Brazil. METHODS: Eleven commercially available diagnostic tests, comprising five lateral-flow immunochromatographic assays (LFAs) and six immunoenzymatic assays (ELISA) were analyzed from the perspective of the Brazilian Unified Health System. RESULTS: The direct costs of LFAs ranged from US$ 11.42 to US$ 17.41and of ELISAs, from US$ 6.59 to US$ 10.31. Considering an estimated disease prevalence between 5% and 10%, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) was the most cost-effective test, followed by the rapid One Step COVID-19 Test, at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 2.52 and US$ 1.26 per properly diagnosed case, respectively.

METHODS: One hundred fourteen parents who accepted to participate in the study aged 18 and over and who had children between the ages of 6 and 16 were included in the study. A questionnaire was carried out after written consents were obtained. In the first part of the questionnaire, there were a total of 9 questions including socio\\\\demographic information and nutritional characteristics, and the second part included the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC). The data were analyzed with the SPSS 20 statistical program. RESULTS: The total number of participants was 114 parents; 64 (56%) of the children were girls and 50 (43.9%) were boys. Among the participants, the number of children who had COVID\\\\19 was 38 (33.3%). There was no statistically significant relationship between going through COVID\\\\19 status and the variables examined in general. The proportion of participants who stated that if the pandemic period was prolonged, COVID\\\\19 would not change their diet was found to be statistically significant (P = .038).

We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada. Methods We used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program according to tested schedules in clinical trials for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, prioritizing healthcare workers, individuals with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older. Daily vaccination rate was parameterized based on vaccine administration data. Using estimates of vaccine efficacy, we projected the impact of vaccination on the overall attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths. We further investigated the effect of increased daily contacts at different stages during vaccination campaigns on outbreak control. Results Maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with an average of 74% reduction in daily contacts, vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 27.3% (95% CrI: 22.3% - 32.4%) and 27.0% (95% CrI: 21.9% - 32.6%), respectively, over a one-year time horizon. The largest benefits of vaccination were observed in preventing deaths with reductions of 31.5% (95% CrI: 22.5% - 39.7%) and 31.9% (95% CrI: 22.0% - 41.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, compared to no vaccination. We found that an increase of only 10% in daily contacts at the end of lockdown, when vaccination coverage with only one dose was 6%, would trigger a surge in the outbreak. Early relaxation of population-wide measures could lead to a substantial increase in the number of infections, potentially reaching levels observed during the peak of the second wave in Ontario. Conclusions Vaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Sustaining population-wide NPIs, to allow for a sufficient increase in population-level immunity through vaccination, is essential to prevent future outbreaks.","output":"Projecting the impact of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern infecting more than 40 million people across 188 countries and territories.

Recently, deep learning approaches have become an effective tool for automatic screening of medical images, and it is also being considered for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the high infection risk involved with COVID-19 leads to relative sparseness of collected labeled data limiting the performance of such methodologies. Moreover, accurately labeling CT images require expertise of radiologists making the process expensive and time-consuming. In order to tackle the above issues, we propose a supervised domain adaption based COVID-19 CT diagnostic method which can perform effectively when only a small samples of labeled CT scans are available. To compensate for the sparseness of labeled data, the proposed method utilizes a large amount of synthetic COVID-19 CT images and adjusts the networks from the source domain (synthetic data) to the target domain (real data) with a cross-domain training mechanism.

This has resulted in the suggestion of adopting a mild ovarian stimulation approach for all poor responders, based on the results of several trials which failed to identity differences when comparing mild and more intense stimulation in predicted poor responders. The current article analyzes in detail these studies and discusses the shortcomings in terms of type of population included, outcomes and settings performed, which may actually be responsible for the belief that only mild stimulation should be used.

However, the literature on preexisting respiratory diseases and COVID-19, accounting for other possible confounders, is limited. The primary objective of this study was to determine the association between preexisting respiratory diseases and severe disease outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Secondary aim was to investigate any correlation between smoking and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a multihospital retrospective cohort study on 1871 adult patients between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The main outcomes of the study were severe disease outcomes i.e. mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. During statistical analysis, possible confounders such as age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities including, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, any history of cancer and prior liver disease, chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, hyperlipidemia and history of prior stroke, were accounted for. RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (mean (SD) age, 64.11 (16) years; 965(51.6%) males; 1494 (79.9%) African Americans; 809 (43.2%) with &#8805; 3 comorbidities) were included in the study. During their stay at the hospital, 613 patients (32.8%) died, 489 (26.1%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 592 (31.6%) required ICU admission. In fully adjusted models, patients with preexisting respiratory diseases had significantly higher mortality (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR), 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.72; p = 0.01), higher rate of ICU admission (aOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.68; p = 0.009) and increased need for mechanical ventilation (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72; p = 0.01). Additionally, patients with a history of smoking had significantly higher need for ICU admission (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55; p = 0.03) in fully adjusted models. CONCLUSION: Preexisting respiratory diseases are an important predictor for mortality and severe disease outcomes, in COVID-19 patients.

Objective: To characterize the experience of patients with serious illness and their caregivers receiving palliative care (PC) by telemedicine. Design: Mixed-methods telephone survey. Setting/Subjects: Patients and family caregivers who had at least one telemedicine visit with the outpatient PC team at our urban academic medical center. Results: A total of 35 patients and 15 caregivers were surveyed. Patient mean age was 61 years, 49% had cancer, and 86% were Caucasian. Caregiver mean age was 62 years. Mean satisfaction with PC telemedicine visits was 8.9 out of 10 for patients; 8.8 for caregivers. Patients (97%) and caregivers (100%) felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics over video. Participants felt telemedicine was an acceptable format to discuss most sensitive topics but 53% of caregivers preferred to receive bad news in person. Participants valued the convenience of telemedicine; they had concerns about rapport building and desired a more user-friendly telemedicine platform. Conclusions: Patients with serious illness and their caregivers rated telemedicine visits highly and felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics by video.

Data on all infections, including asymptomatic infection, are needed to guide state testing and prevention programs. To minimize biases in estimates from seroprevalence surveys and reported cases, we conducted a state-wide probability survey of Georgia households and estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections adjusted for antibody waning. Methods: From August to December 2020, we mailed kits to self-collect specimens (nasal swabs and blood spots) to a random sample of Georgia addresses. One randomly-selected adult household member completed a survey and returned specimens for virus and antibody testing. We estimated cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections adjusted for waning antibodies, reported fraction, and infection fatality ratio (IFR). Differences in seropositivity among demographic, geographic and clinical subgroups were explored with weighted prevalence ratios (PR). Results: Among 1,370 Georgia adult participants, adjusted cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was 16.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 13.5-19.2%) as of November 16, 2020.

Follow-up data were correlated with measures of pre-COVID-19 status (anthropometrics, comorbidities) and measures of severity of the acute infection. RESULTS: A total of 22 (65%) women and 12 (26%) men reported excessive fatigue. In all, 20 women (67%) and 17 men (37%) reported decreased physical function. Female sex was associated with fatigue. Loss of physical function was associated with pre-COVID-19 presence of heart disease and absence of lung disease. Severity of the acute COVID-19 infection was not associated with fatigue or change in functional status.

There has been an increase in reliance on guidance for decision-making and alterations in the working of the trauma theatre. This has largely been due to the safety measures implemented. Theatre efficiency has gained increasing importance over the years, and with the added pressure of the pandemic, it is essential that trauma theatres operate efficiently. There has been no data analysing the efficiency of trauma theatre during this pandemic. Methods and Results We retrospectively analyzed the data at our hospital and looked into the parameters to assess trauma theatre efficiency. It was noted that the operative time and anaesthetic time went up significantly in 2020 in comparison to 2019. Also, the change over time and the late start time was significantly high in 2020. A large proportion of cases did not start on time in 2020. This resulted in a decrease in the efficiency of theatre usage. Discussion Reduced productivity of the trauma theatre has been due to several reasons, many of which include implementation of safety measures, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), theatre cleaning, recovery of patients, using designated routes for transfer, and many others.

Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its licensing in 1971, the synthetic compound inosine pranobex has been effectively combating viral infections, including herpes zoster, varicella, measles, and infections caused by the herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, EpsteinCBarr virus, cytomegalovirus, and respiratory viruses.

We examine the performance of machine learning algorithms in detecting microvascular disease when trained on either statistical or topological summaries of segmented retinal vascular images. We apply our methods to four publicly-available datasets and find that the fractal dimension performs best for high resolution images. By contrast, we find that topological descriptor vectors quantifying the number of loops in the data achieve the highest accuracy for low resolution images. Further analysis, using the topological approach, reveals that microvascular disease may alter morphology by reducing the number of loops in the retinal vasculature.

Design/methodology - This study conducts a multifaceted analysis of the global supply chain for semiconductors and related equipment in Korea by examining semiconductor imports and exports by semiconductor type, year, target country, mode of transportation, airport/port, and domestic region, using import/export micro-data. The visualisation, flow analysis, and Bayesian Network methodologies were used to compensate for the limitations of each method. Findings - Korea is a major exporter of semiconductor memory and has the world's highest competitiveness but is relatively weak in the field of system semiconductors.

We also show that TNF and monocyte supernatants, but not O. tsutsugamushi infection of endothelial cells per se, upregulated the endothelial cell surface expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and tissue factor. This finding was consistent with the inability of O. tsutsugamushi to induce cytokine secretion from endothelial cells.

Nasodine is a commercial formulation of 0.5% PVP-I that has been evaluated for safety and efficacy in human trials as a treatment for the common cold, including a Phase III trial (ANZCTR: ACTRN12619000764134). This study presents the first report of the in vitro efficacy of this formulation against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We conducted in vitro experiments to determine if the PVP-I formulation inactivated SARS-CoV-2 using two independent assays and virus isolates, and incorporating both PCR-based detection and cell culture methods to assess residual virus after exposure to the formulation. RESULTS Based on cell culture results, the PVP-I formulation was found to rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 isolates in vitro in short timeframes (15 seconds to 15 minutes) consistent with the minimum and maximum potential residence time in the nose. The Nasodine formula was found to be more effective than 0.5% PVP-I in saline. Importantly, it was found that the formulation inactivated culturable virus but had no effect on PCR-detectable viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS The PVP-I formulation eliminated the viability of SARS-CoV-2 virus with short exposure times consistent with nasal use. PCR alone may not be adequate for viral quantification in nasal PVP-I studies; future studies should incorporate cell culture to assess viral viability.

In this study, small diameter electrospun collagen tubular scaffold with random continuous smooth nanofibers was successfully fabricated. However, the dissolution of collagen in concentrated aqueous (conc. aq.) acetic acid caused to the serious denaturation of collagen. A novel method ammonia treatment here was adopted which recovered the collagen triple helix structure according to the analysis of IR spectra. Further dehydrothermal (DHT) and glutaraldehyde (GTA) treatments were applied to introduce the crosslinks to improve the properties of collagen tube. The nanofibrous structure of collagen tube in a wet state was preserved by the crosslinking treatments. Swelling ratio and weight loss decreased by at least two times compared to those of the untreated collagen tube. Moreover, tensile strength was significantly enhanced by DHT treatment (about 0.0076 cN/dTex) and by GTA treatment (about 0.075 cN/dTex). In addition, the surface of crosslinked collagen tube kept the hydrophilic property. These results suggest that DHT and GTA treatments can be utilized to improve the properties of electrospun collagen tube which could become a suitable candidate for tissue engineered scaffold.","output":"Fabrication and Properties of Electrospun Collagen Tubular Scaffold Crosslinked by Physical and Chemical Treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the utilization of telehealth capabilities by pediatric orthopaedic departments across the United States in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVES: To compare an ICU cohort of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a cohort of severe COVID-19 pertaining to co-infections, ICU-acquired infections and associated antimicrobial consumption. METHODS: We retrospectively compared a cohort of CAP patients with a cohort of COVID-19 patients matched according to organ failure, ICU length of stay (LOS) and ventilation days. Patient data such as demographics, infection focus, probability and severity, ICU severity scores and ICU and in-hospital mortality, days of antimicrobial therapy (DOT) and number of antimicrobial prescriptions, using an incremental scale, were registered and analysed. The total number of cultures (sputum, urinary, blood cultures) was collected and corrected for ICU LOS. FINDINGS: CAP patients (n = 148) were matched to COVID-19 patients (n = 74). Significantly less sputum cultures (68.2% versus 18.9%, P < 0.05) and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) (73.7% versus 36.5%, P < 0.05) were performed in COVID-19 patients. Six (8.1%) COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with a co-infection. Respectively, 58 of 148 (39.2%) CAP and 38 of 74 (51.4%) COVID-19 patients (P = 0.09) developed ICU-acquired infections. Antimicrobial distribution, both in the number of prescriptions and DOT, was similar in both cohorts.

We implemented an HCV testing and patient navigation program at an adult probation department. METHODS: Adults were tested at a local probation department with a rapid point-of-care HCV antibody (Ab) assay followed by a laboratory-based HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) assay if anti-HCV positive. All individuals received counseling rooted in harm reduction principles. Individuals testing positive for HCV Ab were immediately linked to a patient navigator in person or via telephone. The patient navigator assisted patients through cure unless the patient was lost to follow-up. Study participation involved an optional survey and optional point-of-care human immunodeficiency virus test. RESULTS: Of 417 individuals tested, 13% were HCV Ab positive and 65% of those tested for HCV RNA (34 of 52) had detectable HCV RNA. Of the 14 individuals who linked to an HCV treatment provider, 4 completed treatment, as measured by pharmacy fill documentation in the electronic medical record, and 1 obtained sustained virologic response. One hundred ninety-three individuals tested for HIV; none tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: The study cohort had a higher HCV seroprevalence than the general population (13% vs 2%), but linkage to care, completion of HCV treatment, and successful test-of-cure rates were all low. This study indicates that HCV disproportionately impacts adults on probation and prioritizing support for testing and linkage to care could improve health in this population.

In the last 10 years, many national and international guidelines on the treatment of pediatric CAP have been published, in order to optimize the prescription of antibiotics and limit their cost and side effects. However, the practical implementation of these guidelines is still limited. MAIN TEXT: We analyzed the current recommendations for the therapy of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that all converge on the identification of aminopenicillins and beta-lactams as the optimal treatment for CAP. We also conducted a review of the current literature on antibiotic regimens used for pediatric CAP to identify the current state of guidelines implementation in different settings. We selected 37 studies published from 2010 to 2016, including both retrospective and prospective studies, mainly cross-sectional and hospital based. The results show a global heterogeneity in the antibiotics prescription for pediatric CAP, with application of guidelines varying from 0% to more than 91% and with important differences even within the same country.

These agents aim to reduce skin colonization with Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. Increased colonization with S. aureus is correlated with increased AD severity. The antimicrobial effects of silver and chitosan have been demonstrated before. At this point, there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of antibacterial therapeutic clothing in patients with AD. METHODS: This is a pragmatic randomized controlled double-blind multi-center trial comparing the effectiveness of antibacterial therapeutic clothing based on silver or chitosan as compared with non-antibacterial therapeutic clothing in patients with moderate to severe AD. A total of 165 participants, aged 0 to 80, diagnosed with moderate to severe AD are included. The study is performed in the Erasmus MC University Medical Center, University Medical Center Groningen, University Medical Center Utrecht, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, and St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 into one of the three intervention groups: group A will receive therapeutic clothing without antimicrobial agents, group B will receive microbial growth reducing therapeutic clothing based on chitosan, and group C will receive antimicrobial clothing based on silver. All therapeutic clothing is to be worn at night during the 12-month intervention period. Usual care is continued. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of antibacterial clothing (silver and chitosan group) as compared to non-antibacterial clothing assessed with the Eczema Area and Severity Index at 12 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes include between-group differences in physician- and patient-reported outcome measures, topical therapy use, S. aureus skin colonization, and safety.

Adult patients (aged 18 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, with histologically confirmed pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, who had received previous first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and had radiological evidence of disease progression, were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive nivolumab at a flat dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 min intravenously or placebo until disease progression or a maximum of 12 months. The randomisation sequence was generated within an interactive web response system (Alea); patients were stratified according to epithelioid versus non-epithelioid histology and were assigned in random block sizes of 3 and 6. Participants and treating clinicians were masked to group allocation. The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival, analysed according to the treatment policy estimand (an equivalent of the intention-to-treat principle).

A monitoring system is therefore necessary to monitor the health of these bridges and to indicate whether they need maintenance. Different parameters affect the health of an infrastructure, but it would be very difficult to install a network of sensors of various kinds on each viaduct. For this purpose, we want to finalize the use of geomatics technologies to monitor infrastructures for early warning issues and introducing automations in the data acquisition and processing phases. This study describes an experimental sensor network system, based on long term monitoring in real-time while an adaptive neuro-fuzzy system is used to predict the deformations of GPS-bridge monitoring points. The proposed system integrates different data (used to describe the various behaviour scenarios on the structural model), and then it reworks them through machine learning techniques, in order to train the network so that, once only the monitored parameters (displacements) have been entered as input data, it can return an alert parameter. So, the purpose is to develop a real-time risk predictive system that can replicate various scenarios and capable to alert, in case of imminent hazards. The experimentation conducted in relation to the possibility of transmitting an alert parameter in real time (transmitted through the help of an experimental control unit) obtained by predicting the behavior of the structure using only displacement data during monitoring is particularly interesting.","output":"Road Infrastructure Monitoring: An Experimental Geomatic Integrated System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to traditional teaching and learning activities globally.

The aim of this study was to determine the evolution of lung abnormalities evaluated by quantitative CT techniques in patients with COVID-19 infection from initial diagnosis to recovery. This retrospective study included 16 patients with COVID-19 infection from 30 January 2020 through 11 March 2020. Repeat chest CT examinations were obtained for three or more scans per patient. We measured total volume and mean CT value of lung lesions in each patient per scan, and then calculated the mass, which equals to volume  (CT value + 1000). Dynamic evolution of chest CT imaging as a function of time was fitted by non-linear regression model in terms of mass, volume and CT value, respectively. According to the fitting curves, we redefined the evolution of lung abnormalities: progressive stage (0C5 days), infection emerged and rapidly aggravated; peak stage (5C15 days), the greatest severity at approximate 7C8 days after onset; and absorption stage (15C30 days), the lesions slowly and gradually resolved.","output":"Dynamic evolution of lung abnormalities evaluated by quantitative CT techniques in patients with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past 50 years, the number of publications on air pollution and lung disease has increased considerably, although the number of studies considering sex (a biologic factor), or gender (a social construct), has remained low and stagnant.

Sex-specific disaggregation of data has indicated that substantial C but frequently overlooked C differences exist between men and women, highlighting the importance of sex- and gender-stratified analyses to guide the deployment of safe and effective therapeutics options for males and females. In this chapter, we present an overview of the scientific evidence on differential effects of environmental exposures in men and women.

Through the Every Child Ready to Read initiative of the American Library Association, librarians emphasize educating caregivers and parents to work with their children on early literacy skills (Every Child Ready to Read, n.d.).This program identifies singing as one of five core practices in early childhood library literacy programming. Based on this priority on singing in early childhood library programming, there seems to be a valuing of music by library organizers. However, little is known about the musical background and preparation of librarians and library associates who lead storytimes. This instrumental case study of childrens librarians and library associates documented the use of music by participants in library storytime programming (n = 13) as well as their perceptions about music. The researchers employed qualitative data analysis procedures to arrive at four themes, which encompassed the participants positive perceptions of the role of music in childrens lives; participants passion for early literacy; their emphasis on family mentoring; and the diverse music backgrounds that led to diverse approaches of incorporating music into library programming. In our discussion we note the similarities between our population and early childhood generalist teachers who use music in their classrooms, suggesting potential application of prior research.

Objectives: To characterize arterial aging in RA. Patients and Methods: Coronary calcium score (CCS) were available from 112 RA patients; out of these patients, follow-up CCS were measured for 54 randomly selected individuals. Control CCS were obtained from the MESA database (includes 6,000 < participants); arterial age was calculated from CCS. Results: RA patients were significantly older (10.45  18.45 years, p < 0.001) in terms of the arterial age than the age-, gender-, and race-matched controls. The proportion of RA patients who had zero CCS was significantly less (p < 0.01) than that of those in the MESA reference group. Each disease year contributed an extra 0.395 years (p < 0.01) on the top of the normal aging process. However, the rate of the accelerated aging is not uniform, in the first years of the disease it is apparently faster. Smoking (p < 0.05), previous cardiovascular events (p < 0.05), and high blood pressure (p < 0.05) had additional significant effect on the aging process. In the follow-up study, inflammatory disease activity (CRP > 5 mg/L, p < 0.05) especially in smokers and shorter than 10 years of disease duration (p = 0.05) had the largest impact. Conclusion: Arterial aging is faster in RA patients than in control subjects, particularly in the first 10 years of the disease. Inflammation, previous cardiovascular events, and smoking are additional contributing factors to the intensified coronary atherosclerosis progression. These data support that optimal control of inflammation is essential to attenuate the cardiovascular risk in RA.","output":"Largely Accelerated Arterial Aging in Rheumatoid Arthritis Is Associated With Inflammatory Activity and Smoking in the Early Stage of the Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been over seven million cases and almost 413 372 deaths globally due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated disease COVID-19, as of 11 June 2020.

A practical issue at this time is when and how the lockdown interventions should be relaxed since, without an effective vaccine, the general public still remains vulnerable. However, patient should not be placed at an increased risk of dying of lung cancer just to avoid COVID-19. Attention must be paid to all types of cancers and people should not hesitate to go to the hospital to be treated in time.

Our objectives were to compare the characteristics of PLWD receiving HBPC and their hospital utilization and end-of-life care, with those of a matched comparison group, and to understand the experiences of family caregivers of PLWD receiving HBPC. METHODS This mixed-methods study used a retrospective observational cohort design with PLWD receiving HBPC (n = 287) from 2015 to 2020 and a strata-matched comparison group (n = 861), and qualitative phone interviews with 16 HBPC family caregivers in 2020. Inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score-adjusted models were used to compare time-to-first hospital-based utilization and, for decedents, home palliative and hospice care and place of death. Care experience was captured through caregiver interviews. RESULTS Patients receiving HBPC had a similar risk of hospital utilization [adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.89-1.26), p = 0.51] as a matched non-HBPC comparison group after a median follow-up of 199 days. However, HBPC decedents (n = 159) were more likely to receive home palliative care or hospice [rate ratio, RR: 1.23 (95% CI: 1.07-1.42), p < 0.01] and to die at home [RR: 1.66 (95% CI: 1.35-2.05), p < 0.001] than were non-HBPC decedents (n = 423). Caregivers reported that HBPC provided coordinated, continuous, and convenient care that was aligned with families' priorities and goals; however, some expressed unmet needs, especially for help paying for personal care and medical supplies/equipment, and a desire for clearer communication about program operations and more quality oversight for contract services. CONCLUSIONS Although HBPC for PLWD was associated with a similar risk of hospital utilization compared to a matched non-HBPC comparison group, HBPC resulted in more patient-centered end-of-life care for decedents.

While the benefit of territoriality is generally intuitive (improved access to resources), our understanding of its cost is less clear. This paper combines: 1. a review of hypotheses and meta-analytic benchmarking of costs across diverse taxa; and 2. a new empirical test of hypotheses using a longitudinal study of free-living male territorial lizards. The cost of territoriality was best described as a culmination of multiple factors, but especially costs resulting from the time required to maintain a territory (identified by the meta-analysis) or those exacerbated by a territory that is large in size (identified by the empirical test). The meta-analysis showed that physiological costs such as energetic expenditure or stress were largely negligible in impact on territory holders. Species that used territories to monopolise access to mates appeared to incur the greatest costs, whereas those defending food resources experienced the least. The single largest gap in our current understanding revealed by the literature review is the potential cost associated with increased predation. There is also a clear need for multiple costs to be evaluated concurrently in a single species. The empirical component of this study showcases a powerful analytical framework for evaluating a range of hypotheses using correlational data obtained in the field. More broadly, this paper highlights key factors that should be considered in any investigation that attempts to account for the evolutionary origin or ecological variation in territorial behaviour within and between species.","output":"Costs of territoriality: a review of hypotheses, meta-analysis, and field study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High inflation rates, deep recessions, currency devaluations and historically low interest rates: all have been frequent phenomena in Latin America and Chile and could reappear permanently if monetary and fiscal policies are not properly managed.

At present, novel coronavirus pneumonia is widely spread around the world, with the characteristics of long incubation time, strong contagion, rapid progress, and high fatality rate. Inflammatory storm, also known as cytokine storm, has been found to play an important role in COVID-19 induced lung injury, and is believed to be one of the core pathological factors leading to exacerbation and even death of novel coronavirus pneumonia patients. It is found that over-expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 will lead to self-attack and aggressive inflammatory response, and finally cause tissue damage. Studies have shown that the intervention of inflammatory injury may be one of the important mechanisms that contribute to therapeutic effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine against COVID-19. Clinical studies found that early intervention with Traditional Chinese Medicine in novel coronavirus pneumonia patients could significantly alleviate signs and symptoms, shorten course of the disease, decrease possibility of the patients progressing into severe stage, slow or even block the outbreak of inflammatory storm in the patient's body, improve cure rate, reduce mortality, relieve sequelae, and promote the recovery of the patients in the recovery period. Through analyzing the representative prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Eighth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for COVID-19, we found the regulation on the inflammatory injury by Traditional Chinese Medicine is realized in a multitarget manner. On the one hand, some Chinese Medicines are exhibited with direct effects against proliferation of the virus;on the other hand, some Chinese Medicines are shown with ability to re-balance the immune system via regulating function of immune cells, decreasing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators. The epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia has not yet ended, and the world is still under the attack of COVID-19 virus. Although previous studies have found that certain ingredients in Traditional Chinese Medicine, such as astragalin, astragaloside IV, platycodin and wogonin, etc., as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine prescription including Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Huashibaidu Decoction, etc., can control inflammatory injury, their specific mechanism and the material basis still need to be studied in depth. On the other hand, the objective indicator of Traditional Chinese Medicine for patients with different syndromes still needs to be further clarified to facilitate its promotion in clinic. The integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and western medicine has been proved to be more effective in inhibiting the development of novel coronavirus pneumonia, but the role of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the integrative therapy still needs to be further explored.

METHODS: We analyzed the characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits, urgent hospitalizations and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and COVID-19 patients across 3 response phases: before the first Italian case, before national lockdown and during lockdown. RESULTS: ED visits decreased from a daily mean of 239.1 before the first COVID-19 Italian case, to 79.6 during lockdown; urgent hospitalizations decreased from 30.6 to 21.2. As of April 20, 2020, 1970 persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 2.6% were positive. Positive rates were 1.2% in the ED, 21.1% in the COVID center and 0.5% in other wards.

There were 20.73 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10 000 population in Lesotho, and this could potentially increase to a density of 31.49 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10 000 population by 2030 compared with a need of 46.72 per 10 000 population by 2030 based on projected health service needs using disease burden and evolving population size and demographics. The existing stock of health workers covered only 47% of the needs and could improve to 55% in 2030. The financial space for the HWF employment was roughly US$40.94 million in 2020, increasing to about US$66.69 million by 2030. In comparison, the cost of employing all health workers already in the supply pipeline (in addition to the currently employed ones) was estimated to be US$61.48 million but could reach US$104.24 million by 2030. Thus, a 33% gap is apparent between the financial space and what is required to guarantee employment for all health workers in the supply pipeline. CONCLUSION Lesotho's HWF stock falls short of its population health need by 53%. The unemployment of some cadres is, however, apparent. Addressing the need requires increasing the HWF budget by at least 12.3% annually up to 2030 or prioritising at least 33% of its recurrent health expenditure to the HWF.","output":"Health workforce supply, needs and financial feasibility in Lesotho: a labour market analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People working in urban areas often experience various work-related stressors, such as long working hours, high work pressure, and work-life interference, which can lead to severe mental and physical consequences. Identification of the protective factors that enable employees to flourish and thrive is especially important. The present study aims to identify the organizational and personal resources that contribute to employee flourishing. Adopting the conservation of resources theory and organizational support theory, it was hypothesized that perceived organizational support (POS) would promote employee flourishing through increasing psychological capital (PsyCap). A prospective study was conducted on a sample of 400 working adults from the social and personal services industry in Hong Kong. Data were collected at baseline, three months, and one year. Both Dieners composite model of flourishing and Seligmans PERMA model of flourishing were tested. Structural equation modeling showed that PsyCap at three months significantly mediated the effects of POS at baseline on flourishing and all dimensions of PERMA (positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, accomplishments) at one year. Findings suggest that PsyCap underlies the process through which POS influences flourishing, whereby the promotion of positive psychological resources in a nurturing and supportive organization contributes to psychosocial functioning in the long run.","output":"Flourishing in the Workplace: A One-Year Prospective Study on the Effects of Perceived Organizational Support and Psychological Capital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to COVID-19, more people are participating in outdoor activities like hiking This study investigated the relationship between weather and hiking accidents at Bukhansan Mountain National Park, a Guinness World Record holder for the most visited national park per unit area Data analyzed included the number of hikers, accident type, and weather information Data were collected from the last three years The results showed the highest number of people took up hiking in 2020 (3,394,413) Accidents were classified into six types: fall, personal disease, distress, attempted suicide, loss of footing (carelessness), and natural disasters Lost footing caused the largest number of accidents (N=274 cases) For weather-related factors, accidents were more common when the temperature was between 16C28 ?, a humidity of 60C65%, and winds of 6C8 km/h, which are actually considered the ideal conditions for hiking Therefore, public campaigns or educational information should communicate that ideal weather conditions are actually the most dangerous and risky for hiking accidents Additionally, the management team and government should inform hikers through signs, course guides, and electronic displays installed in the park Moreover, hikers should be cautious when hiking and be more aware of their surroundings and environment","output":"The Relationship between Weather Conditions and Hiking Safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of lower respiratory infections was documented in Wuhan caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Increased levels of circulating neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of neuro-axonal injury, have been observed in patients with severe COVID-19. We investigated whether NfL provides non-redundant clinical value to previously identified predictors of COVID-19 mortality. We measured serum or plasma NfL concentrations in a blinded fashion in 3 cohorts totaling 338 COVID-19 patients. In cohort 1, we found significantly elevated NfL levels only in critically ill COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Longitudinal cohort 2 data showed that NfL is elevated late in the course of the disease, following two other prognostic markers of COVID-19: decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Significant correlations between LDH and ALC abnormalities and subsequent rise of NfL implicate multi-organ failure as a likely cause of neuronal injury at the later stages of COVID-19. Addition of NfL to age and gender in cohort 1 significantly improved the accuracy of mortality prediction and these improvements were validated in cohorts 2 and 3. In conclusion, although substantial increase in serum/plasma NfL reproducibly enhances COVID-19 mortality prediction, NfL has clinically meaningful prognostic value only close to death, which may be too late to alter medical management. When combined with other prognostic biomarkers, rising longitudinal NfL measurements triggered by LDH and ALC abnormalities would identify patients at risk of COVID-19 associated mortality who might still benefit from escalated care.","output":"Prognostic Value of Serum/Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain for COVID-19 Associated Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since SARS-CoV2 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, those tasked with the stewardship of public health at a global, regional, and local levelpolicymakers, politicians, scientists, drug regulators, health officials, professional associations, journal editors, publishers, and clinicianshave displayed rushed decisions and lapses in judgment in their handling of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as potential COVID-19 therapeutics and prophylactics.

It concludes that despite the gradual acceptance of the group phenomenon, a group solution has not been formed as a coherent and well-defined legal principle. Instead, it represents a variety of approaches, tools and practices, which pursue different policy objectives underpinned by different societal values. Among them are asset value maximization, business rescue, the protection of financial stability and the preservation of banks critical functions. With all its flexibility, a group solution has one pervasive limitationit cannot trump the interests of individual group members and their creditors.

Wearing protective equipment like mask and gloves, washing hands via soap, frequent use of antiseptic solution and maintaining social distance are being applied globally to reduce the transmission rate. Therefore, this study was intended to investigate water, sanitation and hygienic (WASH) behaviour, protective equipment use and their disposal practices among Bangladeshi residents amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the study aims, data were collected mainly via an online survey and analysed through a set of statistical tools including T test, one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA). This study found that almost 89.80% of the respondents reported to know about the COVID-19 and its preventive measures. WASH status of the respondents is found quite good, where 94.60% stated to have available potable water, 99% have improved toilet facilities, 95% wash their hands via soap, and 79.80% clean their house and toilets by antiseptic solutions properly. Moreover, nearly 94.50% and 54.80% people reported to use face mask and hand gloves, respectively, but the disposal practice of these protective equipment is inappropriate. More than 50% of people reported disposing of their used mask, gloves and tissue with other household wastes, which is alarming for public health and environmental perspective. Moreover, the WASH and waste disposal practices of the marginal people were found very poor and not at a satisfactory level. The results of statistical analysis focused on WASH and waste disposal practices as well as the factors which influence these practices. It is found that gender, occupation, area of residence, and level of education of the participants mainly influence the WASH and waste disposal practices. It is expected that this study exposed the necessity to introduce proper infectious waste management policy and also the increase in awareness level among mass people regarding the preventive measures of COVID-19 infection to combat against disease transmission and environmental pollution.

Although there are reliable measurement scales to assess chronic dispositional levels of pathogen avoidance, no measurement scale currently exists to directly assess moment-to-moment fluctuations in pathogen avoidance. This paper presents the Situational Pathogen Avoidance (SPA) scale, which assesses situational variability in pathogen avoidance, especially as it pertains to avoidance of social stimuli. Across six studies, we demonstrate the reliability and validity of the SPA scale, show that the scale is influenced by situational activation of pathogen avoidance motives, and demonstrate that it mediates the association between pathogen avoidance motives (both chronic and situational) and social biases against obese and foreign targets. The SPA scale provides a valuable measurement tool for researchers who study pathogen avoidance and to those who study social biases more generally.

METHODS: In a multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we compared the presenting clinical features, pathogens present, and outcomes of patients with pneumonia visualized on a CT scan but not on a concurrent chest radiograph (CT-only pneumonia) and those with pneumonia visualized on a chest radiograph. All patients underwent chest radiography; the decision to obtain CT imaging was determined by the treating clinicians. Chest radiographs and CT images were interpreted by study-dedicated thoracic radiologists blinded to the clinical data. RESULTS: The study population included 2,251 adults with CAP; 2,185 patients (97%) had pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, whereas 66 patients (3%) had pneumonia visualized on CT scan but not on concurrent chest radiography. Overall, these patients with CT-only pneumonia had a clinical profile similar to those with pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, including comorbidities, vital signs, hospital length of stay, prevalence of viral (30% vs 26%) and bacterial (12% vs 14%) pathogens, ICU admission (23% vs 21%), use of mechanical ventilation (6% vs 5%), septic shock (5% vs 4%), and inhospital mortality (0 vs 2%). CONCLUSIONS: Adults hospitalized with CAP who had radiological evidence of pneumonia on CT scan but not on concurrent chest radiograph had pathogens, disease severity, and outcomes similar to patients who had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography.

Changes required of providers were substantial and could lead to increased burnout and, subsequently, increased turnover intentions. This study examined burnout experienced by mental health services providers in the context of COVID-19 and through the lens of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model. We examined the effects of work changes on burnout and subsequent turnover intentions, and how job and personal resources may have buffered the extent to which work changes due to COVID-19 impacted burnout. Methods: Service providers (n = 93) from six community mental health centers (CMHCs) in one Midwestern state in the United States completed surveys as part of service contracts to implement evidence-based practices. Path analysis tested the unconditional indirect relations between work changes and turnover intentions through burnout. Moderated mediation determined whether the indirect effect of work changes on turnover intentions via burnout varied in strength by job and personal resources. Results: Work changes had a significant indirect effect on turnover intentions through burnout (  ^ = .140, 95% CI = .072, .217). This indirect effect varied as a function of two job resources, organizational trust and perceived organizational support. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Burnout was relatively low only when work changes were low and job resources levels high. When work changes were high, burnout was similarly high across levels of job resources. To minimize burnout, organizations should limit task, setting, and team-related work changes to the extent possible.

This regulation is basically governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) through their interactions with cis-elements located in the UTRs of their mRNA targets. LYT1 gene, coding for a virulence factor of T. cruzi, is expressed into two isoforms: kLYT1 and mLYT1, which play different functions according to their cellular location and parasite life-cycle stages. Whereas kLYT1 exhibits a regulatory role during the epimastigote-to-metacyclic trypomastigote stage transition, mLYT1 acts as a pore-forming protein, relevant for host cell invasion and parasite intracellular survival. Considering the LYT1 biological relevance and the fact that this is a protein exclusive of T. cruzi, the protein and its mechanisms regulating the alternative gene expression products are promising targets for therapeutic intervention. In this work, an experimental approach consisting of pull-downs assays followed by proteomic analyzes was carried out to identify the proteins interacting with the different LYT1 mRNAs. The dataset presented here was obtained through three biological replicates using all the different UTRs characterized in the LYT1 mRNAs (i.e., 5UTR kLYT1, 5UTR mLYT1, and I and II-type 3UTRs) as baits, and protein extracts from epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of the 058 PUJ (DTU I) strain. Bound proteins were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS). As a control of non-specificity, the same protein extracts were incubated with Leishmania braziliensis rRNA and the bound proteins also identified by LC/MS. In all, 1,557 proteins were identified, 313 of them were found in at least two replicates and 18 proteins were exclusively associated with the LYT1 baits. Of these, six proteins have motifs related to RNA binding, and seven remain annotated as hypothetical proteins. Remarkably, three of these hypothetical proteins also contain nucleic acid binding motifs. This knowledge, beside expanding the known T. cruzi proteome, gains insight into putative regulatory proteins responsible for alternative LYT1 mRNAs processing.

Due to the high urgency of these discovery efforts, off-target binding, which is one of the major reasons for drug-induced toxicity and safety-related drug attrition, was neglected. Here, we used molecular docking, toxicity profiling, and multiple molecular dynamics (MD) protocols to assess the selectivity of 33 reported non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro against eight proteases and 16 anti-targets. The panel of proteases included SARS-CoV Mpro, cathepsin G, caspase-3, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), thrombin, factor Xa, chymase, and prostasin. Several of the assessed compounds presented considerable off-target binding towards the panel of proteases, as well as the selected anti-targets. Our results further suggest a high risk of off-target binding to chymase and cathepsin G.

More recently, cases have been documented in free-ranging populations of both species in bovine tuberculosis (bTB) endemic areas of South Africa. There is limited information on risk factors and transmission patterns for MTBC infections in African rhinoceros, however, extrapolation from literature on MTBC infections in other species and multi-host systems provides a foundation for understanding TB epidemiology in rhinoceros species. Current diagnostic tests include blood-based immunoassays but distinguishing between subclinical and active infections remains challenging due to the lack of diagnostic techniques. In other species, demographic risk factors for MTBC infection include sex and age, where males and adults are generally at higher risk than females and younger individuals. Limited available historical information reflects similar age- and sex-associated patterns for TB in captive black and white rhinoceros, with more reports of MTBC-associated disease in black rhinoceros than in white rhinoceros. The degree of MTBC exposure in susceptible wildlife depends on their level of interaction, either directly with other infected individuals or indirectly through MTBC contaminated environments, which is dependent on the presence and abundance of infected reservoir hosts and the amount of MTBC shed in their excreta. Captive African rhinoceros have shown evidence of MTBC shedding, and although infection levels are low in free-ranging rhinoceros, there is a risk for intraspecies transmission. Free-ranging rhinoceros in bTB endemic areas may be exposed to MTBC from other infected host species, such as the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), through shared environmental niches, and resource co-utilization.

We retrospectively included adult symptomatic COVID-19 admissions between 3/2020 and 4/2021. The primary outcome was early use of antibiotics for pneumonia (started within 48 hours of admission);mean monthly days of therapy per 1,000 patient days (DOT) were compared pre- (3/2020-6/2020) and post-intervention (7/2020-4/2021). Secondary outcomes were early use of antibiotics for any indication, estimated days of antibiotics avoided (comparing pre- and post-intervention DOT), and in-hospital mortality. Analyses were conducted using a two-tailed unpaired t-test (antibiotic use) or Fishers exact test (mortality). Results Of the 1,976 patients included (124 pre- vs. 1852 post-intervention), 55.4% were male and 85.5% were white. Patients in the pre-intervention group were more likely to require hospital transfer [21.8% vs 8.8% (p< 0.001)] and ICU admission [18.5% vs. 9.7% (p=0.003)]. We observed a significant decrease in mean use of early antibiotics for pneumonia [656.9 vs. 240.1 DOT (p< 0.001)], including among non-ICU patients only [603.6 vs 240.2 DOT (p< 0.001)]. Early antibiotic use for any indication also decreased [686.2 vs. 359.3 DOT (p< 0.001)]. An estimated 3,697 days of unnecessary antibiotics for pneumonia were avoided in the 10-months post-intervention [370 days per month (95% CI 304 C 435)].

This decrease was observed in nearly all cancer types, including cancers such as lung cancer (average 23%), head-neck cancer (average 36%) and hematology (average 26%), for which a missed or delayed diagnosis can be life threatening. Therefore, we want more attention for the observed underdiagnosis and the role of the primary care givers, including the general practitioner and dentist. Furthermore, it is of crucial importance that patients with symptoms or complaints feel no hesitation to visit their caregivers.","output":"[Fewer cancer diagnoses during the COVID-19 epidemic according to diagnosis, age and region]./ Onderdiagnostiek bij kanker door de COVID-19-crisis naar diagnose, leeftijd en provincie: Een cruciale rol voor eerstelijnszorgverleners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Il lavaggio broncoalveolare o BAL, permettendo di ottenere le cellule ed i soluti presenti sulla superficie epiteliale del tratto respiratorio distale, si  dimostrato una metodica di ricerca essenziale per lo studio dei meccanismi eziopatogenetici delle malattie del polmone profondo, come ad esempio lo studio delle interstiziopatie, su cui esiste una vastissima letteratura di dati ottenuti con il BAL.

These concerns are not new. The emergence of an epidemic form of cholera in what European medics described as the fetid jungles of Bengal in 1817 and the five pandemics that swept across the world inspired similar fears. With cholera's arrival in England in 1831, it took shape in the British cultural imagination as an Indian entity that threatened Britain not just with death, but with degeneration. As medics were unable to identify its cause, cholera was depicted both through its effects on the body and as an embodied figure. Medical and satiric illustrations attempted to make visible the invisible illness. In pictures of the cholera patient, the disease was framed not by its most visceral and racial effects, but by its most visible symptom: the body turned blue. It then became an embodied agent: first as an orientalized scarecrow supposedly used by doctors to frighten the populace and then as a malevolent spectre spreading death. Visually, cholera was characterized by the colour blue, which recalled another apparent product of India, indigo, and served to colonize medical knowledge through an acceptance of certain characteristics over others. Yet, circulated through print, these images depicted the horrors of the disease to the public, visually demonstrating how cholera could corrupt the English body and the heart of the British Empire.","output":"The 'Scourge of Modern Times': Cholera, Race, and Empire in Early Nineteenth-Century British Illustrated Print Culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory rate (RR) is routinely used to monitor patients with infectious, cardiac and respiratory diseases and is a component of early warning scores used to predict patient deterioration. However, it is often measured visually with considerable bias and inaccuracy. OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to compare distribution and accuracy of electronically measured RR (EMRR) and visually measured RR (VMRR). Secondly, to determine whether, and how far in advance, continuous electronic RR monitoring can predict oncoming hypoxic and pyrexic episodes in infectious respiratory disease. APPROACH: A retrospective cohort study analysing the difference between EMRR and VMRR was conducted using patient data from a large tertiary hospital. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether continuous, EMRR measurements could predict oncoming hypoxic (SpO2 <92%) and pyrexic (temperature >38 C) episodes. MAIN RESULTS: Data were gathered from 34 COVID-19 patients, from which a total of 3445 observations of VMRR (independent of Hawthorne effect), peripheral oxygen saturation and temperature and 729117 observations of EMRR were collected. VMRR had peaks in distribution at 18 and 20 breaths per minute. 70.9% of patients would have had a change of treatment during their admission based on the UK's National Early Warning System if EMRR was used in place of VMRR. An elevated EMRR was predictive of hypoxic (hazard ratio: 1.8 (1.05 to 3.07)) and pyrexic (hazard ratio: 9.7 (3.8 to 25)) episodes over the following 12 hours. SIGNIFICANCE: Continuous EMRR values are systematically different VMRR values, and results suggest it is a better indicator of true RR as it has lower kurtosis, has higher variance, a lack of peaks at expected values (18 and 20) and it measures a physiological component of breathing directly (abdominal movement). Results suggest EMRR is a strong marker of oncoming hypoxia and is highly predictive of oncoming pyrexic events in the following 12 hours. In many diseases, this could provide an early window to escalate care prior to deterioration, potentially preventing morbidity and mortality.","output":"The effectiveness of continuous respiratory rate monitoring in predicting hypoxic and pyrexic events: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"JUSTIFICATION: During the current rapidly evolving pandemic of COVID-19 infection, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their newborn infants form a special vulnerable group that needs immediate attention. Unlike other elective medical and surgical problems for which care can be deferred during the pandemic, pregnancies and childbirths continue. Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the mother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. PROCESS: The GRADE approach recommended by the World Health Organization was used to develop the guideline. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted. The GDG drafted a list of questions which are likely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care. An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize. Literature search was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed. For the practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles. The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations. OBJECTIVES: To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. RECOMMENDATIONS: A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: 1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) neonatal

transplantation (HSCT), the only potentially curative option for many haematological and non-haematological conditions. Work-up requires regular communication between WTAIL and the transplanting clinicians, facilitated by weekly multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings, to agree decisions and proceed through each work-up stage. Effective communication and minimising error are critical, as transplanting cells from a suboptimal donor could have severe or fatal consequences for the patient. We reviewed our HSCT patient management and identified issues including staff dissatisfaction with the inefficiency of the current (paper-based) system and concern about the potential for incidents caused by errors in manual transcription of patient information and tracking clinical decisions. Another driver for change was the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevented the usual face-to-face MDT meetings in which staff would show clinicians the paper records and reports; the shift to online MDT required new ways of sharing data. In this project we developed a new central reference point for our patient management data along with electronic patient summary sheets, designed with an eye to improving safety and efficiency. Over several improvement cycles we tested and refined the summary sheets with staff and clinicians and experimented with videoconferencing to facilitate data sharing. We conducted interviews with staff from which we concluded that the new process successfully reduced transcription and duplication and improved communication with the clinicians during the pandemic. Despite an increase in workload due to build-up of active patient work-up cases during the pandemic, staff reported that the new summaries enabled them to cope well. A key initiative was creation of a Task and Finish group that helped establish continual improvement culture and identified additional areas for improvement which have been followed up in further improvement projects.","output":"Summarised, verified and accessible: improving clinical information management for potential haematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific evidence concerning the subacute and long-term effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is on the rise.

We report three studies, all examining the impact of altering the availability of meat-free meals on meal selection. METHODS: Study 1 (a natural experiment in one university cafeteria) examined the impact of altering the ratio of meat-free meals (one meat-free and two meat, to two meat-free and one meat) on weekly sales of meals containing meat. Study 2 (a natural experiment in 18 worksite cafeterias) examined the impact on meat-free meal sales of a menu change designed to increase the availability of meat-free meals. Study 3 (an online study of 2205 UK-representative adults) compared meal selections when participants were randomised to ranges comprised of (a) one meat-free, three meat options; (b) two meat-free, two meat; or (c) three meat-free, one meat. RESULTS: Study 1 suggested a significant decrease in the proportion of sales of meat options when the availability of meat-free options increased (? 19.9 percentage points; 95%CIs:-25.2,-14.6), with no evidence of changes to meat-based meal sales in other university cafeterias during the same period. Findings from Study 2 were mixed: multilevel regressions found no evidence of an increase in meat-free meals following the menu change (2.3 percentage points; 95%CIs: ? 1.3,5.9), while interrupted time-series analyses suggested sales did increase (2.3; 95%CIs: 0.4,4.2), but implementation of the planned change was limited. In Study 3 reducing meat-free options from 50 to 25% reduced participants selection of meat-free options (odds ratio 0.35; 95%CIs: 0.26,0.46), while increasing meat-free options from 50 to 75% increased meat-free selections (odds ratio 2.43; 95%CIs: 1.94,3.04). There was no evidence effects were moderated by gender, socioeconomic status or usual meat consumption. CONCLUSION: Increasing the availability of meat-free options is effective at reducing meat selection and purchasing for different ratios of meat to meat-free options. The magnitude of the effect is uncertain, but with no evidence of differences in response by demographic groups when directly tested.

However, to date few studies have evaluated the hospital bed shortage for COVID-19 during the lockdown and none for non-COVID-19 patients, although such data are important for better preparedness of the future outbreak. Methods We built a compartmental model to estimate the daily numbers of hospital bed shortage for patients with mild, severe and critical COVID-19, taking account of underreport and diagnosis delay. Results The maximal daily shortage of inpatient beds for mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients was 43,960 (95% confidence interval: 35,246, 52,929), 2,779 (1,395, 4,163) and 196 (143, 250) beds in early February 2020. An earlier or later lockdown would have greatly increased the shortage of hospital beds in Wuhan. The overwhelmed healthcare system might have delayed the provision of health care to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during the lockdown. The second wave in Wuhan could have occurred in June 2020 if social distancing measures had waned in early March 2020. The hospital bed shortage was estimated much smaller in the potential second wave than in the first one.

The influence of the impaired GALT on the postoperative complication rate after surgery for penetrating abdominal trauma has not been investigated and the hypothesis that the HIV-induced changes of the GALT contribute to septic complications postoperatively was tested. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study included patients who required a small bowel resection due to abdominal gunshot wounds. A bowel specimen was obtained in the index operation, and the T-lymphocytic quantity in the specimen was analyzed via immunohistochemistry to scrutinize whether these lymphocyte numbers had an impact on the postoperative outcome. Septic and postoperative complications were documented during the in-hospital course and the first month after discharge. RESULTS: In total, 62 patients were included in the study of which 38 patients were HIV-seronegative and 24 were HIV-seropositive. HIV-seropositive patients had a significantly lower quantity of CD4 + T cells in the GALT compared to the HIV-seronegative patients (p = 0.0001), which was also associated with a significantly higher rate of septic complications in the postoperative course. In the HIV-seropositive group, no significant differences were detected for T-lymphocytic quantity in the GALT between the HIV-treatment na?ve and antiretroviral treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The compromised GALT in HIV-seropositive patients may predispose these patients to postoperative septic complications.

Plant workers in May 2020 were struggling to adapt to exposure risk and illness in the workforce. Furthermore, pressures of an unfamiliar marketplace strained the supply and demand linkages in poultry processing. By utilizing strategies to meaningfully slow the supply of chicken at the processing plant, farm and hatchery, supply was slowed without stopping. This ensured security in the food supply, but jeopardized farmers raising these livestock. After weeks of processing adjustments, some chicken farms were depopulated as a last resort to protect their welfare. The remains of the depopulated flocks presented a risk to public health from environmental externalities. Across the Delmarva peninsula, carcasses were composted in the housing in which they were raised along with feed, bedding and manure, and high-carbon material, and were carefully monitored to reduce environmental impacts. Compost is recycled into a resource and can be utilized safely on farms for soil conditioning, like organic fertilizer, rather than presenting an environmental disaster.

Remote work or school may increase time available for sleep, with benefits for immune function and mental health, particularly in those individuals who obtain less sleep than age-adjusted recommendations. Young adults are thought to regularly carry significant sleep debt related in part to misalignment between endogenous circadian clock time and social time. We examined the impact of social-distancing measures on sleep in young adults by comparing sleep self-studies submitted by students enrolled in a university course during the 2020 summer session (entirely remote instruction, N = 80) with self-studies submitted by students enrolled in the same course during previous summer semesters (on-campus instruction, N = 452; cross-sectional study design). Self-studies included 2-8 week sleep diaries, two chronotype questionnaires, written reports, and sleep tracker (Fitbit) data from a subsample. Students in the 2020 remote instruction semester slept later, less efficiently, less at night and more in the day, but did not sleep more overall despite online, asynchronous classes and ~44% fewer work days compared to students in previous summers. Subjectively, the net impact on sleep was judged as positive or negative in equal numbers of students, with students identifying as evening types significantly more likely to report a positive impact, and morning types a negative impact.

One factor that may contribute to more rapid viral growth in the upper airways is the exponential increase in SARS-CoV-2 stability that occurs with reductions in temperature, as measured in vitro. Because SARS-CoV-2 frequently initiates infection in the upper airways before spreading through the body, increased upper airway viral growth early in the disease course may result in more rapid progression of disease and potentially contribute to more severe outcomes. Similarly, higher SARS-CoV-2 viral titer in the upper airways likely supports more efficient transmission. Conversely, the possible significance of air temperature to upper airway viral growth suggests that prolonged delivery of heated air might represent a preventative measure and prophylactic treatment for coronavirus disease 2019.","output":"Possible effects of air temperature on COVID-19 disease severity and transmission rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to award a local database for detection of human coronavirus (HCoV) species in patients with respiratory tract infections like influenza type A and a tuberculosis using Taqman reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (rRT-PCR) technique A total of 389 respiratory samples was collected from individuals suffering from upper and/or lower respiratory tract diseases for testing of HCoV species (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1 and MERS) RNA extracted and amplification with specific primers and probes Result showed 35 (9%) positive sample and the probe assay associated with cycle number (Ct) was 33 980 97 It is interesting to note, the results pointed out 12/35 (34 29%) coCinfected with the most frequently Flu A and the relative risk value represented 21 5 (95% Cl 4 9-93 9) of cohort influenza type A positive case Moreover, the co-infection with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was 5/35 (14 29%) of HCoVs cases and the relative risk value 1 53 (95% Cl 0 683 45) of cohort TB positive cases The percentage of a positive cases have a single HCoV species higher than multiple HCoV species with 31/35 (88 57%) and 4/35 (11 43%), respectively, and each viral species reported higher percentage as a single species than multiple Also, the frequency of HCoV-229E and NL63 species consisted highest percentage 75% of four HCoV species with significant presence among Iraqi studying populations Furthermore, the percentage of influenza virus A cases with HCoV infections were 7/12=58 33% with species 229E, while 60% of HCoV with TB infection appeared in NL63 In conclusion, the rRT-PCR based on Taqman observed the rapid and efficient detection of CoVs species with few copies number This allows to be used for the diagnosis of CoVs along with other respiratory viruses in a multiplex assay to reduce processing time Subsequent applied multiplex RT-PCR along with influenza and TB infections","output":"Human coronavirus species and their correlation as co-infection detected by fast real-time RT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Political action and electoral behavior often stem from a conviction that an issue is important. Yet despite a growing literature on partisan bias, it remains unclear whether partisan attachment also affects the perceived importance of various issues. We propose a theory of partisan-motivated issue attention (PMIA), wherein citizens satisfy partisan instincts by shifting the perceived importance of an issue. We apply our theory to an issue involving a fundamental tool of the federal governmentthe power to deficit-spendand test the hypothesis that partisans concern about government overspending significantly changes depending on which party presides over deficit-spending. Leveraging pre-registered experimental and observational studies, we find strong support for this hypothesis among both Republicans and Democrats. Lastly, using text analytical methods, we also find evidence of PMIA in televised partisan media. Our study thus demonstrates that putative concern about deficit-spending contains a sizable partisan component and, more broadly, uncovers an additional means by which partisan bias guides citizens attitude formation on policy-relevant issues in the United States.

Since the exact number of infected cases is unknown, the number of documented cases was used by many disease transmission models to infer epidemiological parameters. This means that it was possible to produce biased estimates of epidemiological parameters and hence of the effects of intervention measures, because the percentage of all cases that were documented changed during the first 2 months of the epidemic, as a consequence of a gradually improving diagnostic capability. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, accounting for intervention measures and temporal changes in the proportion of new documented infections out of total new infections, to characterize the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan across different stages of the outbreak. Pre-symptomatic transmission was taken into account in our model, and all epidemiological parameters were estimated using the Particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. RESULTS: Our model captured the local Wuhan epidemic pattern as two-peak transmission dynamics, with one peak on February 4 and the other on February 12, 2020. The impact of intervention measures determined the timing of the first peak, leading to an 86% drop in the Re from 3.23 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.20) to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.69). The improved diagnostic capability led to the second peak and a higher proportion of documented infections. Our estimated proportion of new documented infections out of the total new infections increased from 11% (95% CI 1-43%) to 28% (95% CI 4-62%) after January 26 when more detection kits were released. After the introduction of a new diagnostic criterion (case definition) on February 12, a higher proportion of daily infected cases were documented (49% (95% CI 7-79%)).

Research suggests ACP discussions among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) are infrequent overall and may differ by gender and/or race. BACKGROUND: Previous literature has displayed that African Americans are less likely than other racial groups to use advanced care planning, palliative care or hospice, but does not conclusively account for ACP among PLHIV. African American PLHIV rely on informal care that may be differ by gender and represents an important pathway to increase ACP. DESIGN: The study was mixed methods and observational. METHODS: Participants completed self-report surveys (N = 311) and were interviewed (n = 11). Poisson regression (quantitative) and grounded theory analyses (qualitative) were implemented, using COREQ checklist principles to ensure study rigor. RESULTS: Less than half had discussed ACP (41.2%; N = 267). More ACP knowledge predicted 76% lower likelihood of ACP discussions among women. Men who spent more time caregiving in a given week were nearly 3 times more likely to discuss ACP than men who spent less time caregiving. Women were more likely than men to be caregivers and were also expected to serve in that role more than men, which was qualitatively described as 'being a woman'. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is one of few studies exploring ACP among caregivers in African American populations hardest hit by HIV. Results suggest that ACP skill building and education are critical for African Americans living with HIV to promote ACP discussions with their caregivers. Knowledge about ACP topics was low overall even when healthcare had recently been accessed. Support reciprocity and gender-specific communication skill building may facilitate ACP in African American HIV informal caregiving relationships. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Results underscore the need for ACP education which includes healthcare providers and caregivers, given African Americans' preference for life-sustaining treatments at end-of-life. ACP is crucial now more than ever, as COVID-19 complicates care for older adults with HIV at high risk of complications.","output":"'The Woman Gives': Exploring gender and relationship factors in HIV advance care planning among African American caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We detected a novel feline stool-associated circular DNA virus (FeSCV) in fecal samples from cats with diarrhea using consensus primers matching those of circovirus and cyclovirus.

In Korea, as in other countries, the number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 have been rising. This study aimed to calculate the burden of disease due to COVID-19 in Korea. METHODS: We used data on confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 between January 20 and April 24, 2020 provided by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the local governments and the public media to determine disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by sex and age. Morbidity was estimated directly among the confirmed, cured, and fatal cases. Disability weights were adopted from previous similar causes on the severity of COVID-19 for the years of life lived with disability (YLDs). The years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated using the standard life expectancy from the 2018 life tables for each sex and age. RESULTS: The YLDs were higher in females (155.2) than in males (105.1), but the YLLs were higher in males (1,274.3) than in females (996.4). The total disease burden attributable to COVID-19 in Korea during the study period, was estimated to be 2,531.0 DALYs, and 4.930 DALYs per 100,000 population. The YLDs and the YLLs constituted 10.3% and 89.7% of the total DALYs, respectively. The DALYs per 100,000 population were highest in people aged  80 years, followed by those aged 70C79, 60C69, and 50C59 years, but the incidence was the highest in individuals aged 20C29 years. CONCLUSION: This study provided the estimates of DALYs due to COVID-19 in Korea. Most of the disease burden from COVID-19 was derived from YLL; this indicates that decision-makers should focus and make an effort on reducing fatality for preparing the second wave of COVID-19.","output":"The Burden of Disease due to COVID-19 in Korea Using Disability-Adjusted Life Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The noteworthy success of a small embargoed island in scientific development, and in particular in a typically US-dominated and capital-intensive sector like biotechnology, has attracted considerable interest and discussion among the analysts and specialists, since it shows features that are unique in the panorama of developing countries.

Furthermore, in our Spanish Association of IEM (AECOM) a new section (AECOM&Sociedad) was created with the aim to attend the increasing needs of communication, and education in partnership with patient's associations. Along the end of 2020 and first months of 2021 a combined quest including knowledge about the disease, beliefs about medicines (BMQ), and illness perception (BIPQ) was opened on-line among Gaucher (GD) and Fabry (FD) Spanish populations. We obtained 40 GD (55.7% males) and 49 FD (53% males) anonymous responses. The proportion of adults was 87.5% and 96% for GD and FD cohorts, respectively. Results: The Batalla test of knowledge about the own disease showed a very good and similar result for both cohorts (94% GD and 92% FD). However, striking differences were observed concerning disease control (71% GD vs 44% FD), concern about the disease (75% GD vs 90% FD), and emotional affectation (37% GD vs 65% FD). In addition, these results were compared with 35 PKU/HPA patients referring clinical symptoms in 20% of cases compared to 65% GD and 57% FD, high level of disease knowledge and control (94 and 88%, respectively), and lower percentages for disease concern (63%) and emotional affectation (34%). Conclusions: Compared to GD, FD patients report lower perception of disease control, and higher levels of disease concern and emotional affectation. Differences were still wider when comparing FD with PKU patients.

Participants were recruited from social media platforms employing a snowball convenience sampling. The perception of bullying, beliefs regarding social consequences of infection, views on measures towards violators of patients privacy, and how to reduce the stigma were assessed by self-reported measures. 397 participants returned completed questionnaires. The majority of respondents believed that COVID-19 patients in Jordan are getting bullied (n = 255, 64.3%) and over 80% believed that people enjoy sharing identities, or news about COVID-19 patients.

It consisted of the data of 441 trappings, and the data were statistically analyzed. The results show that three influencing factors impacted mosquito population: distance from running water, built-up density and average temperature had a causal impact on the average number of mosquitoes of an urban area. Each of these factors showed direct impact, and the impact intensified with the combination of the three factors. On that basis, it was made clear which areas of the city mosquito control activity should be focused. Areas of the city where interventions of lower intensity may be necessary compared to the intensity of the earlier mosquito control measures could also be determined.

HCP who received training were surveyed about elements of training and their perceived impact and overall experience by email invitation. A total of 28 HCP from 15 hospitals were interviewed, and 55 HCP completed the survey. Factors affecting PPE selection included: changing guidance, vendor supply, performance evaluations, and perceived risk and comfort for HCP. Cost did not affect selection. PPE acquisition challenges were mitigated by: sharing within hospital networks, reusing PPE during training, and improvising with existing PPE stock. Selected PPE ensembles were similar across sites. Training included hands-on activities with trained observers, instructional videos, and simulations/drills, which were felt to increase HCP confidence. Many felt refresher training would be helpful. Hands-on training was perceived to be effective, but there is a need to establish the appropriate frequency of refresher training frequency to maintain competence.

Efficacy endpoints were mortality, clinical deterioration, and the occurrence of venous thromboembolism, safety endpoint was the occurrence of major bleeding. Of 278 patients with Covid-19, 127 received prophylaxis with high enoxaparin doses and 151 with standard dosage. At 21 days, the incidence rate of death and clinical deterioration were lower in patients on higher doses than in those on the standard dosage (hazard ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.62), and the incidence of venous thromboembolism was also lower (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.05). Major bleeding occurred in four of 127 patients (3.1%) on the high enoxaparin dosage. In conclusion, in the cohort of patients with Covid-19 treated with high enoxaparin dosages we observed a 60% reduction of mortality and clinical deterioration and a 50% reduction of venous thromboembolism compared to standard dosage prophylaxis. However, 3% of patients on high enoxaparin dosages had non-fatal major bleeding.","output":"Increasing dosages of low-molecular-weight heparin in hospitalized patients with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic COVID 19 has posed unprecedented ordeals before the field of sport and education in the last two years.

METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a questionnaire was given to the parents of systemically healthy children aged 0-14 years who applied to the paedodontics clinics for oral examinations. The families were asked about their sociodemographic status, reasons for the application, and their opinions about the pandemic. The obtained data were analyzed using chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman's rank correlation, and binary logistic regression analysis tests. RESULTS: While the most common reason for presentation was toothache (49.8%), the percentage of the patients who applied to the Pediatric Dental Clinic, School of Dentistry, Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey, with urgent reasons was 58.2%. There was an increase in the urgent application in children with low income and younger children (P < 0.010). A negative correlation was found between the urgent applications and income level (r = -0.100, P = 0.014).

A great proportion of the world needs to be vaccinated in order to stop the rapid spread of the disease. In addition to prioritising vulnerable sections of the population to receive the vaccine, an ideal degree-based vaccination strategy uses fine-grained contact networks to prioritise vaccine recipients. This strategy is costly and impractical due to the enormous amount of specific contact information needed. It also does not capture indirect famine or aerosol-based transmission. We recently proposed a new vaccination strategy called Individual's Movement-based Vaccination (IMV), which takes into account both direct and indirect transmission and is based on the types of places people visit. IMV was shown to be cost-efficient in the case of influenza-like diseases. This paper studies the application of IMV to COVID-19 using its documented transmission parameters. We conduct large scale computer simulations based on a city-wide empirical mobility dataset to evaluate the performance and practicability of the strategy.

While geographically close and economically linked, these two populations differ in terms of governance, income, and access to technology for wastewater recycling. To address the data gap pertaining to perceptions of wastewater recycling, a survey was administered among a convenience sample of subjects (n = 236) recruited from Eilat, Israel and Bethlehem, West Bank, from May to November 2018. The survey included questions addressing knowledge of water sources, water scarcity, and recycled water; willingness to use recycled water for produce irrigation and household tasks; and demographics. Israeli willingness to use recycled water for various purposes ranged from 8.3% to 55.1%, and more than half of Israeli respondents were willing to serve both raw and cooked produce irrigated with recycled water. Willingness to use recycled water ranged from 28.9% to 41.7% among the Palestinian respondents, and Palestinian respondents were more willing to engage in high-contact uses (i.e. drinking and cooking) than Israeli respondents.

Two authors working independently screened the records, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews checklist. We extracted quantitative DTA estimates as well as qualitative statements on their relevance to practice. RESULTS We included four SRs published between 2015 and 2018. These SRs included between 17 and 113 studies on OCT for glaucoma diagnosis. Two reviews were at low risk of bias and the other two had two to four domains at high or unclear risk of bias with concerns on applicability. The two reliable SRs reported the accuracy of average retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and found a sensitivity of 0.69 (0.63 to 0.73) and 0.78 (0.74 to 0.83) and a specificity of 0.94 (0.93 to 0.95) and 0.93 (0.92 to 0.95) in 57 and 50 studies, respectively.

METHODS We queried the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry for adults supported with VV-ECMO from 2010 to 2017. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to assess the association between BTEs and in-hospital mortality and the predictors of BTEs. RESULTS Among 7579 VV-ECMO patients meeting criteria, 40.2% experienced  1 BTE. Thrombotic events comprised 54.9% of all BTEs and were predominantly ECMO circuit thrombosis. BTE rates decreased significantly over the study period (p < 0.001). The inpatient mortality rate was 34.9%. Bleeding events (1.69 [1.49-1.93]) were more strongly associated with in-hospital mortality than thrombotic events (1.23 [1.08-1.41]) p < 0.01 for both. The BTEs most strongly associated with mortality were ischemic stroke (4.50 [2.55-7.97]) and medical bleeding, including intracranial (5.71 [4.02-8.09]), pulmonary (2.02 [1.54-2.67]), and gastrointestinal (1.54 [1.2-1.98]) hemorrhage, all p < 0.01. Risk factors for bleeding included acute kidney injury and pre-ECMO vasopressor support and for thrombosis were higher weight, multisite cannulation, pre-ECMO arrest, and higher PaCO2 at ECMO initiation. Longer time on ECMO, younger age, higher pH, and earlier year of support were associated with bleeding and thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS Although decreasing over time, BTEs remain common during VV-ECMO and have a strong, cumulative association with in-hospital mortality. Thrombotic events are more frequent, but bleeding carries a higher risk of inpatient mortality. Differential risk factors for bleeding and thrombotic complications exist, raising the possibility of a tailored approach to VV-ECMO management.","output":"Bleeding and thrombotic events in adults supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: an ELSO registry analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption to daily life for large swaths of individuals and resulted in potentially widespread implications for individuals' health and wellbeing.

Although DNA-based assays are more sensitive than bacterial culture in detecting the pathogen, the molecular results are often inconsistent and challenged by doubts on false positives, such as those due to system- and environment-derived contaminations. In addition, these molecular tools require expensive laboratory instruments. Therefore, establishing molecular tools for field use require simpler molecular platforms. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in a routine clinical bacteriology laboratory. A simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in the same platform has been developed in recent years. This method is referred to as real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification. In this study, we attempted to utilize this method for rapid detection of A. baumannii. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Species-specific primers were designed to test the utility of this method. Clinical samples of A. baumannii were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this system compared to bacterial culture and a polymerase chain reaction method. All positive samples isolated from sputum were confirmed to be the species of Acinetobacter by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The RealAmp method was found to be simpler and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification, and could distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3. DNA was extracted by simple boiling method. Compared to bacterial culture, the sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in detecting A. baumannii was 98.9% and 75.0%, respectively.

METHODS: Prospective observational study that included medical records of patients with lung cancer and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis across 65 Spanish hospitals. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints were hospitalization and admission to intensive care units (ICU). RESULTS: A total of 447 patients with a mean age of 67.1  9.8 years were analysed. The majority were men (74.3 %) and current/former smokers (85.7 %). NSCLC was the most frequent type of cancer (84.5 %), mainly as adenocarcinoma (51.0 %), and stage III metastatic or unresectable disease (79.2 %). Nearly 60 % of patients were receiving anticancer treatment, mostly first-line chemotherapy. Overall, 350 (78.3 %) patients were hospitalized for a mean of 13.4  11.4 days, 9 (2.0 %) were admitted to ICU and 146 (32.7 %) died. Advanced disease and the use of corticosteroids to treat COVID-19 during hospitalization were predictors of mortality. Hospitalized, non-end-of-life stage patients with lymphocytopenia and high LDH had an increased risk of death. Severity of COVID-19 correlated to higher mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation rates.

METHODS Participants were 670 young adult cohort members (ages 21-29) of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010-2018 who participated in the C-EAT study (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time). RESULTS Among the sample, 84% (n = 561) reported pandemic-related changes to their mood or stress and 33% (n = 221) reported changes to their substance use. Linear regression analyses identified several meaningful risk factors for higher psychological distress during the pandemic, including female gender, White race, higher pre-pandemic depressive symptoms and perceived stress, and lower pre-pandemic stress management ability. A thematic analysis further identified five major themes related to changes in stress and mood following the COVID-19 outbreak describing specific emotional reactions, stress related to the direct impact of the pandemic as well as interpersonal connectedness and economic factors, and strategies for managing stress. In addition, two major themes were identified related to substance use during the pandemic detailing specific changes in and motivations for substance use. CONCLUSIONS These findings underscore the need to develop effective, scalable, and rapidly deployable public health resources that target the stressors commonly experienced among young adults to improve their psychological wellbeing during this pandemic.","output":"Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, mood, and substance use among young adults in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area: Findings from project EAT."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research activity in the field of monitoring indoor quality systems has increased dramatically in recent years. Monitoring closed areas can reduce health-related risks due to poor or contaminated air quality. In the current COVID pandemic, the population has observed that improving ventilation in the closed area can significantly reduce infection risk. However, the significance of air quality statistics makes highly accurate real-time monitoring systems vital. In this paper, several researchers' protocols and the methodologies for monitoring a good high indoor air quality system are presented. The majority of the reviewed works are aimed to reduce air pollution levels of the atmosphere. The vast majority of the identified works utilized IoT and WSN technology to fix the partial access to sensed data, high cost, and non-scalability of conventional air monitoring systems. Furthermore, ad-hoc approaches are predominantly used to help society change its attitude and impose corrective actions to improve air quality. This paper presents a short but comprehensive review of several researchers works with different approaches to ecological trend analysis capabilities, drawing on existing literature works. Overall, the findings highlight the need for developing systematic protocols for these systems and establishing smart air quality monitoring systems capable of measuring pollutant concentrations in the air.","output":"Indoor Air Quality Monitoring Systems: A Comprehensive Review of Different IAQM Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the key indicators used in tracking the evolution of an infectious disease isthe reproduction number.

Little is known about how the activities and experiences of patient, family and caregiver partners, as a large group across a variety of settings within the health system, changed due to the substantial health system shifts catalysed by the pandemic. This paper reports on the results of a survey that included questions about this topic. METHODS: Canadian patient, family and caregiver partners were invited to participate in an online anonymous survey in the Fall of 2020. A virtual snowballing approach to recruitment was used. Survey invitations were shared on social media and emailed to health system and governmental organizations with the request that they share the survey with patient partners. This paper focuses on responses to two questions related to patient partner experiences during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. RESULTS: The COVID\\\\19 questions were completed by 533 respondents. Over three quarters of respondents (77.9%, n = 415) indicated their patient engagement activities had been impacted by COVID\\\\19. The majority (62.5%, n = 230) experienced at least a temporary or partial reduction in their patient engagement activities. Some respondents did see increases in their patient engagement activities (11.4%, n = 42). Many respondents provided insights into their experience with virtual platforms for engagement (n = 194), most expressed negative or mixed experiences with this shift. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a snapshot of Canadian patient, family and caregiver partners' perspectives on the impact of COVID\\\\19 on their engagement activities. Understanding how engagement unfolded during a crisis is critical for our future planning if patient engagement is to be fully integrated into the health system. Identifying how patient partners were engaged and not engaged during this time period, as well as the benefits and challenges of virtual engagement opportunities, offers instructive lessons for sustaining patient engagement, including the supports needed to engage with a more diverse set of patient, family and caregiver partners. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Patient partners were important members of the Canadian Patient Partner Study research team. They were engaged from the outset, participating in all stages of the research project. Additional patient partners were engaged to develop and pilot test the survey, and all survey respondents were patient, family or caregiver partners. The manuscript is coauthored by two patient partners.","output":"The impact of COVID\\\\19 on patient engagement in the health system: Results from a Pan\\\\Canadian survey of patient, family and caregiver partners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently defined as the worst pandemic disease. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells via the binding of its S protein to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). The use of ACEIs/ARBs (RAAS inhibitors) regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and may increase ACE2 expression. Considering the large use of ACEIs/ARBs in hypertensive patients, some professional groups are concerned about whether the use of RAAS inhibitors affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or the risk of severe illness and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we summarize preclinical and clinical studies to investigate whether the use of ACEIs/ARBs increases ACE2 expression in animals or patients. We also analyzed whether the use of these drugs affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe illness or mortality based on recent studies. Finally, the review suggests that current evidence does not support the concerns.","output":"The interaction of RAAS inhibitors with COVID-19: Current progress, perspective and future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diffusion- and perfusion-based imaging studies are regularly used in patients with ischemic stroke.

Materials: and Methods: This cross-sectional study comparedthe pre-pandemic pregnant group (July 2019 and December 2019) and the pandemic group (November 2020 and May 2021) of patients atKtahya Health Sciences University Evliya ?elebi Training and Research Hospital. A total of 696 pregnant womenin their second trimesterwere included in the study. All of them were literate andvoluntarily agreed to participate in the study. Data were collected with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (WDEQ-A), and the outpatient doctor asked the questions face-to-face. Results: : The mean age of the pregnant women participating in the study was 31.66.8 years. While the total Wijma score was 62.125.1 in the pre-pandemic group, it was 61.326.4 in the pandemic group, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.738).While 25.7% (n=179) of all participants had a normal fear of childbirth, 22% (n=153) had a mild fear of childbirth, 27% (n=188) had a moderate fear of childbirth, and 25.3% (n=176) had a severe fear of childbirth (Wijma score of 85 and above).

The state also offers the highest wages for migrant workers for jobs in the unorganised sector in the entire Indian subcontinent. Further, the state has evolved several measures for the inclusion of the workers and was able to effectively respond to their distress during the national lockdown. This paper examines labour migration to Kerala, key measures by the government to promote the social security of the workers and the states response to the distress of migrant workers during lockdown, by synthesising the available secondary evidence. The welfare measures as well as interventions initiated by the state are exemplary and promising given the intent and provisions. However, some of them do not appear to have consideration of the grassroots requirements and implementation mechanisms to enhance access. As a result, the policy intent and substantial investments have not yielded the expected results. The states effective response to the distress of workers during the lockdown emanates from its overall disaster preparedness and resilience achieved from confronting with two consecutive state-wide natural disasters and a public health emergency in the immediate past. While the government has played a strategic role through policy imperative and ensuring a synergistic response, the data presented by the state indicate a much larger but invisible role played by the employers and civil society in providing food and shelter to workers.","output":"Inclusion of Interstate Migrant Workers in Kerala and Lessons for India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to detect pathogens specifically and sensitively is critical to combat infectious diseases outbreaks and pandemics.

In non-transplant eligible patients daratumumab has been added in randomized studies to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) and bortezomib, melphalan and prednisolone (VMP) backbones, but not to the VCD regimen. Furthermore, the randomized studies excluded a significant proportion of patients with comorbidities so the benefit of daratumumab in a frail, elderly myeloma population remains untested. Methods Inclusion criteria included untreated patients with symptomatic myeloma who were considered ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation due to either age >65years or the presence of comorbidities. Any degree of renal impairment, including dialysis dependence, was allowed as were patients with a prior history of systemic malignancy that had been disease-free for 2 years. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive VCD or VCDD. VCD consisted of nine 5-week cycles of V 1.3 mg/m2 SC on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22;C 300mg/m2 PO on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 and D 20 mg PO on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22. VCDD consisted of nine 5-week cycles of VCD plus daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2, Days 1 and 15 of cycles 3 to 6 and Day 1 of cycles 7 to 9, followed by daratumumab maintenance 16 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks until progression. The primary endpoint was PFS with secondary endpoints being response rates, MRD, overall survival, toxicity and quality of life. Results A total of 129 patients were randomized, but 7 did not commence intended therapy. The following modified ITT analysis is based on the 122 randomized patients, 58 in the VCD group and 64 in the VCDD group, who received therapy. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two arms. Median age was 76 years (range, 62-91yrs), with 19% being 80 years of age. 30% were female. ECOG performance status was 0 (34%),1 (26%), 2 (16%) and unknown (25%). ISS stage was I (16%), II (36%), III (23%) and unknown (24%). The estimated median potential follow-up is 12.6 months. At the time of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted collection of site data. As a result, the following outcome data is provisional with a full data set to be available for presentation of the formal pre-planned interim analysis by the time of the ASH meeting. Overall response rate was 86% for VCD and 93% for VCDD. There was no significant difference between response rates after 4 cycles of induction for the VCD and VCDD arms: CR 3% vs 2%, VGPR 31% vs 41%, PR 51% vs 50%, MR 11% vs 7%, PD 3% vs 0%. Median PFS for the entire cohort (Fig A) was 21.8 months (95%CI 17.1-31.6 months). Median PFS for those treated with VCD was 18.9 months (95%CI 15.3-NR) and was 26.3 months (95%CI 17.1-31.6 months) for those treated with VCDD. In both arms combined, median PFS was 26.3 vs 21.9 months for those aged <75 vs 75 yrs, and not reached, 21.8 months and 19.9 months for those with ISS stage I, II and III, respectively. 19% of patients in the VCD group and 16% of patients in the VCDD group ceased therapy early, predominantly due to adverse events or death. SAEs during the induction period occurred in 44% and 52% of patients in the VCD and VCDD arms, respectively. There were 13 patients with SAEs due to infection in the VCD group and 20 in the VCDD group. Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy was uncommon, with only one case in the VCD arm. Conclusions The VCD schedule as detailed in this study appears efficacious, well tolerated and deliverable to an elderly myeloma population. The addition of daratumumab does not compromise chemotherapy delivery and may improve PFS. Formal interim analysis of the trial data will be presented at the meeting.

The short-term impacts of lockdowns on China's air quality have been measured and reported, however, the changes in anthropogenic emissions have not yet been assessed quantitatively, which hinders our understanding of the causes of the air quality changes during COVID-19. Here, for the first time, we report the anthropogenic air pollutant emissions from mainland China by using a bottom-up approach based on the near-real-time data in 2020 and use the estimated emissions to simulate air quality changes with a chemical transport model. The COVID-19 lockdown was estimated to have reduced China's anthropogenic emissions substantially between January and March in 2020, with the largest reductions in February. Emissions of SO2, NOx, CO, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and primary PM2.5 were estimated to have decreased by 27?%, 36?%, 28?%, 31?%, and 24?%, respectively, in February 2020 compared to the same month in 2019. The reductions in anthropogenic emissions were dominated by the industry sector for SO2 and PM2.5 and were contributed to approximately equally by the industry and transportation sectors for NOx, CO, and NMVOCs. With the spread of coronavirus controlled, China's anthropogenic emissions rebounded in April and since then returned to the comparable levels of 2019 in the second half of 2020. The provinces in China have presented nearly synchronous decline and rebound in anthropogenic emissions, while Hubei and the provinces surrounding Beijing recovered more slowly due to the extension of lockdown measures. The ambient air pollution presented much lower concentrations during the first 3 months in 2020 than in 2019 while rapidly returning to comparable levels afterward, which have been reproduced by the air quality model simulation driven by our estimated emissions.

Substantial inter-individual variability in individual disease courses is hypothesized to be partially mediated by the differential regulation of the genes that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are involved in the subsequent host response. Here, we comprehensively investigated non-genetic and genetic factors influencing COVID-19-relevant bronchial epithelial gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings obtained from uninfected individuals. We related ACE2 gene expression to host and environmental factors in the SPIROMICS cohort of smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and replicated these associations in two asthma cohorts, SARP and MAST. To identify airway biology beyond ACE2 binding that may contribute to increased susceptibility, we used gene set enrichment analyses to determine if gene expression changes indicative of a suppressed airway immune response observed early in SARS-CoV-2 infection are also observed in association with host factors. To identify host genetic variants affecting COVID-19 susceptibility in SPIROMICS, we performed expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping and investigated the phenotypic associations of the eQTL variants. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.","output":"Genetic and non-genetic factors affecting the expression of COVID-19-relevant genes in the large airway epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"News outlets overflow with grim information about the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and its dire effects.

Asymptomatic and pre symptomatic are responsible for substantial transmission. RNA or antigen tests are necessary to identify non-symptomatic individuals. We tested the feasibility of using samples pooling offering different collection alternatives (swab/throat wash/saliva) to volunteers of a public health institute. MethodsWe evaluated pool samples from frozen material from previously tested samples and a prospective collection from asymptomatic volunteers. Some collections were paired for comparison. Pools and some individual samples were extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and/or Lucigen Quick Extract DNA extraction solution (BioSearch, USA) and submitted to rtPCR (Allplex, Seegene, Korea). ResultsA total of 240 samples from 130 new collections and 37 samples with known result were evaluated. Pool CT was generally higher than individual samples. Lucigen extraction showed higher CT, including false negative results for samples with high CT at Qiagen extraction. Paired Swab and TW samples showed comparable results. No volunteer from negative pools reported any symptom in the 2-3 days after collection. ConclusionsClinical samples pooling to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is feasible and an economical way to test for COVID-19, especially in surveillance strategies targeting more infectiousness, higher viremia individuals. The use of Lucigen reagents show lower sensibility that may lead to false negative results with lower viremia samples. Combining throat wash with saliva may provide and interesting self-collection alternative, but more comparative work is needed.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using pooling of self-collected samples: Simple protocols may foster asymptomatic surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is intended to solve a detail in the precautions to avoid the spreading of the coronavirus.

This has appropriately led to prioritization of frail older adults and LTC residents, and those who care for them, in the vaccination effort against COVID-19. Older adults have distinct immunological, clinical, and practical complexity, which can be understood through a lens of frailty. Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of COVID-19 vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been optimally tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination programs are being implemented. This is an example of how vaccines are often not tested in Phase 1/2/3 clinical trials in the people most in need of protection. We argue that geriatricians, as frailty specialists, have much to contribute to the development, testing and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. We discuss roles for geriatricians in ten stages of the vaccine development process, covering vaccine design, trial design, trial recruitment, establishment and interpretation of illness definitions, safety monitoring, consideration of relevant health measures such as frailty and function, analysis methods to account for frailty and differential vulnerability, contributions in regulatory and advisory roles, post-marketing surveillance, and program implementation and public health messaging. In presenting key recommendations pertinent to each stage, we hope to contribute to a dialogue on how to push the field of vaccinology to embrace the complexity of frailty.

CT imaging can thus emerge as an important modality for the management of COVID-19 patients. AI-based solutions can be used to support CT based quantitative reporting and make reading efficient and reproducible if quantitative biomarkers, such as the Percentage of Opacity (PO), can be automatically computed. However, COVID-19 has posed unique challenges to the development of AI, specifically concerning the availability of appropriate image data and annotations at scale. In this paper, we propose to use synthetic datasets to augment an existing COVID-19 database to tackle these challenges. We train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to inpaint COVID-19 related tomographic patterns on chest CTs from patients without infectious diseases. Additionally, we leverage location priors derived from manually labeled COVID-19 chest CTs patients to generate appropriate abnormality distributions. Synthetic data are used to improve both lung segmentation and segmentation of COVID-19 patterns by adding 20% of synthetic data to the real COVID-19 training data. We collected 2143 chest CTs, containing 327 COVID-19 positive cases, acquired from 12 sites across 7 countries. By testing on 100 COVID-19 positive and 100 control cases, we show that synthetic data can help improve both lung segmentation (+6.02% lesion inclusion rate) and abnormality segmentation (+2.78% dice coefficient), leading to an overall more accurate PO computation (+2.82% Pearson coefficient).","output":"3D Tomographic Pattern Synthesis for Enhancing the Quantification of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data visualizations have proliferated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate information about the crisis and influence policy development and individual decision-making. In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19.

We utilise assurance to calculate the required sample size based on the target width of a posterior probability interval and can choose to use or disregard the data from the analytical validity study when subsequently inferring measures of test accuracy. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the robustness of the proposed sample size to the choice of prior, and prior-data conflict is evaluated by comparing the data to the prior predictive distributions. We illustrate the proposed approach using a motivating real-life application involving a diagnostic test for ventilator associated pneumonia. Finally, we compare the properties of the proposed approach against commonly used alternatives. The results show that by making better use of existing data from earlier studies, the assurance-based approach can not only reduce the required sample size when compared to alternatives, but can also produce more reliable sample sizes for diagnostic accuracy studies.","output":"Bayesian sample size determination for diagnostic accuracy studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We report on service user participation in a population-based data linkage study designed to analyse the daily, weekly and yearly cycles of births in England and Wales, the outcomes for women and babies, and their implications for the NHS. Public Involvement and Engagement (PI&E) has a long history in maternity services, though PI&E in maternity data linkage studies is new in the United Kingdom. We have used the GRIPP2 short form, a tool designed for reporting public involvement in research. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to involve and engage a wide range of maternity service users and their representatives to ensure that our use of patient-identifiable routinely collected maternity and birth records was acceptable and that our research analyses using linked data were relevant to their expressed safety and quality of care needs. METHODS: A three-tiered approach to PI&E was used. Having both PI&E co-investigators and PI&E members of the Study Advisory Group ensured service user involvement was part of the strategic development of the project. A larger constituency of maternity service users from England and Wales was engaged through four regional workshops. RESULTS: Two co-investigators with experience of PI&E in maternity research were involved as service user researchers from design stage to dissemination. Four PI&E study advisors contributed service user perspectives. Engagement workshops attracted around 100 attendees, recruited largely from Maternity Services Liaison Committees in England and Wales, and a community engagement group. They supported the use of patient-identifiable data, believing the study had potential to improve safety and quality of maternity services. They contributed their experiences and concerns which will assist with interpretation of the analyses. CONCLUSION: Use of PI&E knowledge intermediaries successfully bridged the gap between data intensive research and lived experience, but more inclusivity in involvement and engagement is required. Respecting the concerns and questions of service users provides social legitimacy and a relevance framework for researchers carrying out analyses.","output":"Involving service users in the Birth Timing project, a data linkage study analysing the timing of births and their outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed increased strain on health care workers and disrupted childcare and schooling arrangements in unprecedented ways. As substantial gender inequalities existed in medicine before the pandemic, physician mothers may be at particular risk for adverse professional and psychological consequences. OBJECTIVE: To assess gender differences in work-family factors and mental health among physician parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study included 276 US physicians enrolled in the Intern Health Study since their first year of residency training. Physicians who had participated in the primary study as interns during the 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 academic years and opted into a secondary longitudinal follow-up study were invited to complete an online survey in August 2018 and August 2020. EXPOSURES: Work-family experience included 3 single-item questions and the Work and Family Conflict Scale, and mental health symptoms included the Patient Health QuestionnaireC9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety DisorderC7 scale. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were work-to-family and family-to-work conflict and depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms during August 2020. Depressive symptoms between 2018 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) were compared by gender. RESULTS: Among 215 physician parents who completed the August 2020 survey, 114 (53.0%) were female and the weighted mean (SD) age was 40.1 (3.57) years. Among physician parents, women were more likely to be responsible for childcare or schooling (24.6% [95% CI, 19.0%-30.2%] vs 0.8% [95% CI, 0.01%-2.1%]; P < .001) and household tasks (31.4% [95% CI, 25.4%-37.4%] vs 7.2% [95% CI, 3.5%-10.9%]; P < .001) during the pandemic compared with men. Women were also more likely than men to work primarily from home (40.9% [95% CI, 35.1%-46.8%] vs 22.0% [95% CI, 17.2%-26.8%]; P < .001) and reduce their work hours (19.4% [95% CI, 14.7%-24.1%] vs 9.4% [95% CI, 6.0%-12.8%]; P = .007). Women experienced greater work-to-family conflict ( = 2.79; 95% CI, 1.00 to 4.59; P = .03), family-to-work conflict ( = 3.09; 95% CI, 1.18-4.99; P = .02), and depressive ( = 1.76; 95% CI, 0.56-2.95; P = .046) and anxiety ( = 2.87; 95% CI, 1.49-4.26; P < .001) symptoms compared with men. We observed a difference between women and men in depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic (mean [SD] PHQ-9 score: 5.05 [6.64] vs 3.52 [5.75]; P = .009) that was not present before the pandemic (mean [SD] PHQ-9 score: 3.69 [5.26] vs 3.60 [6.30]; P = .86). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found significant gender disparities in work and family experiences and mental health symptoms among physician parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may translate to increased risk for suicide, medical errors, and lower quality of patient care for physician mothers. Institutional and public policy solutions are needed to mitigate the potential adverse consequences for womens careers and well-being.","output":"Experiences of Work-Family Conflict and Mental Health Symptoms by Gender Among Physician Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). STUDY DESIGN: Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The left ventricular ejection fraction normalized in 95% of those with a depressed ejection fraction.

Maintaining resilience: participants acknowledged they were self-reliant prior to their diagnosis, and that the sense of their own internal capabilities was a source of comfort for them;Importance of pre-established relationships with healthcare professionals: the sense of connection established prior to the telehealth consultation supported participants to engage with healthcare professionals. The need for connectedness was amplified by a sense of isolation. Seeking help: participants sought help from services that they perceived as being expert;Convenience: factors such as costs and saving time were highlighted;Preferences for consultation type: majority of participants identified physical and emotional comfort being in their own space. For a small number of patients, continuing a face to face assessment was important due to expectation based on previous experience.

It is produced at sites of infection and inflammation by both structural and inflammatory cells. However its role in allergen-induced inflammation remains to be tested. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of PTX3 deletion on ovalbumin (OVA)Cinduced allergic inflammation in a murine model of asthma. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from severe asthmatic and healthy subjects and level of PTX3 was determined by ELISA. PTX3(+/+) and PTX3(?/?) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and BALF and the lungs were collected for accessing inflammation. Lung tissue inflammation and mucus production were assessed by flow cytometry, H&E and PAS staining, respectively. FlexiVENT was used to determine airway resistance to methacholine of these mice. RESULTS: Here we report that severe asthmatics and OVA-sensitized/ challenged mice had increased PTX3 level in the lungs compared with healthy controls. Mice lacking PTX3 develop exaggerated neutrophilic/ eosinophilic lung inflammation, mucus production and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in an experimental model of OVA-induced asthma. Furthermore, OVA-exposed lung PTX3(?/?) CD4 T cells exhibit an increased production of IL-17A, an effect that is accompanied with an elevated STAT3 phosphorylation, reduced IL-2 production, enhanced activation and survival. Also we observed increase in IL-6 and IL-23 producing DCs in OVA-exposed PTX3(?/?) mice as compared to their wild type controls. CONCLUSION: Altogether, PTX3 deficiency results in augmented AHR, mucus production and IL-17A-dominant pulmonary inflammation, suggesting a regulatory role of PTX3 in the development of allergic inflammation.","output":"PTX3 Deletion Aggravates Allergic Inflammation through a Th17 -Dominant Phenotype and Enhanced CD4 T cell Survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As in other coronaviruses, the nucleocapsid protein is one of the core components of the SARS coronavirus (CoV).

CRISPR/Cas9 editing outcomes depend on local DNA sequences at the target site and are thus predictable. However, existing prediction methods are dependent on both feature and model engineering, which restricts their performance to existing knowledge about CRISPR/Cas9 editing. RESULTS: Herein, deep multi-task convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and neural architecture search (NAS) were used to automate both feature and model engineering and create an end-to-end deep-learning framework, CROTON (CRISPR Outcomes Through cONvolutional neural networks). The CROTON model architecture was tuned automatically with NAS on a synthetic large-scale construct-based dataset and then tested on an independent primary T cell genomic editing dataset. CROTON outperformed existing expert-designed models and non-NAS CNNs in predicting 1 base pair insertion and deletion probability as well as deletion and frameshift frequency. Interpretation of CROTON revealed local sequence determinants for diverse editing outcomes. Finally, CROTON was utilized to assess how single nucleotide variants (SNVs) affect the genome editing outcomes of four clinically relevant target genes: the viral receptors ACE2 and CCR5 and the immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA4 and PDCD1. Large SNV-induced differences in CROTON predictions in these target genes suggest that SNVs should be taken into consideration when designing widely applicable gRNAs.

The preclinical surgery pilot course took place before COVID-19 disruptions, and the EMLR and LC experiences took place virtually. Specialty choice was examined in the EMLR and LC cohorts. Performance on the NBME surgical assessments was analyzed among students enrolled in the traditional clerkship and pandemic-disrupted courses and compared to national data using a two-sample t-test. RESULTS: Compared to preclinical students, EMLR and LC students demonstrated improvements in their perceived surgical clerkship readiness. After the 3-week EMLR course, in the setting of completing only one-third of the clerkship year, students had an average NBME Surgical Self-Assessment Exam score of 72 (SD 12), comparable to the national average of 71 (SD 9) pa?=a?0.33.

OBJECTIVES: Systematic literature review of data on asthma in heroin users. DOCUMENTARY SOURCES: Medline(?), on the period 1980-2017 with the following keywords: keywords: asthma or bronchospasm and heroin or opiate or opiates, limits title/abstract; the selected languages were English or French. Among 97 articles, 67 abstracts have given use to a dual reading to select 23 studies. RESULTS: The seven case reports included 21 patients (mean age: 28 years [19C46 years]; sex-ratio: 2.5 [males: 71.5%]). Heroin was inhaled (71.4%), sniffed (19%) or injected by intravenous route (9.5%). Associated addictive substances were tobacco (81%), cannabis (38%), alcohol (4.7%) and cocaine (4.7%). Outcome was fatal in 3 subjects (14.3%). Other studies included one cross-sectional study, 3 case-control studies and 12 longitudinal studies (11 retrospective studies and one prospective study). The proportion of heroin users was higher in asthmatic subjects and the prevalence of asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity was higher in heroin users. Heroin use can be responsible for asthma onset, with a temporal relationship between the onset of heroin use and asthma onset in 28 to 31% of subjects. A positive association between inhaled heroin use and acute asthma exacerbation was observed. Asthma treatment observance was lower in heroin users. In case of asthma exacerbation, heroin users were more likely to seek care in the emergency department, to be admitted in intensive care units and to require intubation and invasive ventilation. Asthma deaths related to heroin use mainly occurred following an intravenous injection (especially in the case of overdose), but also following heroin use by nasal (sniff) or pulmonary route. CONCLUSION: Heroin use may be responsible for asthma onset, acute asthma exacerbations (which may require intubation and invasive ventilation) or deaths related to asthma. Heroin use must be sought in case of asthma exacerbation in young persons and practitioners must help heroin users to stop their consumption.","output":"Asthme et usage dhro?ne"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the SARS-COV-2 pandemic evolves, what is expected of vaccines extends beyond efficacy and includes evaluations of both durability and cross-reactivity to emerging variants.

It has been observed that lethality seems to be related to the age of patients. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that ageing causes some modi?cations at a molecular level. Objective: The study aims to investigate a possible link between the increased COVID-19 lethality and the molecular changes that occur in elderly people. Methods: : We considered publicly available datasets on ageing-related genes and SARS-CoV-2 interactors. Then, for each SARS-CoV-2 protein interactor, we tested for the enrichment of ageing-related proteins. Finally, we performed a network-based analysis to identify which molecular mechanisms could play a role in the SARS-CoV-2 molecular aetiology and ultimately affect COVID-19 outcome. Results: : We observed a signi?cant intersection between some SARS-CoV-2 interactors and ageing-related genes. Our analysis evidenced that virus infection particularly affects ageing molecular mechanisms centred around proteins EEF2, NPM1, HMGA1, HMGA2, APEX1, CHEK1, PRKDC, and GPX4. Conclusion: Our study generated a mechanistic framework aiming at explaining the correlation between COVID-19 incidence in elderly patients and molecular mechanisms of ageing.

The radial distribution functions indicate that the biocidal ingredients are sensitive to the unsaturated oxygen atoms of 3CL hydrolase and their interactions remarkably depend on the concentration of the biocidal ingredients. Besides, we find that the adsorption performance of the active ingredients for the unsaturated oxygen atoms is superior to other styles of atoms.

They have different manifestations, natural histories, and treatments. Compared with other vascular malformations, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are considered the most symptomatic and difficult to manage. AVMs inherently progress and have a high rate of recurrence after treatment. Imaging helps provide an accurate and early diagnosis, which can then be used to direct appropriate management, with embolization evolving as the primary therapy. Thus, radiology plays a crucial role in the detection, workup, and management of AVMs. Ultrasonography (US) is a useful initial imaging modality, particularly when AVMs involve the extremities or a superficial or accessible location. Limitations include poor identification of soft-tissue and bone components, as well as suboptimal evaluation of deep or complex AVMs. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is the preferred imaging modality for AVMs and should be considered in any symptomatic patient or in the initial evaluation of vascular anomalies that are equivocal at US. Computed tomographic angiography should be reserved for those patients who are unable to undergo MR angiography or for evaluation of acute symptoms, such as bleeding or airway compromise. Conventional catheter-based angiography is useful for real-time depiction and evaluation of AVMs, particularly in the planning and execution of endovascular treatment and in the diagnosis of an AVM when findings from noninvasive imaging are equivocal for a high-flow component.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for 3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted > 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions.

However, direct tests of changes in health outcomes among vulnerable adolescents from before to during COVID-19 are limited. In addition, little is known about how to buffer adolescents, particularly those who are most vulnerable, against stress-related decrements in health. This randomized controlled trial begins to fill these gaps in the literature by exploring changes in mental health, health behaviors, executive function, emotion regulation, and mindfulness among vulnerable adolescents involved in a mentoring program during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also examined to what extent there were protective benefits of incorporating mindfulness training within a mentoring program for buffering adolescents from negative pandemic health effects. Thirty-five adolescents (Mage = 12.9, 37% female) and 32 parents (Mage = 44.75, 80% female) completed questionnaires at baseline (February 2020) and follow-up (July 2020). There were few significant reductions in health; instead, on average, youth reported improvements in sleep, emotion regulation, executive function, and mindfulness over time. Adolescents randomized to mentoring + mindfulness displayed significantly less posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology and emotional impulsivity at follow-up, compared to the mentoring-as-usual condition. These pilot findings suggest that mentoring with a mindfulness training component may offer an effective strategy for protecting adolescents from deteriorations in health outcomes during COVID-19.

In such cases, it might not be good to rely on the fully autonomous operation of robots. Since many mobile robots are fully functional with low-level tasks such as grabbing and moving, we consider the mixed-initiative control where the user can guide the robot remotely to finish such tasks.

The considered ventilator modes were: assisted control volume with a low trigger flow (between ? 2 and 2 L/mn) and pressure support mode. US diaphragmatic assessments were performed at SP and at 60 min of PP. Both End-inspiratory and End-expiratory diameters (EID/EED) were taken at 3 levels of axillary lines and determined by the average values of multiple measures. Diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) was calculated as: DTF = (EID ? EED/EED)  100. Pairing and ANOVA tests were used for comparisons. RESULTS: Forty ventilated patients (42 years of median age) at 4 days [2C7] of median duration of ventilation were examined during the two positions: SP versus PP. EID decreased from the SP to the PP (2.8 mm in SP vs. 2.4 mm in PP, p = 0.001). No difference was showed regarding the expiratory thickness. Overall, DTF didnt change in PP (37.4 vs. 42.05%, p = 0.36).

Yet implementation of policies are variable across contexts, potentially limiting its impact on population health outcomes. The potential impact of a policy to advance health equity depends both on the design and its implementation, requiring ongoing evaluation and stakeholder engagement. Despite the importance of health policies in shaping public health, health care policy implementation science remains underrepresented in research. We argue that enhanced integration of policy questions within implementation science could reduce the time lag from policy to practice and improve population health outcomes to build a body of evidence on effective policy implementation. In this commentary, we argue that approaches to studying policy implementation science should reflect the dynamic and evolving policy context, analogous to the learning healthcare system, to better understand and respond to systematic and multilevel impacts of policy. Several example opportunities for a learning health policy system are posed in building a broader agenda toward research and practice in policy implementation science in public health.","output":"Policy Implementation Science to Advance Population Health: The Potential for Learning Health Policy Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Surgery in the time of COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging issue while treatment of affected fracture patients is inevitable. The present study summarizes the challenges that an orthopedic surgeon is confronting during the surgical treatment of fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection. Methods Demographic and fracture related data of 13 fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection who were treated with surgery was collected from three trauma centers in Tehran and Kermanshah cities from 21, February 2020 to April 3, 2020. Results All patients were male with mean age of 38.619.5 years. Eight patients had high energy fracture and seven patients had multiple fractures and trauma. Wrist and hand were the common sites of fracture following hip and pelvis. The mean interval time period between the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and surgery was 2.31.5 days. Before surgery, all patients except one had been admitted to the corona dedicated wards, while two patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). One of the ICU admitted patients died. All the 12 alive patients remained in home isolation after discharge. Conclusion Fracture surgery in COVID-19 patients has many challenges such as lack of medical resources, delay of surgery, medial staff fear, and patient isolation. However, a multidisciplinary approach using all potential hospital resources would lead to successful operation and acceptable outcome.","output":"Fracture Surgery in Known COVID-19 Infected Patients: What Are the Challenges?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to report the safety and efficacy of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) plication of the diaphragm at our institution between 2006 and 2016. METHODS Adult patients selected on etiology and combination of investigations including plain chest x-ray, computed tomography of chest and abdomen, lung functions in supine and sitting positions, radiological/ultrasonic screening for diaphragmatic movement, and phrenic nerve conduction studies. We incorporated a triportal VATS and Endostitch device for plication, using CO2 insufflation to maximum 12 mm Hg. Bilateral simultaneous plication and high-risk patients were electively admitted to intensive therapy unit postoperatively. RESULTS Thirty-five patients (24 males) had their diaphragm plicated. The mean age was 56.6 years (range = 23-76 years). The mean body mass index was 32.1 (range = 22.2-45.4). Twenty one were right, 13 left, 2 patients had VATS simultaneous bilateral plication, and 1 had sequential VATS bilateral plication. Paralysis was idiopathic in 17, posttraumatic in 5, postremoval of mediastinal tumor in 4, and postcardiac surgery in 3. All patients presented with lifestyle-limiting dyspnea and orthopnea, three were on nocturnal noninvasive ventilation. Five were diabetic and 16 were smokers. The mean supine forced expiratory volume in the first second was 62.5% of predicted. Twenty two were performed by VATS (63%), three converted to thoracotomy, and 13 were open limited thoracotomy (historic). The mean hospital stay was 4.5 days (range = 1-18, mode 2 days). Intensive therapy unit admission was required in six patients for mechanical ventilation 0 to 3 days. Five patients (14%) had no improvement in symptoms. There were no deaths, no 30-day readmissions, and no long-term neuralgia in this series. CONCLUSIONS We found minimal access VATS plication of the diaphragm to be feasible and safe, but no firm conclusions should be drawn from our limited resources. We report the feasibility of concomitant bilateral VATS plication of the diaphragm in two adults, and this was not previously reported in the adult population. There is a need for further good quality, prospective studies, and randomized controlled studies evaluating efficacy of VATS diaphragmatic plication.","output":"VATS Plication of the Diaphragm: A Descriptive Observational 10-Year Southampton Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus named COVID-19 has disrupted the Chinese economy and is spreading globally. The evolution of the disease and its economic impact is highly uncertain which makes it difficult for policymakers to formulate an appropriate macroeconomic policy response. In order to better understand possible economic outcomes, this paper explores seven different scenarios of how COVID-19 might evolve in the coming year using a modelling technique developed by Lee and McKibbin (2003) and extended by McKibbin and Sidorenko (2006). It examines the impacts of different scenarios on macroeconomic outcomes and financial markets in a global hybrid DSGE/CGE general equilibrium model. The scenarios in this paper demonstrate that even a contained outbreak could significantly impact the global economy in the short run.

This contribution presents a data-driven methodology that allows exploring the hospitalization dynamics of COVID-19, exemplified with a study of 17 autonomous regions in Spain. MethodsWe use data on new daily cases and hospitalizations reported by the Ministry of Health of Spain to implement a Bayesian inference method that allows making short and mid-term predictions of bed occupancy of COVID-19 patients in each of the autonomous regions of the country. FindingsWe show how to use given and generated temporal series for the number of daily admissions and discharges from hospital to reproduce the hospitalization dynamics of COVID-19 patients. For the case-study of the region of Aragon, we estimate that the probability of being admitted to hospital care upon infection is 0{middle dot}090 [0{middle dot}086-0{middle dot}094], (95% C.I.), with the distribution governing hospital admission yielding a median interval of 3{middle dot}5 days and an IQR of 7 days. Likewise, the distribution on the length of stay produces estimates of 12 days for the median and 10 days for the IQR. A comparison between model parameters for the regions analyzed allows to detect differences and changes in policies of the health authorities. InterpretationThe amount of data that is currently available is limited, and sometimes unreliable, hindering our understanding of many aspects of this pandemic. We have observed important regional differences, signaling that to properly compare very different populations, it is paramount to acknowledge all the diversity in terms of culture, socio-economic status and resource availability.

However, due to the lack of an adaptive culture system, porcine ToV (PToV) has received less attention. In this study, we developed a novel serological detection method based on the PToV envelope spike subunit 1 (S1) protein for the first time, and compared it to an existing indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the nucleocapsid protein. By using the S1-based ELISA, we carried out the first seroepidemiological survey of PToV in China, assaying both-specific IgG and IgA responses in 1,037 serum samples collected from diarrheic pigs in eastern China. There was a relatively high incidence of seropositivity in pigs of different ages, especially one-week-old piglets and sows (78% and 43%), the former probably reflecting maternal antibodies. Furthermore, 3/20 (15%) of fecal samples collected from one PToV-seropositive swine herd in Zhejiang province tested positive by RT-PCR. The complete PToV genome was sequenced from one of these samples, and its phylogenetic relationship with other full-length PToV sequences available in GenBank was determined.

We therefore implemented a multiparameter mapping (MPM) protocol based on vendor's product sequences and demonstrate its repeatability and reproducibility for whole-brain coverage. Within ~20 min, four MPM metrics (magnetization transfer saturation [MT], proton density [PD], longitudinal [R1], and effective transverse [R2*] relaxation rates) were measured using an optimized 1 mm isotropic resolution protocol on six 3 T MRI scanners from two different vendors. The same five healthy participants underwent two scanning sessions, on the same scanner, at each site. MPM metrics were calculated using the hMRI-toolbox. To account for different MT pulses used by each vendor, we linearly scaled the MT values to harmonize them across vendors. To determine longitudinal repeatability and inter-site comparability, the intra-site (i.e., scan-rescan experiment) coefficient of variation (CoV), inter-site CoV, and bias across sites were estimated. For MT, R1, and PD, the intra- and inter-site CoV was between 4 and 10% across sites and scan time points for intracranial gray and white matter. A higher intra-site CoV (16%) was observed in R2* maps. The inter-site bias was below 5% for all parameters. In conclusion, the MPM protocol yielded reliable quantitative maps at high resolution with a short acquisition time. The high reproducibility of MPM metrics across sites and scan time points combined with its tissue microstructure sensitivity facilitates longitudinal multicenter imaging studies targeting microstructural changes, for example, as a quantitative MRI biomarker for interventional clinical trials.","output":"Multiparameter mapping of relaxation (R1, R2*), proton density and magnetization transfer saturation at 3 T: A multicenter dual-vendor reproducibility and repeatability study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, we are living one of the most severe pandemics in history.

The aims of our study were to investigate levels of resilience in Italian healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to identify potential predictors of resilience. METHODS: We performed a web-based survey of HCPs (n = 1009) working in Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey contained a 14-item resilience scale (RS14) and questionnaires to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms. Non-HCP individuals (n = 375) from the general population were used for comparison. RESULTS: HCPs showed significantly lower resilience compared to the control group (p = 0.001). No significant differences were observed after stratification for geographical area, work setting, role, or suspected/confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. In a linear regression analysis, RS14 was inversely correlated with depression (R2 = 0.227, p < 0.001) and anxiety (R2 = 0.117, p < 0.001) and directly correlated with age (R2 = 0.012, p < 0.001) but not with body mass index (BMI, R2 = 0.002, p = 0.213). In male HCPs, higher depression score (odds ratio (OR) 1.147, p < 0.001) or BMI (OR 1.136, p = 0.011) significantly predicted having low resilience. In female HCPs, higher depression score (OR 1.111, p < 0.0001) and working in a COVID-19 free setting (OR 2.308, p = 0.002) significantly predicted having low resilience. HCPs satisfied with personal protective equipment had higher levels of resilience (p < 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that resilience was lower in Italian HCPs than in the general population after the first COVID-19 wave.

Methods and results: We used a large French multicentric retrospective study enrolling 2,878 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in medical wards. After exclusion of patients who had an AC treatment before hospitalization, we generated a propensity-score-matched cohort of patients who were treated with intermediate-dose or standard-dose prophylactic AC between February 26 and April 20, 2020 (intermediate-dose, n = 261; standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, n = 763). The primary outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality; this occurred in 23 of 261 (8.8%) patients in the intermediate-dose group and 74 of 783 (9.4%) patients in the standard-dose prophylactic AC group (p = 0.85); while time to death was also the same in both the treatment groups (11.5 and 11.6 days, respectively, p = 0.17).

Human mobility represents a crucial element to be considered in modelling human infectious diseases. In this paper, we examined the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 propagation using a Susceptible-Infected stochastic model (SI) driven mainly by commuting network in Italy. We modelled a municipality-specific contact rate to capture the disease permeability of each municipality, considering the population at different times of the day and describing the characteristic of the municipalities as attractors of commuters or places that make their workforce available elsewhere. The purpose of our analysis is to provide a better understanding of the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Italy and to characterize the territory in terms of vulnerability at local or national level. The use of data at such a high spatial resolution allows highlighting particular situations on which the health authorities can promptly intervene to control the disease spread. Our approach provides decision-makers with useful geographically detailed metrics to evaluate those areas at major risk for infection spreading and for which restrictions of human mobility would give the greatest benefits, not only at the beginning of the epidemic but also in the last phase, when the risks deriving from the gradual lockdown exit strategies must be carefully evaluated.","output":"A municipality-based approach using commuting census data to characterise the vulnerability to influenza-like epidemic: the COVID-19 application in Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona virus disease of 2019 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to inflict significant morbidity and mortality around the globe.

Due to its pathophysiologic relevance, the right ventricle finds itself in the eye of the storm of corona virus disease of 2019, placing it at higher risk of failure. Increased afterload from acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary embolism, negative inotropic effects of cytokines, and direct angiotensin converting enzyme 2-mediated cardiac injury from SARS-CoV-2 are potential mechanisms of right ventricle dysfunction in corona virus disease of 2019.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Subacute unit of a Rehabilitation Institute. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 (N=184; aged 18 years or older) who were admitted to a subacute unit to stabilize their condition and recover from acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At admission patients underwent the SPPB test, represented by the sum of 3 functional tests, standing balance, 4-meter gait speed, and 5-repetition sit-to-stand motion. Comparisons between 2 SPPB score groups were performed by an unpaired t test; multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was employed to detect predictors of the SPPB score considering several clinical parameters. RESULTS: Participants were 7412 years old, 52% were men and with more than 2 comorbidities in 43% of cases. SPPB score was 3.023.87 denoting patients' profound physical dysfunction. Normal physical function was detected in only 12% of patients, whereas low, intermediate, and severe impairment was found in 65%, 13%, and 10%, respectively. Age, both invasive and noninvasive ventilation use, and the presence of previous disability were significant predictors of SPPB. Patients without any comorbidities (8%) also exhibited low function (SPPB: 5.671.12). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of survivors after COVID-19 experienced acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia and exhibited substantial physical dysfunction influenced by age, mechanical ventilation need, and previous disability.

The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in patients with CLL in 1 year was approximately 3% in the recent Italian CAMPUS CLL survey; large retrospective studies have documented a higher mortality in patients with CLL hospitalized for severe COVID-19 compared with the general population. Controversial results for CLL-directed treatment have been reported, with some studies suggesting a potential benefit for BTK inhibitors. Reducing the number of hospital visits, delaying treatment whenever possible, and using oral therapy have become the mainstay of management in these patients. Available results with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines indicate an immune serological response in 40% of patients only, with a detrimental effect of recent therapy with or without anti-CD20 therapy, older age, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Further studies are needed to determine the best strategies in patients with CLL regarding (i) management of concomitant COVID-19, (ii) identification of patients in whom CLL therapy can be safely postponed, (iii) CLL treatment algorithms, and (iv) optimal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination strategies.","output":"COVID-19 and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Where We Stand Now."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 encodes a papain-like cysteine proteinase (PLP-1) that, during translation of ORF1a, cleaves p28 from the amino terminus of the growing polypeptide chain.

Current state-of-the-art cryoET combined with subtomogram averaging analysis enables the high-resolution structural determination of macromolecular complexes that are present in multiple copies within tomographic reconstructions. Tomographic experiments usually require a vast amount of tilt series to be acquired by means of high-end transmission electron microscopes with important operational running-costs. Although the throughput and reliability of automated data acquisition routines have constantly improved over the recent years, the process of selecting regions of interest at which a tilt series will be acquired cannot be easily automated and it still relies on the user's manual input. Therefore, the set-up of a large-scale data collection session is a time-consuming procedure that can considerably reduce the remaining microscope time available for tilt series acquisition. Here, the protocol describes the recently developed implementations based on the SerialEM package and the PyEM software that significantly improve the time-efficiency of grid screening and large-scale tilt series data collection. The presented protocol illustrates how to use SerialEM scripting functionalities to fully automate grid mapping, grid square mapping, and tilt series acquisition. Furthermore, the protocol describes how to use PyEM to select additional acquisition targets in off-line mode after automated data collection is initiated. To illustrate this protocol, its application in the context of high-end data collection of Sars-Cov-2 tilt series is described. The presented pipeline is particularly suited to maximizing the time-efficiency of tomography experiments that require a careful selection of acquisition targets and at the same time a large amount of tilt series to be collected.","output":"Strategies for Optimization of Cryogenic Electron Tomography Data Acquisition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There have been increasing reports documenting barbiturate-related deaths, despite routine prescribing for only relatively rare indications. The aims of the current study were to examine trends in barbiturate-related deaths in Australia from 2000 to 2019 and determine the case characteristics and circumstances of barbiturate-related deaths. METHODS: All barbiturate-related deaths identified in the Australian National Coronial Information System were examined. Information was collected on cause, manner, demographics, location, psychosocial factors, circumstances of deaths and toxicology. We examined these based on the age categories 18-44 years, 45-64 years and &#8805;65 years. RESULTS: We identified 511 cases. Mean age was 57.9 years (SD 20.2, range 18-100) and 56% were male. Intentional poisoning was the most common cause of death (87.5%) and was slightly higher in the oldest age group (92.1%) and lowest in the youngest age group (81.1%). Pentobarbitone was the most common barbiturate (75.7%) and pentobarbitone-related deaths increased from 0% in 2000 to 93.6% in 2017. There were notable differences between age categories, with the youngest age group recording more severe psychiatric histories. In contrast, the oldest age group were more likely to have severe physical health problems, such as cancer, chronic non-cancer pain, neurological conditions and significant cardiopulmonary morbidity. Euthanasia resources were commonly documented (33.9%), most frequently in the oldest age group (52.3%). CONCLUSION: Barbiturate-related deaths in Australia are increasing, particularly pentobarbitone-related deaths. Most deaths were intentional and involved adults across the lifespan. Younger people were more likely to have significant mental health problems, whilst the oldest age group were more likely to have severe physical health conditions.","output":"Trends and characteristics in barbiturate deaths Australia 2000-2019: a national retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although coronavirus disease 2019 was first identified in December 2019, it rapidly spread and became a global pandemic.

Beyond the difficulties in caring for Covid-19 in detention, prison infirmaries, where they exist, are rarely integrated into the health system in practice. Administrations provide little for the vital needs of prisoners. Dietary deficiencies are frequent, skin diseases recurrent and prisoners are most often dependent on the financial means of their families or NGOs when it comes to access to health care. The social illegitimacy of the prison population and the reluctance of States to offer convicted prisoners what they do not guarantee to the general population are two arguments put forward to justify what amounts to necropolitics. At the same time, international actors working in prisons essentially target pathologies with epidemic potential, constrained by funding sources (UNAIDS, Global Fund) supporting population-wide health strategies. Here we would like to return to these two logics and develop an argument for a decompartmentalized approach to prison health.

The research paper discusses the case of an Indian social entrepreneur who works for menstrual health and hygiene of unprivileged and rural women in India. The social entrepreneurs constant endeavor is to create an ecosystem to ensure rural womens economic and social upliftment through financial inclusion and livelihood training. When faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, the social entrepreneur re-purposed the manufacturing process to produce masks that were the need of the hour. Design/methodology/approach: The research paper is qualitative and follows an inductive case study approach. The underlying principles of frugal innovation are established through content analysis of the social entrepreneurs interviews and her team members. Findings: The study discusses how adversity can be an opportunity for social entrepreneurs by implementing frugal innovation principles, i.e. re-use, re-purpose, re-combine and rapidity, in times of crisis. Research limitations/implications: One of the major limitations of this study is that it is based on a single case study, as, in the current scenario, this case appeared to be the most suitable one. There is no way to generalize the assumptions of this model. Researchers will have to study the phenomena of frugal innovation in adversity across multiple cases in the future. Also, the study is based on a single emerging economy, i.e. India. Further research may be carried out with such cases from other countries. Practical implications: The proposition of this research paper will help new and established social entrepreneurs understand that the four principles of frugal innovation and their practical application by a social entrepreneur. This will act as a guiding light for the present and future entrepreneurs regarding how one can respond to a crisis. This will also help advance our understanding of the distinct ways in which social entrepreneurs activities can help society in times of crisis. The findings of this research paper provide timely implications for social entrepreneurs. To respond efficiently to various crises, it is important to consider its effect on social entrepreneurship. Social implications: The research paper shows that the social enterprise has implemented frugal innovation principles to manufacture the COVID-19 protection items supplied through existing supply chain networks. Also, a social entrepreneur is not intimidated by the sudden changes in the business environment;instead, they look at the situation as an opportunity to do something new. They are always willing to take the risk to innovate a solution that will address peoples problems. frugal innovation, due to its highly collaborative nature and its ability to make the most from limited resources, is the only way social entrepreneurs can create an inclusive, secure and sustainable future. Originality/value: There are several challenges in social entrepreneurship, especially in emerging economies like India. During the pandemic, availability of resources was the major challenge, due to which social entrepreneurs had to find solutions through frugal innovation. This paper provides the practical application of the four principles of frugal innovation implemented by a social enterprise to manufacture and supply Covid protection items.

Our objective was to assess patient satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 era. Methods: Telemedicine visit data were gathered from Stanford Health Care (Stanford) and the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS). Patient satisfaction data from HSS were captured from a Press-Ganey questionnaire between April 19, 2020, and December 12, 2020, whereas Stanford data were taken from a novel survey instrument that was distributed to all patients between June 22, 2020, and November 1, 2020. Participants: There were 60,550 telemedicine visits at Stanford, each linked with a postvisit survey. At HSS, there were 66,349 total telemedicine visits with 7,348 randomly linked with a postvisit survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two measures of patient satisfaction were used for this study: (1) a patient's \\"overall visit score\\" and (2) whether the patient indicated the highest possible \\"likelihood to recommend\\" (LTR) score (LTR top box score). Results: The LTR top box percentage at Stanford increased from 69.6% to 74.0% (p = 0.0002), and HSS showed no significant change (p = 0.7067). In the multivariable model, the use of a cell phone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.23) and tablet (aOR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.07-1.23) was associated with higher overall scores, whereas visits with interrupted connections (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.57) or help required to connect (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.56) predicted lower patient satisfaction. Conclusions: We present the largest published description of patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and we identify important telemedicine-specific factors that predict increased overall visit score. These include the use of cell phones or tablets, phone reminders, and connecting before the visit was scheduled to begin. Visits with poor connectivity, extended wait times, or difficulty being seen, examined, or understood by the provider were linked with reduced odds of high scores. Our results suggest that attention to connectivity and audio/visual definition will help optimize patient satisfaction with future telemedicine encounters.","output":"Patient Experience and Satisfaction with Telemedicine During Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multi-Institution Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an oncogenic retrovirus that causes immunosuppression and neoplastic diseases in poultry. Cytokine signal-transduction inhibitor molecule 3 (SOCS3) is an important negative regulator of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and plays certain roles in ALV-J infection. It is of significance to confirm the roles of SOCS3 in ALV-J infection and study how this gene affects ALV-J infection. In this study, we assessed the expression of the SOCS3 gene in vivo and in vitro, and investigated the roles of SOCS3 in ALV-J infection using overexpressed or interfered assays with the SOCS3 in DF-1 cells. The results showed that the SOCS3 expression of ALV-J infected chickens was different from uninfected chickens in the spleen, thymus and cecal tonsil. Further, SOCS3 is mainly expressed in the nucleus as determined by immunofluorescence assay. Overexpression of SOCS3 in DF-1 cells promoted the replication of ALV-J virus, and the expression of interferons (IFN and INF), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF) along with interferon-stimulating genes (CH25H, MX1, OASL, and ZAP). Conversely, interference of SOCS3 showed the opposite results. We also observed that SOCS3 promoted ALV-J virus replication by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation. In conclusion, SOCS3 promotes ALV-J replication via inhibiting the phosphorylation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These results would advance further understanding of the persistent infection and the viral immune evasion of the ALV-J virus.","output":"SOCS3 Promotes ALV-J Virus Replication via Inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 Phosphorylation During Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe postsurgical pain in posterior spinal fusion is common. Multimodality analgesia, including opioid-based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), is commonly used, but opioid-related adverse events such as nausea and vomiting are sometimes a problem. We used a ropivacaine-epinephrine-dexamethasone mixture given as one-time local bilateral submyofascial injections at the operated levels added to conventional multimodality analgesia including PCA for postoperative pain control in one group of patients to confirm whether administration of this mixture reduced postoperative pain and opioid use status post posterior spinal fusion. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 67 consecutive patients who had undergone posterior fusion surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), 35 of whom were treated with conventional analgesia that consisted mainly of PCA (control group) and 32 of whom were treated with one-time submyofascial injections of a ropivacaine-epinephrine-dexamethasone mixture (submyofascial injection group) added to conventional multimodality analgesia. We compared postsurgical pain levels and the amount of opioid use over the first 48 h after surgery, as well as physical activity levels and adverse events 2 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Postsurgical pain quantified by a numeric rating scale (1-10) in the submyofascial injection group was significantly lower than that in the control group. The amount of fentanyl use was significantly less in the submyofascial injection group at 24 h, 48 h, and all subsequent periods after surgery. In addition, Walking Recovery Time (WRT) defined as the number of days until the first event of ambulation was significantly less in the submyofascial injection group (3.3 d vs 4.1 d, P = 0.0007)). Laxative use was significantly less in the submyofascial injection group (0.3 times vs 1.3 times, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: One-time submyofascial injections at the operated levels with a ropivacaine-epinephrine-dexamethasone mixture after spinal fusion surgery reduced pain, opioid consumption, and opioid-related adverse events.

Mobile health promises to improve the reach of a limited pool of palliative care specialists through interprofessional, community-based care coordination. This work assessed the effectiveness of a smartphone- or Web-based app, mPalliative Care Link (mPCL), to extend specialist access via shared data and communication with local health workers. Central to mPCL is the African Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS), adapted for automated mobile symptom assessment and response. METHODS: Adult patients with incurable cancer were randomly assigned at hospital discharge to mPCL versus phone-contact POS collection. Sociodemographic, clinical, and POS data were obtained at baseline. Twice-weekly POS responses were collected and managed via mPCL or phone contact with clinician study personnel for up to 4 months, on the basis of study arm assignment. Patient end-of-study care satisfaction was assessed via phone survey. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients per arm participated. Comparison of baseline characteristics showed an insignificant trend toward more women (P = .07) and higher discharge morphine use (P = .09) in the mPCL group compared with phone-contact and significant between-group differences in cancer types (P = .003). Proportions of deaths were near equal between groups (mPCL: 27%; phone-contact: 29%). Overall symptom severity was significantly lower in the phone-contact group (P < .0001), and symptom severity decreased over time in both groups (P = .0001); however, between-group change in overall symptoms over time did not vary significantly (P = .34). Care satisfaction was generally high in both groups. CONCLUSION: Higher symptom severity scores in the mPCL arm likely reflect between-group sociodemographic and clinical differences and clinical support of phone-contact arm participants. Similar rates of care satisfaction in both groups suggest that mPCL may support symptom-focused care coordination in a more efficient and scalable manner than phone contact. A broader study of mPCL's cost efficiency and utility in Tanzania is needed.","output":"mPalliative Care Link: Examination of a Mobile Solution to Palliative Care Coordination Among Tanzanian Patients With Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapies used to tide over acute crisis of COVID-19 infection may lower the immunity, which can lead to secondary infection or a reactivation of latent infection.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. ObjectivesHere, we assess whether alveolar epithelial cell necrosis and subsequent releases of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) at an early disease stage aggravate ARDS with COVID-19 MethodsIn patients with COVID-19 with and without ARDS and healthy adults, serum levels of the following were quantified: an epithelial total cell death marker, cytokeratin18-M65; an epithelial apoptosis marker, CK18-M30; HMGB-1; and alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury markers, sRAGE, angiopoietin-2, and surfactant protein-D. Molecular mechanisms of alveolar epithelial cell death and effects of HMGB-1 neutralization on alveolar tissue injury were assessed using a mouse model of COVID-19-induced ARDS. Measurements and main resultsThe levels of CK18-M65, CK18-M30, and alveolar tissue injury markers were elevated in early stages of ARDS. The median M30/M65 ratio, an epithelial apoptosis indicator, was 31.50% in patients with ARDS, a value significantly lower than that of non-ARDS patients or healthy subjects. Serum levels of HMGB-1, one of DAMPs released from necrotic cells, were also significantly elevated in ARDS versus non-ARDS patients. In a COVID-19-induced ARDS mouse model, alveolar epithelial cell necrosis involved two forms of programmed necrosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis. Finally, neutralization of HMGB-1 attenuated alveolar tissue injury in the mouse model. ConclusionsNecrosis, including necroptosis and pyroptosis, seems to be the primary form of alveolar epithelial cell death, and subsequent release of DAMPs is a potential driver of COVID-19-induced ARDS. The impact of this researchAlveolar tissue injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with COVID-19 is aggravated by hyperinflammatory responses even after passing the peak of viral load. Our analysis of serum samples from COVID-19 patients and an animal model revealed that alveolar epithelial necrosis, including necroptosis and pyroptosis, occurs at the early disease stage of COVID-19-induced ARDS. Moreover, our data indicated that damage-associated molecular patterns released from necrotic alveolar epithelial cells are promising therapeutic targets to prevent the COVID-19 aggravation.","output":"Early Alveolar Epithelial Cell Necrosis is a Potential Driver of ARDS with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two population-based surveys on coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19)-like symptoms were conducted by BVA-Doxa on representative samples of the general population from Italy and its largest region, Lombardy, with over 10 million inhabitants and heavily struck by Covid-19, on 27-30 March and 3-7 April, on a total of 2000 individuals - 353 from Lombardy.

Arranging transportation could spike the number of COVID-19 infected cases. Hence, this paper investigates the potential surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infection and assesses the train and bus fleet size required for the repatriating migrant workers. The expected to repatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011 census data and comparing it with the information reported in the news media. A modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 patients in India's selected states with high outflux of migrants. The developed model considered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of migrant workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the origin of the trip dependent symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily arrival rate of migrant workers for states with very high outflux of migrants (i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in confirmed and active cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days needed to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence, travel arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, about 50,000 per day to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 20,000 per day to Maharashtra and less than 20,000 per day to other states of India was recommended.","output":"Implication of Repatriating Migrant Workers on COVID-19 Spread and Transportation Requirements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical models of epidemiological systems enable investigation of and predictions about potential disease outbreaks.

In this review, we discuss the uncertainties resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, vertical transmission of the virus, and its effects on breastfeeding of the newborn. The problems of families and communities caring for mothers with COVID-19 and its impact on breastfeeding in newborns are discussed. The challenges posed by the pandemic have forced us to think and devise innovative solutions, including telemedicine help for antenatal counseling, breastfeeding education, and lactation support. Optimal utilization of resources and technology to find creative solutions at the individual and the community level will help in facilitating maternalCinfant bonding soon after birth. Appropriate health care policies to support pregnant and lactating mothers will go a long way in meeting healthy child development goals.","output":"Supporting Breastfeeding in 2021 and BeyondLessons from the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND. An immune correlate of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection is urgently needed. METHODS. We used an ongoing household cohort with an embedded transmission study that closely monitors participants regardless of symptom status. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure infections and seropositivity. Sequencing was performed to determine circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the protection associated with seropositivity resulting from prior infection, the anti-spike antibody titers needed for protection, and we compared the severity of first and second infections. RESULTS. In March 2021, 62.3% of the cohort was seropositive. After March 2021, gamma and delta variants predominated. Seropositivity was associated with 69.2% protection from any infection (95% CI: 60.7%?75.9%), with higher protection against moderate or severe infection (79.4%, 95% CI: 64.9%?87.9%). Anti-spike titers of 327 and 2,551 were associated with 50% and 80% protection from any infection; titers of 284 and 656 were sufficient for protection against moderate or severe disease. Second infections were less severe than first infections (Relative Risk (RR) of moderated or severe disease: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.38C0.98; RR of subclinical disease:1.9, 95% CI: 1.33C2.73). CONCLUSIONS. Prior infection-induced immunity is protective against infection when predominantly gamma and delta SARS-CoV-2 circulated. The protective antibody titers presented may be useful for vaccine policy and control measures. While second infections were somewhat less severe, they were not as mild as ideal. A strategy involving vaccination will be needed to ease the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"An immune correlate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of reinfections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been enormously disruptive and harmful to people around the world, but its impact on other illnesses and injuries has been more variable. To evaluate the ramification of infectious disease outbreaks on major traumatic injuries, we compared changes in the incidence of major trauma cases during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) period with COVID-19 in 2020. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the trauma registry of a major, tertiary-care teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Patients presenting with major traumatic injuries during the first six months of 2001-03 and 2018-20 were retrieved for analysis. Patient characteristics, injury mechanism, admitting service, and emergency department (ED)/hospital lengths of stay (LOS) were recorded. Raw and adjusted survival rates (using the modified Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS)) were recorded. RESULTS: The number of trauma cases fell dramatically during 2003 and 2020 compared with previous years. In both 2003 and 2020, the number of trauma registry patients fell by 49% in April (compared to the preceding reference years of 2001/02 and 2018/19, respectively). Patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were also different during the outbreak years. Comparing 2003 to 2020 relative to their respective reference baselines, the percentages of injuries that happened at home, patients without co-morbidities, and patients' mean age all increased in 2003 but decreased in 2020. Work-place injuries drastically dropped in 2003, but not in 2020. Average ED LOS dropped in 2003 by 36.4 min (95% CI 12.5, 60.3) but declined by only 14.5 min (95% CI -2.9, 32.1) in 2020. Both observed and expected 30-day mortality declined in 2020 vs. 2003 (observed 4.5% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.001, OR 0.352, 95% CI 0.187, 0.661) (expected 4.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.002, OR 0.358, 95% CI 0.188, 0.684). CONCLUSION: Major trauma cases dropped by half during both the peak of the 2003 SARS and 2020 COVID-19 pandemics in Hong Kong, suggesting a trend for future pandemic planning. If similar findings are seen at other trauma centers, proactive personnel and resource allocations away from trauma towards medical emergency systems may be more appropriate for future pandemics.","output":"The impact of SARS and COVID-19 on major trauma in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A significant role of intensive care unit (ICU) workforce is ongoing communication with and support for families of critically ill patients.

Here, analysis of publicly accessible transcriptomes was used to expand our understanding of crustacean ALPs. Specifically, transcriptome mining was used to investigate the phylogenetic/structural conservation, tissue localization, and putative functions of ALPs in decapod species. Transcripts encoding putative ALP precursors were identified from one or more members of the Penaeoidea (penaeid shrimp), Sergestoidea (sergestid shrimps), Caridea (caridean shrimp), Astacidea (clawed lobsters and freshwater crayfish), Achelata (spiny/slipper lobsters), and Brachyura (true crabs), suggesting a broad, and perhaps ubiquitous, conservation of ALPs in decapods. Comparison of the predicted mature structures of decapod ALPs revealed high levels of amino acid conservation, including eight identically conserved cysteine residues that presumably allow for the formation of four identically positioned disulfide bridges. All decapod ALPs are predicted to have amidated carboxyl-terminals. Two isoforms of ALP appear to be present in most decapod species, one 44 amino acids long and the other 42 amino acids in length, both likely generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. In carideans, a gene or terminal exon duplication appears to have occurred, with alternative splicing producing four ALPs, two 44 and two 42 amino acid isoforms. The identification of ALP precursor-encoding transcripts in nervous system-specific transcriptomes (e.g., Homarus americanus brain, eyestalk ganglia, and cardiac ganglion assemblies, finding confirmed using RT-PCR) suggests that members of this peptide family may serve as locally-released and/or hormonally-delivered neuromodulators in decapods. Their detection in testis- and hepatopancreas-specific transcriptomes suggests that members of the ALP family may also play roles in male reproduction and innate immunity/detoxification.","output":"Multiple transcriptome mining coupled with tissue specific molecular cloning and mass spectrometry provide insights into agatoxin-like peptide conservation in decapod crustaceans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telomerase-based therapeutic cancer vaccines (TCVs) have been under clinical investigation for the past two decades.

However, Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. METHODS: We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages Pangolin tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. RESULTS: We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries.

However, providing psychological support to reduce the long-term and severe consequences is essential. The present study aimed to determine the effect of supportive counseling on mother psychological reactions and mother-infant bonding following traumatic childbirth. This quasi experimental study was performed on 166 postpartum women with psychological birth trauma admitted to public hospitals in Arak, Iran. Postpartum bonding questionnaire was filled before hospital discharge. The women were randomly assigned into the intervention and control groups. The intervention group (n = 83) received individual supportive counseling for two in-person sessions before hospital discharge, and 10-15 days after delivery and a telephone consultation during 4-6 weeks after delivery. The data were collected using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and the postpartum bonding questionnaire, after 2 months. The data were analyzed using SPSS21 software and chi-square, t-test, and ANCOVA were used. The mean score of postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (MD: -13.40, 95% CI: -10.66 to -16.15, P < 0.001). The severity of the PTSD symptoms in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (MD: -6.37, 95% CI: -3.55 to -9.18, P = 0.04). The mean (SD) of mother-infant bonding after controlling the effect of baseline score indicated a significant difference between the two groups (MD: -7.82, 95% CI: -6.53 to -9.11, P < 0.001). The supportive counseling seems to be effective in reducing PPD and PTSD symptoms, and improving postpartum bonding after traumatic childbirth. The use of group supportive counseling with other time intervals and long follow-up period is recommended. Further, other intervention approaches should be used for preventing the progression of psychological birth trauma toward PTSD.","output":"The Effect of Supportive Counseling on Mother Psychological Reactions and Mother-Infant Bonding Following Traumatic Childbirth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the original publication of the article, the \\"Keywords\\" and Fig. 7 were published incorrectly.","output":"Correction to: Distance measurements and origin levels of the coeliac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery by multiple-detector computed tomography angiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) may reduce muscle injury and related inflammation.

DESIGN A prospective, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. SETTING Tertiary, university hospital, single centre. PATIENTS Eighty-two patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS Moderate (Mod) and deep (Deep) NMB groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The changes in inflammatory cytokines were measured. The incidence of POD was evaluated by using confusion assessment method (CAM). The differences of postoperative bleeding and peri-operative oxygenation in both groups were also measured. RESULTS The NMB reversal duration was significantly longer in the Mod NMB group than in the Deep NMB group. Changes in interleukin-6 were significantly smaller in the Deep NMB group than in the Mod NMB group (P < 0.001). The incidence of POD was not significantly different between groups (34 versus 17% in Mod and Deep NMB groups, respectively; P = 0.129). The amount of postoperative bleeding until postoperative day 2 was significantly greater in the Mod NMB group than in the Deep NMB group (P = 0.027).

Ultimately, this could potentially lead to unmet needs of individuals requiring mental health support. Methods. Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, descriptive timeseries was conducted using data from 1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020 across five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (n = 171,823) and appointments taking place (n = 865,902). Results. The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the 9 weeks after lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK. As referrals began to increase again, there was a relatively faster increase in referrals from Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups as well an increase in referrals from more densely populated areas. Despite a reduction in access, service providers adapted to infection control guidance by rapidly shifting to remote delivery of care. Interpretation. Services were able to rapidly adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced dramatically, potentially placing a future burden on service providers to treat a likely backlog of patients in addition to a possible excess of patients as the long-term consequences of the pandemic become more apparent.

The threats of new strains are concerning, as some of them are more infectious than the original one. A therapeutic against the disease is, therefore, of urgent need. Here, we use the DrugBank database to screen for potential inhibitors against the 3CLpro main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Instead of using the traditional approach of computational screening by docking, we developed a kernel ridge regressor (using a part of the docking data) to predict the binding energy of ligands. We used this model to screen the DrugBank database and shortlist two lead candidates (bromocriptine and avoralstat) for in vitro enzymatic study. Our results show that the 3CLpro enzyme activity in presence of 100 M concentration of bromocriptine and avoralstat is 9.9% and 15.9%, respectively. Remarkably, bromocriptine exhibited submicromolar IC50 of 130 nM (0.13 M). Avoralstat showed an IC50 of 2.16 M. Further, the interactions of both drugs with 3CLpro were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations of 100 ns. Results indicate that both ligands are stable in the binding pocket of the 3CLpro receptor. In addition, the MM-PBSA analysis revealed that bromocriptine (-29.37 kcal/mol) has a lower binding free energy compared to avoralstat (-6.91 kcal/mol). Further, hydrogen bond analysis also showed that bromocriptine interacts with the two catalytic residues, His41 and Cys145, more frequently than avoralstat.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The model proposed is an improvement to the SEIR model. In order to improve the basic understanding of disease spread and outcomes, four compartments included presymptomatic, asymptomatic, quarantine hospitalized and hospitalized. We have studied COVID-19 cases in the city of Mumbai. We first gather clinical details and fit it on death cases using the Lavenberg-Marquardt model to approximate the various parameters. The model uses logistic regression to calculate the basic reproduction number over time and the case fatality rate based on the age-category scenario of the city of Mumbai. Two types of case fatality rate are calculated by the model: one is CFR daily, and the other is total CFR. The total case fatality rate is 4.2, which is almost the same as the actual scenario. The proposed model predicts the approximate time when the disease is at its worst and the approximate time when death cases barely arise and determines how many hospital beds in the peak days of infection would be expected. The proposed model outperforms the classic ARX, SARIMAX and the ARIMA model. And It also outperforms the deep learning models LSTM and Seq2Seq model.

Disease management programs are hindered by the lack of infrastructure and resources for clinical sample collection, storage, and transport and a dearth of sensitive diagnostic methods that are inexpensive as well as accurate. Many diagnostic tests and tools have been developed for the parasitic NTDs, but the collection and storage of clinical samples for molecular and immunological diagnosis can be expensive due to storage, transport, and reagent costs, making these procedures untenable in most areas of endemicity. The application of membrane technology, which involves the use of specific membranes for either sample collection and storage or diagnostic procedures, can streamline this process, allowing for long-term sample storage at room temperature. Membrane technology can be used in serology-based diagnostic assays and for nucleic acid purification prior to molecular analysis. This facilitates the development of relatively simple and rapid procedures, although some of these methods, mainly due to costs, lack accessibility in low-socioeconomic regions of endemicity. New immunological procedures and nucleic acid storage, purification, and diagnostics protocols that are simple, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective must be developed as countries progress control efforts toward the elimination of the parasitic NTDs.","output":"Membrane Technology for Rapid Point-of-Care Diagnostics for Parasitic Neglected Tropical Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses and to prospectively evaluate the performance of the fast-track diagnostics (FTD) respiratory pathogens multiplex PCR assay shortly after the 2009/10 influenza pandemic.

Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States.

The validated 5C scale, that assesses 5 psychological antecedents of vaccination, could be effective in exploring COVID-19 VH. This study aimed to determine a statistically valid cutoff points for the 5C sub-scales among the Arab population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 446 subjects from 3 Arab countries (Egypt, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Jordan). Information regarding sociodemographics, clinical history, COVID-19 infection and vaccination history, and 5C scale were collected online. The 5C scores were analyzed to define the cutoff points using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and to verify the capability of the questionnaire to differentiate whether responders are hesitant or non-hesitant to accept vaccination. ROC curve analysis was conducted for previous vaccine administration as a response, with the predictors being the main 5 domains of the 5C questionnaire. The mean score of each sub-scale was compared with COVID-19 vaccine intake. RESULTS: The mean age of the studied population was 37  11, 42.9% were males, 44.8% from Egypt, 21.1% from Jordan, and 33.6% from the UAE.

Individual awards were categorised to compare amounts invested into different blast injuries, the scientific approaches taken and analysis of research investment into blast traumatic brain injury (TBI). RESULTS A total of 806 awards were identified into blast injury-related research globally, equating to US$902.1 million (m, 565.9m GBP). There was a general increase in year-on-year investment between 2003 and 2009 followed by a consistent decline in annual funding since 2010. Pre-clinical research received $671.3 m (74.4%) of investment. Brain-related injury research received $427.7 m (47.4%), orthopaedic injury $138.6 m (15.4%), eye injury $63.7 m (7.0%) and ear injury $60.5m (6.7%). Blast TBI research received a total investment of $384.3 m, representing 42.6% of all blast injury-related research. The U.S. Department of Defense funded $719.3 m (80%).

METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until May 31st, 2020, and accessed the available data on the role of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury in around 7-28% of patients, significantly increasing its associated complications and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more prone to develop acute cardiac injury as a result of COVID-19. The use of cardiac biomarkers may aid in differentiating the cardiac cause of dyspnea in patients with severe COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers may also aid in triaging, risk-stratification, clinical decision-making, and prognostication of patients with COVID-19. However, there are concerns that routine testing in all patients with COVID-19 irrespective of severity, may result in unnecessary downstream investigations which may be misleading. In this brief review, using an algorithmic approach, we have tried to rationalize the use of cardiac biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19. This approach is also likely to lessen the infection exposure risk to the cardiovascular team attending patients with severe COVID-19.

We applied Lean Six Sigma processes to optimize clinic workflow to reduce patient wait times and improve the patient experience. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: We implemented (1) pushing most extended wait times to the end of the workflow by rooming the patient directly and (2) using distractions during the waiting process by using educational videos and a timer for physician arrival in the patient exam room. We compared the patient wait times and subcomponents of Press Ganey scores as a surrogate for changes in patient experience and satisfaction from the preimplementation period (n = 277) to the 3-month (September 1, 2020, to November 30, 2020) postimplementation period (n = 218). RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in overall throughput time (38 vs 35 minutes) and wait before rooming (11 vs 8 minutes), and increased physician time with patients (15 vs 17 minutes) (P < .0001 for all). These results corresponded with a significant improvement in Press Ganey subcomponents of (1) waiting time in the exam room before being seen by the care provider, (2) degree to which you were informed about any delays, (3) wait time at clinic (from arriving to leaving), and (4) length of wait before going to an exam room (P < .001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Simple, inexpensive measures can improve patient engagement and provide a safe setting for patients for clinic visits in the wake of COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges to therapy service operations in DoPs, with infection control measures impacting opportunities for therapeutic and social engagement. A trauma-informed care (TIC) lens was used when adapting services in Tallaght University Hospital DoP in response to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: An interdisciplinary approach was taken to adapt therapy services during early stages of the pandemic. Changes were informed by TIC principles to minimise re-traumatisation while maintaining high-quality services. Changes included expansion of the therapeutic activity programme, changes to groups, addition of COVID-19-specific groups and increased awareness of communication support needs. Findings: The early response to the pandemic, combined with the focus on TIC, resulted in continued, effective therapy services and positive client feedback. With clients involvement in their care enhanced, Individual Care Planning goals were achieved through group interventions.

The traumatic events perceived as being most stressful for emergency nurses involve sudden death, children, and adolescents. Multicasualty, school-associated shooting events are, therefore, likely to affect emergency nurses, and recent reports indicate an increase in multicasualty, school-associated shootings. This research is necessary to learn of emergency nurses experiences of caring for patients from a school shooting event in an effort to benefit future preparedness, response, and recovery. This manuscript describes these experiences and provides opportunities for nurses, peers, and leaders to promote mental health and resilience among emergency nurses who may provide care to patients after such events. METHODS: A qualitative case series approach, a theory of secondary traumatic stress, and the compassion fatigue resilience model guided the research. The emergency nurses who provided care to patients who were injured during a 2018 multicasualty, school-associated shooting in the Southeastern United States were invited to participate. RESULTS: The themes identified by this research with 7 participants were preparation and preparedness, coping and support mechanisms, and reflections and closure. DISCUSSION: The results identified through this research may be translated to policies and practice to improve emergency nurses welfare, coping, resilience, and retention.

The objective of our study was to determine the impact of telemedicine on post-acute stroke clinic follow-up. Methods: With this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the impact of telemedicine in Emory Healthcare, an academic healthcare system of comprehensive (CSC) and primary stroke centers (PSC) in Atlanta, Georgia, on post-hospital stroke clinic follow-up. We compared the frequency of successful post-hospitalization follow-up in a centralized subspecialty stroke clinic among patients hospitalized before the local COVID-19 pandemic (January 1- February 28, 2020), during (March 1- April 30, 2020) and after telemedicine implementation (May 1- December 31, 2020). A comparison was made across network hospitals less than 1 mile (CSC) and 25 miles (PSC25) from the specialty stroke clinic. Results: Of the 553 ischemic stroke patients [median age 68 years (IQR 58-79), median NIHSS 4 (IQR 1-8)] discharged home or to a rehab facility during the study period, 241 (43.6%) had follow-up in the Emory Stroke Clinic (CSC=48%, PSC25=23%). Overall, 90-day follow-up increased from 31% before to 48% after telemedicine implementation. Similarly, telemedicine appointments increased from 19% to 72% of the follow-up visits. The increase in follow-up visits was modest among CSC patients, from 41% to 51% (p=0.16), relative to the increase among PSC25 patients (5.3% to 31%, p=0.002).

Some of its limitations may be weaker social connections and the possibility of privacy impingement; the commission of various crimes due to the virtual space and anonymity of the metaverse; and maladaptation to the real world for students whose identity has not been established. The metaverse is predicted to change our daily life and economy beyond the realm of games and entertainment. The metaverse has infinite potential as a new social communication space.

Websites of relevant organisations and other grey literature sources were searched to supplement the electronic database search. The characteristics and effect of the interventions were analysed. We also explored how the interventions were delivered and the elements of trauma-informed care that were described. RESULTS 28 studies were included. We identified four types of interventions: (1) trauma focused psychotherapies; (2) non-trauma psychotherapies; (3) housing interventions and (4) pharmacotherapies. The trauma-informed interventions were small case series and the non-trauma focused therapies included four randomised controlled trials, were generally ineffective.

As a result, individuals who are pregnant face unprecedented mental health challenges. Objectives We sought to determine the impact of the pandemic on perinatal depression and anxiety in a longitudinal pregnancy cohort. We hypothesized increased depression and anxiety scores in individuals during pregnancy and postpartum in the pandemic at all time points. Study Design Participants were enrolled in the Ontario Birth Study (OBS), a pregnancy cohort embedded in clinical care at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto. Perinatal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-2 (GAD-2) in early pregnancy while the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and GAD-2 were used in late pregnancy and postpartum. Logistic regression models were created to examine the association of the pandemic with clinically elevated mental health scores in pre-pandemic vs. during pandemic groups while adjusting for covariates. Results 1159 survey responses from 649 participants between March 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021, were used to conduct this study. Participants were assessed in early pregnancy (416), in late pregnancy (373), and postpartum (370). Responses received on or prior to February 29, 2020, were considered the pre-pandemic group, while responses after were considered the pandemic group. Mean rank scores of depression and anxiety were significantly higher in the pandemic group (p=0.02, p=0.003) in the postpartum period. There was no significant association between pandemic time and antenatal scores. However, postnatally, mothers were 2.6 times more likely to score 13 or above on the EPDS during the pandemic than pre-pandemic (95% CI= 1.2-5.7, p=0.02). Adjustment for ethnicity and income strengthened this association as the odds ratio increased to 3.3 (95% CI= 1.4-8.0, p=0.007).

We undertook prospective serosurveillance in a large cohort of healthy adults from the start of the epidemic in England. METHODS: Clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers were recruited across three English regions and tested monthly from March to November 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and nucleoprotein (N) antibodies using five different immunoassays. In positive individuals, antibody responses and long-term trends were modelled using mixed effects regression. FINDINGS: In total, 2246 individuals attended 12,247 visits and 264 were seropositive in 2 assays. Most seroconversions occurred between March and April 2020. The assays showed >85% agreement for ever-positivity, although this changed markedly over time. Antibodies were detected earlier with Abbott (N) but declined rapidly thereafter. With the EuroImmun (S) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) assays, responses increased for 4 weeks then fell until week 12-16 before stabilising. For Roche (N), responses increased until 8 weeks, stabilised, then declined, but most remained above the positive threshold. For Roche (S), responses continued to climb over the full 24 weeks, with no sero-reversions. Predicted proportions sero-reverting after 52 weeks were 100% for Abbott, 59% (95% credible interval 50-68%) Euroimmun, 41% (30-52%) RBD, 10% (8-14%) Roche (N) <2% Roche (S).

Patients with long COVID asked for rehabilitation. Many of them, including previously healthy and fit clinicians, tried to fight postviral fatigue with exercise-based rehabilitation. We observed a growing number of patients with long COVID who experienced adverse effects from exercise therapy and symptoms strikingly similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Community-based physical therapists, including those in private practice, unaware of safety issues, are preparing to help an influx of patients with long COVID. In this editorial, we expose growing concerns about long COVID and ME. We issue safety recommendations for rehabilitation and share resources to improve care for those with postviral illnesses.

Smart walkers are a particular type of these devices since they integrate navigation systems, path-following algorithms, and user interaction modules to ensure natural and intuitive interaction. Although these functionalities are often implemented in rehabilitation scenarios, there is a need to actively involve the healthcare professionals in the interaction loop while guaranteeing safety for them and patients. This work presents the validation of two visual feedback strategies for the teleoperation of a simulated robotic walker during an assisted navigation task. For this purpose, a group of 14 clinicians from the rehabilitation area formed the validation group. A simple path-following task was proposed, and the feedback strategies were assessed through the kinematic estimation error (KTE) and a usability survey. A KTE of 0.28 m was obtained for the feedback strategy on the joystick. Additionally, significant differences were found through a MannCWhitneyCWilcoxon test for the perception of behavior and confidence towards the joystick according to the modes of interaction (p-values of 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). The use of visual feedback with this tool contributes to research areas such as remote management of therapies and monitoring rehabilitation of peoples mobility.","output":"Semi-Remote Gait Assistance Interface: A Joystick with Visual Feedback Capabilities for Therapists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

To identify the key parameters or processes that have the greatest effects on the pandemic and reveal the different progressions of epidemics in different countries, we quantified enhanced control measures and the dynamics of the production and provision of medical resources. We then nested these within a COVID-19 epidemic transmission model, which is parameterized by multi-source data. We obtained rate functions related to the intensity of mitigation measures, the effective reproduction numbers and the timings and durations of runs on medical resources, given differing control measures implemented in various countries. Increased detection rates may induce runs on medical resources and prolong their durations, depending on resource availability. Nevertheless, improving the detection rate can effectively and rapidly reduce the mortality rate, even after runs on medical resources. Combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies and timely improvement of abilities to supplement medical resources are key to effective control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A 50% reduction in comprehensive control measures would have led to the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths exceeding 590000 and 60000, respectively, by 27 March 2020 in mainland China. The proposed model can assist health authorities to predict when they will be most in need of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators, personal protection equipment, drugs and staff.","output":"Effects of medical resource capacities and intensities of public mitigation measures on outcomes of COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 through natural infection and vaccination generally have reduced effectiveness to SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We delineate the structural basis of this relatively escape-resistant epitope that extends from one end of the receptor binding site (RBS) into the highly conserved CR3022 site. ADG20 can then benefit from high potency through direct competition with ACE2 in the more variable RBS and interaction with the more highly conserved CR3022 site. Importantly, antibodies that are able to target this site generally neutralize all VOCs, albeit with reduced potency against Omicron. Thus, this highly conserved and vulnerable site can be exploited for design of universal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.","output":"A broad and potent neutralization epitope in SARS-related coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improving evidence for action is crucial to tackle antimicrobial resistance.

Aim: Assessment of the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the rate of diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in Poland, along with an analysis of the incidence and course of COVID-19 among patients (pts) diagnosed with PH, treated under the National Health Fund program, registered in the national BNP-PL database. Methods: The records of the complete population of Polish pts treated under the National Drug Program of PH (PAH and CTEPH), registered in the national database of BNP-PL, updated on an ongoing basis by all PH centers, were analyzed. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the clinical severity of their course and the mortality were reviewed, taking into account the specific therapies used. The basic clinical characteristics of the group of sick and deceased patients were compared to the remaining patients registered in the BNP-PL database. The rate of increase of new diagnoses ended with inclusion in the Drug Program between March and December 2020, compared to the corresponding periods of the previous year, and the change in the treatment profile were compared. Results: The analysis included 1704 pts (PAH 1134, CTEPH 570). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 3.8% (n=65), including PAH 2.7% (n=46) and CTEPH 3,2% (n=18). 32 patients (49%) required hospitalization. Mortality rate was 28% (18/65) - including 7/18 outside of hospital. Those who died due to COVID-19 were older (mean age 68.4l15.8 vs. 50.8l18.8 yrs;p<0,001), had higher WHO class and more cardiovascular comorbidities (4l2,06 vs. 2,66l1,8;p=0,01) (Table 1). During the pandemic the number of new diagnoses of PH markedly decreased compared to the corresponding period in 2019 (total 150 vs. 203, PAH 90 vs. 123, CTEPH 60 vs. 80, respectively). A significant increase in total mortality was also observed in the PH group (9,72 vs. 5,85%). Moreover, escalation of specific PH therapy decreased significantly (14,7% vs. 21,6%). Incidence of COVID-19 study group was lower than estimated for general Polish adult population (3,8% vs. 6,5%). Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic deeply influenced the diagnostic and therapeutic process of pulmonary hypertension by reducing the number of new diagnoses, escalation therapy and increased overall mortality in this population. This may be due in part to the conversion of some PAH centers into hospitals treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as to patients' fear of admitting to hospital despite clinical deterioration. Pulmonary hypertension is linked to markedly increased mortality in COVID-19, similarly for PAH and CTEPH. Intriguing finding of lower infection rate may be linked to protective lifestyle or specific therapies.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemics upon pulmonary hypertension patients: insights from BNP-PL national database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) encoded secreted antigen 85 enzymes (Ag85A/Ag85B/Ag85C) play that critical roles in the virulence, survival and drug-resistant TB of the pathogen. Ag85 proteins are potential antitubercular drug targets because they are essential in the catalytic synthesis of trehalose moieties and mycolic acid attachment to the Mtb cell wall. Recently, experimental protocols led to the discovery of a selective covalent Ag85 inhibitor, -isomer monocyclic enolphosphorus Cycliphostin (CyC8) compound, which targets the Ag85 serine 124 to exhibit a promising therapeutic activity. For the first time, our study unravelled the structural features among Mtb Ag85C homologs and motions and dynamics of Ag85C when the CyC8 bound covalently and in open model conformations to the protein using bioinformatics tools and integrated Molecular dynamics simulations. Comparative Ag85C sequence analysis revealed conserved regions; 70% active site, 90% Adeniyi loop L1 and 50% loop L2, which acts as a switch between open and closed conformations. The average C- atoms RMSD (2.05 ?) and RMSF (0.9 ?) revealed instability and high induced flexibility in the CyC8 covalent-bound compared to the apo and open model systems, which displayed more stability and lower fluctuations. DSSP showed structural transitions of -helices to bend and loops to 310-helices in the bound systems. SASA of CyC8 covalent bound showed active site hydrophobic residues exposure to huge solvent.

Vaccination rates were analyzed also in the corresponding pediatric population.Almost 27% of participants declared they were in favor of vaccinations, and in fact real life vaccination rates in children exceeded the national mean. Only 26.5% of respondents declared they would receive COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine refusal was attributed to safety concerns in 76% of parents. Specific vaccine attributes further reduced the acceptance rate. Female gender, younger age and lower education level were associated with non-adherence to vaccination. Among extrinsic factors of COVID-19 vaccination, only information from National Health Authorities was significantly associated to vaccine acceptance.The rate of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was very poor in our population of parents.

Despite this expanded scope of practice, only 11% of the pharmacies reported furnishing hormonal contraception over the following 6 years. OBJECTIVES: Our study objectives were to determine the extent of hormonal contraceptive furnishing and identify the factors that led to successful implementation in San Francisco community pharmacies. METHODS: Backspace we conducted a cross-sectional survey to identify community pharmacies furnishing hormonal contraception in San Francisco. Interviews were coded inductively to identify consistent themes. Semistructured interviews with pharmacists at the locations that furnished contraception identified the factors that had led to successful implementation in local community pharmacies, as well as assessing changes in practice during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. RESULTS: San Francisco had 113 operational community pharmacies in April 2020. Of these, 21 locations reported that they furnished hormonal contraception (19%), and we interviewed pharmacists at 12 of those locations. We identified 3 key factors that drove implementation at the pharmacy level: administrative support, advertising, and pharmacist engagement. Additional drivers of implementation involved the nature of the community. The respondents also reported on barriers that continued to slow adoption, including consultation fees, time constraints, and patient privacy. Changes in demand for services owing to COVID-19 risks were inconsistent.

In addition, the adjuvant effect and thermostability of the particles has not been evaluated. RESULTS: In the present study we demonstrate the use of a system developed to generate nano and microparticles carrying as a fusion protein peptides or proteins of interest to be used as vaccines. These particles are purified easily by centrifugation. Immunization of animals with the particles in the absence of adjuvant result in a robust and long-lasting immune response. Proteins contained inside the particles are maintained for over 1 year at ambient temperature, preserving their immunological properties. CONCLUSION: The rapid and efficient production of the particles in addition to the robust immune response they generate position this system as an excellent method for the rapid response against emerging diseases.

The centromere is a crucial region of eukaryotic chromosomes responsible for the accurate segregation of genetic material. The typical landmark of centromere chromatin is the rapidly-evolving variant of the histone H3, CenH3, while DNA sequences packed in constitutive heterochromatin are associated with H3K9me3-modified histones.

In order to investigate the DNA composition of genomic regions associated with the two specific chromatin types, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing of the Cg-CenH3- and H3K9me3-associated sequences. CenH3-associated sequences were assigned to six groups of repetitive elements, while H3K9me3-associated-ones were assigned only to three. Those associated with CenH3 indicate the lack of uniformity in the chromosomal distribution of sequences building the centromeres, being also in the same time dispersed throughout the genome.

AIM: We aimed to examine the effects of social distancing, loneliness, difficulties in emotion regulation, and self-regulation on participants self-reported coping using sex during lockdown in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Participants had to be residents of the United Kingdom, aged between 18-60 years, fluent in English, and had to have an Internet connection. They were instructed not to participate if they had consumed alcohol in the previous 24 hours. A total of 789 participants aged 18-59 years completed an online survey. Participants provided self-report measures of social distancing, loneliness, and difficulties in emotion regulation. A Go/No-Go task was used to assess self-regulation. OUTCOMES: Participants self-reported their use of sex to cope over a 14-day period during lockdown, as well as retrospectively for a 14-day period immediately preceding lockdown. Coping using sex items included consensual and non-consensual themes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no increase in coping using sex during lockdown compared with before lockdown. Findings showed that 30% of participants reported increased coping using sex during lockdown compared with before, 29% reported decreased coping using sex, and 41% reported no change. All regression models included age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis of psychiatric condition, level of education, being at high-risk for difficulties relating to COVID-19, living alone, and diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 as covariates. Being younger, being male, and greater emotion dysregulation were associated with higher coping using sex total and consent subscale scores during lockdown. Being younger, being male, not living alone, and less adherence to social distancing advice were associated with coping using sex with a theme of rape/violence during lockdown. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: A proportion of participants used sex to cope more often during lockdown compared with before. Less adherence to social distancing advice and emotion dysregulation were associated with using sex to cope during lockdown. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths of this study were the large sample size and inclusion of key sociodemographic characteristics as covariates. The main limitations were the cross-sectional design and a sample that was mostly white, educated, and female. CONCLUSION: Participants who had difficulty regulating emotions were more likely to use sex to cope. It is important that support is available for people who have problems regulating their emotions during the pandemic and that they have access to appropriate help and advice.

A previous study demonstrated a high sensitivity of a phocid, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), in discriminating time intervals. In the present study, we compared the harbour seal's timing abilities with the timing abilities of an otariid, the South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus). This comparison seemed essential as phocids and otariids differ in many respects and might, thus, also differ regarding their timing abilities. We determined time difference thresholds for sub- and suprasecond time intervals marked by a white circle on a black background displayed for a specific time interval on a monitor using a staircase method. Contrary to our expectation, the timing abilities of the fur seal and the harbour seal were comparable. Over a broad range of time intervals, 0.8-7 s in the fur seal and 0.8-30 s in the harbour seal, the difference thresholds followed Weber's law. In this range, both animals could discriminate time intervals differing only by 12 % and 14 % on average. Timing might, thus be a fundamental cue for pinnipeds in general to be used in various contexts, thereby complementing information provided by classical sensory systems. Future studies will help to clarify if timing is indeed involved in foraging decisions or the estimation of travel speed or distance.","output":"Visual timing abilities of a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) and a South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) for sub- and supra-second time intervals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of Cryptosporidium can occur via contaminated food or water, contact with animals or other people. Exposures are often identified from outbreak investigations, but sources for sporadic disease and pathways to infection are still unclear. The aim of this review is to consolidate the literature to describe exposures associated with human cryptosporidiosis in industrialised countries. Methods followed the recommendations made in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Three steps were used to identify the literature including electronic database searching using PubMed, Scopus and Web Of Science; reference list trawling; and an exploration of the grey literature. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Screening of results was undertaken by two reviewers and data extracted using a standardised form. A narrative summary presented. Papers were included if they reported on sporadic cases and were published between 2008 and 2018. Exposures were grouped into pathways. After full-text screening, eight articles (comprising 11 studies) were included, and seven (comprising 10 studies) were suitable for further synthesis. None of the identified grey literature was included. Four studies described case-control methods, two were case-case studies and one cross-sectional. Study year ranged from 1999 to 2017 and the studies were conducted in five, large countries in three continents: Europe (UK and the Netherlands), North America (USA, Canada), and Australia. Included papers investigated water and animal exposures most frequently. Recreational water was not a major source of sporadic illness in this review. The person-to-person pathway represented the most consistent finding, with all three studies reporting on contact with a symptomatic individual demonstrating correlations between exposure and disease. This applied particularly to the home environment, which is increasingly understood to be a significant setting for spread of Cryptosporidium infection. Further work on this would help support public health messaging on preventing spread of disease at home.","output":"Exposures associated with sporadic Cryptosporidium infection in industrialised countries: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As a very serious city outside HubeProvince, China, Wenzhou had a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19, but clinical characteristics of critic","output":"Clinical Characteristics of Critically Ill Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infected Pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wenzhou, China: A Retrospective, Single-Center, Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibromyalgia can be defined as a chronic pain condition, affecting the musculoskeletal system, etiology and pathophysiology of which is sufficiently understudied.

Here, we show that in C. elegans, inherited small RNAs control genetic variation by regulating the crucial decision of whether to self-fertilize or outcross. We found that under stressful temperatures, younger hermaphrodites secrete a male-attracting pheromone. Attractiveness transmits transgenerationally to unstressed progeny via heritable small RNAs and the Argonaute Heritable RNAi Deficient-1 (HRDE-1). We identified an endogenous small interfering RNA pathway, enriched in endo-siRNAs that target sperm genes, that transgenerationally regulates sexual attraction, male prevalence, and outcrossing rates. Multigenerational mating competition experiments and mathematical simulations revealed that over generations, animals that inherit attractiveness mate more and their alleles spread in the population.

However, the incidences of NMAEs remain unclear. We aimed to calculate the pooled event rate of NMAEs after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials on the incidences of NMAEs after COVID-19 vaccination was conducted. The PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched from inception to 2 June 2021. Two independent reviewers selected the study and extracted the data. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearsons chi-square test. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and generated with random or fixed effects models. The protocol of the present study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021240450). Results: In 15 phase 1/2 trials, NMAEs occurred in 29.2% vs. 21.6% (p < 0.001) vaccinated participants and controls. Headache and myalgia accounted for 98.2% and 97.7%, and their incidences were 16.4% vs. 13.9% (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.28C3.06, p = 0.002) and 16.0% vs. 7.9% (OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 2.05C5.35, p < 0.001) in the vaccine and control groups, respectively.

In four open-label trials, the incidences of headache, myalgia, and unsolicited NMAEs were 38.7%, 27.4%, and 1.5%. Following vaccination in phase 3 trials, headache and myalgia were still common with a rate of 29.5% and 19.2%, although the unsolicited NMAEs with incidence rates of  0.7% were not different from the control group in each study. Conclusions: Following the vaccination, NMAEs are common of which headache and myalgia comprised a considerable measure, although life-threatening unsolicited events are rare. NMAEs should be continuously monitored during the ongoing global COVID-19 vaccination program.","output":"Nervous and Muscular Adverse Events after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2012 and 2013, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) undertook fact\\\\finding visits to several Asian countries, with a view to developing advice for small companion animal practitioners in Asia related to the administration of vaccines to dogs and cats. The VGG met with numerous first opinion practitioners, small animal association leaders, academic veterinarians, government regulators and industry representatives and gathered further information from a survey of almost 700 veterinarians in India, China, Japan and Thailand. Although there were substantial differences in the nature and magnitude of the challenges faced by veterinarians in each country, and also differences in the resources available to meet those challenges, overall, the VGG identified insufficient undergraduate and postgraduate training in small companion animal microbiology, immunology and vaccinology. In most of the countries, there has been little academic research into small animal infectious diseases. This, coupled with insufficient laboratory diagnostic support, has limited the growth of knowledge concerning the prevalence and circulating strains of key infectious agents in most of the countries visited. Asian practitioners continue to recognise clinical infections that are now considered uncommon or rare in western countries. In particular, canine rabies virus infection poses a continuing threat to animal and human health in this region. Both nationally manufactured and international dog and cat vaccines are variably available in the Asian countries, but the product ranges are small and dominated by multi\\\\component vaccines with a licensed duration of immunity (DOI) of only 1 year, or no description of DOI. Asian practitioners are largely unaware of current global trends in small animal vaccinology or of the WSAVA vaccination guidelines. Consequently, most practitioners continue to deliver annual revaccination with both core and non\\\\core vaccines to adult animals, with little understanding that herd immunity is more important than frequent revaccination of individual animals within the population. In this paper, the VGG presents the findings of this project and makes key recommendations for the Asian countries. The VGG recommends that (1) Asian veterinary schools review and increase as needed the amount of instruction in small animal vaccinology within their undergraduate curriculum and increase the availability of pertinent postgraduate education for practitioners; (2) national small animal veterinary associations, industry veterinarians and academic experts work together to improve the scientific evidence base concerning small animal infectious diseases and vaccination in their countries; (3) national small animal veterinary associations take leadership in providing advice to practitioners based on improved local knowledge and global vaccination guidelines; (4) licensing authorities use this enhanced evidence base to inform and support the registration of improved vaccine product ranges for use in their countries, ideally with DOI for core vaccines similar or equal to those of equivalent products available in western countries (i.e. 3 or 4 years). The VGG also endorses the efforts made by Asian governments, non\\\\governmental organisations and veterinary practitioners in working towards the goal of global elimination of canine rabies virus infection. In this paper, the VGG offers both a current pragmatic and future aspirational approach to small animal vaccination in Asia. As part of this project, the VGG delivered continuing education to over 800 Asian practitioners at seven events in four countries. Accompanying this document is a list of 80 frequently asked questions (with answers) that arose during these discussions. The VGG believes that this information will be of particular value to Asian veterinarians as they move towards implementing global trends in small companion animal vaccinology.","output":"Recommendations on vaccination for Asian small animal practitioners: a report of the WSAVA Vaccination Guidelines Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though the previous Gaming the Match agreement offered guidance to programs on how best to approach the Match process, guidance for applicants remains inconsistent.

The aim of this longitudinal cohort study was to describe the practice of AITT and caregiver satisfaction in a primarily Western setting during the first year of life. METHODS Families who started AITT before 4 months of age were recruited. Standardized interviews of caregivers were conducted at 1- to 2-month intervals. To identify trends over time, data were fitted to a linear mixed-effect model. Data were analyzed according to five 2-month blocks, starting at 3 to 4 months. RESULTS Of 85 participating families, 87 children started AITT at a mean age of 2.5 months. At all age intervals, 88% to 94% of caregivers could identify elimination signals. Toileting attempts decreased from 10/day at 3 to 4 months to 7/day at 11 to 12 months (p < 0.001). Many families (45%-53%) practiced AITT on a part-time basis. Daytime dryness was noted in 12% to 14% of infants throughout the first year. Although more than 63% of families used cloth or disposable diapers throughout this study, use of trainers and underwear increased significantly by 2- to 3-fold (p < 0.01 for both). Caregiver satisfaction was high overall. Although negatively associated with potty refusal, it was positively associated with daytime and nighttime dryness, perceived elimination signals, and a better understanding of their infant's needs (p < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that AITT is a worthy viable alternative to the use of diapers even in Western settings.

In this regard, a number of assays have been developed based on its cleavage sequence preferences to monitor its activity. These include the usage of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based substrates in vitro and a FlipGFP reporter, one which fluoresces after Mpro-mediated cleavage, in live cells. Here, we have engineered a pair of genetically encoded, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based sensors for detecting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro proteolytic activity in living host cells as well as in vitro assays. The sensors were generated by sandwiching Mpro N-terminal autocleavage sites, either AVLQSGFR (short) or KTSAVLQSGFRKME (long), in between the mNeonGreen and nanoLuc proteins. Co-expression of the sensor with the Mpro in live cells resulted in its cleavage in a dose- and time-dependent manner while mutation of the critical C145 residue (C145A) in Mpro completely abrogated the sensor cleavage. Importantly, the BRET-based sensors displayed increased sensitivities and specificities as compared to the recently developed FlipGFP-based Mpro sensor. Additionally, the sensors recapitulated the inhibition of Mpro by the well-characterized pharmacological agent GC376. Further, in vitro assays with the BRET-based Mpro sensors revealed a molecular crowding-mediated increase in the rate of Mpro activity and a decrease in the inhibitory potential of GC376.

MAJOR OUTCOMES: Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient. RESULTS: A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolate was shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European culture collections.

Nevertheless, bacteria continue to evolve new mechanisms to evade this drug-mediated killing with surprising speed on the deployment of each new drug and antibiotic worldwide, a phenomenon called antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Nowadays, AMR represents a critical health threat, for which new medical interventions are urgently needed. By 2050, it is estimated that the leading cause of death will be through untreatable AMR pathogens. Although antibiotics remain a first-line treatment, non-antibiotic therapies such as prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are increasingly interesting alternatives to limit the spread of such antibiotic resistant microorganisms. For the discovery of new vaccines and mAbs, the search for effective antigens that are able to raise protective immune responses is a challenging undertaking. In this context, outer membrane vesicles (OMV) represent a promising approach, as they recapitulate the complete antigen repertoire that occurs on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. In this review, we present Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as specific examples of key AMR threats caused by Gram-negative bacteria and we discuss the current status of mAbs and vaccine approaches under development as well as how knowledge on OMV could benefit antigen discovery strategies.","output":"Strategies to Tackle Antimicrobial Resistance: The Example of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comorbid diabetes and depression constitutes a major health problem, worsening associated cardiovascular diseases.

Fluoxetine was administered the last 14 days (10 mg/kg/day; p.o). Bradycardia was obtained by vagal stimulation (3, 6 and 9 Hz) or i.v. acetylcholine administrations (1, 5 and 10 g/kg). Fluoxetine treatment diminished vagally-induced bradycardia. Administration of 5-HT originated a dual action on the bradycardia, augmenting it at low doses and diminishing it at high doses, reproduced by 5-CT (5-HT(1/7) agonist). 5-CT did not alter the bradycardia induced by exogenous acetylcholine. Decrease of the vagally-induced bradycardia evoked by high doses of 5-HT and 5-CT was reproduced by L-694,247 (5-HT(1D) agonist) and blocked by prior administration of LY310762 (5-HT(1D) antagonist). Enhancement of the electrical-induced bradycardia by 5-CT (10 g/kg) was abolished by pretreatment with SB269970 (5-HT(7) receptor antagonist). Thus, oral fluoxetine treatment originates a decrease in cardiac cholinergic activity and changes 5-HT modulation of bradycardic responses in diabetes: prejunctional 5-HT(7) receptors augment cholinergic-evoked bradycardic responses, whereas prejunctional 5-HT(1D) receptors inhibit vagally-induced bradycardia.","output":"Fluoxetine Treatment Decreases Cardiac Vagal Input and Alters the Serotonergic Modulation of the Parasympathetic Outflow in Diabetic Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies in pregnancy have not focused in evaluating the effect of walking during pregnancy and prevention of insomnia.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intention among Chinese nursing students. DESIGN: A cross-sectional online survey was used. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1070 Chinese nursing students participated in this study. METHODS: The study used structured self-administered questionnaires to assess the effects of the following elements; sociodemographic factors, vaccination status, beliefs on general vaccination, beliefs and attitudes towards COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and COVID-19 vaccination intention. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between these variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention. RESULTS: More than half (51.9%) of nursing students were willing to vaccinate against COVID-19, while 43.4% were uncertain and 4.7% were unwilling to get vaccinated. Increased likelihood of intention to get vaccinated was associated with positive beliefs towards general vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination, perceived less adverse effects following vaccination, the greater impact of COVID-19 on daily life, and less clinical practice experience in healthcare settings. Those hesitant to vaccinate raised concerns about the safety of vaccines, doubted the efficacy, believed that vaccination was unnecessary, or had insufficient information on COVID-19 vaccines.

RESULTS: Of the programs surveyed, 11 (31%) had official department or hospital-specific guidelines for mitigating care delays and determining which surgical cases could proceed. Seventeen (47%) programs left the decision to proceed with surgery to individual surgeon discretion. Five (14%) programs employed committee review, and 7 (19%) used chairman review systems to grant permission for surgery.

The rapid development of social media use and the ease of information exchange accelerated the spread of hoaxes. Even in the COVID-19 pandemic hoax news about the Coronavirus and matters related to it are widespread in the community. This hoax news both during the Election and the COVID-19 Outbreak caused much unrest in the community. Some of the hoax news spreaders were jailed for violations of the ITE Law. Various legal practitioners and academics have also suggested that hoax news creators and spreaders be criminalized. This article reviews normatively whether the criminalization of hoax news is feasible for reasons of maintaining stability or needs to be eliminated to maintain freedom of opinion. The author reviews the normative aspects of criminalizing the creation and dissemination of hoax news by using Habermas theory of deliberative democracy. Through this theory the writer finds that hoax news makes aspects of democracy such as dialogue that is full of awareness and accurate information unattainable. This is also in line with what the Indonesian constitution wants. However it is necessary to ensure that the criminalization of hoaxes is not used as an instrument of abuse of power considering that the circulation of hoaxes is a symptom of a problem rather than the root of the problem itself.

Artikel ini meninjau kembali secara normatif apakah kriminalisasi berita hoax ini layak dilakukan demi alasan menjaga stabilitas atau perlu dihapuskan untuk menjaga kebebasan berpendapat. Penulis meninjau aspek normatif kriminalisasi pembuatan dan penyebaran berita hoax tersebut dengan menggunakan teori demokrasi deliberatif Habermas. Melalui teori tersebut penulis menemukan bahwa berita hoax membuat aspek-aspek demokrasi seperti dialog yang penuh kesadaran dan informasi yang tepat tidak dapat tercapai. Hal ini pun selaras dengan apa yang dikehendaki oleh konstitusi Indonesia. Namun demikian, perlu dipastikan bahwa kriminalisasi hoax ini tidak dijadikan instrumen penyalahgunaan kekuasaan mengingat beredarnya hoax sendiri merupakan gejala dari suatu masalah ketimbang sebagai akar masalahnya itu sendiri.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with cerebrovascular injury, including both ischemia and hemorrhage. We aimed to compare brain MRI findings of COVID-19 associated ARDS with non-COVID-19 ARDS. Methods: A registry of patients with COVID-19 from March 2020 through July 2021 from a hospital network was reviewed. Patients who met criteria for ARDS by Berlin definition and underwent MRI during their hospitalization were included. These patients were matched 1:1 by age and sex with patients who underwent MRI from another registry of patients of ARDS in the same hospital between 2010 and 2018. Cerebrovascular injury was classified as either acute cerebral ischemia (ischemic infarct or hypoxic ischemic brain injury) or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). Results: Of 13,319 patients with COVID-19 infection, 26 patients had ARDS and MRI. Sixty-six of 678 non-COVID-19 ARDS patients had an MRI and were matched 1:1 by age and sex resulting in 23 matched pairs. The median age was 66 and 59% of patients were male. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS were more likely to have hypertension and chronic kidney disease but otherwise baseline medical characteristics were similar. ARDS severity as determined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio at ICU admission was similar between both groups. No difference was seen in the prevalence of cerebrovascular injury (52% vs 61%, p=0.8), cerebral ischemia (35% vs 43%, p=0.8), ICH (43% vs 48%, p=1.0), or CMBs (43% vs 39% p=1.0) on MRI between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts. However, two unique patterns of injury were seen only among COVID-19 patients: hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (3 patients, 12%) and bilateral cerebral peduncular ischemia with microhemorrhage (2 patients, 8%). Conclusion: Cerebrovascular injury was common in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS without significant frequency difference. However, COVID-19 ARDS had unique neuroimaging patterns that may indicate distinct patterns of brain injury of COVID-19.","output":"Cerebrovascular injury associated with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the analytical sensitivity and specificity of 4 rapid antigen diagnostic tests (Ag RDTs) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as the reference method and further characterizing samples using droplet digital quantitative PCR (ddPCR) and a mass spectrometric antigen test. METHODS: Three hundred fifty (150 negative and 200 RT-qPCR positive) residual PBS samples were tested for antigen using the BD Veritor lateral flow (LF), ACON LF, ACON fluorescence immunoassay (FIA), and LumiraDx FIA. ddPCR was performed on RT-qPCR-positive samples to quantitate the viral load in copies/mL applied to each Ag RDT. Mass spectrometric antigen testing was performed on PBS samples to obtain a set of RT-qPCR-positive, antigen-positive samples for further analysis. RESULTS: All Ag RDTs had nearly 100% specificity compared to RT-qPCR. Overall analytical sensitivity varied from 66.5% to 88.3%. All methods detected antigen in samples with viral load >1 500 000 copies/mL RNA, and detected 75% of samples with viral load of 500 000 to 1 500 000 copies/mL. The BD Veritor LF detected only 25% of samples with viral load between 50 000 to 500 000 copies/mL, compared to 75% for the ACON LF device and >80% for LumiraDx and ACON FIA. The ACON FIA detected significantly more samples with viral load <50 000 copies/mL compared to the BD Veritor. Among samples with detectable antigen and viral load <50 000 copies/mL, sensitivity of the Ag RDT varied between 13.0% (BD Veritor) and 78.3% (ACON FIA).

We previously reported a therapeutic dyad of immunostimulatory small molecules that induces innate immunity, termed inducible epithelial resistance, against a wide range of pneumonia-causing pathogens, including coronaviruses and influenza viruses. This combination (Pam2-ODN) is comprised of a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2/6 agonist, Pam2CSK4, and a TLR-9 agonist, ODN M362, that stimulate protective responses from lung epithelial cells and promotes synergistic survival benefits and microbicidal effects that exceeds the additive effects of treatment with individual ligands. Here, we investigate the immunomodulatory signaling mechanism of Pam2-ODN that reduces susceptibility to viral infection in lung epithelial cells. Methods: Transcriptional responses of human and mouse lung epithelial cells to influenza A H1N1 or SARS-CoV-2 (GSE147507) or Pam2-ODN (GSE289984) were analyzed using R and IPA software to build host-based antiviral innate immune pathways to infections and identify relevant transcriptional factors (TFs) involved. Isolated human or mouse lung epithelial cells were stimulated with PBS or Pam2-ODN and challenged with influenza A H3N2 or coronavirus OC43 to study transcriptional control of relevant TFs by high-throughput methods of immunofluorescence (IF) staining, in-cell western blotting and imaging flow cytometry (IFC). Results: Network-based enrichment analysis reduced infection of epithelial cells with Pam2-ODN against both coronavirus and influenza through inhibition of viral budding and viral RNA replication. In silico prediction of pathogen-specific host-based responses with Pam2-ODN included disruption of SARS-CoV-2's IL-1, 6 and 8 signaling, and inhibition of influenza A's anti-interferon mechanisms. Functional enrichment analysis revealed activation of these host innate immune responses by Pam2-ODN prior to viral exposure through activity of NF-kB/RelA and AP-1/cJun. IFC and IF confirmed an NF-kB-dependent transcriptional cooperation of RelA and cJun with Pam2-ODN in both mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Phospho-kinetic studies revealed an early transient activity of RelA-(pS536), followed by a sustained cJun-(pS73) signal in lung epithelial cells after Pam2-ODN. Upon viral infection, Pam2-ODN treated cells activated cJun-(pS73) signaling more rapidly in response to both influenza and coronavirus infection. Coronavirus-induced activation of RelA-(pS536) after infection was suppressed in Pam2-ODN treated cells. Conclusion: Inducible epithelial resistance by Pam2- ODN enhances broad host-based antiviral innate immunity responses through signaling pathways of RelA and cJun, which also abrogate virus-specific pathogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, phospho-signaling control of these transcriptional responses in lung epithelium suggest a novel pathogen-dependent antiviral response immune mechanism to infection.","output":"Antiviral immunomodulatory signaling of inducible epithelial resistance recalibrates host response to coronavirus and influenza infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Keratoprosthesis (KPro) devices have the remarkable ability to restore vision in patients suffering from corneal blindness who are poor candidates for traditional penetrating keratoplasty. However, eyes with KPro can experience various complications, including the development of retroprosthetic membrane (RPM). RPMs reduce visual acuity in patients due to physical obstruction of the visual axis, but studies have shown that RPM can also lead to a variety of other consequences, from melting of the corneal carrier graft to precipitating retinal detachments. Histopathologic studies have shown that RPMs are composed of elements from both the recipient and donor. The presence of myofibroblasts in RPMs imparts them with contractile properties, which can contribute to their downstream complications, including angle closure, hypotony, and retinal detachment. At present, there are limited treatments to combat the growth of RPM.

METHODS: An unmatched case-control study was conducted through telephonic interviews among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Jodhpur, India from 23 March to 20 July 2020. Contact history, comorbidities and tobacco and alcohol use were elicited using standard tools. RESULTS: Among 911 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, 47.5% were symptomatic, 14.1% had severe COVID-19 and 41 (4.5%) died. Older age, working outside the home, cardiac and respiratory comorbidity and alcohol use were found to increase the risk of symptomatic disease as compared with asymptomatic infection. Current tobacco smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.26 to 0.78]) but not smokeless tobacco use (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.55 to 1.19]) appeared to reduce the risk of symptomatic disease. Age &#8805;60 y and renal comorbidity were significantly associated with severe COVID-19. Age &#8805;60 y and respiratory and cardiac comorbidity were found to predispose to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent reduced risk of symptomatic COVID-19 among tobacco smokers could be due to residual confounding owing to unknown factors, while acknowledging the limitation of recall bias. Cross-protection afforded by frequent upper respiratory tract infection among tobacco smokers could explain why a similar association was not found for smokeless tobacco use, thereby being more plausible than the 'nicotinic hypothesis'.

These changes were attributed to both artifactual changes related to declines in routine health seeking for respiratory illness as well as real changes in influenza virus circulation because of widespread implementation of measures to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Data from clinical laboratories in the United States indicated a 61% decrease in the number of specimens submitted (from a median of 49,696 per week during September 29, 2019-February 29, 2020, to 19,537 during March 1-May 16, 2020) and a 98% decrease in influenza activity as measured by percentage of submitted specimens testing positive (from a median of 19.34% to 0.33%). Interseasonal (i.e., summer) circulation of influenza in the United States (May 17-August 8, 2020) is currently at historical lows (median = 0.20% tests positive in 2020 versus 2.35% in 2019, 1.04% in 2018, and 2.36% in 2017). Influenza data reported to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) FluNet platform from three Southern Hemisphere countries that serve as robust sentinel sites for influenza from Oceania (Australia), South America (Chile), and Southern Africa (South Africa) showed very low influenza activity during June-August 2020, the months that constitute the typical Southern Hemisphere influenza season. In countries or jurisdictions where extensive community mitigation measures are maintained (e.g., face masks, social distancing, school closures, and teleworking), those locations might have little influenza circulation during the upcoming 2020-21 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The use of community mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, plus influenza vaccination, are likely to be effective in reducing the incidence and impact of influenza, and some of these mitigation measures could have a role in preventing influenza in future seasons. However, given the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty of continued community mitigation measures, it is important to plan for seasonal influenza circulation in the United States this fall and winter.

A migrated thrombus was defined as distal migration greater than 1 cm on initial cerebral angiography compared with preprocedural angiographic findings. We evaluated immediate angiographic results and clinical outcomes through a review of electronic medical records and compared clinical outcomes between migrated and non-migrated MCA occlusions. Results During this period, 98 patients underwent MAT using Penumbra catheters for treatment of acute MCA occlusions. Of these, 19 (19.4%) had a migrated MCA thrombus on initial cerebral angiography compared with preprocedural angiographic findings. The overall rate of successful recanalization (TICI grade  2b) was 90.8%. The rate of successful recanalization in the migrated thrombus group was 94.7% (18/19). Overall procedure time for recanalization in the migrated thrombus group was significantly shorter than that in the non-migrated thrombus group ( p = 0.001). Although the difference was not significant, there was a trend toward more favorable clinical outcomes in the migrated thrombus group compared to the non-migrated thrombus groups (78.9% versus 60.8%, p = 0.231).

Multiple factors related to the patient, tumor, and cancer therapy can affect the risk of infection in patients with solid tumors. A thorough understanding of such factors can aid in the identification of patients with substantial risk of infection, allowing medical practitioners to tailor therapy and apply prophylactic measures to avoid serious complications. The use of novel treatment modalities, including targeted therapy and immunotherapy, brings diagnostic and therapeutic challenges into the management of infections in cancer patients. A growing body of evidence suggests that antibiotic therapy can modulate both toxicity and antitumor response induced by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and especially immunotherapy. This article provides a comprehensive review of potential risk factors for infections and therapeutic approaches for the most prevalent infections in patients with solid tumors, and discusses the potential effect of antibiotic therapy on toxicity and efficacy of cancer therapy.","output":"Risk Factors for Infections, Antibiotic Therapy, and Its Impact on Cancer Therapy Outcomes for Patients with Solid Tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Web-based videoconferencing has gained a great momentum worldwide, with extremely high adoption rates during the COVID-19 pandemic The current study aims to investigate the use of web-based videoconferencing for teaching in the post-COVID-19 landscape The study proposes and evaluates a model to predict continuance intention to use videoconferencing systems, from the perspective of University teachers The proposed model combines constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Expectancy Confirmation Model (ECM) Sixty-six academic staff members filled out a survey questionnaire about their attitudes towards continuing using videoconferencing systems for teaching in the post-Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) period Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used to test the measurement and the structural model The model explains and predicts 73% of the total variance in continuance intention to use User satisfaction with web-based videoconferencing and perceived usefulness are the top two strong predictors Implications for school administrators and instructional designers are discussed","output":"Web-based videoconferencing for teaching online: Continuance intention to use in the post-COVID-19 period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold-standard technique for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in nasopharyngeal swabs specimens. The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution.

BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN The study was carried out among 250 adults attending primary care clinics in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia). The study adopted a case-control approach, where diabetes status was first ascertained, and data collection carried out afterwards using questionnaires and periodontal examinations. Variations in the performance of the PPM by demographic (sex and age), socioeconomic (education) and behavioural factors (smoking status and last dental visit) were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) regression. RESULTS The PPM including 3 periodontal parameters (missing teeth, percentage of sites with pocket depth 6mm and mean pocket depth) had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.69 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.61-0.78), which dropped to 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53-0.75) after adjustment for covariates. Larger variations in performance were found by participants' sex, age and education, but not by smoking status or last dental visit. The PPM performed better among male (adjusted AUC: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.99), younger (0.67; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.84) and less educated participants (0.76; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.92).

We estimated a duration of immunity to seasonal HCoVs of 7.8 y (95% CI 6.3 to 8.1) and show that, while cross-protection between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the age distribution, it is insufficient to explain the age pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales.

Here we synthesise the available indexed and grey literature reporting on the delivery of NCD interventions to conflict-affected women and children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS A systematic search in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases for indexed articles published between 1 January 1990 and 31 March 2018 was conducted, and publications reporting on NCD intervention delivery to conflict-affected women or children in LMICs were included. A grey literature search of 10 major humanitarian organisation websites for publications dated between 1 January 2013 and 30 November 2018 was also conducted. We extracted and synthesised information on intervention delivery characteristics and delivery barriers and facilitators. RESULTS Of 27 included publications, most reported on observational research studies, half reported on studies in the Middle East and North Africa region and 80% reported on interventions targeted to refugees. Screening and medication for cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the most commonly reported interventions, with most publications reporting facility-based delivery and very few reporting outreach or community approaches. Doctors were the most frequently reported delivery personnel. No publications reported on intervention coverage or on the effectiveness of interventions among women or children. Limited population access and logistical constraints were key delivery barriers reported, while innovative technology use, training of workforce and multidisciplinary care were reported to have facilitated NCD intervention delivery. CONCLUSION Large and persistent gaps in information and evidence make it difficult to recommend effective strategies for improving the reach of quality NCD care among conflict-affected women and children.

Changes in haematological characteristics in patients with COVID-19 are emerging as important features of the disease. We aimed to explore the haematological characteristics and related risk factors in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to three designated sites of Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease (defined according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia, trial version 7, published by the National Health Commission of China). We assessed the risk factors associated with critical illness and poor prognosis. Dynamic haematological and coagulation parameters were investigated with a linear mixed model, and coagulopathy screening with sepsis-induced coagulopathy and International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis overt disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring systems was applied. FINDINGS: Of 466 patients admitted to hospital from Jan 23 to Feb 23, 2020, 380 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study. The incidence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100a??a??109 cells per L) in patients with critical disease (42 [49%] of 86) was significantly higher than in those with severe (20 [14%] of 145) or moderate (nine [6%] of 149) disease (p<00001). The numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils were significantly lower in patients with critical disease than those with severe or moderate disease (p<00001), and prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrin degradation products significantly increased with increasing disease severity (p<00001). In multivariate analyses, death was associated with increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (&#8805;913; odds ratio [OR] 539 [95% CI 170-1713], p=00042), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100a??a??109 per L; OR 833 [256-2715], p=000045), prolonged prothrombin time (>16 s; OR 494 [150-1625], p=00094), and increased D-dimer (>2 mg/L; OR 441 [106-1830], p=0041). Thrombotic and haemorrhagic events were common complications in patients who died (19 [35%] of 55). Sepsis-induced coagulopathy and International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis overt disseminated intravascular coagulation scores (assessed in 12 patients who survived and eight patients who died) increased over time in patients who died. The onset of sepsis-induced coagulopathy was typically before overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. INTERPRETATION: Rapid blood tests, including platelet count, prothrombin time, D-dimer, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio can help clinicians to assess severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The sepsis-induced coagulopathy scoring system can be used for early assessment and management of patients with critical disease.

BACKGROUND: The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a controversial topic within the medical community and international and national health organizations. Lay press and social media outlets have circulated opinions on this topic despite the fact that the evidence for or against the use of these medications is sparse. In the field of headache medicine, these medications are used commonly and both patients and clinicians may have questions or hesitations pertaining to their use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A detailed search of the scientific and popular literature was performed. RESULTS: There is limited literature pertaining to the safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, there are no clear scientific data that preclude the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the general population who may acquire COVID-19 or in those acutely infected with the virus. Several health organizations have concluded that treatment with corticosteroids during active infection should be avoided due to concerns of prolonged viral shedding in the respiratory tract and the lack of survival benefit based on the data from past coronaviruses and influenza virus; specific exceptions exist including treatment for underlying asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION: Scientific information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and limited or contradictory information can lead to confusion for both patients and clinicians. It is recommended that prior to prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids for the treatment of headache, clinicians have open discussions with their patients about the potential risks and benefits of using these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: Six databases were retrieved. The software R 3.6.2 was used for meta-analysis of the included literature. Results: 12 studies were included, which comprise 8996 patients affected with COVID-19 infection. The meta-analysis study found that blood pressure (MAP, SBP and DBP), heart rate, respiration rate and SpO2 are the risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Among them, the increase in MAP and the decrease in SpO2 have the greatest impact on the death of patients with COVID-19 [MAP: MD = 5.66, 95% CI (0.34, 10.98), SpO2: MD = -5.87, 95% CI (-9.17, -2.57), P = 0.0005].

Findings: Most patients were elderly (median age 75) with multiple comorbidities. One quarter were admitted from residential or nursing care. Symptoms were consistent with COVID-19, with cough, fever and/or breathlessness in 90.5% of patients. Two thirds of patients had severe disease on admission. Mortality was 81/291 (27.8%). Most deaths were anticipated; decisions to initiate respiratory support were individualised after consideration of patient wishes, premorbid frailty and comorbidities, with specialist palliative care input where appropriate. 22/291 (7.6%) patients were intubated and 11/22 (50%) survived beyond discharge. Multiple logistic regression identified age as the most significant risk factor for death (OR 1.09 [95% CI 1.06 - 1.12] per year increase, p < 0.001).

During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a well-documented deterioration in psychological well-being and increased social isolation. This raises questions as to whether those experiencing psychological adversity during the pandemic are more at risk of contracting and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between psychological factors and the risk of COVID-19 self-reported infection and the symptomatic experience of SARS-CoV-2 (indicated by the number and severity of symptoms). METHODS: As part of a longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, 1,087 adults completed validated measures of psychological well-being during April 2020 and self-reported incidence of COVID-19 infection and symptom experience across the pandemic through to December 2020. Regression models were used to explore these relationships controlling for demographic and occupational factors. RESULTS: Greater psychological distress during the early phase of the pandemic was significantly associated with subsequent self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the experience of a greater number and more severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection and symptoms may be more common among those experiencing elevated psychological distress. Further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations is needed.","output":"Psychological Predictors of Self-reported COVID-19 Outcomes: Results From a Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We found that the real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of viral RNA from sputum or nasopharyngeal swab has a relatively low positive rate in the early stage to determine COVID-19 (named by the World Health Organization).

Therefore, clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type of pneumonia as soon as possible.This study aimed to establish an early screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a 3-dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated images were then categorized into COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence scores using a location-attention classification model. Finally the infection type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy-or Bayesian function.The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.The deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early screening of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.","output":"Deep Learning System to Screen Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Among patients with anal cancer, chemoradiotherapy is often associated with toxicities that diminish quality of life. We describe the GI-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of patients with anal cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy to improve patient-physician communication. METHODS: We prospectively followed patients with nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Patients completed the bowel subdomain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire before treatment and at 4 subsequent timepoints. We used the paired Wilcoxon test to compare EPIC scores at different times. RESULTS: The study included 21 patients; median age was 57 years. Most patients (52%) had T2 and either N0 or N1 disease (81%). Most patients (91%) received chemotherapy with cisplatin-fluorouracil and either intensity-modulated radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy. Compared with the patients' median overall summary score at baseline (66), their median score at 1 week (82) was higher (P = .009), whereas their median score at 5 weeks (54) was lower (P = .025). The patients' median overall summary score at baseline and at 3 months did not differ (P = .919). Three months after radiotherapy, most patients reported minimal adverse effects compared with baseline. CONCLUSION: The GI-related PROs of patients with anal cancer tend to fluctuate during radiotherapy but return to baseline by 3 months, at which time most patients report few or no residual adverse effects. We provide a clear timeline of GI acute toxicity using sequential PRO measurements that will improve patient-physician communication regarding expectations for cancer treatment.","output":"Patient-Reported GI Outcomes in Patients With Anal Cancer Receiving Modern Chemoradiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy took place in Lombardia, a densely populated and highly industrialized northern region, and spread across the northern and central part of Italy according to quite different temporal and spatial patterns. In this work, a multi-scale territorial analysis of the pandemic is carried out using various models and data-driven approaches. Specifically, a logistic regression is employed to capture the evolution of the total positive cases in each region and throughout Italy, and an enhanced version of an SIR-type model is tuned to fit the different territorial epidemic dynamics via a differential evolution algorithm. Hierarchical clustering and multidimensional analysis are further exploited to reveal the similarities/dissimilaritiesof the remarkably different geographical epidemic developments.

Besides traditional risk factors, dysregulation of lung immune defenses and microbiota may play an important role in ARDS patients. Prone positioning does not seem to be associated with a higher risk of pulmonary infection. Although bacteria associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in ARDS patients are similar to those in patients without ARDS, atypical pathogens (Aspergillus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus) may also be responsible for infection in ARDS patients. Diagnosing pulmonary infection in ARDS patients is challenging, and requires a combination of clinical, biological and microbiological criteria. The role of modern tools (e.g., molecular methods, metagenomic sequencing, etc.) remains to be evaluated in this setting. One of the challenges of antimicrobial treatment is antibiotics diffusion into the lungs. Although targeted delivery of antibiotics using nebulization may be interesting, their place in ARDS patients remains to be explored. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the most severe patients is associated with a high rate of infection and raises several challenges, diagnostic issues and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics changes being at the top. Prevention of pulmonary infection is a key issue in ARDS patients, but there is no specific measure for these high-risk patients.

PARTICIPANTS: In 2014, LLUHa US academic medical centre and universityincentivised participation in a workplace smoking cessation programme (LLUH BREATHE) by lowering health plan costs. Specifically, LLUH introduced a Wholeness Health Plan (WHP) option that, for the smokers, continuously incentivises participation in nicotine screening and the LLUH BREATHE smoking cessation programme by offering an opt-in wellness discount that consisted of 50%C53% lower out of pocket health plan costs (ie, monthly employee premiums, copayments). This novel continuously incentivised model lowers annual health plan costs for smokers who, on an annual basis, attempt or maintain cessation from tobacco use. The annual WHP cost savings for smokers far exceed the value of short-term incentives that have been tested in workplace cessation trials to date. This ongoing health plan option offered to over 16 000 employees has created an open, dynamic LLUH BREATHE cohort of current and former smokers (n=1092). FINDINGS TO DATE: Our profile of the LLUH BREATHE cohort indicates that after 5 years of follow-up in a prospective cohort study (2014C2019), continuously incentivised smoking cessation produced a 74% participation (95% CI (71% to 77%)) in employer-sponsored smoking cessation attempts that were occurring less than a year after the incentive was offered. The cohort can be purposed to examine the effect of continuously incentivised cessation on cessation outcomes, health plan utilisation/costs, use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, and COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Cohort profile for the Loma Linda University Health BREATHE programme: a model to study continuously incentivised employee smoking cessation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We report here a Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala state, India which had caused fatal encephalitis in an adolescent male and the outbreak response which led to the successful containment of the disease and the related investigations. Methods: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR, ELISA based antibody detection and whole genome sequencing were performed to confirm the Nipah virus infection. Contacts of the index case were traced and isolated based on risk categorization. Bats from the areas near the epicentre of the outbreak were sampled for throat swabs, rectal swabs and blood samples for Nipah virus screening by real time RT-PCR and anti-Nipah virus bat IgG ELISA. Plaque reduction neutralization test was performed for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. Results: Nipah viral RNA and anti-NiV IgG antibodies were detected in the serum of the index case. Rapid establishment of an onsite NiV diagnostic facility and contact tracing helped in quick containment of the outbreak. NiV sequences retrieved from the clinical specimen of the index case formed a sub-cluster with the earlier reported Nipah I genotype sequences from India with more than 95% similarity. Anti-NiV IgG positivity could be detected in 21% of Pteropus medius and 37.73% of Rousettus leschenaultia. Neutralizing antibodies against NiV could be detected in P.medius.

In the current study, we examined job insecurity as a mediator and employees negative affect as a moderator in the relationship between job precariousness and employees withdrawal behavior. Using a sample of 472 employees working in Chinese hotels, we found that job precariousness is positively related to employees withdrawal behavior by increasing their job insecurity. Moreover, this mediating relationship is conditional on the moderator variable of employees negative affect for the path from job insecurity to withdrawal behavior. The importance of these findings for understanding the undesirable behavior outcomes of job precariousness is discussed.","output":"Precarious Job Makes Me Withdraw?

Despite this need, few studies have compared the effectiveness of clinic-based versus web-based or telehealth services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of clinic-based multidisciplinary therapy in an integrated practice unit (C-IPU) model with online integrated multidisciplinary therapy (O-IPU) in individuals undergoing conservative care for LBP. METHODS: A total of 1090 participants were prospectively recruited to participate in a clinical trial registry (NCT04081896) through the SpineZone rehabilitation IPU program. All participants provided informed consent. Participants were allocated to the C-IPU (N=988) or O-IPU (N=102) groups based on their personal preferences. The C-IPU program consisted of a high-intensity machine-based core muscle resistance training program, whereas the O-IPU program consisted of therapist-directed home core strengthening exercises through a web-based platform. Changes in LBP symptom severity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), goal achievement (Patient-Specific Functional Scale), and frequency of opioid use were compared between the C-IPU and O-IPU groups using multivariate linear regression modeling adjusted for age, gender, treatment number, program duration, and baseline pain and disability. RESULTS: Approximately 93.03% (1014/1090) of the participants completed their recommended programs, with no group differences in dropout rates (P=.78). The C-IPU group showed greater pain relief (P<.001) and reductions in disability (P=.002) than the O-IPU group, whereas the O-IPU group reported greater improvements in goal achievement (P<.001). Both programs resulted in reduced opioid use frequency, with 19.0% (188/988) and 21.5% (22/102) of participants reporting cessation of opioid use for C-IPU and O-IPU programs, respectively, leaving only 5.59% (61/1090) of participants reporting opioid use at the end of their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both in-clinic and web-based multidisciplinary programs are beneficial in reducing pain, disability, and opioid use and in improving goal achievement. The differences between these self-selected groups shed light on patient characteristics, which require further investigation and could help clinicians optimize these programs.

In addition, a few inhibitors of the pyrimidine biosynthesis have shown to induce the innate immunity in a yet-to-be-determined manner and inhibit the virus infection. Thus, we also investigated whether the anti-enteroviral activity of gemcitabine is mediated by innate immunity, induction of which is related with the inhibition of the pyrimidine synthesis. In this study, we found that the addition of exogenous cytidine, uridine and uridine mono-phosphate (UMP) effectively reversed the antiviral activity of gemcitabine in enterovirus-infected as well as enteroviral replicon-harboring cells, demonstrating gemcitabines targeting of the salvage pathway. Moreover, the expression of several interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) was significantly induced by the treatment of gemcitabine, which was also suppressed by the co-treatment with cytidine.

STUDY SELECTION Studies of healthcare workers (including students) using disposable or reusable respirators with a range of designs. We examined respirator performance, clinician adherence and performance, comfort and impact, and perceptions of use. RESULTS We included standards from eight authorities across Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australasia and 39 research studies. There were four main findings. First, international standards for respirators apply across workplace settings and are broadly comparable across jurisdictions. Second, effective and safe respirator use depends on proper fitting and fit testing. Third, all respirator types carry a burden to the user of discomfort and interference with communication which may limit their safe use over long periods; studies suggest that they have little impact on specific clinical skills in the short term but there is limited evidence on the impact of prolonged wearing. Finally, some clinical activities, particularly chest compressions, reduce the performance of filtering facepiece respirators.

Reimbursement policies have been historically limited due to concerns of over-utilization of visits and testing. Additionally, there is limited literature on endocrinology care delivered via TH for conditions other than diabetes. OBJECTIVE: Assess real-world use of TH for endocrinology in a pre-pandemic environment with hypothesis that TH would not increase utilization of total visits or related ancillary testing services compared to conventional face-to-face office visits (CVL). METHODS: A single-institution retrospective cohort study assessing the pre-pandemic use of TH in endocrinology, consisting of 75 patients seen via TH and 225 patients seen in CVL visits. For the majority of patients, TH was conducted via a clinic-to-clinic model. Outcomes measured were total endocrine visit frequency and frequency of related laboratory and radiology testing per patient, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), microalbumin, low density lipoprotein (LDL), thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin, and thyroid ultrasounds. RESULTS: For all endocrine visits, TH patients had a median of 0.24 (IQR 0.015-0.36) visits per month. CVL patients had median of 0.20 visits per month (IQR 0.11-0.37). Total visits per month did not vary significantly between groups (p=0.051). HbA1c outcomes were equivalent and there was no increase in ancillary lab testing for the TH group. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations demonstrate that in a pre-pandemic healthcare setting, TH visits can provide equivalent care for endocrinology patients, without increasing utilization of total visits or ancillary services.","output":"Telehealth for Endocrinology: Experience and Effect on Utilization in Pre-Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential benefits of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) in the regulation of lipid metabolism have been reported in large prospective cohort studies although the molecular regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Okara is a by-product obtained during soybean processing for soy milk and soybean curd (tofu), which is rarely utilized and can be a cheap potential dietary fiber (DF) resource. In this study, the structure and physicochemical properties of insoluble dietary fiber (SIDF) extracted from okara were characterized, and the prebiotic effects on fat metabolism were investigated in vivo. The results showed that the main monosaccharides of SIDF (90.50%) identified were galactose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose and glucose. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses suggested that SIDF had a loose and porous structure, polysaccharide functional groups, and a typical crystalline cellulose I structure. In addition, SIDF had ideal oil-adsorption capacity (OAC; 7.95 g g-1) and significantly improved cholesterol adsorption (11.14 mg g-1) at pH 7.0. In vivo, IDF supplementation reduced the serum lipid levels and inhibited hepatic fat accumulation. Additionally, SIDF administration improved hepatic steatosis by stimulating lipolysis via upregulation of PPAR, CYP4a10 and CPT1a. This is the first systematic study on the composition, structure, physicochemical properties, adsorption function and biological effects of SIDF. The above results show that SIDF could be used as an ideal functional ingredient in food processing as well as play a positive role in improving the added value of okara and promoting its comprehensive utilization.","output":"Preparation and characterization of soybean insoluble dietary fiber and its prebiotic effect on dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in high fat-fed C57BL/6J mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines are recognized worldwide as one of the most important tools for combating infectious diseases. Despite the tremendous value conferred by currently available vaccines toward public health, the implementation of additional vaccine platforms is also of key importance. In fact, currently available vaccines possess shortcomings, such as inefficient triggering of a cell-mediated immune response and the lack of protective mucosal immunity. In this regard, recent work has been focused on vaccine delivery systems, as an alternative to injectable vaccines, to increase antigen stability and improve overall immunogenicity. In particular, novel strategies based on edible or intradermal vaccine formulations have been demonstrated to trigger both a systemic and mucosal immune response. These novel vaccination delivery systems offer several advantages over the injectable preparations including self-administration, reduced cost, stability, and elimination of a cold chain. In this review, the latest findings and accomplishments regarding edible and intradermal vaccines are described in the context of the system used for immunogen expression, their molecular features and capacity to induce a protective systemic and mucosal response.","output":"Alternative Methods of Vaccine Delivery: An Overview of Edible and Intradermal Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Periodontal ligament (PDL) stem cells (PDLSCs) have been reported as a useful cell source for periodontal tissue regeneration. However, one of the issues is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of PDLSCs for clinical application because very few PDLSCs can be isolated from PDL tissue of donors. Therefore, we aimed to identify a specific factor that converts human PDL cells into stem-like cells. In this study, microarray analysis comparing the gene profiles of human PDLSC lines (2-14 and 2-23) with those of a cell line with a low differentiation potential (2-52) identified the imprinted gene mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST). MEST was expressed in the cytoplasm of 2-23 cells. Knockdown of MEST by siRNA in 2-23 cells inhibited the expression of stem cell markers, such as CD105, CD146, p75NTR, N-cadherin, and NANOG; the proliferative potential; and multidifferentiation capacity for osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. On the other hand, overexpression of MEST in 2-52 cells enhanced the expression of stem cell markers and PDL-related markers and the multidifferentiation capacity. In addition, MEST-overexpressing 2-52 cells exhibited a change in morphology from a spindle shape to a stem cell-like round shape that was similar to 2-14 and 2-23 cell morphologies. These results suggest that MEST plays a critical role in the maintenance of stemness in PDLSCs and converts PDL cells into PDLSC-like cells. Therefore, this study indicates that MEST may be a therapeutic factor for periodontal tissue regeneration by inducing PDLSCs.","output":"MEST Regulates the Stemness of Human Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we analyze the growth pattern of Covid-19 pandemic in India from March 4th to May 15th using regression analysis (exponential and polynomial), auto-regressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) model as well as Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters models.

The normalisation principle (NP) proposes that individuals with a disability should have access to the same living conditions as 'others'. The NP can be described as a strategy that highlights equal rights for individuals regardless of their life situation. The main findings are that mental illness is defined by needs assessors on a spectrum of diagnoses from schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder to anxiety and depression. The successful normalisation of mental illness is linked to structural context, attitudes to older people's mental illnesses and ageing, the practise established on a unit and whether needs assessors reproduce ageism or challenge it through the NP by attempting to secure the rights of older people.","output":"Is it normal to be depressed in old age?

METHODS: We searched for patients with primary SS presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined following and according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines) among those included in the Big Data Sj?gren Registry, an international, multicentre registry of patients diagnosed according to the 2002/2016 classification criteria. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were included in the study (46 women, mean age at diagnosis of infection of 60 years). According to the number of patients with primary SS evaluated in the Registry (n = 8211), the estimated frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.62% (95% CI 0.44, 0.80). All but two presented with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever (82%), cough (57%), dyspnoea (39%), fatigue/myalgias (27%) and diarrhoea (24%), and the most frequent abnormalities included raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (88%), CRP (81%) and D-dimer (82%) values, and lymphopenia (70%). Infection was managed at home in 26 (51%) cases and 25 (49%) required hospitalization (five required admission to ICU, four died). Compared with patients managed at home, those requiring hospitalization had higher odds of having lymphopenia as laboratory abnormality (adjusted OR 21.22, 95% CI 2.39, 524.09). Patients with comorbidities had an older age (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00, 1.11) and showed a risk for hospital admission six times higher than those without (adjusted OR 6.01, 95% CI 1.72, 23.51) in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Baseline comorbidities were a key risk factor for a more complicated COVID-19 in patients with primary SS, with higher rates of hospitalization and poor outcomes in comparison with patients without comorbidities.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with primary Sj?gren syndrome: characterization and outcomes of 51 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The spread of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is here investigated from an epidemic model considering four pathways of person-to-person transmission.

In the case of COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country such as Bangladesh, however, the fact is that some physicians decline either to report for duty or to treat patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms. At issue ethically is whether such medical practitioners are to be automatically disciplined for dereliction of duty and gross negligence; or, on the contrary, such physicians may legitimately claim a professional right of autonomous judgment, on the basis of which professional right they may justifiably decline to treat patients. METHODS: This ethical issue is examined with a view to providing some guidance and recommendations, insofar as the conditions of medical practice in an under-resourced country such as Bangladesh are vastly different from medical practice in an industrialized nation such as the USA. The concept of moral dilemma as discussed by philosopher Michael Shaw Perry and philosopher Immanuel Kant's views on moral appeal to \\"emergency\\" are considered pertinent to sorting through the moral conundrum of medical care during pandemic. RESULTS: Our analysis allows for conditional physician discretion in the decision to treat COVID-19 patients, i.e., in the absence of personal protective equipment (PPE) combined with claim of duty to family. Physicians are nonetheless expected to provide a minimum of initial clinical assessment and stabilization of a patient before initiating transfer of a patient to a \\"designated\\" COVID-19 hospital. The latter is to be done in coordination with the national center control room that can assure admission of a patient to a referral hospital prior to ambulance transport. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a moral dilemma (i.e., conflict of obligations) in the pandemic situation of clinical care requires institutional authorities to exercise tolerance of individual physician moral decision about the duty to care. Hospital or government authority should respond to such decisions without introducing immediate sanction, such as suspension from all clinical duties or termination of licensure, and instead arrange for alternative clinical duties consistent with routine medical care.","output":"A Duty to treat?

Most are found to be consistent with the $\\\\phi_i$ model.

Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study aims to review patients from four major hospitals in Saudi Arabia. All pediatric hospitalizations secondary to asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia during the months of the lockdown (March, April, and May) in 2020 were documented. Then, they were compared to the previous 2 years. Variables like number of hospitalizations, oxygen requirement, mechanical ventilation, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), length of stay, and results of viral studies were collected. Results: We included 1,003 children from four different centers. Males were slightly higher than females (55.8% vs. 44.2%). Total number of hospitalizations in 2020 was 201, significantly lower than 399 and 403 hospitalizations in 2019 and 2018, respectively (P < 0.01). The major drop happened on the months of April and May. Although bronchiolitis hospitalizations' dropped by more than half in 2020 compared to the previous 2 years, it was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). But, asthma hospitalizations were significantly less in 2020 compared to the previous 2 years (49C65% reduction, P = 0.003). Number of pneumonia cases were lowered in 2020 compared to the previous 2 years. However, proportion of pneumonia diagnosis to total hospitalizations increased in 2020 (55% compared to 50% and 35%). There was a surge of viral testing during a period of uncertainty in the early phase of the pandemic. This total reduction in hospitalization was not associated with higher oxygen requirements, mechanical ventilation, ICU admissions or longer hospital stay. Conclusions: Lockdown and precautionary measures executed during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic helped decrease the number of hospitalizations due to lower respiratory illnesses in Saudi Arabia. Reduction in hospitalizations seems less likely to be secondary to hospital avoidance or delayed presentations as number of ICU admission and oxygen requirements did not increase.

Our review aimed to summarize the current economic evidence and understand the costs and cost-effectiveness of systematic screening approaches among high-risk groups and settings. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on economic evaluations of screening for TB disease targeting persons with clinical and/or structural risk factors, such as persons living with HIV (PLHIV) or persons experiencing homelessness. We searched three databases for studies published between January 1, 2010 and February 1, 2020. Studies were included if they reported cost and a key outcome measure. Owing to considerable heterogeneity in settings and type of screening strategy, we synthesized data descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 27 articles were included in our review; 19/27 (70%) took place in high TB burden countries. Seventeen studies took place among persons with clinical risk factors, including 14 among PLHIV, while 13 studies were among persons with structural risk factors. Nine studies reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from US$51 to $1980 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Screening was most cost-effective among PLHIV. Among persons with clinical and structural risk factors there was limited evidence, but screening was generally not shown to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Studies showed that screening is most likely to be cost-effective in a high TB prevalence population. Our review highlights that to reach the missing millions TB programmes should focus on simple, cheaper initial screening tools (i.e., symptom screen and CXR) followed by molecular diagnostic tools (i.e., Xpert?) among the highest risk groups in the local setting (i.e., PLHIV, urban slums).

We first demonstrate that Molnupiravir can reduce infectious virus titers in lungs of infected animals in a dose-dependent manner by up to 3.5 log10 which is associated with a marked improvement of virus-induced lung pathology. When animals are treated with a combination of suboptimal doses of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir (that each alone result in respectively a 1.3 log10 and 1.1 log10 reduction of infectious virus titers in the lungs), a marked combined potency is observed.

METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in a convenience sample of 19 older adults (aged 64+) living at home in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland during the first COVID-19 lockdown, between April and May 2020. Participants varied in terms of gender, education, age, nationality, and socio-economic status. We conducted semi-structured phone interviews to elicit emotions, expectations and hopes in relation to the present situation, and the post-pandemic world. We inquired about opinions on the enforced public health measures, including those specifically targeting older adults, and on the societal portrayal of older adults. FINDINGS: We found that the epidemic and the public health response to it had both generated a variety of resentments and a high degree of ambivalence at the individual, micro-, meso- and macro-social levels. We also found that labelling older adults as an at-risk sub-population inevitably contributed to public and self-stigmatization. DISCUSSION: We conducted an in-depth qualitative investigation of lived experiences of older adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in one of the most gravely hit region in Europe.

Previous studies reveal that a molecular analysis of PLpro indicates the catalytic activity of viral PLpro and its interactions with ubiquitin. By using sequence comparisons, molecular models, and protein-protein interaction maps, PLpro was compared in the three recorded fatal CoV epidemics, which involved severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The pairwise sequence comparison of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro indicated similarity percentages of 82.59% and 30.06% with SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro , respectively. In comparison with SARS-CoV PLpro , in SARS-CoV-2, the PLpro had a conserved catalytic triad of C111, H278, and D293, with a slightly lower number of polar interface residues and of hydrogen bonds, a higher number of buried interface sizes, and a lower number of residues that interact with ubiquitin and PLpro . These features might contribute to a similar or slightly lower level of deubiquitinating activity in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. It was, however, a much higher level compared to MERS-CoV, which contained amino acid mutations and a low number of polar interfaces. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro showed almost the same catalytic site profiles, interface area compositions and polarities, suggesting a general similarity in deubiquitination activity. Compared with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 had a higher potential for binding interactions with ubiquitin. These estimated parameters contribute to the knowledge gap in understanding how the new virus interacts with the immune system.","output":"The emerging SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease: Its relationship with recent coronavirus epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Peer review of palliative intent radiation plans is an important component of quality assurance (QA) and has been made a priority by Cancer Care Ontario. The goal of this project was to better evaluate the QA process at the London Regional Cancer Program, including capturing the effects of changes to our process brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This is a single-centre, quality improvement project that assessed palliative QA review at our centre between fall 2018 and fall 2020. Initially, QA involved weekly, in-person multidisciplinary rounds. However, from March to October 2020, due to COVID-19, this was changed to offline review and each plan was assigned to only a single Radiation Oncology staff for review. Characteristics of plans were captured prospectively and comments (queries and major/minor change recommendations) were tracked. Queries captured questions about the plan that were not a specific recommendation. We retrospectively ed the anonymized data. Descriptive statistics were generated, stratified by cohort (in-person versus offline) and compared using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, two-sample T-test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed for any comment for all eligible variables for all patients and analyzed per plan. Cost estimates were made based on time spent reviewing plans, QA round attendance records, and the publicly available hourly wage of professionals involved. Results: The mean  SD age of reviewed patients was 67.1  12.0 years, with no difference between in-person and offline review (p=0.784). Most common primary diagnoses were lung (32.2% inperson versus 25.6% offline), breast (13.8% versus 7.7%), prostate (10.4% versus 10.5%), colorectal (4.8% versus 10.2%), and renal cell (5.6% versus 7.7%). The most common treatment sites were brain (28.4% in-person versus 39.0% offline), spine (20.8% versus 12.3%), and non-spine bone (25.2% versus 18.9%). Plans were also categorized by complexity (complex or simple photon plan, electron plan, or unknown). For in-person review 49.2% were complex (IMRT, VMAT, etc.) versus 47.8% simple (POP, etc.), while during the offline period complex plans were more heavily prioritized for review (95.8% complex versus 2.1% simple). Notably, plan complexity was not predictive of a comment being made (univariable analysis, odds ratio: 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.52-1.86, p=0.227). The overall percentage of recorded comments per plan reviewed in-person was 2.36%. However, for in-person review, if the treating staff was present queries were addressed during rounds and not recorded. To account for this missing data and consequent underestimation, the frequency of recorded queries and the percentage of time the treating staff was present during plan review was used to extrapolate the number of queries addressed during rounds. With this, the estimated percentage of comments per plan increased to 3.19% compared to only 1.40% for offline review (p=0.097). Cost estimates for in-person review was $152 per plan reviewed and $4768 per comment made versus $105 and $7494 for offline review, respectively. Conclusions: This study provides comparison of and cost estimates for both in-person, multidisciplinary and offline peer review. Additionally, our results suggest that review by a single, independent staff may not be sufficient and that excluding simple plans from review based solely on their lack of complexity may not be best practice.","output":"Evaluation of Palliative Radiation Quality Assurance Program at a Single Canadian Centre with Assessment of Associated Costs and Comparison of Two Different Review Processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that HCC patients and healthy subjects are equally responsive to a RNAdjuvant(?), a novel TLR-7/8/RIG-I agonist based on noncoding RNA developed by CureVac, by an ex vivo evaluation. However, the immunological effect of adjuvants on immune cells from cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy remains to be demonstrated. Different adjuvants currently used in cancer vaccine clinical trials were evaluated in the present study on immune cells from cancer patients before and after chemotherapy in an ex vivo setting. METHODS: PBMCs were obtained from 4 healthy volunteers and 23 patients affected by either colon (OMA) or lung cancer (OT). The effect of CpG, Poly I:C, Imiquimod and RNA-based adjuvant (RNAdjuvant(?)) was assessed using a multiparametric approach to analyze network dynamics of early immune responses. Evaluation of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression as well as the downstream effect on CD4(+) T cell phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry; cytokine and chemokine production was evaluated by Bio-Plex ProTM. RESULTS: Treatment with RNAdjuvant(?) induced the strongest response in cancer patients in terms of activation of innate and adoptive immunity. Indeed, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression was found upregulated in circulating dendritic cells, which promoted a CD4(+) T cell differentiation towards an effector phenotype. RNAdjuvant(?) was the only one to induce most of the cytokines/chemokines tested with a pronounced Th1 cytokine pattern. According to the different parameters evaluated in the study, no clear cut difference in immune response to adjuvants was observed between healthy subjects and cancer patients. Moreover, in the latter group, the chemotherapy treatment did not consistently correlate to a significant altered response in the different parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first analysis of immunological effects induced by adjuvants in cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy, who are enrolled in the currently ongoing cancer vaccine clinical trials. The results show that the RNAdjuvant(?) is a potent and Th1 driving adjuvant, compared to those tested in the present study. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that chemotherapy does not significantly impair the immune system, implying that cancer patients are likely to respond to a cancer vaccine even after a chemotherapy treatment.","output":"Immunological effects of adjuvants in subsets of antigen presenting cells of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We review the use of telemedicine in glaucoma and its possible roles in the COVID-19 outbreak.

This search strategy yielded a total of 14 relevant articles after manual curation. Of the 14 articles, 4 were from the same randomized control trial, 7 were prospective studies, 2 were retrospective studies, 1 was descriptive analysis, and 1 was cost-effective analysis. Seven discussed the common ophthalmologic measurements used in teleglaucoma.

Timely response, intervention, and transportation in the prehospital setting reduce morbidity and mortality of trauma victims. Our objective was to describe the existing literature evaluating trauma morbidity and mortality outcomes as a function of prehospital care time to identify gaps in literature and inform future investigation. MAIN BODY: We performed a scoping review of published literature in MEDLINE. Results were limited to English language publications from 2009 to 2020. Included articles reported trauma outcomes and prehospital time. We excluded case reports, reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, comments, editorials, letters, and conference proceedings. In total, 808 articles were identified for title and abstract review. Of those, 96 articles met all inclusion criteria and were fully reviewed. Higher quality studies used data derived from trauma registries. There was a paucity of literature from studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), with only 3 (3%) of articles explicitly including African populations. Mortality was an outcome measure in 93% of articles, predominantly defined as in-hospital mortality as opposed to mortality within a specified time frame. Prehospital time was most commonly assessed as crude time from EMS dispatch to arrival at a tertiary trauma center. Few studies evaluated physiologic morbidity outcomes such as multi-organ failure. CONCLUSION: The existing literature disproportionately represents high-income settings and most commonly assessed in-hospital mortality as a function of crude prehospital time. Future studies should focus on how specific prehospital intervals impact morbidity outcomes (e.g., organ failure) and mortality at earlier time points (e.g., 3 or 7 days) to better reflect the effect of early prehospital resuscitation and transport. Trauma registries may be a tool to facilitate such research and may promote higher quality investigations in Africa and LMICs.

Not all items are represented equally in WM. Attention can be allocated to select and privilege relevant WM content. It is unclear whether attention selects individual features or whole objects in WM. Here, we used behavioural measures, eye-tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) to test the hypothesis that attentional selection spreads between an objects features in WM. Twenty-six participants (male and female) completed a WM task that asked them to recall the angle of one of two oriented, coloured bars after a delay while EEG and eye-tracking data was collected. During the delay, an orthogonal incidental task cued the colour of one item for a match/mismatch judgement. On congruent trials (50%), the cued item was probed during memory recall; on incongruent trials (50%), the other memory item was probed. As predicted, selecting the colour of an object in WM brought other features of the cued object into an attended state as revealed by EEG decoding, oscillatory -power, gaze bias and improved subsequent orientation recall performance. Together, the results build a case for object-based attentional selection in WM. Analyses of neural processing at recall revealed that the selected object was automatically compared with the probe, whether it was the target for recall or not, providing a potential mechanism for non-predictive cueing benefits in WM. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Everyday behaviour depends on working memory (WM)the ability to hold information in mind for an upcoming task. Attention can be focused to prioritise the most relevant object in WM. Most objects consist of multiple features, such as shape and colour. It is unclear whether attention selects entire objects in WM or only enhances the currently relevant feature. Here, we show that when people focus on a single feature of an object in memory, such as its colour, other features of that object are shifted into the focus of attention and become prioritised for subsequent decision-making. The results show that well-known object-based attention mechanisms exist for internal attention and highlight objects as a key unit of selection in WM.","output":"Neural reinstatement tracks object-based attentional selection in working memory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The positive association of HSD11B1 gene polymorphism with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetic conditions has been revealed. In the current study, we assessed the effectiveness of licorice on the clinical profile of the patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. Licorice (Glycyrrhiza Glabra) is a competitive inhibitor of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11-HSD1) enzyme and has been traditionally reported as an anti-ulcer, anti-pyretic, anti-thirst, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic agent. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of licorice on the clinical profile of participants with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. The study was performed using diabetic patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. Biochemical and anthropometric parameters were measured using standard diagnostic tools. Fourteen patients were divided into two groups by simple randomization, Licorice group (treated with 750 mg licorice/day for three weeks), and placebo group (treated with 750 mg placebo/day for three weeks). Investigations were repeated at the end of three weeks. Licorice showed a significant reduction in serum insulin levels (p = 0.03). There was no significant change in any other clinical parameters either by licorice or placebo. Conclusively, licorice moderately improves serum insulin levels in patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphism. From our pilot study, the safety of licorice is confirmed at a dose of 750 mg/day.

There are and will always be outbreaks of infection from airborne diseases. Our objective was to assess the potential risk of airborne virus transmission during CPR in open-air conditions. METHODS: We performed advanced high-fidelity three-dimensional modelling and simulations to predict airborne transmission during out-of-hospital hands-only CPR. The computational model considers complex fluid dynamics and heat transfer phenomena such as aerosol evaporation, breakup, coalescence, turbulence, and local interactions between the aerosol and the surrounding fluid. Furthermore, we incorporated the effects of the wind speed/direction, the air temperature and relative humidity on the transport of contaminated saliva particles emitted from a victim during a resuscitation process based on an Airborne Infection Risk (AIR) Index. RESULTS: The results reveal low-risk conditions that include wind direction and high relative humidity and temperature. High-risk situations include wind directed to the rescuer, low humidity and temperature. Combinations of other conditions have an intermediate AIR Index and risk for the rescue team. CONCLUSIONS: The fluid dynamics, simulation-based AIR Index provides a classification of the risk of contagion by victim's aerosol in the case of hands-only CPR considering environmental factors such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature. Therefore, we recommend that rescuers perform a quick assessment of their airborne infectious risk before starting CPR in the open air and positioning themselves to avoid wind directed to their faces.","output":"Airborne infection risk during open-air cardiopulmonary resuscitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Physical inactivity is a key risk factor for a range of chronic diseases and conditions, yet, approximately 50% of U.S. adults fall below recommended levels of regular aerobic physical activity (PA).

Text messaging (SMS) represents a convenient and accessible communication channel for delivering targeted PA information and support, but has not been rigorously evaluated against standard telehealth advising programs. The objective of the On The Move randomized controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of a linguistically and culturally targeted SMS PA intervention (SMS PA Advisor) versus two comparison conditions: a) a standard, staff-delivered phone PA intervention (Telephone PA Advisor) and b) an attention-control arm consisting of a culturally targeted SMS intervention to promote a healthy diet (SMS Nutrition Advisor). The study sample (N = 350) consists of generally healthy, insufficiently active Latino adults ages 35 years and older living in five northern California counties. Study assessments occur at baseline, 6, and 12 months, with a subset of participants completing 18-month assessments. The primary outcome is 12-month change in walking, and secondary outcomes include other forms of PA, assessed via validated self-report measures and supported by accelerometry, and physical function and well-being variables.

Great efforts have been made to identify good vaccine candidates during the last decades, but only three molecules reached clinical trials so far. The reverse vaccinology approach has become an attractive option for vaccine design, especially regarding parasites like Schistosoma spp. that present limitations for culture maintenance. This strategy also has prompted the construction of multi-epitope based vaccines, with great immunological foreseen properties as well as being less prone to contamination, autoimmunity, and allergenic responses. Therefore, in this study we applied a robust immunoinformatics approach, targeting S. mansoni transmembrane proteins, in order to construct a chimeric antigen. Initially, the search for all hypothetical transmembrane proteins in GeneDB provided a total of 584 sequences. Using the PSORT II and CCTOP servers we reduced this to 37 plasma membrane proteins, from which extracellular domains were used for epitope prediction. Nineteen common MHC-I and MHC-II binding epitopes, from eight proteins, comprised the final multi-epitope construct, along with suitable adjuvants. The final chimeric multi-epitope vaccine was predicted as prone to induce B-cell and IFN- based immunity, as well as presented itself as stable and non-allergenic molecule. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics foresee stable interactions between the putative antigen and the immune receptor TLR 4.

Vaccines containing live attenuated or heat-inactivated pathogens elicit robust immune responses, but their safety is sometimes not assured. Subunit vaccines consisting of the most potent antigenic protein or carbohydrates of the pathogen are safer but often induce a weak immune response. Traditional Ayurveda medicines have a long history of safety and may act as immuno-modulators or vaccine adjuvants. They can reduce the amount of vaccine booster doses required to elicit an immune response against any pathogen. The main objective of this review is a mechanistic evaluation of the antiviral potential of Ayurveda herbal compositions for their ability to increase cytokine expression and enhance NK cell activity, activate CD4/ CD8 + T cells, and increase the formation of IL-2 and IFN against SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Various peer-reviewed publications, books, monographs, and reputed search engines were reviewed in depth. Information available from the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and in recent in silico analyses were compared in order to understand the mechanism of action of herbal components against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: It was found in various molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies that many bioactive natural components of Ayurvedic medicines could prevent viral entry or multiplication within a human host.

Staging allows surgeons to do the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) first with the conversion only happening when a failure or technical challenge is identified. PURPOSE We present the mid-term outcomes of SADI bypass surgery after SG. METHOD A retrospective analysis was performed on a prospective database from four institutions. Ninety-six patients were identified from 2013 to 2018. Patients were divided into two groups: one had two-stage SADI because of insufficient weight loss, the second had planned two-stage SADI because of super obesity (BMI > 50 kg/m2). Incidence of complications was divided into < 30 days and > 30 days. RESULT Of 96 patients, 3 patients were completely lost to follow-up. The mean age was 44.8  11.3 years. There were no deaths or conversion to open surgery. The postoperative early complication and late complication rate was 5.3% and 6.4% respectively. At 24 months, group 2 had higher %weight loss (WL) and change in BMI units compared to group 1 with statistically significant difference. The average WL and change in BMI for entire patient's population at 24 months after 2nd stage SADI was 20.5% and 9.4 units respectively. The remission rate for DM was 93.7% with or without the use of medication. CONCLUSION The two-stage approach to SADI-S appears technically simpler than a single compromised operation.

STUDY DESIGN: The qualitative FIA FRENDTM test, designed to detect within 3 minutes the Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, was evaluated using nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM&#8482;, Copan Diagnostics Inc, US) from suspected COVID-19 cases who accessed the Emergency Room of the Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Liguria, Northwest Italy. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and STANDARD FTM COVID-19 Ag FIA test (SD BIOSENSOR Inc., Republic of Korea). RESULTS: In November 2020, 110 nasopharyngeal samples were collected consecutively; 60 resulted RT-PCR positive. With respect to RT-PCR results, sensitivity and specificity of FRENDTM COVID-19 Ag test were 93.3% (95% CI: 83.8-98.2) and 100% (95% CI: 92.9-100), respectively. FRENDTM and STANDARD FTM COVID-19 Ag FIA assays showed a concordance of 96.4% (Cohen's k = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.86-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: FRENDTM FIA test showed high sensitivity and specificity in nasopharyngeal swabs. The assay has the potential to become an important tool for an ultra-rapid identification of SARS-COV-2 infection, particularly in situations with limited access to molecular diagnostics.","output":"On-field evaluation of a ultra-rapid fluorescence immunoassay as a frontline test for SARS-COV-2 diagnostic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: NOX-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mediators of signalling pathways implicated in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction in hypertension. Among the numerous redox-sensitive kinases important in VSMC regulation is c-Src. However, mechanisms linking NOX/ROS to c-Src are unclear, especially in the context of oxidative stress in hypertension. Here, we investigated the role of NOX-induced oxidative stress in VSMCs in human hypertension focusing on NOX5, and explored c-Src, as a putative intermediate connecting NOX5-ROS to downstream effector targets underlying VSMC dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: VSMC from arteries from normotensive (NT) and hypertensive (HT) subjects were studied. NOX1,2,4,5 expression, ROS generation, oxidation/phosphorylation of signalling molecules, and actin polymerization and migration were assessed in the absence and presence of NOX5 (melittin) and Src (PP2) inhibitors. NOX5 and p22phox-dependent NOXs (NOX1C4) were down-regulated using NOX5 siRNA and p22phox-siRNA approaches. As proof of concept in intact vessels, vascular function was assessed by myography in transgenic mice expressing human NOX5 in a VSMC-specific manner. In HT VSMCs, NOX5 was up-regulated, with associated oxidative stress, hyperoxidation (c-Src, peroxiredoxin, DJ-1), and hyperphosphorylation (c-Src, PKC, ERK1/2, MLC(20)) of signalling molecules. NOX5 siRNA reduced ROS generation in NT and HT subjects. NOX5 siRNA, but not p22phox-siRNA, blunted c-Src phosphorylation in HT VSMCs. NOX5 siRNA reduced phosphorylation of MLC(20) and FAK in NT and HT. In p22phox- silenced HT VSMCs, Ang II-induced phosphorylation of MLC(20) was increased, effects blocked by melittin and PP2. NOX5 and c-Src inhibition attenuated actin polymerization and migration in HT VSMCs. In NOX5 transgenic mice, vascular hypercontractilty was decreased by melittin and PP2. CONCLUSION: We define NOX5/ROS/c-Src as a novel feedforward signalling network in human VSMCs. Amplification of this system in hypertension contributes to VSMC dysfunction. Dampening the NOX5/ROS/c-Src pathway may ameliorate hypertension-associated vascular injury.","output":"Central role of c-Src in NOX5- mediated redox signalling in vascular smooth muscle cells in human hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prognosis of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia is uncertain.

In light of the evidence for gastrointestinal infection implying a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and given the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, associated with the widespread misuse of proton pump inhibitors, this suggests that we should not rule out the hypothesis that patients treated with proton pump inhibitors may be more at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Proton Pump Inhibitors are Risk Factors for Viral Infections: Even for COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) has proved to be an important tool for the genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples.

Their protein composition and gluten dependent technological traits have been comprehensively studied, however, little information is available about their carbohydrate dependent viscous properties. The aim of this work was the comprehensive rheological characterisation of all sublines of Bnkti 1201 maintained at Martonvsr and to investigate their variability if the carbohydrate dependent viscous behaviour would be also included in the analyses. RESULTS: The majority of the lines reflected the famously good mixing quality of Bnkti, however, much higher diversity of pasting behaviour was detected. Cluster analysis of the Mixolab data was performed resulting four sample groups. Since several lines of similar mixing properties had significantly different pasting characteristics, it was assumed that classification was mainly based on the viscous properties. From each clusters 2-3 representative samples were selected for wider examination using conventional testing methods. These results also supported the higher variability of pasting behaviour of the lines, which can be critical for end product quality. The members of the second cluster can be highlighted due to their waxy wheat like behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Possible reasons of the great variability of pasting behaviour could be the compositional and structural differences of starch and other carbohydrates (e.g. arabinoxylans).

After Ag clearance, memory CD8 cells are maintained over time by a slow proliferation, primarily cytokine driven. In this article, we show that the bone marrow (BM) is the crucial organ where such basal division of memory CD8 cells occurs. BM memory CD8 cells contain a higher percentage of proliferating cells than their corresponding cells in either spleen or lymph nodes from C57BL/6 mice. This occurs both in the case of memory-phenotype CD44(high) CD8 cells and in the case of Ag-specific memory CD8 cells. Importantly, the absolute number of Ag-specific memory CD8 cells dividing in the BM largely exceeds that in spleen, lymph nodes, liver, and lung taken together. In the BM, Ag-specific memory CD8 cells express lower levels of CD127, i.e., the alpha-chain of IL-7R, than in either spleen or lymph nodes. We interpret these results as indirect evidence that Ag-specific memory CD8 cells receive proliferative signals by IL-7 and/or IL-15 in the BM and propose that the BM acts as a saturable \\"niche\\" for the Ag-independent proliferation of memory CD8 cells.

The retrospective study included 69 adult kidney transplant recipients continuously followed-up by our transplant nephrology service and who fell ill with COVID-19 from April 2020 till February 2021. The comparison study of the clinical pattern, laboratory and instrumental test results, treatment features and outcomes was made. Results. The most common clinical symptoms were hyperthermia (85.5%, n=59), weakness (65.2%, n=45) and cough (52.2%, n=36), other symptoms were significantly less common. In 89.5% of cases (n=60), the virus ribonucleic acid was detected at least once by polymerase chain reaction;in 10.5% of cases (n=7), the polymerase chain reaction results were negative. According to CT, the extent of lung tissue lesion was identified as CT1 stage in 28 patients (46.7%), CT2 stage in 24 (40%);and only in 8 (13%) patients the lesion was assessed as CT3. Later on the number of patients with more than 50% lung damage increased to 16 (26.7%) and in 1 case the severity of lung tissue damage was consistent with CT4. Typical features for all patients were anemia and lymphopenia of varying severity, hypoproteinemia, increased serum creatinine and urea, C-reactive protein, ferritin, procalcitonin and D-dimer in the laboratory test results. The treatment included antiviral, antibacterial, anticoagulant therapy, corticosteroids, biological anti-cytokine drugs. In 95% of cases (n=66), the maintenance immunosuppressive therapy was changed up to complete withdrawal of the certain components. The patient survival rate with a functioning graft was 76.8% (n=53), the graft loss was observed in 4.3% of cases (n=3), and the lethal outcome was reported in 18.8% (n=13). The cause of death was a severe respiratory distress syndrome with multiple organ dysfunction complicated by sepsis and septic shock in 8 patients (61.5%).

However, evidence of its effect on humans is still scarce. In this study, we conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double blind, parallel-group trial to investigate the safety of orally administered NMN and its efficacy to increase NAD(+) levels in thirty healthy subjects. Healthy volunteers received 250 mg/day of NMN (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) for 12 weeks, and physiological and laboratory tests were performed during this period.

However, the construct validity and in-practice reliability of computational assessments of mental health constructs with social media data remain largely unexplored. Towards this goal, we study how assessing the mental health of college students using social media data correspond with ground-truth data of on-campus mental health consultations. For a large U.S. public university, we obtained ground-truth data of on-campus mental health consultations between 2011C2016, and collected 66,000 posts from the universitys Reddit community. We adopted machine learning and natural language methodologies to measure symptomatic mental health expressions of depression, anxiety, stress, suicidal ideation, and psychosis on the social media data. Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models of forecasting on-campus mental health consultations showed that incorporating social media data led to predictions with r = 0.86 and SMAPE = 13.30, outperforming models without social media data by 41%. Our language analyses revealed that social media discussions during high mental health consultations months consisted of discussions on academics and career, whereas months of low mental health consultations saliently show expressions of positive affect, collective identity, and socialization. This study reveals that social media data can improve our understanding of college students mental health, particularly their mental health treatment needs.","output":"Social Media Discussions Predict Mental Health Consultations on College Campuses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and thereby more difficult to detect. This is a concern to all, but even more to Critical Infrastructures, like health organizations. A Cyber Threat Monitoring System (CTMS), providing a global approach to detect and analyze cyber-threats for health infrastructures is proposed by combining a set of solutions from Airbus CyberSecurity with a machine learning pipeline to improve detection and provide awareness from cyber side to a more global approach that will combine them with physical incidents. The work is being carried out in the scope of SAFECARE project. In this work, we present the CTMS architecture and present our experimental findings with ensemble learning methods for intrusion detection. Several parameters of six different ensemble methods are optimized, using Grid Search and Bayesian Search approaches, in order to detect intrusions as soon as they occur. Then, after the determination of best set of parameters for each algorithm, the attack detection performance of these six different ensemble algorithms using the CICIDS 2017 dataset are calculated and discussed. The results obtained identified Random Forest, LightGBM and Decision Trees as the best algorithms, with no significant difference in the performance, using a 95% confidence interval.","output":"Cyber Threat Monitoring Systems - Comparing Attack Detection Performance of Ensemble Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the world is fighting against the newly emerged highly contagious coronavirus strain, new evolving ideas regarding symptoms and investigations are reverberating among health care professionals to combat the public health emergency.

All the findings and statements in this review regarding the pandemic are based on published information as listed in the references. Most research articles initially focused on fever and respiratory symptoms. Later gastrointestinal symptoms were also taken into consideration. Only 5 studies from the literature have mentioned any smell and taste disturbances after SARS-CoV-2 infection to date. So changing trends can be seen in publications and recognizing these symptoms has important to timely combat this disease. The majority of corona virus-infected patients suffer from mild to moderate severity of the disease. Much hyped up symptoms of the respiratory tract may not be shown by a greater number of patients.

A low level of virus circulation has been reported in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in the past. However, the extent of the infection in Malaysia is not known. In the present study, we determine the seroepidemiology of EV-D68 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia before and after the USA outbreak in Aug 2014. A luciferase-based seroneutralization test was developed using a clone-derived prototype Fermon strain carrying a nanoluciferase marker. We screened the neutralization capacity of 450 serum samples from children and adults (1-89 years old) collected between 2013 to 2015. EV-D68 seropositivity increased with age, with children aged 1-3 showing significantly lower seroprevalence compared to adults. Multivariate analysis showed that older age groups 13-49 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.78 [95% CI 2.69-8.49], p<0.0001) and >50 years (OR 3.83 [95% CI 2.19-6.68], p<0.0001) were more likely to be EV-D68 seropositive than children <13 years. Sampling post-Sept 2014 compared to pre-Sept 2014 also predicted seropositivity (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.04-2.65]). Presence of neutralizing antibodies against EV-D68 in the study population suggests that EV-D68 was circulating prior to 2014. A higher seropositivity post-Sept 2014 suggests that Malaysia also experienced an upsurge in EV-D68 infections after the USA outbreaks in Aug 2014. A low seropositivity rate observed in children, especially those aged 1-3 years old, suggests that they are at risk and should be prioritized for future vaccination.

As with any airborne viral respiratory infection, surgical and non-surgical patients may be affected. Methods: Review and synthesis of pertinent English-language literature pertaining to COVID-19 infection among adult patients. Results: COVID-19 disease that requires hospitalization results in critical illness approximately 25% of the time and requires mechanical ventilation with positive airway pressure. Acute kidney injury, a marked hypercoagulable state, and sometimes myocarditis can be features of COVID-19 in addition to the characteristic severe acute lung injury. Even if not among the most seriously afflicted, older patients with medical comorbidities are both predisposed to infection and risk increased morbidity and mortality, however, all persons presenting for surgical intervention should be suspected of infection (and thus transmissibility) even if asymptomatic. Although most elective surgery has been curtailed by administrative or governmental fiat, patients will still need urgent or emergency operative intervention for time-sensitive disease processes such as malignant neoplasia or for true emergencies such as perforated viscus or traumatic injury. It is possible to provide safe surgical care for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and minimize nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. Conclusions: This guidance will facilitate appropriate protection of patients and staff, and maintenance of infection control measures to assist surgical personnel and facilities to prepare for COVID-19-infected adult patients requiring urgent or emergent operative intervention and to provide optimal patient care.","output":"Surgical Infection Society Guidance for Operative and Peri-Operative Care of Adult Patients Infected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thymus transplantation is a promising investigational therapy for infants born with no thymus.

Mindfulness has been demonstrated to improve stress management and emotion regulation when delivered to parents in person, however, more accessible online interventions are under-researched. AIMS: To provide preliminary data on family well-being and parentCchild relationships as well as the acceptability and usability of the Headspace app C a self-delivered mindfulness-based intervention C for parents in low-risk families during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We provided 12 parents with access to Headspace, and collected qualitative data (semi-structured interviews and 5 minute speech samples) immediately following the initial COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. The resulting transcripts were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Most parents reported Headspace to be acceptable and useful C improvements in parents own sleep were particularly noted C and there was high adherence to the intervention. However, difficulties related to family well-being and parentCchild relationships following the lockdown were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the confounding impact of COVID-19 restrictions, and varied access to app content, we were unable to determine any outcomes to be a result of practising mindfulness specifically. However, COVID-19 has had a profound impact on many UK-based families, including those previously at low risk, and our results demonstrate that Headspace may have beneficial effects for parents.

The clusters included four in Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kanagawa and Wakayama prefectures. The number of secondary cases generated by each primary case was calculated using contact tracing data. Results: Of the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated secondary cases. The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9).

Therefore, herein we propose a new method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater based on a carbon nanodots-amplified electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for the determination of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein. For the construction of the immunosensor, N-rich carbon nanodots have been synthetized with a double function: to contribute as amplifiers of the electrochemiluminescent signal in presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and as antibody supports by providing functional groups capable of covalently interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 antibody. The proposed ECL immunosensor has demonstrated a high specificity in presence of other virus-related proteins and responded linearly to SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 concentration over a wide range with a limit of detection of 1.2 pg/mL. The immunosensor has an excellent stability and achieved the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 in river and urban wastewater, which supplies a feasible and reliable sensing platform for early virus detection and therefore to protect the population. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 in urban wastewater can be used as a tool to measure the circulation of the virus in the population and to detect a possible resurgence of COVID-19.","output":"Sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewaters using a carbon nanodot-amplified electrochemiluminescence immunosensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is disrupting lives across the globe for everyone, it has a more devastating impact on the health of older adults, especially that of older men.

In this study, we explore the influence of COVID-19 on access to, experiences with, and motivations for OUD treatment through a qualitative analysis of public discussion forums on Reddit. METHODS: We collected data from Reddit, a free and international online platform dedicated to public discussions and user-generated content. We extracted 1000 of the most recent posts uploaded between March 5th and May 13th, 2020 from each of the two most popular opioid subreddits \\"r/Opiates\\" and \\"r/OpiatesRecovery\\" (total 2000). We reviewed posts for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use and coded content using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Thematic analysis identified common themes related to study questions of interest. RESULTS: Of 2000 posts reviewed, 300 (15%) discussed topics related to the intersection of opioid use and COVID-19. Five major themes related to OUD treatment were identified: Concern about closure of OUD treatment services; transition to telehealth and virtual care; methadone treatment requirements and increased exposure to COVID-19; reactions to changing regulations on medications for OUD; and influences of the pandemic on treatment motivation and progress. CONCLUSION: In the face of unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19, reactions of Reddit opioid forum users ranged from increased distress in accessing and sustaining treatment, to encouragement surrounding new modes of treatment and opportunities to engage in care.

We reviewed the current evidence on the transmission dynamics and on pathogenic and clinical features of COVID-19 to critically identify any gaps in the current infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed global COVID-19 IPC guidelines by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Guidelines from 2 high-income countries (Australia and United Kingdom) and from 1 middle-income country (China) were also reviewed. We searched publications in English on 'PubMed' and Google Scholar. We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations, and exposures that may facilitate transmission. We then compared these findings with the recommended IPC measures. RESULTS: Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings occurs through droplets, aerosols, and the oral-fecal or fecal-droplet route. However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other. Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures. However, recommendations regarding the type of face mask varied, and the CDC recommends cloth masks when surgical masks are unavailable. CONCLUSION: IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and should target all patient care activities involving risk of person-to-person transmission.

Purpose The objective of this study is to investigate whether CQ and HCQ could be ACE2 blockers and used to inhibit 2019-nCoV virus infection. Methods In our study, we used CCK-8 staining, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining to evaluate the toxicity and autophagy of CQ and HCQ, respectively, on ACE2 high-expressing HEK293T cells (ACE2h cells). We further analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus was also used to observe the viropexis effect of CQ and HCQ in ACE2h cells. Results Results showed that HCQ is slightly more toxic to ACE2h cells than CQ. Both CQ and HCQ could bind to ACE2 with KD =(7.310.62)e?7 M and (4.820.87)e?7 M, respectively. They exhibit equivalent suppression effect for the entrance of 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus into ACE2h cells.

Here we describe expanded chemistry for the Digital Spatial Profiling platform to quantify whole transcriptomes in human and mouse tissues using a wide range of spatial profiling strategies and sample types. We designed multiplexed in situ hybridization probe pools targeting the protein-coding genes in the human and mouse transcriptomes, hereafter referred to as the human or mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA). We validated the human and mouse WTA assays using cell lines to demonstrate concordance with orthogonal gene expression profiling methods in profiled region sizes ranging from 10-500 cells. By benchmarking against bulk RNAseq and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate robust transcript detection possible down to 100 transcripts per region. To assess the performance of WTA across tissue and sample types, we applied WTA to biological questions in cancer, molecular pathology, and developmental biology. We show that spatial profiling with WTA can detect expected spatial gene expression differences between tumor and tumor microenvironment, identify spatial disease-specific heterogeneity in gene expression in histological structures of the human kidney, and comprehensively map transcriptional programs in anatomical substructures of nine organs in the developing mouse embryo. Digital Spatial Profiling technology with the WTA assays provides a flexible method for spatial whole transcriptome profiling applicable to diverse tissue types and biological contexts.","output":"Spatially resolved whole transcriptome profiling in human and mouse tissue using Digital Spatial Profiling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to examine the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CochraneLibrary, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and medRxiv pre-print databases using available MeSH terms for COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine. Data from all studies that focused on the effectiveness of HCQ with or without the addition of azithromycin (AZM) in confirmed COVID-19 patients, which were published up to 12 September 2020, were collated for analysis using CMA v.2.2.064. RESULTS Our systematic review retrieved 41 studies. Among these, 37 studies including 45,913 participants fulfilled the criteria for subsequent meta-analysis. The data showed no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the HCQ and control groups (RR: 1.02, 95% CI, 0.81-1.27). Combination of HCQ with AZM also did not lead to improved treatment outcomes (RR: 1.26, 95% CI, 0.91-1.74). Furthermore, the mortality difference was not significant, neither in HCQ treatment group (RR: 0.86, 95% CI, 0.71-1.03) nor in HCQ plus AZM treatment group (RR: 1.28, 95% CI, 0.76-2.14) in comparison to controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that age was the factor that significantly affected mortality (P<0.00001). CONCLUSION The meta-analysis found that there was no clinical benefit of using either HCQ by itself or in combination with AZM for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Hence, it may be prudent for clinicians and researchers to focus on other therapeutic options that may show greater promise in this disease.","output":"The Role of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent emergence of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transpired into pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has been rapidly transmitted across the globe within a short period of time, with more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths. The continuous rise in worldwide cases of COVID-19, transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 including re-infections and enormous case-fatality rates emphasizes the urgent need of potential preventive and therapeutic measures. The development of effective therapeutic and preventive measures relies on understanding the molecular and cellular mechanism of replication exhibited by SARS-CoV-2. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is ranging from 90-120 nm that comprises surface viral proteins including spike, envelope, membrane which are attached in host lipid bilayer containing the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral RNA. Spike (S) glycoprotein initiates the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 with a widely expressed cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and subsequent S glycoprotein priming via serine protease TMPRSS2. Prominently, comprehensive analysis of structural insights into the crucial SARS-CoV-2 proteins may lead us to design effective therapeutics molecules.

In this context, drone delivery systems are of great interest as they may allow for faster and cheaper deliveries. This paper presented a navigation system that makes feasible the delivery of parcels with autonomous drones. The system generates a path between a start and a final point and controls the drone to follow this path based on its localization obtained through GPS, 9DoF IMU, and barometer. In the landing phase, information of poses estimated by a marker (ArUco) detection technique using a camera, ultrawideband (UWB) devices, and the drones software estimation are merged by utilizing an extended Kalman filter algorithm to improve the landing precision. A vector field-based method controls the drone to follow the desired path smoothly, reducing vibrations or harsh movements that could harm the transported parcel.

Implementation of lung-protective ventilation including prone positioning for coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome is limited by isolation precautions and personal protective equipment scarcity. We sought to determine the safety and associated clinical outcomes for coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with prolonged prone position ventilation without daily repositioning. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study. SETTING: Community academic medical ICU. PATIENTS: Sequential mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Lung-protective ventilation and prolonged protocolized prone position ventilation without daily supine repositioning. Supine repositioning was performed only when Fio2 less than 60% with positive end-expiratory pressure less than 10 cm H2O for greater than or equal to 4 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary safety outcome: proportion with pressure wounds by Grades (0-4). Secondary outcomes: hospital survival, length of stay, rates of facial and limb edema, hospital-acquired infections, device displacement, and measures of lung mechanics and oxygenation. Eighty-seven coronavirus disease 2019 patients were mechanically ventilated. Sixty-one were treated with prone position ventilation, whereas 26 did not meet criteria. Forty-two survived (68.9%). Median (interquartile range) time from intubation to prone position ventilation was 0.28 d (0.11-0.80 d). Total prone position ventilation duration was 4.87 d (2.08-9.97 d). Prone position ventilation was applied for 30.3% (18.2-42.2%) of the first 28 days. Pao2:Fio2 diverged significantly by day 3 between survivors 147 (108-164) and nonsurvivors 107 (85-146), mean difference -9.632 (95% CI, -48.3 to 0.0; p = 005). Age, driving pressure, day 1, and day 3 Pao2:Fio2 were predictive of time to death. Thirty-eight (71.7%) developed ventral pressure wounds that were associated with prone position ventilation duration and day 3 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Limb weakness occurred in 58 (95.1%) with brachial plexus palsies in five (8.2%). Hospital-acquired infections other than central line-associated blood stream infections were infrequent.

Coronavirus is an infectious disease that has affected many countries, changing daily life. For many individuals, sexual activity has decreased, physical contact within couples has been reduced. Obviously, to maintain a safe sex life, it is essential to know how to avoid the virus transmission. Distance creates irritability, fear, anxiety, endangering sexual life: it is reasonable to have sex between cohabiting partners unless one or both are at risk of infection. Despite this, the pandemic allows us to think of new sexual intimacies mediated by sextoys and technology. Not all distant couples are willing to have sex online, and it is difficult for singles to engage in casual sexual relations, so after the pandemic there will be many couples who will have to remodel and many singles who will seek a partner. Using the Internet to maintain active sexual activity appeared to be an excellent alternative to diminish the distance between partners or to increase online knowledge. The most common advice for separated couples was to maintain constant digital contact to alleviate nostalgia and lack. This was the springboard to use sexting, meeting via webcam or making a hot call that make the couple more uninhibited. Using the webcam, also sometimes with the possibility to use sex toys, could create also the opportunity to enrich the future sexual repertoire. Practicing online sex with the stable partner far from home has helped some to keep their desire active and to satisfy it in order to be able to realize it once the pandemic has ended.

Various existing basic or advanced life support (BLS or ALS, respectively) rules for the termination of resuscitation (TOR) have been derived and validated in North America and Asian countries. This study aimed to evaluate the external validation of these rules in predicting the survival outcomes of OHCA patients in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study using the WinCOVID-19 Daegu registry data collected during February 18CMarch 31, 2020. The subjects were patients who showed cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology. The outcomes of each rule were compared to the actual patient survival outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, false positive value (FPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of each TOR rule were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 170 of the 184 OHCA patients were eligible and evaluated. TOR was recommended for 122 patients based on the international basic life support termination of resuscitation (BLS-TOR) rule, which showed 85% specificity, 74% sensitivity, 0.8% FPV, and 99% PPV for predicting unfavorable survival outcomes. When the traditional BLS-TOR rules and KoCARC TOR rule II were applied to our registry, one patient met the TOR criteria but survived at hospital discharge. With regard to the FPV (upper limit of 95% confidence interval < 5%), specificity (100%), and PPV (> 99%) criteria, only the KoCARC TOR rule I, which included a combination of three factors including not being witnessed by emergency medical technicians, presenting with an asystole at the scene, and not experiencing prehospital shock delivery or return of spontaneous circulation, was found to be superior to all other TOR rules. CONCLUSION: Among the previous nine BLS and ALS TOR rules, KoCARC TOR rule I was most suitable for predicting poor survival outcomes and showed improved diagnostic performance. Further research on variations in resources and treatment protocols among facilities, regions, and cultures will be useful in determining the feasibility of TOR rules for COVID-19 patients worldwide.

Results showed that the recombinant S1 protein was highly glycosylated, and the neutralizing antigenicity of recombinant S1 protein was lower than that of inactivated virus. However, anti-S1 ELISA indicated that the recombinant S1 protein induced antibodies against S1.

There are two main types of prophylaxis: chemical and mechanical. Chemical prophylaxis is very effective but causes bleeding complications in surgical wounds and remote organs. On the other hand, mechanical methods are free of hemorrhagic complications but are less effective. We hypothesized that mechanical prophylaxis is effective enough for Asians in whom VTE occurs less frequently. This study evaluated the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in the prevention of VTE after major hip surgery. METHODS Incidences of symptomatic VTE after primary total hip arthroplasty with and without application of IPC were compared. A total of 379 patients were included in the final analysis. The IPC group included 233 patients (106 men and 127 women) with a mean age of 54 years. The control group included 146 patients (80 men and 66 women) with a mean age of 53 years. All patients took low-dose aspirin for 6 weeks after surgery. IPC was applied to both legs just after surgery and maintained all day until discharge. When a symptom or a sign suspicious of VTE, such as swelling or redness of the foot and ankle, Homans' sign, and dyspnea was detected, computed tomography (CT) angiogram or duplex ultrasonogram was performed. RESULTS Until 3 months after surgery, symptomatic VTE occurred in three patients in the IPC group and in 6 patients in the control group. The incidence of VTE was much lower in the IPC group (1.3%) than in the control group (4.1%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Complications associated with the application of IPC were not detected in any patient. Patients affected by VTE were older and hospitalized longer than the unaffected patients.

Subsequent responsive UK Government guidance for older adults included self-isolation during the pandemic. It is therefore hypothesised that during the pandemic older adults are inadvertently deconditioned due to iatrogenic factors such as inactivity, social isolation, hospital-avoidance and malnutrition, and present with reduced resilience to illness and lower levels of function. The OPU continued to admit COVID-negative, or recently termed COVID-protected, patients throughout the pandemic. Data captured prior to, and during the COVID-19 pandemic has been compared to explore the implications on older adults, and elicit whether they are protected from the consequences of the pandemic? METHOD: Demographic and physical function data (average 6 m gait-speed, Elderly Mobility Scale) were captured pre- and through-pandemic for all patients admitted to a COVID-negative OPU ward over a one month period. Ethical review was provided through local Trust governance process. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic 2019 (n = 67, mean(SD) age 82.7(8.2) years, 61%, hospital length-of-stay (LOS) 7.9(7.3) days, hospital mortality-rate 7.2%) and through-pandemic 2020 (n = 73, 83.1(8.3) years, 59%, LOS 9.0(9.1) days, hospital mortality-rate 7.5%) data were captured during July 2019 and May 2020 respectively. There were no between-group differences in age [t(?.313) = 138, p = 0.755], gender [X(2), 1 df, p = 0.782], LOS [t(0.78) = 134, p = 0.44], or hospital mortality-rate [X(2) 1 df, p = 0.96].

RESULTS Analysis of 819 recent donors with 11,254 blood counts and 1464 questionnaires and 1011 historical donors with 12,848 blood counts revealed that increased annual platelet donation frequencies were associated with decreased lymphocyte counts in both groups. Median lymphocyte counts in recent donors with no versus 24 previous annual donations declined from 2.0 to 1.2  103 /L (p < 2.2  10-16 ), and those in historical donors with no versus 24 previous annual donations decreased from 2.0 to 1.5  103 /L (p = 6  10-4 ), respectively. The questionnaire results showed that donation frequency and lymphopenia were not associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) incidence or duration, but platelet donors who concomitantly donated granulocytes had significantly shorter URTI durations than those who did not (p = .008). CONCLUSION This study confirmed that plateletpheresis-associated lymphopenia occurs in LRS and to a lesser degree in non-LRS platelet donors, but revealed no evidence of a negative impact on donor health.","output":"Total platelet donation count and donation frequency are determinants of plateletpheresis-associated lymphopenia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened college students' mental health while simultaneously creating new barriers to traditional in-person care. Teletherapy and online self-guided mental health supports are two potential avenues for addressing unmet mental health needs when face-to-face services are less accessible, but little is known about factors that shape interest in these supports. Participants: 1,224 U.S. undergraduate students (mean age = 20.7; 73% female; 40% White) participated. Methods: Students completed an online questionnaire assessing interest in teletherapy and self-guided supports.

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) pathway, and males are more susceptible than females. After infection, immunopathological damage is noticed in the testicles, and the semen index is significantly reduced.

We assess the optimal allocation of a limited vaccine supply in the United States across groups differentiated by age and essential worker status, which constrains opportunities for social distancing. We model transmission dynamics using a compartmental model parameterized to capture current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate three alternative policy objectives (minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths) and model a dynamic strategy that evolves with the population epidemiological status. We find that this temporal flexibility contributes substantially to public health goals. Older essential workers are typically targeted first. However, depending on the objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to control spread or seniors to directly control mortality. When the objective is minimizing deaths, relative to an untargeted approach, prioritization averts deaths on a range between 20,000 (when nonpharmaceutical interventions are strong) and 300,000 (when these interventions are weak).

We first implement our MD pipeline to employ site-wise calculation of Kullback-Leibler divergence in atom fluctuation over replicate sets of short-term MD production runs thus enabling a statistical comparison of the rapid motion of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in both the presence and absence of three well-known neutralizing antibodies. Using this simple comparative method applied to motions of viral proteins, we successfully identified in silico all previously empirically confirmed sites of escape in influenza HA, predetermined via selection experiments and neutralization assays. Upon the validation of our computational approach, we then surveyed potential hot spot residues in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence of COVOX-222 and S2H97 antibodies. We identified many single sites in the antigen-antibody interface that are similarly prone to potential antibody escape and that match many of the known sites of mutations arising in the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In the omicron variant, we find only minimal adaptive evolutionary shifts in the functional binding profiles of both antibodies.

The identification of candidate drugs effective for COVID-19 is crucial, thus many natural products including phytochemicals are also being proposed for repurposing and evaluated for their potential in COVID-19. Among numerous phytochemicals, limonene (LMN), a dietary terpene of natural origin has been recently showed to target viral proteins in the in-silico studies. LMN is one of the main compounds identified in many citrus plants, available and accessible in diets and well-studied for its therapeutic benefits. Due to dietary nature, relative safety and efficacy along with favorable physicochemical properties, LMN has been suggested to be a fascinating candidate for further investigation in COVID-19. LMN showed to modulate numerous signaling pathways and inhibits inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostanoids, and eicosanoids. We hypothesized that given the pathogenesis of COVID-19 involving infection, inflammation, and immunity, LMN may have potential to limit the severity and progression of the disease owing to its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. The present article discusses the possibilities of LMN in SARS-CoV-2 infections based on its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. Though, the suggestion on the possible use of LMN in COVID-19 remains inconclusive until the in-silico effects confirmed in the experimental studies and further proof of the concept studies.

Such coding is usually done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex correlations among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve the performance. METHODS: To address the issues of model explainability and label correlations, we propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN), which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE) initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS (National Health Service) COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare the HLAN model and label embedding initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods, including variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RESULTS: HLAN achieved the best Micro-level AUC and F1 on the top-50 code prediction, 91.9% and 64.1%, respectively; and comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other models: around 97% Micro-level AUC. More importantly, in the analysis of model explanations, by highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label, HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to the CNN-based models and its downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Label embedding (LE) initialisation significantly boosted the previous state-of-the-art model, CNN with attention mechanisms, on the full code prediction to 52.5% Micro-level F1. The analysis of the layers initialised with label embeddings further explains the effect of this initialisation approach. The source code of the implementation and the results are openly available at https://github.com/acadTags/Explainable-Automated-Medical-Coding. CONCLUSION: We draw the conclusion from the evaluation results and analyses. First, with hierarchical label-wise attention mechanisms, HLAN can provide better or comparable results for automated coding to the state-of-the-art, CNN-based models. Second, HLAN can provide more comprehensive explanations for each label by highlighting key words and sentences in the discharge summaries, compared to the n-grams in the CNN-based models and the downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Third, the performance of deep learning based multi-label classification for automated coding can be consistently boosted by initialising label embeddings that captures the correlations among labels. We further discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the overall method regarding its potential to be deployed to a hospital and suggest areas for future studies.","output":"Explainable automated coding of clinical notes using hierarchical label-wise attention networks and label embedding initialisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health disaster.

Recommendations on the management of acute appendicitis have been based on expert opinion, but very little evidence is available. This study addressed that dearth with a snapshot of worldwide approaches to appendicitis. METHODS The Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe designed an online survey to assess the current attitude of surgeons globally regarding the management of patients with acute appendicitis during the pandemic. Questions were divided into baseline information, hospital organization and screening, personal protective equipment, management and surgical approach, and patient presentation before versus during the pandemic. RESULTS Of 744 answers, 709 (from 66 countries) were complete and were included in the analysis. Most hospitals were treating both patients with and those without COVID. There was variation in screening indications and modality used, with chest X-ray plus molecular testing (PCR) being the commonest (198 per cent). Conservative management of complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis was used by 66 and 24 per cent respectively before, but 237 and 53 per cent, during the pandemic (both P < 0001). One-third changed their approach from laparoscopic to open surgery owing to the popular (but evidence-lacking) advice from expert groups during the initial phase of the pandemic. No agreement on how to filter surgical smoke plume during laparoscopy was identified. There was an overall reduction in the number of patients admitted with appendicitis and one-third felt that patients who did present had more severe appendicitis than they usually observe. CONCLUSION Conservative management of mild appendicitis has been possible during the pandemic. The fact that some surgeons switched to open appendicectomy may reflect the poor guidelines that emanated in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Global attitudes in the management of acute appendicitis during COVID-19 pandemic: ACIE Appy Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a continued global threat to public health.

METHODS: Content analysis, expert consultation, and high frequency word analysis were applied in this study. Relevant data and information were collected from official websites, the experience accumulated in China during the fighting to the novel coronavirus, and suggestions from some experts. RESULTS: As of March 29, 2020, China had accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.01%; in the mean time, the global had accumulated 596 042 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.76%. Although the mortality of COVID-19 was not so high, its harmfulness couldnt be ignored. Ten facts during COVID-19 epidemic in China were summarized in the study, including: the COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread through many channels; although elderly people and people with underlying diseases are susceptible, young people can also be victims; isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and secondary disasters induced by COVID-19 should be emphasized in advance.

Since there was no rapid diagnostic method for complete diagnosis in the past, diagnosis was solely made on the basis of clinical symptoms or the time of infection. With recent developments in rapid diagnostic methods like multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, R-mix virus culture, etc., early detection and effective treatment of respiratory viral infections is possible. Herein, we compared the efficiency of multiplex RT-PCR and the R-mix virus culture for the rapid detection of respiratory viruses. METHODS We used 96 nasopharyngeal swab specimens for culturing respiratory viruses using R-mix (Diagnostics Hybrids Inc., USA). Afterwards, multiplex RT-PCR was performed using specimens stored at -70 degrees C. RESULTS R-mix virus culture yielded positive results in 34 cases (35.4%) and multiplex RT-PCR in 73 cases (76.0%). Both methods yielded identical results in 51 cases (29 positive cases and 22 negative cases). Among 45 cases that showed different results, 40 showed negative results in R-mix virus culture and positive results in multiplex RT-PCR, and 1 showed positive result in R-mix virus culture and negative result in multiplex RT-PCR. Different viruses were detected in the remaining 4 cases by both the methods. CONCLUSIONS Multiplex RT-PCR provided faster results and had higher detection rates than R-mix virus culture. Further, unlike R-mix virus culture, multiplex RT-PCR can be used to identify new respiratory viruses. Therefore, multiplex RT-PCR is more useful than R-mix virus culture in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infection.","output":"[Comparison of R-mix virus culture and multiplex reverse

METHOD: Retrospective observational study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 and bacterial/fungal infections at the Hospital Clnico Universitario of Valladolid, Spain (March 1-May 31, 2020). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were compared based on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and predictors of mortality by were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 712 COVID-19 patients, 113 (16%) presented bacterial/fungal coinfections or superinfections. Their median age was 73 years (IQR 57-89) and 59% were men. The profiles of ICU patients (44%) included male, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, leukocytosis, elevated inteleukin-6, with interferon ?-1b and tocilizumab and superinfection (p < 0.05). Coinfections were diagnosed in 5% (39/712) patients. Most common pathogens of respiratory coinfection (18) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (6) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Superinfections were detected in 11% (80/712) patients. Urinary (53) and RIs (39) constituted the majority of superinfections Acinetobacter baumannii multidrug-resistant was the main agent of IR and bacteremia. An outbreak of A. baumannii contributed to this result. Three patients were considered to have probable pulmonary aspergillosis. Mortality was higher in UCI patients (50 vs. 29%; p = 0.028).

Yet, to date, there are no data on the motivating benefit of SARs in a long-term interaction with post-stroke patients. METHODS: Here, we describe a robot-based gamified exercise platform, which we developed for long-term post-stroke rehabilitation. The platform uses the humanoid robot Pepper, and also has a computer-based configuration (with no robot). It includes seven gamified sets of exercises, which are based on functional tasks from the everyday life of the patients. The platform gives the patients instructions, as well as feedback on their performance, and can track their performance over time. We performed a long-term patient-usability study, where 24 post-stroke patients were randomly allocated to exercise with this platformeither with the robot or the computer configurationover a 5C7 week period, 3 times per week, for a total of 306 sessions. RESULTS: The participants in both groups reported that this rehabilitation platform addressed their arm rehabilitation needs, and they expressed their desire to continue training with it even after the study ended. We found a trend for higher acceptance of the system by the participants in the robot group on all parameters; however, this difference was not significant. We found that system failures did not affect the long-term trust that users felt towards the system. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the usability of using this platform for a long-term rehabilitation with post-stroke patients in a clinical setting. We found high levels of acceptance of both platform configurations by patients following this interaction, with higher ratings given to the SAR configuration.

Dozens of legislative proposals were presented to the national Parliament, however without great effectiveness or productive effects, showing initiatives of simple opportunity. The complex environment of taxation in Brazil, reinforced by the Covid-19 pandemic, suggests a more pragmatic incursion in the implementation of new sources of tax collection, demanding greater acuity in relation to the domestic socioeconomic situation that exposes a historically problematic panorama, whose fluctuations in inflation and interest rate cannot be ignored. This article proposes a discussion capable of inserting the Brazilian wealth tax in the macroeconomic context of the Brazilian State, undertaking a tying of the exception to the basic interest rate of the Brazilian economy (SELIC). In this perspective, without neglecting the necessary debate regarding the various elements involved in the proposals for the creation of a new Brazilian wealth tax, the study takes as its central theme the adoption of a specific criterion for the establishment of IGF rates, linked to the potential income of the taxpayer equity. It is not intended to investigate, in this way, the problems daily associated with the tax, such as the confrontation of the indeterminate concept (\\"great wealth\\"), the passive subjection of the tax obligation or the concrete quantitative limits of the exaction, but rather to raise a mechanism capable of adapting the tax rates applicable to the contingencies of a shifting economy. As a delimitation of the proposed theme, the article focuses closely on the need to link the tax rate to the percentage of the basic interest rate in Brazil. In the end, the investigation suggests that the link between tax and the SELIC rate is a considerable alternative to be discussed in the field of tax policy.","output":"Alquota do Imposto sobre Grandes Fortunas: Atrelamento  Taxa de Juros Bsica da Economia Brasileira (Selic)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parrot beak nail dystrophy is an excessive forward curvature of the nail plate that can affect both fingernails and toenails.

Vaccines are effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19, yet there remains a small proportion of the eligible population who choose not to vaccinate. Social media and online news sources are opportunities for targeted public health interventions to improve vaccine uptake. This study reports the results of a semi-structured interview study that explored the influence of media and information on individuals' self-reported intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was employed to gain insight from a diverse group of individuals. Adult participants were recruited through a related COVID-19 study; we used a maximum variation sampling technique and purposively sampled participants based on demographics. Interviews were conducted from February 2021 to May 2021. Themes from interviews were summarized with representative quotations according to the 3C Theoretical Framework (Confidence, Complacency, Convenience). RESULTS: Key themes identified following thematic analysis from 60 participants included: vaccine safety, choice of vaccine, fear mongering, trust in authority, belief in vaccinations (Confidence); delaying vaccination (Complacency); confusing information, access to vaccines and information (Convenience). While most participants intended to vaccinate, many expressed concerns and hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy prevents universal immunization and contradictory messages in media are a source of concern and fear. The success of future vaccine campaigns will depend upon authorities' ability to disseminate accessible, detailed, and consistent information promoting public confidence.","output":"Exploring the impact of media and information on self-reported intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19: A qualitative interview-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has severely impacted health professions education and assessment has mostly shifted online Major challenges remain especially about teaching-learning and assessment of clinical skills Interacting with an individual online does not provide the range of information provided by an in-person meeting There have been dramatic advances in computers and the internet in the last 60 years Extended reality (XR) is all real- and virtual-combined environments and human-computer interactions generated by computers and wearable devices The future physical world is likely to face multiple challenges It is likely that human interactions and learning will increasingly occur in XR spaces Three-dimensional holographic avatars and interacting and manipulating objects in XR spaces will become easier Most medical education can occur in these spaces Universities will invest substantially in these spaces The safety of the physical world, the cost and usability will determine the extent of use of these learning spaces ?

COVID-19 caused significant impact on healthcare industry, depleting resources and manpower, which led to disruption to graduate medical education and residency training. Surgical residents were affected by the pandemic both by reduced operative opportunities in most training centers and inducing stress and concerns about safety and wellbeing among residents. Spread of the SARS-Cov-2 was naturally accompanied with a gradual decrease in numbers of healthcare personnel which consequently increased the burden on residents. During these times of crisis and uncertainty, it is crucial that residency programs find alternative learning opportunities and deploy pre-designed, dynamic operational strategies to ensure high quality surgical services while optimizing resident safety and wellbeing. The COVID-19 crisis was a natural call for the essential need to add another dimension to residency competencies, which is Crisis-based learning and practice. Times of public health crisis are opportunities to reflect on the medical practice from an interdisciplinary and interprofessional perspective and train the residents to function as part of a larger, globally responsible team. It also calls upon adopting innovative instructional and learning strategies such as utilizing digital and online learning tools to complement learning. A holistic approach to the crisis was taken by the surgical residency program at the University of Illinois in Chicago, which addressed the issue from a resident, hospital, and public health standpoints. An operational strategy was introduced to optimize resident safety, maximize learning opportunities, support other non-surgical services, and promote online teaching and learning. This strategy is meant to serve as a dynamic reference for surgical residency programs and as an infrastructure for dealing with this and any upcoming healthcare crises in an efficient and resident-centered way.","output":"Surgical Residents in the Battle Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about genes that induce stem cells differentiation into astrocytes. We previously described that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) downregulation is directly related to neural differentiation under chemical induction in placenta-derived multipotent stem cells (PDMCs). Using this neural differentiation cell model, we cross-compared transcriptomic and proteomic data and selected 26 candidate genes with the same expression trends in both omics analyses. Those genes were further compared with a transcriptomic database derived from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Eighteen out of 26 candidates showed opposite expression trends between our data and the AD database. The mRNA and protein expression levels of those candidates showed downregulation of HSP27, S100 calcium-binding protein A16 (S100A16) and two other genes in our neural differentiation cell model. Silencing these four genes with various combinations showed that co-silencing HSP27 and S100A16 has stronger effects than other combinations for astrocyte differentiation. The induced astrocyte showed typical astrocytic star-shape and developed with ramified, stringy and filamentous processes as well as differentiated endfoot structures. Also, some of them connected with each other and formed continuous network. Immunofluorescence quantification of various neural markers indicated that HSP27 and S100A16 downregulation mainly drive PDMCs differentiation into astrocytes. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopic images showed the classical star-like shape morphology and co-expression of crucial astrocyte markers in induced astrocytes, while electrophysiology and Ca2+ influx examination further confirmed their functional characteristics. In conclusion, co-silencing of S100A16 and HSP27 without chemical induction leads to PDMCs differentiation into functional astrocytes.","output":"Downregulated Calcium-Binding Protein S100A16 and HSP27 in Placenta-Derived Multipotent Cells Induce Functional Astrocyte Differentiation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed outside China.

In this study, we aimed to explore the risk of maternal-fetal transmission before 24 weeks of gestation, through analysis of abortion materials collected from PCR-positive women with pregnancy loss. To the best of our knowledge, apart from case reports, this study is the first prospective work on the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy. METHODS: The patients who had attended our clinic with the diagnosis of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks of gestation were screened for COV?D-19. Vertical transmission in PCR-positive women was assessed through the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fetal-placental tissues by rt-PCR test. RESULTS: 24 of 210 (%11,4) pregnant women participating in the study had positive rt-PCR results. Placenta and curettage material samples of these PCR-positive patients were analyzed and all valid test results (21 samples) were negative for SARS CoV-2 RNA. In three cases, the rt-PCR results were invalid due to failed internal controls. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial.

The manual classification and diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia requires specialized personnel and is time consuming and very costly. On the other hand, automatic diagnosis would allow for real-time diagnosis without human intervention resulting in reduced costs. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a novel optimized Deep Learning (DL) approach for the automatic classification and diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia using X-ray images. For this purpose, a publicly available dataset of chest X-rays on Kaggle was used in this study. The dataset was developed over three stages in a quest to have a unified COVID-19 entities dataset available for researchers. The dataset consists of 21,165 anterior-to-posterior and posterior-to-anterior chest X-ray images classified as: Normal (48%), COVID-19 (17%), Lung Opacity (28%) and Viral Pneumonia (6%). Data Augmentation was also applied to increase the dataset size to enhance the reliability of results by preventing overfitting. An optimized DL approach is implemented in which chest X-ray images go through a three-stage process. Image Enhancement is performed in the first stage, followed by Data Augmentation stage and in the final stage the results are fed to the Transfer Learning algorithms (AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet) where the images are classified and diagnosed. Extensive experiments were performed under various scenarios, which led to achieving the highest classification accuracy of 95.63% through the application of VGG16 transfer learning algorithm on the augmented enhanced dataset with freeze weights. This accuracy was found to be better as compared to the results reported by other methods in the recent literature. Thus, the proposed approach proved superior in performance as compared with that of other similar approaches in the extant literature, and it made a valuable contribution to the body of knowledge.

METHODS: A total of 60 SLE patients, 70 RA patients and 35 HCs, who received a complete inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (Vero cells) regimen, were recruited in the current study. Serum IgG and IgM antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were determined by using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). RESULTS: There were no significant differences regarding the seroprevalences of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and the self-reported vaccination-related adverse events among SLE patients, RA patients and HCs. The inactivated COVID-19 vaccines appeared to be well-tolerated and moderately immunogenic. In addition, case-only analysis indicated that in SLE patients, the disease manifestation of rash and anti-SSA autoantibody were associated with seroprevalence of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2, whereas the uses of ciclosporin and leflunomide had influence on the seroprevalence of IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2. In RA patients, rheumatoid factor (RF) appeared to be associated with the seroprevalence of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2.

We include examples of rising rates of asymptomatic infection with population-level masking, including in closed settings (e.g., cruise ships) with and without universal masking. Asymptomatic infections may be harmful for spread but could actually be beneficial if they lead to higher rates of exposure. Exposing society to SARS-CoV-2 without the unacceptable consequences of severe illness with public masking could lead to greater community-level immunity and slower spread as we await a vaccine.

Methodology: This is a descriptive design study conducted among the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population via an online application between 1 March and 1 May 2020. Three hundred twenty people participated in this questionnaire study. The data were collected through an online form, relying upon a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire had three main parts. The first part is related to the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample, including gender, age, family status, address status and education level. The second part involves the items related to precautionary measures using none, sometimes, and always. The last part contains items related to death probability owing to other causes and this includes five categories: extremely low, low, intermediate, high and extremely high. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire were revised by the panel of experts before the data collection. Results: The outcomes of the study revealed that the majority, ca. 73%, of the Kurdistan Region/Iraq population depended on TV to obtain information about COVID-19. Also, this investigation showed that there is a substantial association between participants with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19. Moreover, according to this study, there is a significant relationship between the death probability and COVID-19. Concurrently, there is not any significant association between other causes, namely cancer, heart diseases, diabetes and road traffic accidents, and the death probability.

The goal of this study is to investigate mechanisms of neuroinflammation in Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-treated mouse model and SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In this research I will assay vascular reactivity of cerebral vessels to assess vascular dysfunction within the microcirculation. I will determine expression of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors and AT1 receptors (AT1R) in isolated microvessels from the circle of Willis to assess inflammation, thrombosis and RAS activity in the microvasculature. LPS and SARS-CoV-2, are both associated with coagulopathies and because of that I will measure concentration of PAI-1, von Willebrand Factor, thrombin and D-dimer to assess the thrombotic pathway in the circulation. Histology and immunohistochemistry will assess immune cell type infiltration into the brain parenchyma, microglia activation and severity of neuroinflammation and neural injury. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We hypothesize that under conditions of reduced ACE2 (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 infection), AT1R activity is upregulated in the microvasculature. In the presence of an inflammatory insult, these AT1Rs promote endothelialitis and immunothrombosis through pro-thrombotic pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokine production leading to endothelial dysfunction in the microvasculature, blood brain barrier (BBB) injury, deficits in cognition and increased anxiety. We will test this hypothesis through 2 aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of the pro-injury arm of the RAS in the pathophysiology of the brain in animal models of neuroinflammation and COVID-19. Aim 1: Determine the role of the protective arm of the RAS in the pathophysiology of the brain in animal models of neuroinflammation and COVID-19. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study will provide insights that will complement on-going clinical trials on angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19.

Among these changes, the most reported was the reduction in the levels of some atmospheric pollutants related to urban and industrial activities. In Brazil, the state of Rio Grande do Sul adopted a Controlled Distance Model (MDC) with 4 different stages of distancing measures based on the restriction of human activities, represented by colors (yellow, orange, red and black). The objective of the study was to evaluate the behavior of air pollutants (O-3, NO2, SO2, PM2,5 e CO) during the first 15 weeks of the implementation of the MDC in five municipalities in the extreme south of the state (Pelotas, Rio Grande, Bage, Candiota and Herval). Interestingly, the levels of some pollutants were increased in the most restrictive scenarios of the MDC, especially O-3 in 4 municipalities and SO2, NO2 and CO in Candiota and Bage. In addition, a similar scenario was found when the levels of air pollutants were related to the time of implementation of the MDC, indirectly reflecting a decrease in adherence to restrictive measures imposed by social isolation, mainly due to the increase in the levels of pollutants over the 15 weeks evaluated.

Disease can result in poor feed conversion, reduced weight gain, and can lead to the development of necrotic enteritis. For prevention of coccidiosis, poultry are commonly vaccinated with a live, sporulated oocysts mass applied with a vaccination cabinet in the hatchery. Traditionally, coccidia vaccines have been applied by coarse spray in a water based diluent, however, new technology using gel diluents has entered the US market. Gel diluents can have variable viscosities and are dropped onto chicks with an applicator bar. It is thought that gel droplets remain intact on the birds for longer than water based droplets, allowing more time for preening and ingestion of oocysts. In this experiment, the efficacy of a commercial coccidia vaccine applied with a water based diluent, a more viscous gel diluent, and a less viscous gel diluent was compared. Fecal samples were collected at multiple time points post-vaccination to quantify vaccine oocyst shedding. Shedding in the first cycle (days 5 to 8 post-vaccination) was related to the number of oocysts received from each application method, where the groups receiving higher doses shed more oocysts. However, a decrease in shedding was seen for the more viscous gel group in the second cycle (days 12 to 15 post-vaccination). Chickens were challenged with Eimeria maxima oocysts and 7 days post-challenge body weight gains and gross and microscopic lesions were recorded to evaluate protection levels for the different vaccine applications. All vaccinated groups appeared to be protected based on body weight gain and lesion scoring. The results of this project indicate that all vaccine applications are effective at protecting against Eimeria maxima challenge when using a proper dose of vaccine that allows for repeated oocyst cycling in the litter post-vaccination.","output":"Evaluation of a coccidia vaccine using spray and gel applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to determine the knowledge of the students about Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) before the Philippines government implements the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon A descriptive research design was conducted among the students of Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology, San Isidro Campus The sample size was computed by using the Epi-Info version 2000 Computer Programme Questionnaire was used to collect data that was composed of the profile, questions regarding their knowledge about COVID-19 and their source of knowledge Permission to conduct and informed consent was obtained before the respondent answer the questionnaire Data were analyzed using various statistical tools Majority of the respondents had an average and good knowledge while sex was the only variable that differs significantly in their knowledge about COVID-19 Social media and seminars in the school were among their primary source of knowledge It is concluded that students knowledge about COVID-19 was sufficient However, the absence of vaccines against COVID-19, prevention and control of the disease was the only way to fight it which requires organizing health education campaigns in different communities to disseminate more information on how everybody can effectively deal with this pandemic ? 2020, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan - Faculty of Publich Health All rights reserved","output":"Knowledge about covid-19 among university students before the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine in philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence and course of COVID-19 and the risk of an upper respiratory tract infection in a group of people with physically active lifestyles.

This is coupled with a trend in which the intensity and frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and earthquakes have increased over the past decades. Larger and more diverse communities have been negatively influenced by these disasters and they might encounter crises socially and/or economically, further exacerbated when the natural disasters and pandemics co-occurred. However, conventional disaster response and management rely on human surveys and case studies to identify these in-crisis communities and their problems, which might not be effective and efficient due to the scale of the impacted population. In this paper, we propose to utilize the data-driven techniques and recent advances in artificial intelligence to automate the in-crisis community identification and improve its scalability and efficiency. Thus, immediate assistance to the in-crisis communities can be provided by society and timely disaster response and management can be achieved. A novel framework of the in-crisis community identification has been presented, which can be divided into three subtasks: (1) community detection, (2) in-crisis status detection, and (3) community demand and problem identification.

The principal causes of AMS have yet to be determined. We aimed to identify the common causes of AMS in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department with AMS on arrival. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients presenting with AMS to three New York hospitals, from March 1 to April 16, 2020. Underlying causes of AMS on arrival to the emergency department (ED) were categorized as (1) neurological causes (stroke, seizure, encephalitis); (2) metabolic encephalopathy; (3) indeterminant. Multivariable analysis was used to assess independent predictors. RESULTS: Overall, 166 patients presented to the ED with AMS. Metabolic encephalopathy was diagnosed as the cause in 154 (92.8%), with 118 (71.1%) categorized as multifactorial ME and 36 (21.7%) with single-cause ME. Hypoxia 103 (62.0%) and renal failure 75 (45.2%) were the most common underlying mechanisms. Neurological causes of AMS occurred in a total 20 patients (12%) and as the sole factor in 5 (3.0%); 10 (6.0%) cases were seizure related and 10 (6.0%) were cerebrovascular events. Of the 7 patients with indeterminant causes, only 1 was suspicious for encephalitis (0.6%). Age, pre-existing dementia and cerebrovascular disease, and impaired renal function were independent predictors of AMS. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, AMS on presentation to the ED is most frequently caused by metabolic encephalopathy (delirium). Seizures and cerebrovascular events contribute to a lesser degree; encephalitis appears rare.

Information about the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who were not admitted to hospital is limited. Some risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19 are controversial (eg, smoking). Moreover, the impact of city closure on mortality and admission rates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19 infection among a sample of patients in Wuhan whose conditions were reported on social media. METHODS: We enrolled 599 patients with COVID-19 from 67 hospitals in Wuhan in the study; 117 of the participants (19.5%) were not admitted to hospital. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features of the patients were extracted from their social media posts and coded. Telephone follow-up was conducted 1 month later (between March 15 and 23, 2020) to check the clinical outcomes of the patients and acquire other relevant information. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 who died (72 years, IQR 66.5-82.0) was significantly higher than that of patients who recovered (61 years, IQR 53-69, P<.001). We found that lack of admission to hospital (odds ratio [OR] 5.82, 95% CI 3.36-10.1; P<.001), older age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.1; P<.001), diffuse distribution (OR 11.09, 95% CI 0.93-132.9; P=.058), and hypoxemia (odds ratio 2.94, 95% CI 1.32-6.6; P=.009) were associated with increasing odds of death. Smoking was not significantly associated with mortality risk (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.44-1.85; P=.78).

METHODSData on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were extracted from the Israeli Ministry of Health database for the period August to September 2021 regarding all persons previously infected or vaccinated. We compared infection rates as a function of time since the last immunity-conferring event using Poisson regression, adjusting for possible confounding factors. RESULTSConfirmed infection rates increased according to time elapsed since the last immunity-conferring event in all cohorts. For unvaccinated previously infected individuals they increased from 10.5 per 100,000 risk-days for those previously infected 4-6 months ago to 30.2 for those previously infected over a year ago. For individuals receiving a single dose following prior infection they increased from 3.7 per 100,000 person days among those vaccinated in the past two months to 11.6 for those vaccinated over 6 months ago.

METHODS: Five frontline echocardiographers performed and interpreted B-TTE for 30 patients with COVID-19 in the isolation wards, and the on-site B-TTE reports (OSR) were generated. Then remote consultation over the 30 B-TTE studies was conducted by two experienced echocardiographic consultants while blinded to the OSR, and the corresponding remote consultation reports (RCR) were generated. Subsequently, the five frontline echocardiographers were convened together to discuss the difference between the OSR and RCR, and to confirm the correct interpretation and the misdiagnosis using a \\"majority-vote\\" consensus as the diagnostic \\"gold standard\\". Afterwards the reasons for the misdiagnosis were given by the frontline echocardiographers themselves. The inter-rater agreement between the OSR and the \\"gold standard\\" was assessed using Kappa coefficient and percent agreement. RESULTS: Complete correctness of the 30 copies of the RCR were determined by the 5 frontline echocardiographers.

Results: n=306, 244 women (79.7%), with an average age of 43 years (range 23-65). Of the total, 129 (42.2%) were physicians, 112 (36.6%) nurses and 65 (21.2%) other health workers. 208 (79.7%) used surgical masks and 53 (20.3%) used filtering masks. Of all those surveyed, 158 (51.6%) presented de novo headache. The occurrence of headache was independently associated with the use of a filtering mask, OR 2.14 (IC95% 1.07-4.32), being a nurse OR 2.09 (IC95% 1.18-3.72) or another health worker OR 6.94 (IC95% 3.01-16.04) or having a history of asthma OR 0.29 (IC95% 0.09-0.89). Depending on the type of mask used there were differences in headache intensity. And the impact of headache in the subjects who used a filtering mask was worse in the all aspects evaluated. Conclusions: The appearance of de novo headache is associated with the use of filtering masks and is more frequent in certain health care workers, causing a greater occupational, family, personal and social impact.","output":"Mask-associated de novo headache in healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19s lockdown policies saw Modern Manufacturing Practice (MMP) C batch/mass/just-in-time supply chains C severed and societal demands rapidly change from products such as vehicles and clothing to Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), ventilators and equipment for remote working. The critical and, in many cases, life preserving, need for responsive manufacturing resulted in government and frontline services turning to societys Additive Manufacturing (AM) capability in homes, schools, universities, and industry to provide essential products and product replacements. While AM managed to respond and support some government and frontline services, the highly distributed and diverse nature of the nations AM resources resulted in potentially avoidable production inefficiencies and delays. This paper develops and evaluates a series of strategies for coordinating AM for rapidly changing product demand to further enhance the responsiveness and productivity of AM. The strategies presented in the paper employ a host-client agent-based architecture that enable local governance of production thereby enabling distributed AM resource to come together to tackle societys production needs without the need for centralised coordination. To enable and support local governance, it is necessary to understand how the combination of production logics impact the overall performance of the production system. Correspondingly, the contribution of this paper lies in the characterisation and quantification of the impacts of production logic through the metrics of Time in System, Lateness and Jobs in Queue and the consequences for responsive AM production systems.","output":"Responding to rapidly changing product demand through a coordinated additive manufacturing production system: a COVID-19 case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Case series with different clinical presentations indicating central nervous system (CNS) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been published. Comprehensive work-ups including clinical characteristics, laboratory, electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are needed to understand the mechanisms. Design: We evaluated 32 consecutive patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at a tertiary care centre from March 09 to April 03, 2020 for concomitant severe central nervous system (CNS) symptoms occurring during their critical disease state. Those with CNS disorders were examined in detail regarding clinical characteristics and undergoing additional examinations, e.g. computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (EEG), (CSF) analysis and autopsy if they had died. Results: Of 32 critically ill patients with COVID-19 eight (18%) had severe CNS involvement (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [6.8] years;seven men;two patients died). All eight patients had cardiovascular risk factors, most frequently arterial hypertension. Two patients presented with lacunar ischemic stroke and one with status epilepticus in the early phase. As most common presentation, six patients presented with prolonged impaired consciousness after termination of analgosedation. In all but one with delayed wake-up, neuroimaging or autopsy showed multiple cerebral microbleeds, in three of them with additional subarachnoid haemorrhage and in another two with additional small ischemic lesions. In three patients intracranial vessel wall sequence MRI was performed, for the first time to our knowledge. All cases showed contrast-enhancement of vessel walls in large and middle-sized cerebral arteries, suggesting vascular wall pathologies with an inflammatory component. CSF analysis showed normal cells counts and chemistry. RT-PCRs for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF were all negative, and no intrathecal SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG synthesis was detectable. Conclusions: CNS disorders are common in patients with severe COVID-19. Different mechanisms might be involved. Besides unspecific encephalopathy and encephalitic syndromes, large vessel strokes might occur early after disease onset. In a later phase, microbleeds and microinfarctions indicate potential CNS small vessel disease. MRI vessel wall contrast enhancement suggests cerebral vascular wall pathologies with an inflammatory component. CNS disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to long-term disabilities aggravating socio-economic damage. The mechanisms have to be investigated urgently in order to develop preventive and therapeutic neuroprotective strategies.","output":"Central Nervous System Disorders in Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection: detailed clinical work-up of eight cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the declaration of severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus-2019 as pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, there has been a steady rise in number of cases.

Moreover, recent findings have documented a divergent group of arenaviruses in captive alethinophidian snakes. Human infections occur through mucosal exposure to aerosols or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious materials. Arenaviruses merit interest both as highly tractable experimental model systems to study acute and persistent infections and as clinically important human pathogens including Lassa (LASV) and Junin (JUNV) viruses, the causative agents of Lassa and Argentine hemorrhagic fevers (AHFs), respectively, for which there are no FDA-licensed vaccines, and current therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin (Rib) that has significant limitations. Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bi-segmented negative strand (NS) RNA genome. Each genome segment, L (ca 7.3 kb) and S (ca 3.5 kb), uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two polypeptides in opposite orientation, separated by a noncoding intergenic region (IGR). The S genomic RNA encodes the virus nucleoprotein (NP) and the precursor (GPC) of the virus surface glycoprotein that mediates virus receptor recognition and cell entry via endocytosis. The L genome RNA encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or L polymerase) and the small (ca 11 kDa) RING finger protein Z that has functions of a bona fide matrix protein including directing virus budding. Arenaviruses were thought to be relatively stable genetically with intra- and interspecies amino acid sequence identities of 90C95 % and 44C63 %, respectively. However, recent evidence has documented extensive arenavirus genetic variability in the field. Moreover, dramatic phenotypic differences have been documented among closely related LCMV isolates. These data provide strong evidence of viral quasispecies involvement in arenavirus adaptability and pathogenesis. Here, we will review several aspects of the molecular biology of arenaviruses, phylogeny and evolution, and quasispecies dynamics of arenavirus populations for a better understanding of arenavirus pathogenesis, as well as for the development of novel antiviral strategies to combat arenavirus infections.","output":"Arenavirus Quasispecies and Their Biological Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum La ranimation cardiopulmonaire de base est le cha?non le plus important de la cha?ne de survie de larrt cardiaque mais est aussi le plus fragile.

Oral administration of these compounds to obtain desired pulmonary exposures resulted in dose-limiting systemic toxicity in humans. However, pulmonary drug delivery enables direct and rapid administration to obtain higher local tissue concentrations in target tissue. In this work, inhalable formulations for thermal aerosolization of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were developed, and their physicochemical properties were characterized. Thermal aerosolization of 40 mg/mL chloroquine and 100 mg/mL hydroxychloroquine formulations delivered respirable aerosol particle sizes with 0.15 and 0.33 mg per 55 mL puff, respectively. In vitro toxicity was evaluated by exposing primary human bronchial epithelial cells to aerosol generated from Vitrocell. An in vitro exposure to 7.24 g of chloroquine or 7.99 g hydroxychloroquine showed no significant changes in cilia beating, transepithelial electrical resistance, and cell viability. The pharmacokinetics of inhaled aerosols was predicted by developing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model that included a detailed species-specific respiratory tract physiology and lysosomal trapping. Based on the model predictions, inhaling emitted doses comprising 1.5 mg of chloroquine or 3.3 mg hydroxychloroquine three times a day may yield therapeutically effective concentrations in the lung. Inhalation of higher doses further increased effective concentrations in the lung while maintaining lower systemic concentrations. Given the theoretically favorable risk/benefit ratio, the clinical significance for pulmonary delivery of aerosolized chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 needs to be established in rigorous safety and efficacy studies.

In this Health Policy paper, we look at the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and historical spending in the UK and comparable countries, assess the role of private spending, and review spending projections to estimate future needs. Public spending on health has increased by 37% a year on average since the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in 1948 and, since then, has continued to assume a larger share of both the economy and government expenditure. In the decade before the ongoing pandemic started, the rate of growth of government spending for the health and care sector slowed. We argue that without average growth in public spending on health of at least 4% per year in real terms, there is a real risk of degradation of the NHS, reductions in coverage of benefits, increased inequalities, and increased reliance on private financing. A similar, if not higher, level of growth in public spending on social care is needed to provide high standards of care and decent terms and conditions for social care staff, alongside an immediate uplift in public spending to implement long-overdue reforms recommended by the Dilnot Commission to improve financial protection.

This report describes a novel approach to support patient safety. METHODS: An interdisciplinary childrens hospital team developed a brief ED-based evaluation process called the ED Rapid Assessment of Patients Intended for Inpatient Disposition (ED RAPID). It entails a brief evaluation of vital signs and clinical stability by the ED attending physician and nurse. Children deemed stable are admitted to inpatient wards, whereas those requiring immediate intervention undergo full ED evaluation and disposition. We assessed outcomes for all children evaluated through this process from March 2013 through February 2015. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 715 patients undergoing ED RAPID evaluation. Of these, we directly admitted 691 (96.4%) to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation; median ED treatment time was 4.0 minutes. We transitioned 24 (3.4%) to full ED evaluation, 14 (2.0%) because a ward bed was unavailable, and 10 (1.4%) for clinical reasons identified in the evaluation. We admitted four of the 10 stopped (40% of stops, 0.6% of total) to an intensive care unit, and 6 (60% of stops, 0.8% of total) to the hospital ward after ED care.

Currently, no causal therapy is available and treatment is purely supportive. The main reason for death in critically ill patients is acute respiratory failure. However, in a number of patients a severe hyperinflammatory response with excessively elevated proinflammatory cytokines causes vasoplegic shock resistant to vasopressor therapy. A new polystyrene-based hemoadsorber (CytoSorb?, Cytosorbents Inc., New Jersey, USA) has been shown to adsorb effectively cytokines and other middle molecular weight toxins this way reducing their blood concentrations. This has been routinely used in clinical practice in the EU for other conditions where a cytokine storm occurs and an observational study has just been completed on COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that the extracorporeal elimination of cytokines in critically ill COVID-19 patients with suspected hyperinflammation and shock may stabilize hemodynamics and improve outcome. The primary endpoint is time until resolution of vasoplegic shock, which is a well implemented, clinically relevant endpoint in critical care studies. TRIAL DESIGN: Phase IIb, multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, 1:1 parallel group pilot study comparing the additional use of CytoSorb to standard of care without CytoSorb. PARTICIPANTS: Patients are recruited from the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of 7 participating centers in Germany (approximately 10 ICUs). All patients aged 18- 80 with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2, a C-reactive protein (CRP)  100 mg/l, a Procalcitonin (PCT) < 2 ng/l, and suspected cytokine storm defined via a vasoplegic shock (Norepinephrine > 0.2 g/min/kg to achieve a Mean Arterial Pressure  65mmHg). Patients are included irrespective of indication for renal replacement therapy. Suspected or proven bacterial cause for vasoplegic shock is a contraindication. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Within 24 hours after meeting the inclusion criteria patients will be randomized to receive either standard of care or standard of care and additional CytoSorb therapy via a shaldon catheter for 3-7 days. Filter exchange is done every 24 hours. If patients receive antibiotics, an additional dose of antibiotics is administered after each change of CytoSorb filter in order to prevent underdosing due to CytoSorb treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome is time to resolution of vasoplegic shock (defined as no need for vasopressors for at least 8 hours in order to sustain a MAP  65mmHg) in days. Secondary outcomes are 7 day mortality after fulfilling the inclusion criteria, mortality until hospital discharge, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) measurement on day 1 and 3, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU-stay, catecholamine dose on day 1/2/3 after start of CytoSorb and acute kidney injury. RANDOMIZATION: An electronic randomization will be performed using the study software secuTrial? administered by the Clinical Study Center (CSC) of the Charit C Universit?tsmedizin Berlin, Germany. Randomization is done in blocks by 4 stratified by including center. BLINDING (MASKING): The trial will be non-blinded for the clinicians and patients. The statistician will receive a blinded data set, so that all analyses will be conducted blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): As this is a pilot study with the goal to examine the feasibility of the study design as well as the intervention effect, no formal sample size calculation was conducted. A total number of approximately 80-100 patients is planned (40-50 patients per group). Safety assessment is done after the inclusion of each 10 patients per randomization group. TRIAL STATUS: Please see the study protocol version from April 24 2020. Recruitment of patients is still pending. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on April 27 2020 in the German Registry of Clinical Trials (DRKS) under the number DRKS00021447.

The plasma fully neutralized the virus for 7 passages, but after 45 days, the deletion of F140 in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) N3 loop led to partial breakthrough. At day 73, an E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) occurred, followed at day 80 by an insertion in the NTD N5 loop containing a new glycan sequon, which generated a variant completely resistant to plasma neutralization. Computational modeling predicts that the deletion and insertion in loops N3 and N5 prevent binding of neutralizing antibodies. The recent emergence in the United Kingdom and South Africa of natural variants with similar changes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to escape an effective immune response and that vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants should be developed.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 escape in vitro from a highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE SARS-CoV-2 has been compared with other strains of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and with the flu viruses: all of them manifest themselves with respiratory symptoms and, although their genetic patterns are similar, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly reached global dimensions, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus with greater spreading capacity, albeit less lethal. Compared with influenza viruses, coronaviruses have a longer incubation period and the patients with coronaviruses' syndromes develop more severe diseases requiring frequent hospitalizations and intensive care admissions. The aim was to explore the relationships between seasonal influenza vaccination and coronavirus infection and to understand whether this hypothetic role by the flu vaccines modifies SARS-CoV-2 infection's outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this retrospective, multicenter study, we enrolled 952 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection; 448 were admitted to our two main hospitals in Ferrara territory, while the remaining 504 were isolated at home. We compared the group of patients who had been vaccinated for influenza in the previous 12 months to that of unvaccinated patients. RESULTS Significant differences were found for both the need for hospitalization and 30-day mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We found age to be the only independent risk factor for a worse 30-day prognosis, while gender, influenza vaccinations and age itself were independent risk factors for undergoing hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS In our groups of patients, we found a relationship between seasonal influenza vaccinations and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age seems to be the main risk factor for short-term mortality in COVID-19 inpatients, while the influenza vaccination is, together with gender and age itself, a determining factor in predicting the need for hospitalization.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and H1N1 vaccination: does a relationship between the two factors really exist?

We characterized anti-Spike (S)-IgA and -IgG antibody responses in 431 individuals and found that about 85% develop and maintain anti-S-IgG responses over time. In a subsample of 64 participants selected for a detailed characterization of immune responses, we additionally evaluated anti-Nucleocapsid (N)-IgG antibodies and T cell responses specific to viral Membrane (M), N, and S proteins. Most participants had detectable T cell responses to at least one of the four peptide pools analyzed, which were more frequent than antibody seropositivity. We found a moderate correlation between antibody and T cell responses, which declined over time and suggests important variability in response patterns between individuals. The heterogeneity of immune trajectories was further analyzed using cluster analyses taking into account joint antibody and T cell responses over time. We identified five distinct immune trajectory patterns, which were characterized by specific antibody, T cell and T cell subset patterns along with disease severity and demographic factors. Higher age, male sex, higher disease severity and being a non-smoker was significantly associated with stronger immune responses. Overall, the results highlight that there is a consistent and maintained antibody response among most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, while T cell responses appear to be more heterogenous but potentially compensatory among those with low antibody responses.

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in psychiatric morbidities, including psychosis. Various putative biological and psychosocial changes have been implicated in COVID-19-related psychosis. COVID-19 is a proinflammatory state. Alterations in immunological processes both as a direct consequence of infection or secondary to the hyperimmune response heuristically explain the etiopathogenesis of psychosis in the affected individual. The uses of immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory drugs may be the other moderators of a psychotic presentation in COVID-19 patients. Evidence to substantiate this hypothesis is still lacking however, which further studies should address. Because of its management implications, a better understanding of the involved immunological mechanisms becomes extremely important.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend prescribing renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) to prevent diabetic nephropathy at any stage. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effects of RAASi with placebo and other antihypertensive agents in adults with diabetes on continuous and binary kidney outcomes to provide a comprehensive review of the class effect of RAASi on several subgroups. METHODS A systematic electronic search to identify randomized clinical trials of a duration of  12 months that recruited  50 adult participants with type 1 or 2 diabetes with any stage of chronic kidney disease and proteinuria was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane library with no language restriction. Studies were screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria by two reviewers independently. RESULTS In this meta-analysis, evidence was drawn from 26,551 patients with diabetes from 46 studies. Our analysis shows that RAASi were better than placebo in reducing SrCr (the raw mean difference [RMD] = -13.4 mol/L; 95%CI: -16.78; -10.01) and albuminuria levels (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -1; 95%CI: -1.57, -0.44, I2 = 96%). When compared to other active treatments, RAASi did not reduce SrCr (RMD = 0.03 mol/L; 95%CI: -6.4, 6.10, I2 = 76%), caused a non-significant reduction of GFR levels (RMD = -1.21 mL/min; 95%CI: -4.52, 2.09, I2 = 86%), and resulted in modest reduction of albuminuria levels (SMD = -0.55; 95%CI: -0.95, -0.16, I2 = 90%). RAASi were superior to placebo in reducing the risks of kidney failure (OR = 0.74; 95%CI: 0.56, 0.97) and doubling of serum creatinine levels (SrCr; OR = 0.71; 95%CI: 0.55, 0.91), but not in promoting the regression of albuminuria (OR = 3.00; 95%CI: 0.96, 9.37). RAASi, however, were not superior to other antihypertensives in reducing the risks of these outcomes. Patients with type 2 diabetes, macroalbuminuria and longer duration of diabetes had less risk of developing kidney failure in placebo-controlled trials, while longer duration of diabetes, normal kidney function, and hypertension increased the probability of achieving regression of albuminuria in active-controlled trials. CONCLUSION While our findings revealed the non-superiority of RAASi over other antihypertensives and portrayed a class effect on several subgroups of study participants, it raised a challenging question on whether RAASi deserve their place as first-line therapy in managing diabetic nephropathy.","output":"The effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors on continuous and binary kidney outcomes in subgroups of patients with diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between two recent currents in postsecondary education C integrative learning and undergraduate innovation.

We aimed at identifying the variables associated with psychological distress during the lockdown between April and May 2020 in the Italian academic population. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional online survey (IO CONTO 2020) within five Italian universities. Among about 240,000 individuals invited to participate through institutional communications, 18 120 filled the questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured by the self-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The covariates collected included demographic and lifestyle characteristics, trust in government, doctors and scientists. Associations of covariates with influenza-like symptoms or positive COVID-19 test and with psychological distress were assessed by multiple regression models at the local level; a meta-analysis of the results was then performed. Severe levels of anxiety or depression were reported by 20% of the sample and were associated with being a student or having a lower income, irrespective of their health condition and worries about contracting the virus. The probability of being severely anxious or depressed also depended on physical activity: compared to those never exercising, the highest OR being for those who stopped during lockdown (1.53; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.84) and the lowest for those who continued (0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95). Up to 21% of severe cases of anxiety or depression might have been avoided if during lockdown participants had continued to exercise as before.

Low IL-37 responses predicted severe clinical prognosis in combination with IL-8 and CRP. In addition, we observed that IL-37 administration was able to attenuate lung inflammation and alleviate respiratory tissue damage in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that IL-37 plays a protective role by antagonizing inflammatory responses while retaining type I IFN, thereby maintaining the functionalities of vital organs. IL-37, IL-8 and CRP might be formulated as a precise prediction model for screening severe clinical cases and have good value in clinical practice.","output":"Early plasma IL-37 responses accompanied with low inflammatory cytokines correlate with benign clinical outcomes during SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physiotherapy (PT) is an allied health profession that is generally taught at universities with face-to-face learning to deliver the required knowledge and practical skills of PT. The education sector has transitioned to distance learning (DL) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to evaluate PT students' perception of quality of DL and satisfaction with DL, and identify potential predictors of student satisfaction with DL during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. An online survey included demographic information, and the Distance Education Learning Environments Survey (DELES) was sent to PT students in Jordan. Regression analyses were used to identify the predictors of student satisfaction with DL. RESULTS: A total of 296 students completed the survey. Most students rated the overall quality of DL as good. However, they were not satisfied with DL. Instructor support for students, personal relevance, previous experience in DL, and being a master's student were the potential predictors of DL satisfaction. CONCLUSION: PT students rated the quality of DL as good with low level of satisfaction. Students' perceptions of and satisfaction with using DL were correlated to several potential predictors that could be considered for improving the DL experience in PT education.","output":"Predictors of distance learning in physiotherapy students during COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). At the time of conducting this study, it had recorded over 11,301,850 confirmed cases while more than 531,806 have died due to it, with these figures rising daily across the globe. The burden of this highly contagious respiratory disease is that it presents itself in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patterns in those already infected, thereby leading to an exponential rise in the number of contractions of the disease and fatalities. It is, therefore, crucial to expedite the process of early detection and diagnosis of the disease across the world. The case-based reasoning (CBR) model is a compelling paradigm that allows for the utilization of case-specific knowledge previously experienced, concrete problem situations or specific patient cases for solving new cases. This study, therefore, aims to leverage the very rich database of cases of COVID-19 to solve new cases. The approach adopted in this study employs the use of an improved CBR model for state-of-the-art reasoning task in the classification of suspected cases of COVID-19. The CBR model leverages on a novel feature selection and the semantic-based mathematical model proposed in this study for case similarity computation. An initial population of the archive was achieved from 71 (67 adults and 4 pediatrics) cases obtained from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) repository. Results obtained revealed that the proposed approach in this study successfully classified suspected cases into their categories with an accuracy of 94.54%. The study found that the proposed model can support physicians to easily diagnose suspected cases of COVID-19 based on their medical records without subjecting the specimen to laboratory tests. As a result, there will be a global minimization of contagion rate occasioned by slow testing and in addition, reduced false-positive rates of diagnosed cases as observed in some parts of the globe.","output":"A case-based reasoning framework for early detection and diagnosis of novel coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A simple and rapid method for efficient synthesis of sulfonyl chlorides/bromides from sulfonyl hydrazide with NXS (X = Cl or Br) and late-stage conversion to several other functional groups was described.

In particular, the number of severe courses of the disease is still dramatically high. An efficient drug therapy that helps to improve significantly the fatal combination of damages in the airway epithelia, in the extensive pulmonary microvascularization and finally multiorgan failure, is missing. The physiological, inorganic polymer, polyphosphate (polyP) is a molecule which could prevent the initial phase of the virus life cycle, the attachment of the virus to the target cells, and improve the epithelial integrity as well as the mucus barrier. Results: Surprisingly, polyP matches perfectly with the cationic groove on the RBD. Subsequent binding studies disclosed that polyP, with a physiological chain length of 40 phosphate residues, abolishes the binding propensity of the RBD to the ACE2 receptor. In addition to this first mode of action of polyP, this polymer causes in epithelial cells an increased gene expression of the major mucins in the airways, of MUC5AC and MUC1, as well as a subsequent glycoprotein production. MUC5AC forms a gel-like mucus layer trapping inhaled particles which are then transported out of the airways, while MUC1 constitutes the periciliary liquid layer and supports ciliary beating. As a third mode of action, polyP undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis of the anhydride bonds in the airway system by alkaline phosphatase, releasing metabolic energy.

The objective was to assess the evolution of mental health indicators of Brazilian health workers providing care to COVID-19 patients, considering the beginning and first wave of the pandemic, identifying risk and protective factors. A non-probabilistic sample of health professionals was assessed for 6 months at seven different points in time using standardized instruments to measure anxiety, depression, insomnia, posttraumatic stress, and burnout symptoms. Risk and protective factors were assessed using a questionnaire addressing socio-demographic, clinical, occupational variables, and COVID-19 risk perception. The results indicate high rates for all the indicators (>30%) throughout the follow-up; only anxiety symptoms decreased in the different phases compared to the baseline. Depression and insomnia symptoms showed a significant drop in isolated points of the assessment, which were not maintained at the final follow-up. Burnout indicators concerning emotional exhaustion and depersonalization remained stable (40 and 20%), while professional achievement decreased by approximately 19%. Occupational and personal characteristics (profession and work setting), perceptions regarding protective measures imposed by the institutions, and future professional prospects stood out as risk/protective factors in mental health.

Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context. METHODS: Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those &#8804;65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74).

Because inflammation and oxidative stress are processes that can sustain each other, the ways pigs are able to activate their antioxidant defenses are critical for production performance and health during periods when the immune system is solicited. Selection for production performance can also influence reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and expression levels of genes involved in cellular response to oxidative stress in different tissues. To establish the extent by which poor hygiene and selection for feed efficiency affected redox status, pigs divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were housed in poor or good hygiene during 6 weeks. At the end, blood was collected in all pigs, and half of them were killed for tissue sampling. The remaining pigs were reared in good hygiene conditions during a recovery period of 7C8 weeks. RESULTS: At week 6, poor hygiene was associated with a lower total antioxidant capacity assessed by plasma ferric reducing ability in all pigs, and with greater plasma levels of hydrogen peroxides in the high RFI pigs (less efficient). Adipose tissue of high RFI pigs exhibited higher activities of catalase and glutathione reductase, and greater thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations when compared with the low RFI pigs (more efficient). Poor hygiene conditions activated the antioxidant enzymes activities (glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) in adipose tissue of both lines, but led to higher ROS production by mature adipocytes isolated from the high RFI pigs only. In liver and muscle, there were only minor changes in antioxidant molecules due to genetics and hygiene conditions. After the resilience period, adipose tissue of pigs previously challenged by poor hygiene maintained higher antioxidant enzyme activities, and for the high RFI line, displayed higher TBARS concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Pigs selected for improved feed efficiency showed a lower susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by poor hygiene conditions.

Here we focus on West Nile Virus (WNV), a mosquito borne pathogen, as a case study for spatial data visualization of environmental characteristics of a vectors habitat alongside human demographic composition for understanding potential public health risks of infectious disease. Multiple efforts have attempted to predict WNV environmental risk, while others have documented factors related to human vulnerability to the disease. However, analytical modeling that combines the two is difficult due to the number of potential explanatory variables, varying spatial resolutions of available data, and differing research questions that drove the initial data collection. We propose that the use of geovisualization may provide a glimpse into the large number of potential variables influencing the disease and help distill them into a smaller number that might reveal hidden and unknown patterns. This geovisual look at the data might then guide development of analytical models that can combine environmental and socio-economic data. METHODS: Geovisualization was used to integrate an environmental model of the disease vectors habitat alongside human risk factors derived from socio-economic variables. County level WNV incidence rates from California, USA, were used to define a geographically constrained study area where environmental and socio-economic data were extracted from 1,133 census tracts. A previously developed mosquito habitat model that was significantly related to WNV infected dead birds was used to describe the environmental components of the study area. Self-organizing maps found 49 clusters, each of which contained census tracts that were more similar to each other in terms of WNV environmental and socio-economic data. Parallel coordinate plots permitted visualization of each clusters data, uncovering patterns that allowed final census tract mapping exposing complex spatial patterns contained within the clusters. RESULTS: Our results suggest that simultaneously visualizing environmental and socio-economic data supports a fuller understanding of the underlying spatial processes for risks to vector-borne disease. Unexpected patterns were revealed in our study that would be useful for developing future multilevel analytical models. For example, when the cluster that contained census tracts with the highest median age was examined, it was determined that those census tracts only contained moderate mosquito habitat risk. Likewise, the cluster that contained census tracts with the highest mosquito habitat risk had populations with moderate median age.

The development of new imaging approaches is instrumental to further the description of RSV spread, virusChost interactions and related acute respiratory disease, at the level of the entire lung. Methods: By combining tissue clearing, 3D microscopy and image processing, we developed a novel visualization tool of RSV infection in undissected mouse lungs. Results: Whole tissue analysis allowed the identification of infected cell subtypes, based on both morphological traits and position within the cellular network. Furthermore, 3D imaging was also valuable to detect the cytoplasmic viral factories, also called inclusion bodies, a hallmark of RSV infection. Conclusions: Whole lung clearing and 3D deep imaging represents an unprecedented visualization method of infected lungs to allow insight into RSV pathophysiology and improve the 2D histology analyses.","output":"New Look at RSV Infection: Tissue Clearing and 3D Imaging of the Entire Mouse Lung at Cellular Resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose significant direct burdens on secondary healthcare services in the UK and around the world. Maintaining timely and safe delivery of major urgent elective surgery throughout the pandemic is essential if we are to continue to treat cancer and other time-critical surgical conditions. Our Trust established a COVID-secure hospital within the Trust to deliver urgent elective surgical care. METHOD: Basic demographics, operative interventions and 30-day outcomes of consecutive patients undergoing major surgery at our COVID-secure site were collected between June-November 2020. Major surgery was defined as patients requiring admission to the Post Anaesthetic care unit (PACU). PACU provides Level 2 care for 23 hours before discharging patients to the ward. RESULTS: 279 consecutive patients were included. PACU admission >23 hours were associated with increased total length of stay (LOS) (p = 0.004), 30-day complications (p < 0.0001), higher rate of transfer to a COVID-hot hospital (p = 0.01) and nosocomial COVID-19 infection (p = 0.051). Compared to spinal anaesthesia, epidural anaesthesia was associated with PACU admission breach (p = 0.02), increased total LOS (p = 0.01), increased transfer to the hot sites (p = 0.03) and 30-day complications (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Establishing a COVID-secure site enabled continuation of major urgent elective surgery within a viral pandemic. Level 2 support is essential to ensure safe delivery of complex surgery at cold sites. This study has identified clinically relevant advantage with the use of adjuvant spinal anaesthesia in preference to epidural. Enhancing critical care services is essential to minimise patient transfer to hot sites and limit nosocomial COVID infection.","output":"743 Establishing COVID-Secure Surgery: Maintaining Urgent Elective Surgery During The COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The performance of sustainable supply chain management today, especially for palm oil, continues to experience a drastic decline from the social, economic, and environmental perspectives Both the supply and demand sides are undergoing severe disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic To survive the COVID-19 situation and afterward, the palm oil industry needs to focus on priority indicators for immediate improvement For that reason, our study aims to determine the primary indicators used to assess the performance of sustainable supply chain management to improve the palm oil industry's performance immediately The F-AHP method is used to rank which indicators are focused on the COVID-19 situation and thereafter The findings of this study designate that there are three main indicators, namely from the economic side (adaptability), the social side (improving employee health and safety), and the environmental side (sustainable supplier management) This finding is beneficial for the industry and for supply chain actors such as suppliers, customers, and the government in taking attitudes and setting policies related to sustainable supply chain management in the face of pandemic ? 2021 by the authors;licensee Growing Science, Canada","output":"The performance improvement of sustainable palm oil supply chain management after COVID-19: Priority indicators using F-AHP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the processes and mechanisms of the spatial spread of epidemics is essential for making reasonable judgments on the development trends of epidemics and for adopting effective containment measures.

Medical personnel, especially those in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, could have increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The objective of this study was to explore the mental health status of medical personnel in Serbia during the pandemic by assessing stress levels, symptoms of anxiety, and depression. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted as an online-based survey, in the period from 8 April to 14 April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 1678 participants, and the snowball sampling technique was used to reach healthcare professionals. The level of stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed among medical personnel in Serbia by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Beck Depression Inventory IA (BDI-IA), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1678 participants completed the survey, with a mean age of 40.38  10.32 years, of which 1,315 (78.4%) were women, and 363 (21.6%) were men. Out of these, 684 (40.8%) participants were medical personnel, and 994 (59.2%) were people of other professions. Frontline medical personnel reported higher scores on all measurement tools than second-line medical personnel (e.g., mean PSS scores: 19.12  5.66 versus 17.53  5.71; p = .006; mean GAD-7 scores: 8.57  6.26 versus 6.73  5.76; p = .001; mean BDI-IA scores: 9.25  8.26 versus 7.36  7.28; p = .006). Binary logistic regression showed that the probability of developing more severe anxiety symptoms doubles in frontline medical personnel. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that frontline medical personnel is under an increased psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, having higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than second-line medical personnel. Adequate measures should be taken to relieve this burden and preserve the mental health of frontline medical personnel.","output":"Mental health of medical personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can lead to venous/arterial thrombosis, stroke, renal failure, myocardial infarction, thrombocytopenia, and other end-organ damage. Animal models demonstrating end-organ protection in C3-deficient mice and evidence of complement activation in humans have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 triggers complement-mediated endothelial damage, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (subunit 1 and 2), but not the N protein, directly activates the alternative pathway of complement (APC). Complement-dependent killing using the modified Ham test is blocked by either C5 or factor D inhibition. C3 fragments and C5b-9 are deposited on TF1PIGAnull target cells, and complement factor Bb is increased in the supernatant from spike proteinCtreated cells. C5 inhibition prevents the accumulation of C5b-9 on cells, but not C3c; however, factor D inhibition prevents both C3c and C5b-9 accumulation. Addition of factor H mitigates the complement attack. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins convert nonactivator surfaces to activator surfaces by preventing the inactivation of the cell-surface APC convertase. APC activation may explain many of the clinical manifestations (microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal injury, and thrombophilia) of COVID-19 that are also observed in other complement-driven diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. C5 inhibition prevents accumulation of C5b-9 in vitro but does not prevent upstream complement activation in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.","output":"Direct activation of the alternative complement pathway by SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins is blocked by factor D inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was leading to a worldwide pandemic, which affected surgical operation. This study assessed the efficacy of perioperative management of patients scheduled for gastrointestinal surgery during COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 188 patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak in Jiaxing, China. Perioperative data were collected, including data on pre-, intra-, and postoperative management strategies. The same data over the same period in 2019 were also collected for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 117, 63, and 8 patients underwent emergency, semi-elective, and elective surgeries, respectively. The locals: nonlocals ratio was significantly higher during this investigation period in 2020 than during the same period in 2019 (P < .05). After screening, 12 patients were identified as unqualified. The number of gastrointestinal surgeries was reduced in 2020. There were no differences in the ratio of emergency surgery or semi-elective surgery between in 2020 and in 2019. The elective surgery ratio between January 27 and February 28 was found to be lower in 2020 than in 2019 (P < .05). The disease spectra of emergency surgery and semi-elective surgery were similar. A total of 31 elective surgeries were postponed. There were five cases of short-term complications for emergency surgeries and two cases of short-term complications for semi-elective surgeries. No long-term complications or COVID-19 infection occurred in any of the cases, and no medical staff member was infected.

The use of digital technology for the delivery of health interventions has expanded rapidly. Intervention delivery by mobile phone can be a useful way to address young peoples needs with regard to sexual and reproductive health, because the information can be digested at a time of the recipients choosing. This study reports the adaptation of an evidence-based contraceptive behavioural intervention for young people in Zimbabwe. METHODS: Focus group discussions and in depth interviews were used to evaluate the fit of the existing intervention among young people in Harare, Zimbabwe. This involved determining how aligned the content of the existing intervention was to the knowledge and beliefs of young Zimbabweans plus identifying the most appropriate intervention deliver mode. The verbatim transcripts were analysed using a thematic analysis. The existing intervention was then adapted, tested and refined in subsequent focus group discussions and interviews with young people in Harare and Bulawayo. RESULTS: Eleven key themes resulted from the discussions evaluating the fit of the intervention. While there were many similarities to the original study population, key differences were that young people in Zimbabwe had lower levels of personal and smart mobile phone ownership and lower literacy levels. Young people were enthusiastic about receiving information about side effects/side benefits of the methods. The iterative testing and refinement resulted in adapted intervention consisting of 97 messages for female recipients (94 for male), delivered over three months and offered in English, Shona and Ndebele. CONCLUSIONS: Young people in Zimbabwe provided essential information for adapting the existing intervention. There was great support for the adapted intervention among the young people who took part in this study.

In this regard, the case of the Italian vaccination debate is particularly worrying given that Italy has been one of the European countries with the highest number of measles cases in the recent past. According to this scenario, we conducted a cross-sectional study on a convenience sample of Italian university students aimed at: (1) exploring their attitudes towards a future vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and; (2) evaluating the impact of the university curricula (healthcare vs. non-healthcare curricula) on the intention to vaccinate. Descriptive analysis on the 735 students that answered to the question on the intention to vaccinate showed that 633 (86.1%) students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination for the COVID-19 coronavirus; on the other side, 102 (13.9%) students reported that they would not or be not sure to vaccine (low intention to vaccinate). This means that in our sample more than one student out of 10 shows low intention to vaccinate (vaccine hesitancy). Furthermore, when running analysis comparing healthcare students versus non-healthcare students we found no significant differences in responses percentage distribution (p = .097).

These differences raise the question whether nations with lower incidence share any medical commonalities that could be used to not only explain that lower incidence, but that could also provide guidance for potential treatments elsewhere. Such treatment would be particularly valuable if it could be used as a prophylactic against COVID-19 transmission, thereby effectively slowing spread of the disease while we await the wide availability of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including Ivermectin have significantly lower incidences of COVID-19. Prophylactic use of Ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to Ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain persistence of such inhibitory effect after serum levels of Ivermectin have declined. It is suggested that Ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.","output":"A COVID-19 Prophylaxis?

The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20C60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake.","output":"In the long shadow of our best intentions: Model-based assessment of the consequences of school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Overweight and obesity are associated with metabolic diseases. However, a subgroup of the overweight/obese population does not present metabolic abnormalities. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can distinguish different obesity phenotypes and metabolic status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 98 individuals were divided into three groups: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Participants were evaluated for anthropometric and biochemical parameters and serum BMPR1A concentration and miR-503 level. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: The level of miR-503 was significantly higher in the MHO group compared with that in the MUO group, but no difference was observed between the MHNW and MHO groups. Meanwhile, no significant differences in serum BMPR1A concentration were observed between the three groups. ROC curve analysis showed that miR-503 could be used as a marker to distinguish the MUO from the MHO. Logistic regression analysis suggested that miR-503 was an important related factor associated with an unhealthy metabolic state in overweight/obese subjects.

The omicron variant is reported to be highly contagious with antibody-escaping activity. The emergence of antibody-escaping variants is alarming, and thus the quick discovery of small molecule inhibitors is needed. Hence, the current study uses computational drug screening and molecular dynamics simulation approaches (replicated) to identify novel drugs that can inhibit the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) with hACE2. Screening of the North African, East African and North-East African medicinal compound databases by employing a multi-step screening approach revealed four compounds, namely (?)-pipoxide (C1), 2-(p-hydroxybenzyl) benzofuran-6-ol (C2), 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-{4-[(E)-3-hydroxy-1-propenyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy}-1,3-propanediol (C3), and Rhein (C4), with excellent anti-viral properties against the RBD of the omicron variant. Investigation of the dynamics demonstrates stable behavior, good residue flexibility profiles, and structural compactness. Validation of the top hits using computational bioactivity analysis, binding free energy calculations and dissociation constant (K(D)) analysis also indicated the anti-viral properties of these compounds.

The effects of COVID-19 are caused by the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is the underlying actions of SARs-CoV-2 virions on the endothelial glycocalyx that we consider here. One of the key factors in COVID-19 infection is its almost unique age-related profile, with a doubling in mortality every 10 years after the age of 50. The endothelial glycocalyx layer is essential in maintaining normal fluid homeostasis, but is fragile and prone to pathophysiological damage. It is physiologically significant in capillary microcirculation and in fluid distribution to the tissues. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in plasma, is created in the liver which also maintains its concentration, but this reduces by 10C15% after 50 years of age. HSA transports hormones, free fatty acids and maintains oncotic pressure, but SARS-CoV-2 virions bind competitively to HSA diminishing its normal transport function. Furthermore, hypoalbuminemia is frequently observed in patients with such conditions as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic heart failure, i.e., those most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, and vascular disease have been linked in COVID-19 and have been shown to predict outcome independent of age and morbidity. Hypoalbuminemia is also known factor in sepsis and Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs when fluids build-up in the alveoli and it is associated with sepsis, whose mechanism is systemic, being associated with the fluid and logistic mechanisms of the circulation. Glycocalyx damage is associated with changes plasma protein concentration, particularly HSA and blockage of albumin transport can produce the systemic symptoms seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection and sepsis. We therefore conclude that albumin binding to SARS-CoV-2 virions may inhibit the formation of the endothelial glycocalyx by inhibition of albumin transport binding sites. We postulate that albumin therapy to replace bound albumin might alleviate some of the symptoms leading to sepsis and that clinical trials to test this postulation should be initiated as a matter of urgency.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Bound Human Serum Albumin and Systemic Septic Shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease which is caused by negative strand RNA-viruses belonging to the genus Lyssavirus.

The current study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on both nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing in Chinese patients receiving MHD. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: From December 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, a total of 1,027 MHD patients in 5 large hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, China, were enrolled. Patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptoms and initial computed tomography (CT) of the chest. If patients developed symptoms after the initial screening was negative, repeat CT was performed. Patients suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 were tested with 2 consecutive throat swabs for viral RNA. In mid-March 2020, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained for all MHD patients. EXPOSURE: NAT and antibody testing results for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOMES: Morbidity, clinical features, and laboratory and radiologic findings. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Differences between groups were examined using t test or Mann-Whitney U test, comparing those not infected with those infected and comparing those with infection detected using NAT with those with infection detected by positive serology test results. RESULTS: Among 1,027 patients receiving MHD, 99 were identified as having SARS-CoV-2 infection, for a prevalence of 9.6%. Among the 99 cases, 52 (53%) were initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive NAT; 47 (47%) were identified later by positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. There was a spectrum of antibody profiles in these 47 patients: IgM antibodies in 5 (11%), IgG antibodies in 35 (74%), and both IgM and IgG antibodies in 7 (15%). Of the 99 cases, 51% were asymptomatic during the epidemic; 61% had ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT of the chest compared with 11.6% among uninfected patients (P<0.001). Patients with hypertensive kidney disease were more often found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and were more likely to be symptomatic than patients with another primary cause of kidney failure. LIMITATIONS: Possible false-positive and false-negative results for both NAT and antibody testing; possible lack of generalizability to other dialysis populations. CONCLUSIONS: Half the SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients receiving MHD were subclinical and were not identified by universal CT of the chest and selective NAT.

In vitro cultivation allows a more complete study of the biological aspects of these parasites, indicating better conditions for infection, immunoassay tests, drug evaluations, and vaccines. Thus, we evaluated the three most used culture media for Leishmania spp., Graces insect cell culture medium (Graces), liver infusion tryptose (LIT), and Schneiders insect medium (Schneiders), without supplementation or supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS) and bovine serum albumin (Albumin) to evaluate the growth, viability, and infectivity of the L. infantum promastigotes. It was observed that promastigote forms have a better growth in LIT and Schneiders with or without FCS when compared to that in Graces. The supplementation with albumin promoted greater viability of the parasites independent of the medium. For in vitro infection of J774.A1 macrophages using light microscopy and flow cytometry analyses, FCS-supplemented LIT and Graces promoted higher percentage of infected macrophages and parasite load compared with Schneiders media.

However, it is still unclear why some parasites are shared by many species, while others have only one host. Using a new measure of 'phylogenetic host specificity', we find that most primate parasites with more than one host are phylogenetic generalists, infecting less closely related primates than expected. Evolutionary models suggest that phylogenetic host generalism is driven by a mixture of host-parasite cospeciation and lower rates of parasite extinction. We also show that phylogenetic relatedness is important in most analyses, but fails to fully explain patterns of parasite sharing among primates. Host ecology and geographical distribution emerged as key additional factors that influence contacts among hosts to facilitate sharing.

The characterization of these PbS QDS was performed by different techniques, such as Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and particle size analysis (DLS). The obtained results confirmed the synthesis of PbS QDs. The PbS QDs showed absorption peaks at 1088 nm (ultraviolet-visible spectrometry) and a luminescence peak at 1572 nm.

However, both systemic spread and systemic inflammatory responses are thought to contribute to the systemic pathogenesis. In this study, we determined the temporal kinetics of viral RNA in serum (RNAemia) and the associated inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the course of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. We show that RNAemia can be detected in 90% of the patients who develop critical disease, compared to 50% of the patients who develop moderate or severe disease. Furthermore, RNAemia lasts longer in patients who develop critical disease. Elevated levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and MCP-1but not IL-6are associated with viral load in serum, whereas higher levels of IL-6 in serum were associated with the development of critical disease. In conclusion, RNAemia is common in hospitalized patients, with the highest frequency and duration in patients who develop critical disease. The fact that several cytokines or chemokines are directly associated with the presence of viral RNA in the circulation suggests that the development of RNAemia is an important factor in the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Severe COVID-19 can be considered a systemic disease as many extrarespiratory complications occur. However, the systemic pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that the presence of viral RNA in the blood (RNAemia) occurs more frequently in patients who develop critical disease, compared to patients with moderate or severe disease. In addition, RNAemia is associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, like MCP-1 and IL-10, in serum during the course of disease.

It is essential to identify drugs with DILI potential at the early stages of drug development. In this study, we describe a deep learning-powered DILI (DeepDILI) prediction model created by combining model-level representation generated by conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms with a deep learning framework based on Mold2 descriptors. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed DeepDILI model performance by posing several critical questions: (1) Could the DILI potential of newly approved drugs be predicted by accumulated knowledge of early approved ones? (2) is model-level representation more informative than molecule-based representation for DILI prediction? and (3) could improved model explainability be established? For question 1, we developed the DeepDILI model using drugs approved before 1997 to predict the DILI potential of those approved thereafter. As a result, the DeepDILI model outperformed the five conventional ML algorithms and two state-of-the-art ensemble methods with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.331. For question 2, we demonstrated that the DeepDILI model's performance was significantly improved (i.e., a MCC improvement of 25.86% in test set) compared with deep neural networks based on molecule-based representation. For question 3, we found 21 chemical descriptors that were enriched, suggesting a strong association with DILI outcome. Furthermore, we found that the DeepDILI model has more discrimination power to identify the DILI potential of drugs belonging to the World Health Organization therapeutic category of 'alimentary tract and metabolism'. Moreover, the DeepDILI model based on Mold2 descriptors outperformed the ones with Mol2vec and MACCS descriptors. Finally, the DeepDILI model was applied to the recent real-world problem of predicting any DILI concern for potential COVID-19 treatments from repositioning drug candidates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study on dental treatments in primary and mixed dentitions was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at the Faculty of Dental Medicine, Lebanese University, from 2015 to 2020. The total number of children was 1291. Data were classified and reviewed according to the dentition type, gender, and type of dental treatment. RESULTS: The number of children decreased from 741 for the period 2015C2017 to 550 during the period 2018C2020 (279 males and 271 females). No significant association was found between the admission periods and the genders. A significant relationship was found between the number of treatments performed in both genders and the dentition types (p value = 0,015). Males were slightly more likely than females to present for the treatment in mixed dentition (54.58% versus 45.2%, respectively). Results portrayed a significant relationship between surgical treatment and gender (p value = 0.049). However, no significant relationship between gender and other treatment types was noted. The comparison between the 2 time frames and the types of treatments showed a significant association in composite fillings (p value = 0.043), extractions (p value < 0.0001), sealants (p value = 0.039), preventive resin restoration (p=0.011), pulp therapies (p value < 0.0001), pediatric crowns (p value < 0.0001), and surgical interventions (p value = 0.013). A nonsignificant relationship was recorded for the appliances and composite crowns (p value = 0.45 and 0.14, respectively).

This study aimed to investigate the rate and factors for unvaccination, as well as adverse reactions and deterioration of disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in psoriatic patients. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire survey on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, adverse reactions, and self-reported change of disease condition after vaccination in patients with psoriasis was conducted. Demographic, clinical, and psychological data were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used in the estimation of associations. RESULTS: A total of 788 psoriatic patients were investigated, and 68.9% reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Younger age, use of interleukin-17 inhibitors, and symptoms of anxiety were associated with unvaccination. The incidence of overall adverse reactions after vaccination was 30.8%, and no severe adverse reaction was reported. The most common local and systemic adverse reactions were pain at the injection site and fatigue, respectively. Most patients reported no change in psoriasis after vaccination, while 16.6% and 4.4% reported slight and significant deteriorations of the disease, respectively. Nonadherence to treatment, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and perceived stress were associated with self-reported deterioration of psoriasis after vaccination. CONCLUSION: While a favorable safety profile of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is observed, receiving biologic treatment is factor for unvaccination in patients with psoriasis. Deterioration of psoriasis reported by a small proportion of patients is partially attributable to mental and behavioral factors.","output":"A Web-Based Survey on Factors for Unvaccination and Adverse Reactions of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Chinese Patients with Psoriasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parent and caregiver intimate partner violence (IPV), to which 1 in 5 children are exposed, has profound health effects for survivors and their children.1-3 The health, economic, and social ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic have created unique challenges for families experiencing IPV, by increasing isolation, decreasing available safe and secure services and spaces (e.g., schools), and compounding pre-existing inequities, especially for families from marginalized communities.4,5 Pediatric healthcare settings play an important role in supporting families experiencing IPV, particularly through developing partnerships with IPV agencies.","output":"Healing-Centered Care for Intimate Partner Violence Survivors and Their Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the construction of plasmids which express fusion proteins representing various regions of Germiston virus M polyprotein. The fusion proteins were purified and inoculated into rabbits to produce antisera. The N- and C-terminal regions of the polyprotein induced specific antibodies which reacted with glycoproteins G2 and G1, respectively, and the intermediate region induced antibodies against the NSM polypeptide. This enabled us to determine the gene order: G2-NSM-G1. Glycoproteins G1 and G2 form the spikes on the surface of the virion. We attempted to determine the structural organization of the glycoproteins by using a membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent, dimethyl suberimidate, but were unable to demonstrate that G1 and/or G2 form oligomeric structures. We analysed the glycoproteins further and showed that, like peripheral membrane proteins, the G2 and NSM proteins are almost completely extracted into the aqueous phase of detergent Triton X114-treated cellular extracts, whereas glycoprotein G1 is distributed in almost equal proportions between the aqueous and the detergent fractions. This indicates that G1 is a membrane-associated protein, but its presence in the aqueous phase suggests that it is less hydrophobic than a typical membrane protein. We have also characterized the intracellular transport of the envelope glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase labelling followed by immunoprecipitation and treatment with endoglycosidase H (endo H) showed that both G1 and G2 are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Conversion to the endo H-resistant form is a rather slow process which takes more than 2 h.

Thus, this study examines how anatomists in the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (ROI) perceive the teaching adaptations made in response to COVID-19, and how these adaptations have impacted their experiences teaching, their online work environment and community. Data was collected via a questionnaire from 24 anatomists across 15 universities in the UK (11) and ROI (4). With regards to teaching, 95.6% of academics have upskilled in new technologies to meet the demands of distance teaching. Academics (95.8%) preferred face-to-face delivery of practical sessions. Most universities (80.0%) reported that practical sessions will continue in a new form that ensures social distancing. However, 50.0% of academics are uncertain if these adaptations will improve student learning. Many anatomists believe that the new adaptations may hinder student-student (66.7%) and student-tutor (45.8%) interactions. Regarding assessment, 52.6% of academics preferred traditional methods to online. Remote online assessment was difficult to protect against collusion, but provided time saving opportunities for academics. Finally, in terms of working environment, 83.3% of academics stated that their workload increased; 54.2% preferred working on site rather than remotely and 79.2% think that staff interactions are better when working on site. These results demonstrate a widespread concern amongst anatomists regarding the pandemic-induced adaptations to teaching, assessment and working environment.

Children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), the extreme FASD manifestation, show both facial dysmorphology and mental retardation. Alcohol consumed during gestational age prejudices brain development by reducing, among others, the synthesis and release of neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammatory markers. Alcohol drinking induces also oxidative stress. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: The present study aims at investigating the potential association between neurotrophins, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in 12 prepubertal male and female FASD children diagnosed as FAS or partial FAS (pFAS). METHODS: Accordingly, we analyzed, in the serum, the level of BDNF and NGF and the oxidative stress, as free oxygen radicals test (FORT) and free oxygen radicals defense (FORD). Moreover, serum levels of inflammatory mediators (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, MCP-1, TGF-? and TNF-) involved in neuroinflammatory and oxidative processes have been investigated. RESULTS: We demonstrated in pre-pubertal FASD children low serum levels of NGF and BDNF, respect to healthy controls. These changes were associated with higher serum presence of TNF- and IL-1. Quite interestingly, an elevation in the FORD was also found despite normal FORT levels. Moreover, we found a potentiation of IL-1, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-11 in the analyzed female compared to male children. CONCLUSION: The present investigation shows an imbalance in the peripheral neuroimmune pathways that could be used in children as early biomarkers of the deficits observed in FASD.","output":"Markers of Neuroinflammation in the Serum of Prepubertal Children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Downregulation of host gene expression is a key strategy employed by intracellular pathogens for their survival in macrophages and subsequent pathogenesis. In a previous study, we have shown that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) levels go up in macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and it hypoacetylates histone H3 at the promoter of IL-12B gene, leading to its downregulation. We now show that after infection with M. tuberculosis, HDAC1 is phosphorylated, and the levels of phosphorylated HDAC1 (pHDAC1) increase significantly in macrophages. We found that transcriptional repressor protein zinc finger and BTB domain 25 (ZBTB25) and transcriptional corepressor Sin3a associate with the HDAC1 silencing complex, which is recruited to the promoter of IL-12B to downregulate its expression in infected macrophages. Knocking down of ZBTB25 enhanced release of IL-12p40 from infected macrophages. Inhibition of HDAC1 and ZBTB25 promoted colocalization of M. tuberculosis and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) in autophagosomes. Induction of autophagy resulted in the killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis. Enhanced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT4 was observed in macrophages upon treatment with HDAC1 and ZBTB inhibitors, and inhibition of JAK2/STAT4 negated the killing of the intracellular pathogen, suggesting their role in the autophagy-mediated killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis. In view of the emergence of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis, host-directed therapy is an attractive alternative strategy to combat tuberculosis (TB). HDACs have been proposed to be host targets for TB treatment. Our study indicates that ZBTB25, a functional subunit of the HDAC1/Sin3a repressor complex involved in IL-12B suppression, could be an alternative target for host-directed anti-TB therapy. IMPORTANCE Following infection with M. tuberculosis, levels of HDAC1 go up in macrophages, and it is recruited to the promoter of IL-12B where it hypoacetylates histone H3, leading to the downregulation of the gene. Here, we show that host transcriptional repressor protein ZBTB25 and transcriptional corepressor Sin3a associate with HDAC1 in the silencing complex. Knocking down of ZBTB25 prevented the recruitment of the complex to the promoter and consequently enhanced the gene expression and the release of IL-12p40 from infected macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of ZBTB25 in infected macrophages resulted in the induction of autophagy and killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis. Drug-resistant TB is a serious challenge to TB control programs all over the world which calls for finding alternative therapeutic methods. Host-directed therapy is gaining significant momentum in treating infectious diseases. We propose that ZBTB25 is a potential target for host-directed treatment of TB.","output":"Transcription Repressor Protein ZBTB25 Associates with HDAC1-Sin3a Complex in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Infected Macrophages, and Its Inhibition Clears Pathogen by Autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"n/a.","output":"Anti-Endothelial Cell Antibodies are not frequently elevated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a data-driven adaptive model for infection of COVID-19 is formulated to predict the confirmed total cases and active cases of an area over 4 weeks.

The poultry microbiome has functions which range from protection against pathogens and nutrients production, to host immune system maturation. Fluctuations in the microbiome have also been linked to prevailing environmental conditions. Healthy poultry birds possess a natural resistance to infection. However, the exploration of environmental impacts and other relevant factors on poultry growth and health have been underplayed. Since good performance and growth rate are central to animal production, the host-microbiome relationship remains integral. Prior to the emergence of metagenomic techniques, conventional methods for poultry microbiome studies were used and were low-throughput and associated with insufficient genomic data and high cost of sequencing. Fortunately, the advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms have circumvented some of these shortfalls and paved the way for increased studies on the poultry gut microbiome diversity and functions.

Accordingly, emphasis is presently on curbing transmission, which is potentially achievable by identification and elimination of potential reservoirs. The strongest contenders for being the disease reservoir are cases of Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) which occurs in a minor proportion of individuals apparently cured of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). The demonstration of parasites in tissue aspirates despite being a risky and invasive process is the gold standard for diagnosis of VL, but is now being replaced by serological tests e.g., rK39 strip test and direct agglutination test. However, these antibody based tests are limited in their ability to diagnose relapses, detect cases of PKDL, and monitor effectiveness of treatment. Accordingly, detection of antigen or nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction has been successfully applied for monitoring of parasite kinetics.

Depending on their origin, size, and composition, EVs are grouped in several classes, with one of them being exosomes, which are small EVs (SEVs) generated within the endosomal compartment of eukaryotic cells via the unique multivesicular body pathway. Being able to deliver their content (proteins, lipids, small molecules, and nucleic acids) to other cells, exosomes/SEVs are considered as bioactive vesicles with multiple biological functions. Importantly, the composition of exosomes/SEVs depends on the cell and tissue of origin including a set of specific proteins. However, the pathological conditions may lead to the appearance of diseases-specific exosomes/SEVs containing pathology-specific cargoes utilized in the malicious cell-cell communication and spread of malady. Viruses demonstrate complex 'dancing' around the exosome biogenesis system, being able to hijack the host systems responsible for the exosome biogenesis. They use the exosome biogenesis system to promote packaging of their capsids, regulate virion production, and virus secretion. They also utilize a Trojan horse stratagem to place virions inside the SEVs and thereby to spread beyond their normal range of cell hosts using the normal EV uptake process. Another illustration of the virus-based utilization of Trojan horse strategy is given by the ability of human viruses to use exosomes/SEVs as carriers of their exogenous miRNA or viral proteins to the non-infected cells. Taken together, these strategies of dancing with Trojan horses can help viruses to fight with the host defense and to spread the infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
