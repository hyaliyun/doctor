Persons with HCV/HIV and living with substance use are disadvantaged in benefiting from advances in HCV treatment. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, participants with HCV/HIV were randomized between February 2016 and January 2017 to either care facilitation or control. Twelve-month follow-up assessments were completed in January 2018. Care facilitation group participants received motivation and strengths-based case management addressing retrieval of HCV viral load results, engagement in HCV/HIV care, and medication adherence. Control group participants received referral to HCV evaluation and an offer of assistance in making care appointments. Primary outcome was number of steps achieved along a series of 8 clinical steps (eg, receiving HCV results, initiating treatment, sustained virologic response [SVR]) of the HCV/HIV care continuum over 12 months postrandomization. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-one individuals were screened and 113 randomized. Median age was 51 years; 58.4% of participants were male and 72.6% were Black/African American. Median HIV-1 viral load was 27 209 copies/mL, with 69% having a detectable viral load. Mean number of steps completed was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group vs controls (2.44 vs 1.68 steps;  (2) [1] = 7.36, P = .0067). Men in the intervention group completed a statistically significantly higher number of steps than controls. Eleven participants achieved SVR with no difference by treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: The care facilitation intervention increased progress along the HCV/HIV care continuum, as observed for men and not women.

Multiplex immunoblot (IB) assays termed COVID-19 IB assays were developed for detecting IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Recombinant nucleocapsid protein and the S1, S2 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used as target antigens in the COVID-19 IBs. Specificity of the IB assay was established with 231 sera from persons with allergy, unrelated viral infections, autoimmune conditions and suspected tick-borne diseases, and 32 goat antisera to human influenza proteins. IgG and IgM COVID-19 IBs assays were performed on 84 sera obtained at different times after a positive RT-qPCR test from 37 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. RESULTS: Criteria for determining overall IgG and IgM antibody positivity using the four SARS-CoV-2 proteins were developed by optimizing specificity and sensitivity in the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IB assays. The estimated sensitivities and specificities of the COVID-19 IgG and IgM IBs for IgG and IgM antibodies individually or for either IgG or IgM antibodies meet the US recommendations for laboratory serological diagnostic tests. The proportion of IgM-positive sera from the COVID-19 patients following an RT-qPCR positive test was maximal at 83% before 10 days and decreased to 0% after 100 days, while the proportions of IgG-positive sera tended to plateau between days 11 and 65 at 78C100% and fall to 44% after 100 days. Detection of either IgG or IgM antibodies was better than IgG or IgM alone for assessing seroconversion in COVID-19. Both IgG and IgM antibodies detected RBD less frequently than S1, S2 and N proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex COVID-19 IB assays offer many advantages for simultaneously evaluating antibody responses to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in COVID-19 patients.

We argue for inhibition of the TRPV4 calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema, and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome. We believe that TRPV4 inhibition has a powerful prospect at protecting this vital barrier in Covid-19 patients, even to rescue a damaged barrier. A clinical trial using a selective TRPV4 inhibitor demonstrated a benign safety profile in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from cardiogenic lung edema. We argue for expeditious clinical testing of this inhibitor in Covid-19 patients with respiratory malfunction and at risk for lung edema. We note that among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against Covid-19, none is designed to directly protect the alveolo-capillary barrier. Successful protection of the alveolo-capillary barrier will not only reduce Covid-19 lethality but will pre-empt a catastrophic scenario in healthcare with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration.","output":"COVID-19: Urgent Reconsideration of Lung Edema as a Preventable Outcome: Inhibition of TRPV4 As a Promising and Feasible Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Weather and climate exist on a massive scale: over the last 650,000 years, only seven glacial cycles have occurred.

Here we established a quantitative fusion assay dependent on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S protein, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2, and found that nafamostat mesylate potently inhibited the fusion while camostat mesylate was about 10-fold less active. Furthermore, nafamostat mesylate blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells with an effective concentration (EC)50 around 10 nM, which is below its average blood concentration after intravenous administration through continuous infusion. On the other hand, a significantly higher dose (EC50 around 30 mM) was required for VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, where the TMPRSS2-independent but cathepsin-dependent endosomal infection pathway likely predominates. Together, our study shows that nafamostat mesylate potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated fusion in a cell fusion assay system and also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro in a cell-type-dependent manner.

Symptoms of COVID-19 may vary from mild (fever, dry cough, shortness of breath) to severe pneumonia-like respiratory symptoms as exacerbation of disease occurs. Unlike SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity to ACE-2 receptors which signify its higher transmission rate from person to person. Even though ACE-2 is significant in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulation that exhibits protection to various organs, they play a significant role in COVID-19 disease pathogenesis. Viral interferences with the ACE-2 peptidase activity are found in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients leading to pro-inflammatory responses, hypertension and multi-organ damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is constrained to a variety of organ systems but surface ACE-2 receptors on lung epithelia are largely affected, that lead to pathological alterations in lung histology which may progress to respiratory failure. The viral tropism mainly occurs by the attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzymes-2 receptors in the host cell, thus drugs targeting ACE-2 expressions may arise as the future therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 infections.The innovative approach of repurposing of drugs has shown temporary effectiveness to the rising pandemic.

METHODS In this observational research, we studied 104 intubated adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection (based on clinical symptoms, and radiographic or CT scan parameters) who were admitted to the ICU of a multispecialty hospital during March 2020 in Tehran, Iran. All cases received standard treatment regimens as local protocol (Oseltamivir + hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or sofosbuvir or atazanavir  ribavirin). The cases were grouped as controls (n = 43), infliximab (n = 27), IVIg (n = 23) and combination (n = 11). RESULTS There was no significant difference between controls and treatment groups in terms of underlying diseases or the number of underlying diseases. The mean age (SD) of cases was 72.42 (16.06) in the control group, 64.52 (12.965) in IVIg, 63.40 (17.57) in infliximab and 64.00 (11.679) in combination therapy; (P = 0.047, 0.031 and 0.11, respectively). Also, 37% in the infliximab group, 26.1% in IVIg, 45.5% in combination therapy, and 62.8% in the control group expired (all P < 0.05).

CDC25b and TDP1 downregulated (up to 20-fold) in proficient MMR cells compared to deficient MMR cells, while p.H2AX was significantly upregulated in both cell types, particularly at >10 mg/mL saffron in a concentration-dependent manner. The reduction in cellular proliferation was accompanied with upregulation of caspase 3 and 7. The major active saffron compounds, safranal and crocin reproduced most of the saffron crude extracts effects. Conclusions: Saffrons anti-proliferative effect is significant in cells with deficient MMR. This novel effect may have therapeutic implications and benefits for MSI CRC patients who are generally not recommended for the 5-fluorouracil-based treatment.","output":"Saffron and Its Major Ingredients Effect on Colon Cancer Cells with Mismatch Repair Deficiency and Microsatellite Instability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As lockdown and school closure policies were implemented in response to the coronavirus, the federal government provided funding and relaxed its rules to support emergency food provision, but not guidance on best practices for effectiveness.

A total of 125 BAL samples from immunosuppressed patients submitted for PJP-IFA were tested. Surplus samples were saved and further tested by using the PJ-CMV PCR assay. Among the 125 samples, P. jirovecii was detected in 31.2% (39/125) and in 40% (50/125) of the specimens using IFA and PJ-CMV PCR respectively. Eleven of the PJ-CMV PCR positive samples were negative by direct IFA for P. jirovecii. All samples positive by direct IFA were also positive by PJ-CMV PCR. Using the direct IFA as a gold standard, the PJ-CMV PCR sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for detection of P. jirovecii were 100%, 87.2%, 78% and 100%, respectively. However, after reviewing the clinical diagnosis, the specificity and PPV increased to 100%. Of the 50 P. jirovecii samples positive by PJ-CMV PCR, 18 (36%) were also positive for CMV by the PJ-CMV PCR. The co-infection rate was found to be 37.5% (6/16) and 35.2% (12/34) in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients.

This review focuses on the research performed during the last five years to provide an updated view of the current position of tea regarding human health. According to most authors, tea health benefits can be traced back to its bioactive components, mostly phenolic compounds. Among them, catechins are the most abundant. Tea has an important antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory properties, which make this beverage (or its extracts) a potential aid in the fight against several chronic diseases. On the other hand, some studies report the possibility of toxic effects and it is advisable to reduce tea consumption, such as in the last trimester of pregnancy.

Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to generate an in-depth picture of the pulmonary transcriptional landscape of COVID-19 (10 patients), pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza (5) and uninfected control patients (4). Host transcriptomics showed a significant upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, type I interferon production, coagulation and angiogenesis in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to non-infected controls. SARS-CoV-2 was non-uniformly distributed in lungs with few areas of high viral load and these were largely only associated with an increased type I interferon response. A very limited number of genes were differentially expressed between the lungs of influenza and COVID-19 patients. Specific interferon-associated genes (including IFI27) were identified as candidate novel biomarkers for COVID-19 differentiating this COVID-19 from influenza.

METHODS: Athletes (n = 12,526, comprising 13% world class, 21% international, 36% national, 24% state, and 6% recreational) completed an online survey that was available from 17 May to 5 July 2020 and explored their training behaviors (training knowledge, beliefs/attitudes, and practices), including specific questions on their training intensity, frequency, and session duration before and during lockdown (MarchCJune 2020). RESULTS: Overall, 85% of athletes wanted to maintain training, and 79% disagreed with the statement that it is okay to not train during lockdown, with a greater prevalence for both in higher-level athletes. In total, 60% of athletes considered coaching by correspondence (remote coaching) to be sufficient (highest amongst world-class athletes). During lockdown, < 40% were able to maintain sport-specific training (e.g., long endurance [39%], interval training [35%], weightlifting [33%], plyometric exercise [30%]) at pre-lockdown levels (higher among world-class, international, and national athletes), with most (83%) training for general fitness and health maintenance during lockdown. Athletes trained alone (80%) and focused on bodyweight (65%) and cardiovascular (59%) exercise/training during lockdown. Compared with before lockdown, most athletes reported reduced training frequency (from between five and seven sessions per week to four or fewer), shorter training sessions (from  60 to < 60 min), and lower sport-specific intensity (~ 38% reduction), irrespective of athlete classification. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related lockdowns saw marked reductions in athletic training specificity, intensity, frequency, and duration, with notable within-sample differences (by athlete classification). Higher classification athletes had the strongest desire to maintain training and the greatest opposition to not training during lockdowns. These higher classification athletes retained training specificity to a greater degree than others, probably because of preferential access to limited training resources. More higher classification athletes considered coaching by correspondence as sufficient than did lower classification athletes. These lockdown-mediated changes in training were not conducive to maintenance or progression of athletes physical capacities and were also likely detrimental to athletes mental health. These data can be used by policy makers, athletes, and their multidisciplinary teams to modulate their practice, with a degree of individualization, in the current and continued pandemic-related scenario. Furthermore, the data may drive training-related educational resources for athletes and their multidisciplinary teams.

The diagnostic accuracy of five commercially available EIAs (Abbott, Euroimmun, EDI, ImmunoDiagnostics, and Roche) to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated from cross-sectional samples of potential CCP donors that had prior molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=214) and pre-pandemic emergency department patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=1,099). Of the 214 potential CCP donors, all were sampled >14 days since symptom onset and only a minority had been hospitalized due to COVID-19 (n=16 [7.5%]); 140 potential CCP donors were tested by all five EIAs and a microneutralization assay. When performed according to the manufacturers' protocol to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity of each EIA ranged from 76.4% to 93.9%, and the specificity of each EIA ranged from 87.0% to 99.6%.

These so-called humanitarian drones represent the first wave of robotics applied in the humanitarian and development contexts, providing critical information through mapping of crisis-affected areas and timely delivery of aid supplies to populations in need. Alongside these emergent uses of drones in the aid sector, debates have arisen about potential risks and challenges, presenting diverse perspectives on the ethical, legal, and social implications of humanitarian drones. Guided by the methodology introduced by Arksey and OMalley, this scoping review offers an assessment of the ethical considerations discussed in the academic and gray literature based on a screening of 1,188 articles, from which we selected and analyzed 47 articles. In particular, we used a hybrid approach of qualitative content analysis, along with quantitative landscape mapping, to inductively develop a typology of ethical considerations associated with humanitarian drones. The results yielded 11 key areas of concern: (1) minimizing harm, (2) maximizing welfare, (3) substantive justice, (4) procedural justice, (5) respect for individuals, (6) respect for communities, (7) regulatory gaps, (8) regulatory dysfunction, (9) perceptions of humanitarian aid and organizations, (10) relations between humanitarian organizations and industry, and (11) the identity of humanitarian aid providers and organizations. Our findings illuminate topics that have been the focus of extensive attention (such as minimizing risks of harm and protecting privacy), traces the evolution of this discussion over time (i.e., an initial focus on mapping drones and the distinction of humanitarian from military use, toward the ethics of cargo drones carrying healthcare supplies and samples), and points to areas that have received less consideration (e.g., whether sustainability and shared benefits will be compromised if private companies interest in humanitarian drones wanes once new markets open up).

Therefore, we endeavored to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of chronic use of OAC prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. An electronic search of the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library databases was conducted. Meta-analysis and statistical analyses were completed with using the RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0. A total of 13 articles representing data from 1,266,231 participants were included in this study. The meta-analysis of unadjusted results showed no decrease in mortality (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.73, P = 0.059) or ICU admission rate (OR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.29 to 1.77, P = 0.46) in COVID-19 patients with prior OAC therapy at hospital admission compared to patients without prior use of OAC. Moreover, the meta-analysis of adjusted results showed no lower risk of mortality (OR = 1.08, 95%CI: 0.90 to 1.30, P = 0.415) or ICU admission (OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 0.72 to 3.12, P = 0.284) in patients with prior OAC use compared to patients without previous OAC use.

While the academic literature on access to care emphasises its complexity, policies aimed at improving access to general practice in the UK have tended to focus on measurable aspects, such as timeliness or number of appointments. AIM: To fill the gap between the complex understanding of primary care access in the literature and the narrow definition of access assumed in UK policies. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative, community-based participatory case study within the geographic footprint of a clinical commissioning group in the north west of England. Data collection took place from October 2015 to October 2016. Purposive sampling and snowball approaches were used to achieve maximum variation among service users and providers across general practice settings. METHOD: Levesque et als conceptual framework of patient-centred access was applied and the study used multiple qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups, and observation). Analysis was ongoing, iterative, inductive, and abductive with the theory. RESULTS: The comprehensiveness of Levesque et als access theory resonated with diverse participant experiences. However, while its strength was to highlight the importance of peoples abilities to access care, this studys data suggest equal importance of healthcare workforce abilities to make care accessible. Thus, the authors present a definition of access as the human fit between the needs and abilities of people in the population and the abilities and capacity of people in the healthcare workforce, and provide a modified conceptual framework reflecting these insights. CONCLUSION: An understanding of access as human fit has the potential to address longstanding problems of access within general practice, focusing attention on the need for staff training and support, and emphasising the importance of continuity of care.","output":"Accessing primary care and the importance of human fit: a qualitative participatory case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A case of a middle-aged male, suffering from acute psychosis while in self-isolation due to COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is presented.

Our results indicate that 25% of the tested sensors can be used to identify trends in CO2 concentration, if correctly calibrated. However, 67% of sensors did not respond to the presence of CO2, which suggests that a type of pseudo-technique is used to display the CO2 concentration. We recommend that these sensors are not suitable for infection prevention purposes. We also found that all 67% of the sensors that did not respond to CO2 responded strongly to alcohol. Owing to the widespread use of alcohol in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, sensors that react to alcohol can display inaccurate values, resulting in inappropriate ventilation behavior. Therefore, we strongly recommended that these sensors not be used.

We defined a case as an exposed person with either a positive RT-PCR, or positive microneutralisation testing (MNT) as confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG antibodies detection via fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA). We recruited close school contacts and families of school cases, calculated attack rates (AR) on school level and families, and identified transmission chains. Findings: In incident A, the index was a pupil. Participation rate was 74% (89/121), and no cases were identified. In incident B, the index was a member of school personnel. Participation rate was 81% (51/63). AR was 16% (8/51): 6 pupils and 1 member of school personnel were MNT and FMIA positive; 1 pupil had a positive RT-PCR, but negative serology samples. We visited all school cases' families (n=8). The AR among close household contacts was 42% (9/20 in 3/8 families) but other plausible sources were always reported. At three months post-exposure, 6/8 school cases were re-sampled and still MNT positive. Interpretation: When the index was a child, no school transmission was identified, while the occurrence of an adult case led to a 16% AR. Further cases were evidenced in 3 families, but other transmission chains were plausible. It is likely that transmission from children to adults is limited.

However, previous studies have often neglected the complex interaction of daily activities when looking at health outcomes. METHODS: Using latent profile analysis, this study examined patterns of self-reported daily time use (0C12h hours) for nine types of behaviour (work, errands, housework, childcare, care of persons in need, education, repairs and gardening, physical activity, and hobbies/leisure-time activities) in the 2018 wave of the German Socio-Economic Panel (N = 30,152; 51.9% female; M = 46.87 years). Sociodemographic variables, affective wellbeing, general and domain-specific life satisfaction, and self-rated health were inspected as predictors via multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS: Six latent profiles emerged: full-time work (47.2%), leisure (33.8%), childcare (8.9%), education (7.0%), part-time work & care (2.6%), and care (0.5%). Overall, the care and part-time work & care profiles showed the lowest wellbeing scores, lower subjective health, and life satisfaction. Women were more likely to be members of the care and childcare profiles. Men were more likely to belong to the full-time work profile, and they reported significantly higher wellbeing than women. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis revealed distinct patterns of time use and a burden on women, given their investment in care and childcare. Part-time work, and care seemed particularly demanding, and thus, are important areas for prevention, for instance, regarding mental health problems.

P01's ratings of odor salience of single words were lower than all control participants, whereas his ratings on five other perceptual and affective dimensions were similar to controls. P01 produced unusual associations when cued to generate words that smelled similar to odor-neutral target words (e.g. ink  plant).

This reduced capacity, along with public reluctance to undergo endoscopy during the pandemic, might result in excess mortality from delayed cancer diagnosis. Using the UKs National Endoscopy Database (NED), we performed the first national analysis of the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services and endoscopic cancer diagnosis. DESIGN: We developed a NED COVID-19 module incorporating procedure-level data on all endoscopic procedures. Three periods were designated: pre-COVID (6 January 2020 to 15 March), transition (16C22 March) and COVID-impacted (23 MarchC31 May). National, regional and procedure-specific analyses were performed. The average weekly number of cancers, proportion of missing cancers and cancer detection rates were calculated. RESULTS: A weekly average of 35 478 endoscopy procedures were performed in the pre-COVID period. Activity in the COVID-impacted period reduced to 12% of pre-COVID levels; at its low point, activity was only 5%, recovering to 20% of pre-COVID activity by study end. Although more selective vetting significantly increased the per-procedure cancer detection rate (pre-COVID 1.91%; COVID-impacted 6.61%; p<0.001), the weekly number of cancers detected decreased by 58%.

METHODS This review included studies that focused on qualitative and/or quantitative data, where the study outcome was prostate cancer and included a measure of stigmatization. Electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, PROSPERO, and the Joanna Briggs Institute) and one database for grey literature Opengrey.eu, were screened. We used thematic analysis, with narrative synthesis to analyse these data. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the RoBANS. RESULTS In total, 18 studies met review inclusion criteria, incorporating a total of 2295 participants. All studies recruited participants with prostate cancer, however four studies recruited participants with other cancers such as breast cancer and lung cancer. Of the 18 studies, 11 studies evaluated perceived or felt stigma; four studies evaluated internalised or self-stigma; three studies evaluated more than one stigma domain. DISCUSSION We found that patients living with prostate cancer encounter stigmatisation that relate to perception, internalisation, and discrimination experiences. We also identified several significant gaps related to the understanding of prostate cancer stigmatization, which provides an opportunity for future research to address these important public health issues.

It is important to compute the consequences of time variation in demographic rates for kinship stuctures. Objectives Our goal is to develop a matrix model for the dynamics of kinship networks subject to arbitrary temporal variation in survival, fertility, and population structure. Methods We develop a system of equations for the dynamics of the age structure of each type of kin of a Focal individual. The matrices describing survival and fertility vary with time. The initial conditions in the time-invariant model are replaced with a set of boundary conditions for initial time and initial age. Results The time-varying model maintains the network structure of the time-invariant model. In addition to the results of the time-invariant model, it provides kinship structures by period, cohort, and age. It applies equally to historical sequences of past rates and to projections of future rates. As an illustration, we analyze the kinship structure of Sweden from 1891 to 2120. Contribution The time-varying kinship model makes it possible to analyze the consequences of changing demographic rates, in the past or the future. It is easily computable, requires no simulations, and is readily extended to include additional, more distant relatives in the kinship network. The method can also be used to show the growth of families, lineages, and dynasties in populations across time and place and between social groups.","output":"The formal demography of kinship III: Kinship dynamics with time-varying demographic rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Late diagnoses of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are important public health problems that affect the population at large and migrants in particular. Missed opportunities of HIV and hepatitis screening are numerous, with language differences being a significant barrier to testing. Several studies have shown that migrants who do not speak the language of the health provider are less likely to get tested, due to health providers reluctance to offer a test and to migrants reluctance to accept testing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to develop a multilingual electronic tool (app) that assists health providers in offering and explaining HIV and hepatitis screenings to migrants with a language barrier and to evaluate its acceptability and impact in terms of public health. METHODS: The study will go through 3 stages: (1) concept development, (2) app development, and (3) app evaluation. A qualitative study has been undertaken to explore language barriers during health care encounters and their effect on communication, specifically when a screening test is offered. In parallel, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to have a comprehensive overlook of electronic tools designed to help health care providers communicate with migrants with a language barrier. To generate a list of items to be translated for inclusion in the app, we will conduct a focus group and Delphi survey. The development of the app will include translation and voice recording of items. The electronic development will also include 3 steps of user testing. The acceptability of the app will be evaluated using the System Usability Scale. Evaluation of the apps efficacy will consist of a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. The study will be carried out in 16 centers that treat migrants and offer them screening tests for infectious diseases. The primary outcome is the percentage of screening tests realized. The secondary outcomes are the rate of screening proposal by health professionals, acceptance rate by migrants, number of positive cases using this app, and frequency of use of the app. RESULTS: The app evaluation study received a 3-year grant from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche contre le SIDA et les hpatites virales (ANRS) and from the Office Fran?ais de lImmigration et Intgration (OFII). At the time of publication of this protocol, the initial qualitative study and systematic literature review were completed. CONCLUSIONS: This study will develop an app that assists health providers in offering and explaining HIV and hepatitis screenings to migrants with a language barrier and measure its acceptability and effectiveness in terms of public health. When completed, this app could be distributed to numerous professionals carrying out screening with migrant populations in various health care settings.

Our previous study has achieved 7-DHC synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the endogenous post-squalene pathway. However, the distribution of post-squalene enzymes between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid bodies (LD) might raise difficulties for ERG proteins to catalyze and deliver sterol intermediates, resulting in unbalanced metabolic flow and low product yield. Herein, we intended to rearrange the subcellular location of post-squalene enzymes to alleviate metabolic bottleneck and boost 7-DHC production. After identifying the location of DHCR24 (C-24 reductase, the only heterologous protein for 7-DHC biosynthesis) on ER, all the ER-located enzymes were grouped into four modules: ERG1/11/24, ERG25/26/27, ERG2/3, and DHCR24. These modules attempted to be overexpressed either on ER or on LDs. As a result, expression of LD-targeted DHCR24 and ER-located ERG1/11/24 could promote the conversion efficiency among the sterol intermediates to 7-DHC, while locating module ERG2/3 into LDs improved the whole metabolic flux of the post-squalene pathway. Coexpressing LD-targeted ERG2/3 and DHCR24 (generating strain SyBE_Sc01250035) improved 7-DHC production from 187.7 to 308.2 mg/L at shake-flask level. Further expressing ER-targeted module ERG1/11/24 in strain SyBE_Sc01250035 dramatically reduced squalene accumulation from 620.2 mg/L to the lowest level (by 93.8%) as well as improved 7-DHC production to the highest level (to 342.2 mg/L). Then targeting module ERG25/26/27 to LDs further increased 7-DHC titer to 360.6 mg/L, which is the highest shake-flask level production for 7-DHC ever reported.

Knockdown of RBM15 remarkably suppressed the expression levels of multitarget genes related to programmed cell death and inflammatory response. This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the m6A epitranscriptome of lymphocytes, particularly in the case of severe patients.

Methods: Dynamics of anti-spike IgG titers were assessed two months following the third BNT162b2 vaccination in 52 participants. All participants received the primary series of vaccination with BNT162b2 and received the third dose eight months after the second vaccination.

In this study, we combine 1.5 years of measurements for ozone, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and nitrogen oxide (NO(X)) at four sites to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on surface ozone in Dongguan, an industrial city in southern China. We show that the average concentrations of NO(X) and VOCs decreased by 70%C77% and 54%C68% during the lockdown compared to pre-lockdown, respectively. Based on the source apportionment of VOCs, the contribution of industrial solvent use reduced significantly (86%C94%) during the lockdown, and climbed back slowly along with the re-opening of the industry after lockdown. A slight increase in mean ozone concentration (3%C14%) was observed during the lockdown. The rise of ozone was the combined effect of substantial increase at night (58%C91%) and small reduction in the daytime (1%C17%). These conflicting observations in ozone response between day and night to emission change call for a more detailed approach to diagnostic ozone production response with precursor changes, rather than directly comparing absolute concentrations. We propose that the ratio of daily Ox (i.e. ozone + NO(2)) enhancement to solar radiation can provide a diagnostic parameter for ozone production response during the lockdown period. Smaller ratio of daily O(X) (ozone + NO(2)) enhancement to solar radiation during the lockdown were observed from the long-term measurements in Dongguan, suggesting significantly weakened photochemistry during the lockdown successfully reduces local ozone production.

METHODS: In March 2020, pharmacists and student pharmacists within the Alaska Pharmacist Association worked to tailor, administer, and evaluate results from a 10-question survey, including demographics (respondent name, ZIP Code, cell phone, and alternate e-mail). The survey was developed on the basis of published COVID-19 guidelines, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 screening and management guidelines, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy guidance, and joint policy recommendation from pharmacy organizations.

Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities 4 weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age. Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus. These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections.

Further, KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 locating at 62C67 of the conserved intracellular loop (CIL) were found to play a key role in the restriction on the Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV). Similarly, KRRK basic residues of IFITM2/3 also contributed to suppressing ZIKV replication. Finally, IFITM1 was revealed to be capable of restricting the release of ZIKV particles from endosome to cytosol so as to impede the entry of ZIKV into host cells, which was tightly related with the inhibition of IFITM1 on the acidification of organelles.

Methods SARS-CoV-2 patient samples (n=43) were analysed alongside pre-pandemic control specimen (n=50), confirmed respiratory infections (n=50), inflammatory polyarthritis (n=22) and positive for thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (n=30). Imprecision, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and concordance were evaluated on IgG serologic assays from EuroImmun, Epitope Diagnostics (EDI), Abbott Diagnostics and DiaSorin and a rapid IgG/IgM test from Healgen. Results EDI and EuroImmun imprecision was 0.02-14.0% CV. Abbott and DiaSorin imprecision (CV) ranged from 5.2% - 8.1% and 8.2% - 9.6% respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assays were 100% (CI: 80-100%) for Abbott, EDI and EuroImmun and 95% (CI: 73-100%) for DiaSorin at []14 days post PCR. Only the Abbott assay had a diagnostic specificity of 100% (CI: 91-100%). EuroImmun cross-reacted in 3 non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections and 2 controls. The DiaSorin displayed more false negative results and cross-reacted in six cases across all conditions tested. EDI had one cross-reactive sample. The Healgen rapid test showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. Overall, concordance of the assays ranged from 76.1% to 97.9%.

This paper presents a real and financial social accounting matrix (FSAM) capable of distinguishing the direct and indirect effects that are transferred from micro-, small, medium, and large firms to the rest of the economy. We use the hypothetical extraction method (HEM) to explore the sequence of reactions associated with shocks that arise from the COVID-19 lockdown. Using a structural model for the Spanish economy, we identify the role of different firm size categories in the aggregate gross domestic product (GDP). Our results allow us to reconcile the mixed narrative that accompanies the evaluation of the role played by these categories in economic activity by revealing that both SMEs and large firms are important for supporting economic activity. In particular, SMEs help explain 43% of the income and two-thirds of the unemployment decline caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also show the importance of conditioning SME industrial policy to sectoral analysis. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The effects of the macroeconomic lockdown and its transmission to the rest of the economy differ by firm size and across sectors. Using the Spanish context for micro-, small, medium, and large firms, we distinguish the direct and indirect effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main implications are the following: (1) Research: results emphasize that SMEs and large firms are both important to support economic activity but, in order to account for the relative effects on SMEs, it is crucial to consider the specific sector that receives the disruption. 2) Policy: SMEs are an important focus of business support policies within the EU. According to our estimations, disruptions in SMEs produce larger reductions in demand. These results could support credit policies for SMEs with a strong impact on the aggregate economy due to their greater productive and financial linkages with the domestic economy.","output":"Macroeconomic lockdown and SMEs: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change-induced disasters show the highest risk for agriculture and livelihoods in rural areas of developing countries. Due to changing rainfall pattern, the arid and semiarid region of Pakistan faces frequent droughts. Farming communities affected by drought disasters are causing serious threats to livelihood, global food crises, environmental migration, and sustainable development. The existing study was designed to quantify two key components through (1) analysis of agrometeorological data (1981C2017) with exploratory data analysis and MannCKendall trend analysis; (2) extensive field survey (200 households). The multivariate probit model has been run to detect determinants of coping and adaptive strategies by farmers. Our results showed that the farmers supposed that temperature and rainfall were highly fluctuating in recent years equally. Farmers adopted different coping and adaptive measures that include crop diversification, input adjustment, water management, asset depletion, income diversification, and migration to sustain their livelihood during stress periods. The agrometeorological data analysis revealed that the agricultural vulnerability to drought risks increased significantly, and the survey results projected that 64.7% of the population is exposed to drought directly or indirectly. Sens slope quantification resulted in (0.025 C) rise in temperature, (? 2.936 mm) decline in rainfall year(?1). Modeling future scenarios resulted in an increase in temperature up to 0.7 C, 1.2 C, and a decrease in precipitation up to 161.48 mm, 103.5 mm in 2040 and 2060. The study evaluated a huge gap in the provision of drought risk resilience services, crop insurance, and climate-smart training practices to build capacities among farmers to cope with the impacts of extreme weather conditions.

One major cause for failure of NPC chemotherapeutic treatments is reportedly correlated with the elevation of cancer stem cell (CSC) fractions. Thus, this present study aims to investigate the effect of cisplatin (CDDP) treatment on the enrichment of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and its associated signaling pathway in EBV-negative NPC cells. Cisplatin-pretreated 5-8F NPC cells (5-8F CDDP) were first generated by treating the cells with 0.5 M cisplatin for 48 h. After the instant treatment, 5-8F CDDP showed increased IC50 values, demonstrating a decrease in CDDP sensitization. Besides, the proportion of NPC cells with cancer stem-like phenotypes comprising side population (SP), key stemness-related gene expressions including SOX2, ALDH1, CD24 was significantly enhanced. Additionally, 5-8F CDDP displayed the upregulation of -catenin gene, suggesting its association with the CSC-initiating mechanism. Furthermore, a tankyrase inhibitor for Wnt/-catenin pathway, XAV939, substantially reduced CSCs and retrieved the cisplatin sensitivity in 5-8F CDDP. This confirms that the Wnt/-catenin signaling is accountable for rising of the CSC population in EBV-negative NPC. Finally, the combined treatment of CDDP and XAV939 exhibited lower 5-8F CDDP cell viability compared to the treatment of CDDP alone, suggesting the reversal of cisplatin sensitization. In conclusion, the enhancement of CSCs in 5-8F NPC cells caused by the instant cisplatin treatment is initially mediated through the upregulation of -catenin and activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. As a result, a primary chemotherapeutic treatment with closely monitoring the targeted Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway could potentially prevent the development of CSCs and improve the treatment efficiency in NPC.","output":"Reversal of cisplatin sensitization and abrogation of cisplatin-enriched cancer stem cells in 5-8F nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line through a suppression of Wnt/-catenin-signaling pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the influences of COVID-19 spread at an early stage of the pandemic by focusing the cases in Florida and Ohio.

Dexamethasone is an immunosuppressive treatment potentially increasing the risk of secondary hospital acquired infections in critically ill patients. We conducted an observational retrospective study in three French intensive care units (ICUs) comparing the first and second waves of pandemic to investigate the role of dexamethasone in the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and blood stream infections (BSI). Patients admitted from March to November 2020 with a documented COVID-19 and requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for &#8805; 48 h were included. The main study outcomes were the incidence of VAP and BSI according to the use of dexamethasone. Secondary outcomes were the ventilator-free days (VFD) at day-28 and day-60, ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 151 patients included, 84 received dexamethasone, all but one during the second wave. VAP occurred in 63% of patients treated with dexamethasone (DEXA+) and 57% in those not receiving dexamethasone (DEXA-) (p = 0.43). The cumulative incidence of VAP, considering death, duration of MV and late immunosuppression as competing factors was not different between groups (p = 0.59). A multivariate analysis did not identify dexamethasone as an independent risk factor for VAP occurrence. The occurrence of BSI was not different between groups (29 vs. 30%; p = 0.86). DEXA+ patients had more VFD at day-28 (9 (0-21) vs. 0 (0-11) days; p = 0.009) and a reduced ICU length of stay (20 (11-44) vs. 32 (17-46) days; p = 0.01). Mortality did not differ between groups.

Effective CPT is likely to require high titres of neutralising antibody (nAb) in convalescent donations. Understanding the relationship between functional neutralising antibodies and antibody levels to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins in scalable assays will be crucial for the success of a large-scale collection. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with reactivity in a range of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) targeting the spike (S) protein, the main target for human immune response. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 52 individuals with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 nAbs by microneutralisation and pseudo-type assays and for antibodies by four different ELISAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to further identify sensitivity and specificity of selected assays to identify samples containing high nAb levels. RESULTS: All samples contained SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, whereas neutralising antibody titres of greater than 1:20 were detected in 43 samples (83% of those tested) and >1:100 in 22 samples (42%). The best correlations were observed with EUROimmun immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity (Spearman Rho correlation coefficient 0.88; p < 0.001). Based on ROC analysis, EUROimmun would detect 60% of samples with titres of >1:100 with 100% specificity using a reactivity index of 9.1 (13/22). DISCUSSION: Robust associations between nAb titres and reactivity in several ELISA-based antibody tests demonstrate their possible utility for scaled-up production of convalescent plasma containing potentially therapeutic levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs.","output":"Convalescent plasma therapy for the treatment of patients with COVID-19: Assessment of methods available for antibody detection and their correlation with neutralising antibody levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ces dernires annes, le pouvoir thrapeutique des plantes et des aliments vgtaux a fait lobjet de nombreuses tudes.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: US high schools. PARTICIPANTS: High-school athletic directors. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: Indoor winter sports, school instructional delivery method, and state COVID-19 incidence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surveys were distributed to high-school athletic directors throughout the United States regarding sport reinitiation and COVID-19 cases in winter 2020 to 2021. Separate mixed effects Poisson regression models were developed to evaluate the associations between reported COVID-19 incidence and (1) different sports and (2) school instructional delivery method, while adjusting for the background, state COVID-19 incidence. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty schools had restarted fall sports, representing 31 274 athletes on 1404 teams from 14 states. One thousand four hundred sixty cases of COVID-19 were reported, representing a case rate of 4668 cases per 100 000 athletes and an incidence rate of 58.7 cases per 100 000 player-days. Reported COVID-19 incidence was greatest among girls' hockey (82.1 cases per 100 000 player-days (95% CI, 56.8-115) and boys' hockey [76.7 (61.8-94.2)] and lowest among swimming [39.0 (31.1-48.2)] and gymnastics [28.5 (13.1-54.2)]. No difference in reported COVID-19 incidence was identified among athletes attending schools with virtual versus in-person instruction [incidence rate ratio = 0.86 (0.52-1.4)]. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide survey of US high-school athletic directors regarding indoor winter sports, reported COVID-19 incidence was lower in noncontact sports but unrelated to school instructional delivery method.

METHODS: Retrospective longitudinal observational study of ER accesses for psychiatric evaluation was performed, comparing two periods (9 March-3 May 2020 vs. 9 March-3 May 2019). Data (number of admissions, key baseline demographic and clinical variables) were extracted from the ER databases of referral centres in a well-defined geographic area of North-Eastern Italy (Cesena, Ravenna, Forl, and Rimini). RESULTS: A 15% reduction of psychiatric referrals was observed, together with a 17% reduction in the total number of patients referring to the ER. This reduction was most evident in the first month of the lockdown period (almost 25% reduction of both referrals and patients).

At present, the global epidemic of COVID-19 continues and waves of SARS-CoV-2, the mutant Delta and Omicron variant which are associated with enhanced transmissibility and evasion to vaccine-induced immunity have increased hospitalization and mortality, the biggest challenge we face is whether we will be able to overcome this virus? On the other side, warm seasons and heat have increased the need for proper ventilation systems to trap contaminants containing the virus. Besides, heat and sweating accelerate the growth of microorganisms. For example, medical staff that is in the front line use masks for a long time, and their facial sweat causes microbes to grow on the mask. Nowadays, efficient air filters with anti-viral and antimicrobial properties have received a lot of attention, and are used to make ventilation systems or medical masks. A wide range of materials plays an important role in the production of efficient air filters. For example, metals, metal oxides, or antimicrobial metal species that have anti-viral and antimicrobial properties, including Ag, ZnO, TiO(2), CuO, and Cu played a role in this regard. Carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, or derivatives have also shown their role well. In addition, natural materials such as biopolymers such as alginate, and herbal extracts are employed to prepare effective air filters.

Objectives This study sought to determine pediatric SARS-CoV-2 disease burden during local mitigation efforts by using antibody testing to compare seroprevalence estimates to cumulative PCR prevalence estimates. Study Design In this cross-sectional study, we collected 1142 strict phase and 1196 relaxed phase remnant blood specimens from patients less than 19-years-old in southwestern Pennsylvania (SWPA). Patients were excluded if their residential zip code was outside the region of interest, if they were under 6-months-old, or they had recently received antibody-modifying treatments. Demographic, encounter, and laboratory electronic medical record information was extracted. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG using an EUA ELISA, and PCR results were recorded from county health department data. Seroprevalence and Clopper-Pearson exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results The observed seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies in children during strictest mitigation was 0.53% (95% CI 0.19, 1.14) and 0.92% (95% CI 0.46,1.64) during moderately relaxed. Strict and relaxed phase PCR-based prevalence were significantly higher, 2.87% (95% CI 1.95, 4.08) and 3.64 (95% CI 3.01, 4.38), respectively. Conclusions Estimates of pediatric seroprevalence were significantly lower than cumulative PCR prevalence estimates, and less than adult seroprevalence estimates, potentially due to biological, population, or sampling differences.

Patients undergoing allogeneic HCT received either a single dose of tocilizumab one day prior to HCT (n = 25), or HCT alone (n = 62). The primary outcome included depressive symptoms at 28 days post HCT; anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and pain were assessed at pretreatment baseline and days +28, +100, and +180 post HCT as secondary outcomes.

METHODS: Beginning January 23, 2020, we collected English tweets from the Twitter Streaming application programming interface that mention keywords related to COVID-19. We applied handwritten regular expressions to identify tweets indicating that the user potentially has been exposed to COVID-19. We automatically filtered out reported speech (eg, quotations, news headlines) from the tweets that matched the regular expressions, and two annotators annotated a random sample of 8976 tweets that are geo-tagged or have profile location metadata, distinguishing tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19 from those that do not. We used the annotated tweets to train and evaluate deep neural network classifiers based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Finally, we deployed the automatic pipeline on more than 85 million unlabeled tweets that were continuously collected between March 1 and August 21, 2020. RESULTS: Interannotator agreement, based on dual annotations for 3644 (41%) of the 8976 tweets, was 0.77 (Cohen ). A deep neural network classifier, based on a BERT model that was pretrained on tweets related to COVID-19, achieved an F(1)-score of 0.76 (precision=0.76, recall=0.76) for detecting tweets that self-report potential cases of COVID-19.

AIM: The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the current literature and compare the reported periods of positive SARS-CoV-2 detection from studies that conducted RT-PCR testing in addition to experiments isolating whole virus. METHODS: Using a rapid review approach, studies reporting empirical data on the duration of positive RT-PCR results and/or successful viral isolation following SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans were identified through searches of peer-reviewed and pre-print health sciences literature. Articles were screened for relevance, then data were extracted, analysed, and synthesised. RESULTS: Of the 160 studies included for qualitative analysis, 84% (n = 135) investigated duration of positive RT-PCR tests only, 5% (n = 8) investigated duration of successful viral isolations, while 11% (n = 17) included measurements on both. There was significant heterogeneity in reported data. There was a prolonged time to viral clearance when deduced from RT-PCR tests compared with viral isolations (median: 26 vs 9 days). DISCUSSION: Findings from this review support a minimum 10-day period of isolation but certain cases where virus was isolated after 10 days were identified. Given the extended time to viral clearance from RT-PCR tests, future research should ensure standard reporting of RT-PCR protocols and results to help inform testing policies aimed at clearance from isolation.","output":"Determining the communicable period of SARS-CoV-2: A rapid review of the literature, March to September 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Propagation of new human respiratory virus pathogens in established cell lines is hampered by a lack of predictability regarding cell line permissivity and by availability of suitable antibody reagents to detect infection in cell lines that do not exhibit significant cytopathic effect.

Consequently, to fully understand the viral processes involved in infection and replication, it is fundamental to study them in the cellular context. Often, viral infections induce significant changes in the subcellular organization of the host cell due to the formation of viral factories, alteration of cell cytoskeleton and/or budding of newly formed particles. Accurate 3D mapping of organelle reorganization in infected cells can thus provide valuable information for both basic virus research and antiviral drug development. Among the available techniques for 3D cell imaging, cryoCsoft X-ray tomography stands out for its large depth of view (allowing for 10 m thick biological samples to be imaged without further thinning), its resolution (about 50 nm for tomographies, sufficient to detect viral particles), the minimal requirements for sample manipulation (can be used on frozen, unfixed and unstained whole cells) and the potential to be combined with other techniques (i.e., correlative fluorescence microscopy). In this review we describe the fundamentals of cryoCsoft X-ray tomography, its sample requirements, its advantages and its limitations. To highlight the potential of this technique, examples of virus research performed at BL09-MISTRAL beamline in ALBA synchrotron are also presented.","output":"Imaging of Virus-Infected Cells with Soft X-ray Tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly correlated positioning of ions underlies Coulomb interactions between ions and electrified interfaces within dense ionic fluids such as biological cells and ionic liquids. Recent work has shown that highly correlated ionic systems behave differently than dilute electrolyte solutions and interest is focused upon characterizing the electrical and structural properties of the dense electrical double layers (EDL) formed at internal interfaces. It has been a challenge for experiments to characterize the progressive development of the EDL on the nanoscale as the interfacial electric potential is varied over a range of positive and negative values. Here we address this challenge by measuring X-ray reflectivity from the interface between an ionic liquid (IL) and a dilute aqueous electrolyte solution over a range of interfacial potentials from -450 mV to 350 mV. The growth of alternately charged cation-rich and anion-rich layers was observed along with a polarity reversal of the layers as the potential changed sign. These data show that the structural development of an ionic multilayer-like EDL with increasing potential is similar to that suggested by phenomenological theories and MD simulations, although our data also reveal that the excess charge beyond the first ionic layer decays more rapidly than predicted.","output":"Evolution and Reversible Polarity of Multilayering at the Ionic Liquid/Water Interface."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to align the current experiences and best practices in revised reporting (issuing of addenda and amendments) in pathology.

Invoking the typology of crises, we classify COVID-19 as an intractable crisis that necessitated nations to impose lockdowns. As national economies and businesses got a severe blow with this closure, organizations encouraged employees to work from home. Drawing upon the employee isolation literature, we aimed to examine the impact of work from home on employees during the lockdown. This investigation would help us learn about the nature and quality of work in the context of the current crisis. Towards this, we conducted in-depth interviews with 24 middle and senior-level managers across manufacturing and technology-enabled service sectors in India and analyzed the data using MAXQDA software. Employees reported an increase in working hours, major changes in their roles, reduced levels of productivity, and increased levels of stress. Besides these findings, we discovered sparks of creativity among employees during this isolation period. These creative steps were either towards nurturing oneself for career growth or towards solving long-pending organizational issues. Interestingly, the creativity was self-initiated. Our findings have key implications for organizations and their leaders who need to revisit work-from-home policies for the future workforce.

METHODS: Microsimulation models simulated five restart strategies for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. The models estimated required screening capacity, cancer incidence, and cancer-specific mortality after a disruption of 6 months. The restart strategies varied in whether screens were caught up or not and, if so, immediately or delayed, and whether the upper age limit was increased. RESULTS: The disruption in screening programmes without catch-up of missed screens led to an increase of 2.0, 0.3, and 2.5 cancer deaths per 100 000 individuals in 10 years in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, respectively. Immediately catching-up missed screens minimised the impact of the disruption but required a surge in screening capacity.

RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were studied (aged 59  14 years, 66% males, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II: 31  8). Citrate was dosed at median 2.1 mmol/L of blood flow, with citrate load of 30 mmol/h, and CVVH effluent of 43 mL/kg/h. Twenty patients developed CI. Comparing patients with CI versus none, peak lactate levels were 8 (5-11) versus 3 (2-6) mmol/L, calcium replacement was 13 (10-17) versus 11 (8-12) mmol/h, and standard base excess was -4 (-12 to 1) versus 2(-4 to 7) mmol/L, respectively ( P < .05). Citrate intolerance developed in 38%, 44%, and 55%, in patients with peak lactate >4, >6, >7 mmol/L, respectively, versus 7% in those with peak lactate 4 mmol/L ( P  .001), despite comparable citrate load and effluent rates across all categories. On multivariate analysis, hyperlactatemia and hyperbilirubinemia predicted CI ( P  .01), which was associated with increasing calcium infusion requirement. Higher peak lactate from >4 to >7 mmol/L predicted CI with graded increase in odds ratio and specificity from 59% to 87%, but the corresponding negative predictive value from 93% to 87%.

The objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up COVID-19 testing in India in the public sector. Methods: Potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts (9, 16 and 24 h). Additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qRT-PCR machines, leveraging spare capacity on available qRT-PCR machines not drafted into COVID-19 testing, to in-laboratory process optimization efforts. Results: Moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day. The capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qRT-PCR and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based machines available with the Multidisciplinary Research Units (MRUs), National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP). Using combination/multiplex kits, and provision of automated RNA extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times.

Consequently, mitochondrial injury is linked to systemic effects compromising multi-organ functionality. Although mitochondrial stress is common for many pathomechanisms, individual outcomes differ significantly comprising a spectrum of associated pathologies and their severity grade. Consequently, a highly ambitious task in the paradigm shift from reactive to predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM) is to distinguish between individual disease predisposition and progression under circumstances, resulting in compromised mitochondrial health followed by mitigating measures tailored to the individualized patient profile. For the successful implementation of PPPM concepts, robust parameters are essential to quantify mitochondrial health sustainability.

In this study, we have focused on chiral separation of synthetic cathinones in gradient supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using an inverse gradient of a make-up solvent. Synthetic cathinones possess an amphetamine-like effect and, therefore, are frequently being offered on the Internet as a replacement for illicit drugs. Cathinones are chiral compounds, however, they are usually marketed and used as racemic mixtures. Since the effect of individual enantiomers can significantly vary, there is a need for the development of enantioseparation methods enabling to study the biological effects of individual enantiomers. Since cathinones are basic molecules, they are easily protonated (positively charged) under weakly acidic mobile phase conditions, which is a typical feature of supercritical mobile phases with an alcohol as an organic modifier. The positively charged species represent ideal analytes for ion exchangers, such as chiral zwitterion ion exchangers Chiralpak ZWIX (+) and Chiralpak ZWIX (-), which possess a positively and negatively charged unit in the molecular structure of the selectors. The presence of the positive charge in the selector's structure, functioning as a counter-ion for the positively charged analytes, significantly reduces the required amount of a buffer, which is plausible for hyphenation of such a separation system with mass spectrometry. For mass spectrometry hyphenated to supercritical fluid chromatography, the use of a make-up solvent is required to avoid analyte precipitation when using a low concentration of an organic co-solvent (modifier) in the super-/subcritical mobile phase. Hereby, we introduce a unique approach, which is based on the gradient introduction of the make-up to the post-column effluent. Using this approach, it is possible to keep constant the overall amount of the organic solvent (modifier and make-up) introduced into the mass spectrometer when using a gradient of the organic modifier. We show that the developed gradient elution method facilitates the chiral separation of all employed analytes, while the mobile-phase gradient compensation by the inverse make-up gradient enables their detection with high signal intensities.","output":"Gradient supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with a gradient flow of make-up solvent for enantioseparation of cathinones."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 100,000 confirmed infections and 4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020). The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission.

Moreover in this model, a framework including flight hours, number of days and number of take-offs is considered for maintenance requirements. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is used as the solution approach. To validate the solution approach, 20 test problems were solved using GAMS and PSO. The results show that PSO improved CPU time significantly (98.279% in average) in turn of 1.902% gap with GAMS in optimum solution.","output":"An integrated model of aircraft routing and crew rostering problems to develop fair schedule for the crew under COVID-19 condition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Our goal was to identify genetic risk factors for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania braziliensis. METHODS Genotyping 2066 CL cases and 2046 controls using Illumina HumanCoreExomeBeadChips provided data for 4,498,586 imputed single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Genome-wide association testing using linear mixed models took account of genetic diversity/ethnicity/admixture. Post-GWAS positional, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), and chromatin interaction mapping was performed in FUMA. Transcriptional data were compared between lesions and normal skin, and cytokines measured using flow cytometry and Bioplex assay. RESULTS Positional mapping identified 32 genomic loci associated with CL, none achieving genome-wide significance (P&5x10 -8). Lead SNVs at 23 loci occurred at protein coding or non-coding RNA genes, 15 with eQTLs for functionally relevant cells/tissues and/or showed differential expression in lesions. Of these, the 6 most plausible genetic risk loci were: SERPINB10 (Pimputed_1000G=2.67x10 -6), CRLF3 (Pimputed_1000G=5.12x10 -6), STX7 (Pimputed_1000G=6.06x10 -6), KRT80 (Pimputed_1000G=6.58x10 -6), LAMP3 (Pimputed_1000G=6.54x10 -6) and IFNG-AS1 (Pimputed_1000G=1.32x10 -5). LAMP3 (Padjusted=9.25x10 -12; +6-fold), STX7 (Padjusted=7.62x10 -3; +1.3-fold) and CRLF3 (Padjusted=9.19x10 -9; +1.97-fold) were expressed more highly in CL biopsies compared to normal skin; KRT80 (Padjusted=3.07x10 -8; -3-fold) was lower. Multiple cis-eQTLs across SERPINB10 mapped to chromatin interaction regions of transcriptional/enhancer activity in neutrophils, monocytes, B cells and haematopoietic stem cells. Those at IFNG-AS1 mapped to transcriptional/enhancer regions in T, natural killer, and B cells. The percent peripheral blood CD3 + T cells making antigen-specific interferon- differed significantly by IFNG-AS1 genotype. CONCLUSIONS This first GWAS for CL identified multiple genetic risk loci including a novel lead to understanding CL pathogenesis through regulation of interferon- by IFNG antisense RNA 1.","output":"A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies SERPINB10, CRLF3, STX7, LAMP3, IFNG-AS1 and KRT80 As Risk Loci Contributing to Cutaneous Leishmaniasis In Brazil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Olfactory deficits are common in aging and associated with several conditions linked to inflammation. A few studies suggest that increased concentration of pro-inflammatory biomarkers may be related to olfactory deficits, but these associations are understudied in population-based samples. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and olfactory identification level as well as rate of change in aging. METHODS: We included 1,721 participants (mean age 70.5 years; 61.9% female) with at least two olfactory assessments across the 12-year follow-up. Baseline level and change in odor identification were estimated with linear mixed models as a function of CRP levels, derived from blood plasma at baseline. RESULTS: Results indicated a negative doseCresponse association between CRP level and odor identification scores at baseline, after adjustment for demographic, cognitive, health, and lifestyle factors. CRP levels ranging between 11 and 20 mg/L were significantly related to lower olfactory ability ( = ?0.811, 95% confidence interval [CI] [?1.503 to ?0.118]; p = .022). Likewise, CRP values above 20 mg/L were related to lower olfactory scores, an association that approached statistical significance ( = ?0.996, 95% CI [?2.045 to 0.054]; p = .063). We found no associations between CRP and olfactory change (ps > .368). Sensitivity analyses showed that associations between CRP and olfaction were confined to younger participants (age 72 years) and men (ps < .034).

Recent reports showed that children with KD-like disease from KD low prevalence regions had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology despite a negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples. OBJECTIVES: To describe 3 pediatric Kawasaki Disease patients with false positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively recruited children with KD diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test results including SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were retrieved. We performed a microparticle-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG against nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and a microneutralization assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: Three Chinese children with typical KD were identified. They had no epidemiological links with COVID-19 patients and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 NPA PCR. They were treated with IVIG and aspirin, and were discharged without complications. Subsequently 2 of them were tested positive against anti-RBD and anti-NP antibodies and 1 was tested positive against anti- RBD antibodies. However, microneutralization assay showed that neutralizing antibodies were absent, suggesting a false-positive IgG result.

Data were collected between 12th and 16th June 2020. Adjusted logistic regressions were used to separately investigate factors associated with adherence to use of personal protective equipment, maintaining good hand hygiene, and physical distancing from colleagues. Adherence to personal protective measures was suboptimal (PPE use: 80.0%, 95% CI [77.3 to 82.8], hand hygiene: 67.8%, 95% CI [64.6 to 71.0], coming into close contact with colleagues: 74.7%, 95% CI [71.7 to 77.7]). Adherence to PPE use was associated with having adequate PPE resources, receiving training during the pandemic, lower perceived fatalism from COVID-19, higher perceived social norms and higher perceived effectiveness of PPE. Adherence to physical distancing was associated with one's workplace being designed, using markings to facilitate physical distancing and receiving training during the pandemic.

METHODS Three hundred patients undergoing elective surgery requiring orotracheal intubation were enrolled. Patients presented at least one or more risk factors for difficult airway. The patients were randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups: group L, FOI with tongue root holder, or group C, standard FOI. Orotracheal FOI was performed after commencement of anesthesia. The jaw thrust maneuver was applied in both groups to facilitate advancement of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. The primary endpoint was the feasibility of FOI. The secondary endpoints were number of attempts, time to intubation, and airway clearance at the soft palate and epiglottis levels. RESULTS The FOI was achieved in all 150 patients in group L, significantly higher than that in group C (100% vs 95.3%; P = 0.015). Less attempts of intubation were made in group L (P = 0.039). Mean time to successful intubation on the first attempt was shorter in group L (P < 0.001). The mean times to view the vocal cord and carina were also shorter in group L (P = 0.011 and P < 0.001, respectively). Airway clearance was better in group L at both the soft palate and the glottis levels (P = 0.010 and P = 0.038, respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study shows that FOI is feasible with the newly introduced, self-designed, \\"tongue root holder\\" device, when combined with the jaw thrust maneuver in patients with risk factors for difficult airway. The device also provides better airway clearance, less intubation attempts, and shorter time to intubation at first attempt.

Methods: A total of 176 perinatal women were selected, who were delivered in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 24 to March 29, 2020. The general information of the patients was evaluated. The anxiety self?assessment scale (SAS) and depression self?assessment (SDS) were used before delivery. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess depression from 10 days to 14 days after delivery. The main factors affecting maternal depression and anxiety were investigated and analyzed. Results: During the outbreak of COVID?19, the incidence of anxiety (SAS score 50) was 47.73% (84 cases), and the incidence of depression (SDS score 0.5) was 54.55% (96 cases) before delivery. The incidence of depression (EPDS score0.5) was 44.89% (79 cases) after delivery. The prenatal SAS score was related to depression after delivery ( r =0.641, P <0.001), and the prenatal SDS score was also related to depression after delivery ( r =0.740, P <0.001). Logistic analysis indicated that worrying about the risk of COVID?19 infection ( OR =3.816, 95% CI :1.688?8.627, P =0.001), poor sleep quality ( OR =2.448, 95% CI : 1.053~5.694, P =0.038) and dyspnea in mask ( OR =2.464, 95% CI : 1.009?6.014, P =0.048) were the main risk factors for postpartum depression in pregnant women during outbreak of COVID?19. Conclusion: The outbreak of COVID?19 increased the incidence of maternal depression and anxiety during perinatal period, which was significantly related to the combination of multiple risk factors caused by the outbreak of COVID?19.

A detailed understanding of intervention strategies, including effectiveness of past outbreak containment, is necessary to improve future practices. The objective was to determine what is known about the effectiveness of containment measures for emerging and re-emerging vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban settings and identify research gaps and implications for public health practice. MAIN BODY: We conducted a scoping review and systematically searched peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction, and data on implementation process and transferability were extracted from all studies. A quality assessment was conducted for each included study. We screened 205 full-text articles and reports for a total of 31 articles included in the review. The quality of the studies was generally low to moderate. The largest body of evidence concerned control activities for Ebola virus and dengue fever. The majority of interventions (87%) relied on multiple types of measures, which were grouped into four categories: 1) healthcare provision; 2) epidemiological investigation and/or surveillance; 3) environmental or sanitary interventions; and 4) community-based interventions. The quality of the majority of studies (90%) was poor or moderate, and one-third of the studies did not provide a clear description of the outcomes and of the procedures and/or tools used for the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the difficulty of establishing causation when assessing the effect of containment measures. Studies that extend beyond solely reporting on effectiveness and take into account the complexity of real-world settings are urgently needed. We recommend the allocation of research efforts to the evaluation of the implementation processes of interventions as well as their comprehensive and systematic description using validated checklists.

However, most at a glance comparisons may be misleading because the curve that should explain the evolution of COVID-19 is different across countries, as a result of the underlying geopolitical or socio-economic characteristics. Therefore, this paper contributes to the scientific endeavour by creating a new evaluation framework to help stakeholders adequately monitor and assess the evolution of COVID-19 in countries, considering the occurrence of spikes, \\"secondary waves\\" and structural breaks in the time series. METHODS: Generalized Additive Models were used to model cumulative and daily curves for confirmed cases and deaths. The Root Relative Squared Error and the Percentage Deviance Explained measured how well the models fit the data. A local min-max function was used to identify all local maxima in the fitted values. The pure Markov-Switching and the family of Markov-Switching GARCH models were used to identify structural breaks in the COVID-19 time series. Finally, a quadrants system to identify countries that are more/less efficient in the short/long term in controlling the spread of the virus and the number of deaths was developed. Such methods were applied in the time series of 189 countries, collected from the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. RESULTS: Our methodology proves more effective in explaining the evolution of COVID-19 than growth functions worldwide, in addition to standardizing the entire estimation process in a single type of function. Besides, it highlights several inflection points and regime-switching moments, as a consequence of peoples diminished commitment to fighting the pandemic. Although Europe is the most developed continent in the world, it is home to most countries with an upward trend and considered inefficient, for confirmed cases and deaths.

METHODS Authors of identified published articles were approached by mail, e-mail, and at conferences and invited to take part in the study. Data were obtained from 8 studies (2186 cases). Individual patient data included patient's age, Glasgow Coma Score at presentation, volume and site of hematoma, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, method of evacuation, time to randomization, and outcome. RESULTS Meta-analysis indicated that there was improved outcome with surgery if randomization was [corrected] undertaken within 8 hours of ictus (P=0.003), or the volume of the hematoma was 20 to 50 mL (P=0.004), or the Glasgow Coma Score was between 9 and 12 (P=0.0009), or the patient was aged between 50 and 69 years (P=0.01). In addition, there was some evidence that more superficial hematomas with no intraventricular hemorrhage might also benefit (P=0.09).

Lung cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host by the ACE2 receptor. Thus, ACE2 is the key to understand the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the lack of knowledge about the biomarker of COVID-19 warrants the development of ACE2 biomarkers. The analysis of ACE2 expression in lung cancer was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Therefore, we investigated the prognosis, clinical characteristics, and mutational analysis of lung cancer. We also analyzed the shared proteins between the COVID-19 and lung cancer, protein-protein interactions, gene-miRNAs, gene-transcription factors (TFs), and the signaling pathway. Finally, we compared the mRNA expression of ACE2 and its co-expressed proteins using the TCGA. The up-regulation of ACE2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) was found irrespective of gender and age. We found the low survival rate in high expression of ACE2 in lung cancer patients and 16 mutational positions.

PTSD symptoms can be categorized into clusters including intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, each of which has been associated with distinct outcomes and treatment responses. Our objective was to determine which symptom cluster was predominant among surrogates of patients with CCI. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of a communication intervention. SETTING: The original trial was conducted in medical intensive care units at three tertiary-care centers and one community hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with CCI (7 d of mechanical ventilation and not expected to die or to be weaned from the ventilator in the subsequent 72 hr) and their surrogates. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Surrogate PTSD symptoms were measured 90 days after onset of patient CCI using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). The IES-R includes a total score (range, 0C88, higher scores indicate severe symptoms) as well as three subscales that assess intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal (range of intrusion and avoidance scores 0C32 and range of hyperarousal score 0C24). Intrusion symptoms were most severe (mean score, 10.3; 95% CI, 9.3C11.2), followed by avoidance (mean score, 8.0; 95% CI, 7.2C8.8). Hyperarousal symptoms were lowest (mean score, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.5C5.7).

After this phase (median = 108 days after intake, IQR = 76-137), we asked these patients who were classified as experiencing mild COVID-19 (n = 993) about last-month substance use in three time-points: pre-COVID, just after COVID-19 acute phase (post-COVID acute phase) and in the period before survey (post-COVID follow-up phase). Results: The number of COVID-19 symptoms was not associated with pre- or post-infection substance use. Pre-COVID alcohol and non-medical benzodiazepine use were associated with specific COVID-19 symptoms. However, sensitivity analyses showed that such associations could be explained by previous psychiatric and medical profiles. Alcohol and tobacco use decreased and non-medical analgesics increased in the post-COVID acute phase. However, just alcohol use remained lower in the post-COVID follow-up period. Higher pre-COVID levels of tobacco and alcohol were associated with post-COVID follow-up cannabis and non-medical analgesic use, respectively. Non-medical benzodiazepine use had positive and negative bi-directional associations with cannabis and non-medical analgesic use, respectively. Conclusion: We were not able to find specific associations between substance use and COVID-19 symptomatology in the present study. Patients with mild COVID-19 should be monitored for substance use in the post-COVID-19 period, and preventive interventions for non-medical analgesic use should be implemented. Focused preventive interventions increasing the perceived risks of cannabis and non-medical benzodiazepine and analgesic use among people experiencing mild COVID-19 that reported previous substance use could be useful.","output":"Substance Use in Mild-COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United Kingdom's COVID-19 epidemic during early 2020 was one of world's largest and was unusually well represented by virus genomic sampling.

Using large-scale phylogenetic analyses combined with epidemiological and travel data, we quantified the size, spatiotemporal origins, and persistence of genetically distinct UK transmission lineages. Rapid fluctuations in virus importation rates resulted in >1000 lineages; those introduced prior to national lockdown tended to be larger and more dispersed. Lineage importation and regional lineage diversity declined after lockdown, whereas lineage elimination was size-dependent.

Given the high-stakes nature of Step-1 for medical school advancement and residency match, SWD denied accommodations on Step-1 face considerable consequences. To date no study has investigated the rate of accommodation denial and its impact on medical school operations. METHODS: To investigate the rate of accommodation denial and evaluate whether Step-1 accommodation denial impacts medical school operations, a 10-question survey was sent to Student Affairs Deans and disability resource professionals at all fully-accredited US-MD granting programs. Two open-ended questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-three of the 141 schools responded (52%). In the 2018C2019 academic year, 276 students from 73 schools applied for Step-1 accommodations. Of these, 144 (52%) were denied. Of those denied, 74/144 (51%) were delayed entry into the next phase of curriculum and 110/144 (76%) took the Step-1 exam unaccommodated. Of the 110 who took Step-1 without accommodations, 35/110 (32%) failed the exam, and 4/110 (3%) withdrew or were dismissed following exam failure. Schools reported varied investments of time and financial support for students denied accommodations, with most schools investing less than 20 hours (67%) and less than $1,000.00 (69%). Open-responses revealed details regarding the impact of denial on schools and students including frustration with process; financial and human resources allocation; delay in student progression; lack of resourcing and expertise; and emotional and financial burdens on students.

Owners of companies and businesses have been forced to make difficult decisions. An example is the retrenchment of workers by some organizations because of the financial fall-out due to the coronavirus pandemic. Also, before the pandemic, South Africa had unemployment challenges, economic downgrading, and high levels of inequality (within the employment sector). These challenges bring to mind what the employment method and strategy will look like during the (post)-COVID-19. In view of these challenges, one question that comes to mind is: given the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that the job losses affected people of all races, should the policies of affirmative action and preferential hiring still be considered in South Africa? Thus, this paper is a philosophical reflection on COVID-19, job losses, affirmative action, and preferential hiring in South Africa. In reflecting on the above, this paper aims to show that affirmative action and preferential hiring should not be considered in South Africa during the (post)-COVID-19.

We hypothesized prophylactic administration of nesiritide (human recombinant brain natriuretic peptide, NES, Natrecor, Scios, Fremont, CA, USA), which has similar physiologic properties to ANP and would promote diuresis in maze and mitral patients postoperatively. METHODS Randomized, blinded, prospective pilot study comparing patients undergoing maze and mitral surgery including excision of the left atrial appendage. Three hours after cardiopulmonary bypass, patients received either a 72-hour infusion of NES at 0.01 mcg/kg/min (n = 9) or placebo (n = 10). Diuresis, diuretics, time to extubation, oxygenation, ANP, and serum Endothelin-1 levels were measured.

Building and strengthening the intrinsic motivation of HCWs to apply infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines to avoid contaminating their colleagues, patients, friends, and relatives is a goal that must be energetically pursued. A high rate of nosocomial infections during the first COVID-19 wave was detected by IPC specialists and further cemented their belief in the need for an engaging intervention that could improve compliance with COVID-19 safe behaviors. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a serious game that would promote IPC practices with a specific focus on COVID-19 among HCWs and other hospital employees. METHODS: The first 3 stages of the SERES framework were used to develop this serious game. A brainswarming session between developers and IPC specialists was used to identify the target audience and acquisition objectives. Nicholsons RECIPE mnemonic (reflection, engagement, choice, information, play, exposition) for meaningful gamification was used to guide the general design. A common and simple terminology was used to suit the broad target audience. The game was tested on various platforms (smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers) by different users during each development loop and before its final release. RESULTS: The game was designed to target all hospital staff who could be in direct contact with patients within the Geneva University Hospitals. In total, 10 acquisition objectives were defined by IPC specialists and implemented into the game according to the principles of meaningful gamification. A simple storyboard was first created using Microsoft PowerPoint and was progressively refined through multiple iteration loops. Articulate Storyline was then used to create two successive versions of the actual game. In the final version, a unique graphic atmosphere was created with help from a professional graphic designer. Feedback mechanisms were used extensively throughout the game to strengthen key IPC messages. CONCLUSIONS: The SERES framework was successfully used to create Escape COVID-19, a serious game designed to promote safe IPC practices among HCWs and other hospital employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. This game can be obtained free of charge for research and educational purposes. A SCORM (shareable content object reference model) package is available to facilitate results and completion tracking on most current learning management systems.","output":"A Serious Game Designed to Promote Safe Behaviors Among Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development of Escape COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had emerged in 2019 and rapidly posed a global epidemic.

In this review, we aimed to present the current understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and neonatal periods considering diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention. Few studies on pregnant women with COVID-19 have been conducted between December 2019 and April 2020. The majority of patients applied in the third trimester and presented with fever and cough. Ground-glass opacities and consolidation on computed tomography were reported to be common. COVID-19 was proposed to have a milder course than SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in pregnant women. Hydroxychloroquine and antiproteases (lopinavir/ritonavir) were reported to be safe; however, therapeutic efficacy and safety of remdesivir still lack evidence. As ribavirin and favipiravir have teratogenic effects, there are some debates on the use of ribavirin in severe cases. There is still no clear evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during delivery. Occupational safety issues of pregnant healthcare workers on the frontline should be considered as their risk to develop severe pneumonia is higher because of altered maternal immune response. Knowledge about neonatal outcomes of COVID-19 was based on studies of the last trimester of pregnancy.

Comparing the cellular immune response to p32 between patients who were distinctive responders (n = 10) or non-responders (n = 10) to neuroleptic treatment indicated a similar elevation of cellular response in these groups. Antibodies against HSP60 were screened by dot-blot and ELISA in the sera of the above blood samples.

We measure the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities (RH); median estimated virus half-life is >24 hours at 10C and 40% RH, but ~1.5 hours at 27C and 65% RH. Our mechanistic model uses fundamental chemistry to explain why inactivation rate increases with increased temperature and shows a U-shaped dependence on RH. The model accurately predicts existing measurements of five different human coronaviruses, suggesting that shared mechanisms may affect stability for many viruses.

Understanding these perceptions and their influence on patients treatment decision-making is crucial for achieving compliance, especially during Covid-19 pandemic. Aim: to assess patients perception of risks of IBD exacerbation and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their influence on patients decisions regarding biologic and immunosuppressive treatments during Covid-19 pandemic in Israel. METHODS: A prospective internet-based survey among Meir Medical Center, IBD clinic patients. RESULTS: 116 patients have responded. Mean age 42 (18C84), 44 (38%) males, 75 (64%) Crohns disease, 38 (32%) ulcerative colitis, 34 (29%) with history of abdominal surgery, 47 (40%) were in remission and 9(7.5%) with severe disease. 18 (15%) patients were on Immunosuppressive and 76 (66%) on biologic treatments. Concerns of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection: 56 (48%) patients considered their risk as equal to that of the general population whereas 53 (46%) considered it to be increased. 55% of the patients related the increase risk of COVID-19 infection to their IBD treatment, whereas 47% related it to having IBD. Patients treated with biologics were more concerned of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 then those who were not. There was also a significant association between depression and anxiety levels and the fear of becoming infected (r= 0.3 for depression and 0.4 for anxiety). Adherence to IBD treatment: Only 8 (7.5%) patients considered stopping their IBD treatment, and only 4 (3.7%) patients actually stopped their treatment. Patients with more severe disease were more inclined to stop their treatment compared to those with mild disease. Reasons for not stopping treatment were fear of disease exacerbation in 37 (32%) patients, and reassuring information received from medical providers, in 25 (21.5%) patients. When faced with a theoretical question of trading long-term remission versus risk of SARS-CoV-2infection, 34 (29%) patients were willing to accept a 10% infection risk for a 10-year remission CONCLUSION: Significant portion of the patients with IBD believe that they are at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection, and more than half of them related the increase risk to their IBD treatment. However, despite their fear most patients felt safe enough to continue their treatment.

Quota sampling was used to match the racial/ethnic and urban/rural distribution of the state. More than one in seven (15.1%) participants reported physical, sexual, psychological, or technology-facilitated IPV since COVID, similar to the prevalence in the 3 months before COVID (16.2%). However, there were indications that IPV severity increased and that novel cases of IPV are occurring in relationships that previously had no abuse.

METHODS We have used several devices to gain transumbilical access to the abdominal cavity, usually working with 3 cannulae to insert the instruments. We used a 5 mm endograsper, and articulated rotating (roticulating) endoscissors and endodissector to assist dissection. Vascular control and section of the rectum were performed using roticulating endostaplers. We combined the use of curved and straight instruments as required for each step during surgery. The dissection technique performed was the same as the one we normally use in conventional laparoscopy. Specimens were extracted through the umbilical incision.

Self-esteem mediates the relationship between microaggressions and general health. It is a protective factor of mental health. Identity moderates this relationship, so that a high identification as a black woman is related to lower levels of mental health when faced with a high frequency of discriminatory events. Despite some limitations, the objectives were achieved. Future studies should contribute with explanations of the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health.","output":"Effects of gendered racial microaggressions on the mental health of black women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented levels of disruption to the local and regional transportation networks throughout the United States, especially the Motor City: Detroit.

The aim of the research was to determine the scheduling maturity within project management in selected medium-sized and large companies and the change in the use of these methods during the global COVID-19 virus pandemic. The research presented in this article consists of three consecutive steps: determining the research area and the research question, designing a research plan, conducting data collection and analysis and compiling research results. For the purposes of this research, the research question was defined as follows: How do the project management scheduling methods differ depending on the company size in the selected companies in the Czech Republic? For understanding both the context and the situation in the surveyed companies, qualitative approaches to data collection and analysis were used, particularly in-depth interviews and encoding method. This approach was chosen mainly due to the fact that in case of quantitative research, the results tend to be improved by the respondents or irrelevant respondents are questioned. The semi-structured interview questions which were created based on the findings of the current state of scientific knowledge and literary research were used for the needs of in-depth interviews. Open questions (topics) related to the respondents' experience, perceptions and opinions were created as a part of the preparation process. The aim was to get more reliable and relevant answers to the questions asked. The research, which lasted for 6 months, involved 10 medium-sized and large companies from the Czech Republic. The change in the use of scheduling methods took place mainly in medium-sized companies. Large companies emphasized scheduling even before the pandemic, medium-sized companies often neglected this area - planning was not documented, linked to other projects, suppliers or customers. The pandemic has changed this situation. Companies that participated in this research have started to understand integrated scheduling approaches and are going to invest or consider to invest in complex software solutions in the near future.","output":"Use of Construction Project Scheduling Methods in the Czech Republic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

When prevention and control of COVID-19 is gradually normalized, communication between countries needs to be gradually restored due to development needs. There are 34 vaccines in the clinical evaluation stage and 145 vaccines in the preclinical evaluation stage in the global COVID-19 vaccine research and development program, but the rate and process of vaccination may not be sufficient to meet the current needs of society for restoring development and communication. Studies have found that chloroquine, favipiravir, remdesivir and other drugs are useful for COVID-19, but currently there is no specific drug for the treatment of COVID-19. The main detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 at present include pathogenic detection methods, molecular biology detection methods and antibody detection, of which molecular biology detection technology is the main detection method at present. There are some more convenient and rapid detection methods. A study showed that salivary nucleic acid testing could be used for large-scale screening of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the results showed that the probability of true concordance between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva was stubbornly 0.998 (90% CI: 0.996-0.999). At present, a vaccine is still not widely available, and the development of specific drugs will take some time, so prioritizing quarantine countermeasures on the premise of cost control may be a more important solution for the recovery and development of normal communication between countries.","output":"The development of a quarantine strategy is an important path to a normalized response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to predict oil prices during the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by looking into green energy resources, global environmental indexes (ESG), and stock markets.

Methods Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) was performed at study entry (baseline, BL) and after 96 weeks. Percentage BMD change from BL was evaluated using a general linear model, including factors potentially associated with bone loss. Results One hundred and sixty PLWH were enrolled (26.3% female, mean age 49.9  11.2 years) from April 2015 to April 2017.

The virus has been mutating and local transmission cases from different countries vary due to host dependent viral adaptation. Many distinct clusters of variant SARS CoV2 have been defined globally. In this study, the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 was studied and locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants.The real time PCR was performed on nasopharyngeal specimen to confirm SARSCoV2 with Orf 1ab and E gene as targets. The viral sequencing was performed through oxford nanopore technology MinION platform. Isolates from first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi were compared. The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24% with highest number of positive cases in June. Approximately, 37.45% PCR positive subjects aged between 19-40 years. All the isolates belonged to GH clade and shared missense mutation D614G in spike protein linked to increased transmission rate worldwide. Another spike protein mutation A222V coexisted with D614G in the virus from second wave of COVID-19. Based on the present findings it is suggested that the locally transmitted virus from Karachi vary from those reported from other parts of Pakistan. Slight variability was also observed between viruses from first and second wave. Variability in any potential vaccine target may result in failed trials therefore information on any local viral variants is always useful for effective vaccine design and/or selection. Authors summary Despite precautionary measures the COVID-19 pandemic is causing deaths all over the world. The continuous mutations in viral genome is making it difficult to design vaccines. Variability in genome is host dependent and data sharing has revealed that variant for different geographical locations may harbor different mutations. Keeping this in mind the current study was focused on the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID C19 suspected cases with impact of age and gender. The locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants. The sequenced viral genome varied from the already submitted sequences from Pakistan thereby confirming that slightly different viruses were causing infections during different time periods in Karachi. All belonged to GH clade with D614G, P323L and Q57H mutations. The virus from second wave had A222V mutation making it more different.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study in patients younger than 18 years of age with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cancer diagnoses between April and September 2020. Demographic variables, laboratory, and radiologic findings and complications of each case were identified. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients were identified; the median age was 10 years. Fifteen patients (42%) were in chemotherapy at the time of the infection diagnosis, in two patients the chemotherapy protocol was permanently suspended. The most common symptom was fever in 20 patients (60%). Seven patients (21.2%) showed mild pneumonia, four patients (12.1%) severe pneumonia, and three cases (9.0%) were classified as critical. In the evaluated cohort, five patients (15.1%) died, and in two of those, death was caused by COVID-19 infection.

Single- and multiphase CTA collateral scoring systems have been described but are subjective and require training. We aimed to test whether the CTP-derived hypoperfusion intensity ratio is associated with CTA collateral status and whether a threshold hypoperfusion intensity ratio exists that predicts poor CTA collaterals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging and clinical data of consecutive patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke were retrospectively reviewed. Single-phase CTA and multiphase CTA scoring were performed by 2 blinded neuroradiologists using the Tan, Maas, and Calgary/Menon methods. CTP was processed using RApid processing of PerfusIon and Diffusion software (RAPID). Hypoperfusion intensity ratio = ratio of brain volume with time-to-maximum >10 seconds over time-to-maximum >6-second volume. Correlation between the hypoperfusion intensity ratio and CTA collateral scores was calculated using the Pearson correlation. The optimal threshold of the hypoperfusion intensity ratio for predicting poor collaterals was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke were included. Multiphase CTA collateral scoring showed better interrater agreement (&#954; = 0.813) than single-phase CTA (Tan, &#954; = 0.587; Maas, &#954; = 0.273). The hypoperfusion intensity ratio correlated with CTA collateral scores (multiphase CTA: r = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.40; P &#8804; .001). The optimal threshold for predicting poor multiphase CTA collateral status was a hypoperfusion intensity ratio of >0.45 (sensitivity = 78%; specificity = 76%; area under the curve = 0.86). Patients with high hypoperfusion intensity ratio/poor collateral status had lower ASPECTS/larger infarcts, higher NIHSS scores, and larger hypoperfused volumes. CONCLUSIONS: The hypoperfusion intensity ratio is associated with CTA collateral status in patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. The hypoperfusion intensity ratio is an automated and quantitative alternative to CTA collateral scoring methods for both clinical and future stroke trial settings.","output":"Hypoperfusion Intensity Ratio Correlates with CTA Collateral Status in Large-Vessel Occlusion Acute Ischemic Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O8 Figure 1Flow chart showing TTG-IgA and histological correlation for children with suspected CD CD, celiac disease;GFD, gluten free diet;MO-HG, Marsh Oberhuber histological grading;TTG-IgA, IgA-based anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody;UGIE, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy;ULN, upper limit of normal[Figure omitted See PDF]ConclusionThis study showed that 99 5% of children with TGA-IgA 5xULN had clear histological confirmation of CD with p&lt;0 00001 compared to TGA-IgA&lt;5xULN For the same advantages of the current NBP and considering the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, changing the guidance to TGA-IgA 5xULN appears to be safe and secure for diagnosis of CD in children","output":"O8 Is anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody titre greater than five times upper limit of normal suitable for no-biopsy pathway diagnosis of coeliac disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper assesses the Granger causality between government spending and gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States at multiple horizons. This paper also analyses the role the real exchange rate plays in the causality measure during the zero lower bound (ZLB) period. Many researchers using theoretical models built in a closed economy suggest that the elasticity between government spending and GDP is very large, when the nominal interest rate is binding. Other researchers, also using theoretical models generally built in an open economy, suggest that the elasticity in the ZLB period is not large. The same conflicting results are reported in the empirical literature mostly using vector auto regressives (VARs), with different restrictions. In this paper, we use a different approach to measure the link between the two variables. The new approach has the advantage of not relying on any restrictions, as is the case with VARs when dealing with causalities. Moreover, our approach is not related to the way the model is built, as is the case with dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) types of models. In this paper, we use a Granger causality measure to compare the causality for normal periods with the causality for the ZLB period. We emphasize the role played by the real exchange rate. Our empirical results provide evidence that the causality measures between government spending and GDP are larger and persistent in the ZLB period, but only if the exchange rate is not taken into account.

The study assessed knowledge of vaccine cold chain handlers on vaccine cold chain management, adherence to the WHO vaccine storage codes and vaccine cold chain management practice at primary health facilities in Dalocha district of Silt'e zone. METHOD: Institutional-based cross-sectional study was done at twenty-eight primary health facilities. One hundred forty primary health workers were drawn from four health centers and twenty-four health posts operating in Dalocha woreda of Silt'e zone, SNNPR, Ethiopia. A self-administered questionnaires and on-spot observation checklists were adapted from the WHO and WHO-UNICEF-effective vaccine management assessment tools to collect data from cold chain unit of the primary healthcare facilities. Data were entered to EPI data version 3.1; exported and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine the level of knowledge, adherence to WHO cold chain management guideline and vaccine handling practice. The relationship that the knowledge of primary healthcare workers, primary healthcare workers training status, primary healthcare facilities' adherence to WHO vaccine storage codes, and length of work experience of primary health care workers have with the vaccine management practice were also explored RESULT: Above Half (54%) of the respondents have satisfactory knowledge of vaccine cold chain management. One hundred (71.4%) vaccine cold chain handlers did point correctly to the recommended range of temperature (2C -8C) for vaccine storage. Around two-thirds (63.6%) of them were aware of the twice-daily temperature recordings. Nearly half, (46.2%) of primary healthcare facilities have experienced poor adherence to the WHO storage practice codes. Around three-fifths of the observed primary healthcare facilities have registered undesirable vaccine management practices.

It is not 50:50, but approximately 0.515 in favour of males. There are many factors that can influence Sex Ratio at Birth and its variations are not easily demonstrable. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Our aim has been to investigate the environmental and human agents capable of causing variations in the Sex Ratio at Birth by providing a narrative review of the scientific literature. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Studies demonstrated that male and female embryos/foetuses response to stress in different way and the male ones show less resistance. This phenomenon seems to persist for approximately six months after a stressful event, suggesting a purpose of reproductive regulation and protection of the perpetuation of the species. Although the relationship of dependence with parenting decisions, thanks to prenatal diagnosis and assisted fertility techniques is easily understood, it is more complex to correlate its variations with environmental pressures that act through secondary mechanisms. The Covid-19 pandemic, natural catastrophes, terroristic attacks, economic crises are some of the difficulties encountered in recent times. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of all the factors reported is not explained only with a possible a priori determination of sex at conception, but also with secondary effects in the pregnancy outcomes. Thus, the determination of sex appears to be a complex and multifactorial mechanism, besides a matter of genetics.

The pathogens spectrum of pulmonary infection that can affect patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is wide such as bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitic organisms, and so on. The risk of multi-pathogenic pneumonia is higher in HIV-infected patients. However, the fast and accurate diagnosis of multi-pathogenic pneumonia is challenging because of the limitations of current conventional tests. Case Presentation: Here, we report a case of pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in a 22-year-old male with newly diagnosed HIV infection. Blood tests revealed a low CD4 count, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed extensive ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung with multiple cavity lesions in the left upper lung. Microscopic examination of stained sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) smear specimens did not find any pathogens. There was also no evidence of pathogens known to cause pneumonia in bacteria and fungi culture tests and virus antibodies such as EBV, CMV, and COVID-19. The nucleic acid of CMV in blood was reported by quantitative PCR. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of BALF specimens identified a large number of P. jirovecii and CMV reads, and confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia due to P. jirovecii and CMV. Following the patient's treatment with anti-PCP and anti-CMV, the patient was cured and discharged.

The causative agent of the disease, SARS-CoV-2, is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight into key molecular mechanisms required for its survival. Contained within the untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are various conserved stem-loop elements that are believed to function in RNA replication, viral protein translation, and discontinuous transcription. While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence, a 41-nucleotide s2m element within the genome 3 untranslated region is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral families. In this study, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element dimerizes by forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation. This process is aided by the viral nucleocapsid protein, potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the s2m element interacts with multiple copies of host cellular microRNA (miRNA) 1307-3p. Taken together, our results highlight the potential significance of the dimer structures formed by the s2m element in key biological processes and implicate the motif as a possible therapeutic drug target for COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases.","output":"Highly conserved s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 dimerizes via a kissing complex and interacts with host miRNA-1307-3p"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper utilizes timely proprietary data to examine the contemporary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial property rent dynamics in the AsiaCPacific region. Given that the AsiaCPacific region was the first to be impacted by the public health crisis, it is important to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the real estate markets in this region and to assess how the region has been recovering since then. Our regression analysis, controlling for different macroeconomic fundamentals and city and property type fixed effects, documents substantial declines in rents of approximately 15% during the first six months of 2020 across the AsiaCPacific commercial property market. We further observe that the most significant declines in rent occur in regions where exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic is the more severe, and in the retail property sector, where we have been observing continued declines of over 30%, with little recovery as of the second quarter of 2020. In additional analysis, we examine capital values and show that while capital targeting the retail property sector has been muted, there is some evidence showing capital flows into the residential and industrial sectors. We also show that fiscal stimuli imposed by governments have moderated the adverse impact of the pandemic.

However, the performance and power consumption associated with the involved devices are often not sufficiently contemplated, despite being particularly important in light of sustainability considerations. The contributions of this research are thus twofold. On the one hand, we present telepresence solutions for a social robots location-independent operation using (a) a virtual reality headset with controllers and (b) a mobile augmented reality application. On the other hand, we perform a thorough analysis of their power consumption and system performance, discussing the impact of employing the various technologies. Using the QTrobot as a platform, direct and immersive control via different interaction modes, including motion, emotion, and voice output, is possible.

Millions of people worldwide have been affected and cases continue to rise. Health organizations have focused on creating vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-19 and have successfully formulated new vaccines to distribute globally. However, rare blood clots have been reported on patients receiving viral vector vaccines, halting the distribution and restricting the vaccine's use to limited population. BNT162b1/BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines have been introduced to the world and early studies reported no safety profile against thrombotic events [1,3]. We report a rare case of internal jugular vein thrombosis (IJT) occurring who received his first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and subsequently developed clot in his internal jugular vein. CASE PRESENTATION: 38-year-old with history of opioid abuse on suboxone received his first BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on April 18, 2021. Two days later patient experienced chest pain, dyspnea, left neck swelling and dry cough with odynophagia. Outpatient work up with ultrasonography evaluation revealed a clot and was referred for further evaluation. Carotid US confirmed noncompressible internal jugular vein and CT chest demonstrated left innominate vein thrombus. Laboratory work was notable for elevated PT, PTT, leukocytosis, thrombophilia, elevated LDH and D-Dimer. Intranasal PCR was negative for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Malignancy workup during hospital admission was negative. DISCUSSION: mRNA vaccines have been reported as a safe and efficacious new type of vaccine to combat SARS-CoV-19. Until recently, no thrombotic events were reported from any BNT162b1/ BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines [2]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a rare blood clot seen after the first dose of any mRNA vaccine. Given our patient's symptom onset within 1 week of his first dose with documented thrombus and elevated inflammatory markers and in the absence of comorbid conditions, we hypothesize that BNT162b2 likely triggered an extreme immune inflammatory response culminating in our patient's IJT. Patient only received 1 dose of the vaccine but response to the vaccine varies by individual. Careful monitoring of patients for post-vaccine is appropriate given the lack of long-term safety profile. This report will hopefully provide some insight into a potential complication of the newly developed mRNA vaccine that was not discovered during the initial investigative studies. CONCLUSIONS: The adenovirus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine recently became associated with pathologic thrombosis and, although rare, thrombosis may also be a complication of the mRNA vaccines. Close monitoring and possible prophylactic treatment may be considered in patients receiving these vaccines who are at high risk for thrombosis.

This digitisation of services has led to the concept of Digitally Enhanced Advanced Services (DEAS), a model of servitisation applied in the manufacturing sector, being discussed in relation to the charity sector. This paper examines the applicability of DEAS to the charity sector. It explores how trust, resilience and privacy are addressed in co-creating digital platforms as well as the sustainability of digital services. Using the Refugee Council Children's Section as a case study, a mixed methods approach was applied including data mining, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners and service users. Findings show that there exists a tension between the digital and the reality in the charity sector: digital services increase access to service users in remote areas but digital poverty and illiteracy remain significant obstacles for digital servitisation. Resilience and adaptability have enabled the charity sector to operate inside the tension between the digital and reality. The adoption of DEAS in the charity sector will be dependent upon maximising opportunities, implementing changes, and overcoming barriers. ? 2021 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

However, the pathogenic mechanism of the diseases linked to TDP-43 is largely unknown. We hypothesized that the failure of mRNA transport to neuronal axons by TDP-43 may contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD, and sought to examine the function of TDP-43 by identifying its target mRNA for axonal transport. We found that mRNAs related to translational function including ribosomal proteins (RPs) were decreased by shRNA-based TDP-43 knock-down in neurites of cortical neurons. TDP-43 binds to and transports the RP mRNAs through their 5' untranslated region, which contains a common 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract motif and a downstream GC-rich region. We showed by employing in vitro and in vivo models that the RP mRNAs were translated and incorporated into native ribosomes locally in axons to maintain functionality of axonal ribosomes, which is required for local protein synthesis in response to stimulation and stress to axons. We also found that RP mRNAs were reduced in the pyramidal tract of sporadic ALS cases harboring TDP-43 pathology. Our results elucidated a novel function of TDP-43 to control transport of RP mRNAs and local translation by ribosomes to maintain morphological integrity of neuronal axons, and proved the influence of this function of TDP-43 on neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.","output":"TDP-43 transports ribosomal protein mRNA to regulate axonal local translation in neuronal axons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Population ageing impacts many areas of society from health and social care cost to housing and future workforce, and whole-of-society approach is required to promote healthy ageing. The Decade of Healthy Ageing report has called upon multi-sectoral collaboration to promote age-friendly communities. The Healthy Ageing Promotion Program for You (HAPPY) is a community-based dual-task exercise program for older adults led by health coaches (HC) or trained volunteers (HAPPY leaders) to promote healthy ageing. The primary objective was to observe improvement in cognition. The secondary objective was to observe improvement in frailty status, functional status, perceived health and reduction of social isolation. We also aim to evaluate the effectiveness and describe the implementation of the HAPPY program. DESIGN: To engage older adults with prefrailty, frailty and/or cognitive impairment in dual-task exercise program. Recruitment and publicity were through country-wide multisectoral collaboration. SETTING: Community setting PARTICIPANTS: More than 700 older adults participated in  50 different sites including senior activity centres. Five hundred and sixty-nine participants attended phase 1 screening. Pre-frail or frail ambulant participants or those with underlying cognitive impairment were invited to participate in phase 2 screening. Among them 296 participants enrolled in phase 2 with 66.6% follow up rate at 3 months. MEASUREMENTS: Phase 1 and 2 screening consisted of screening for frailty (FRAIL), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), falls, vision, grip strength, perceived health (EuroQol vertical visual analogue scale), depression (geriatric depression scale), social network (6-item Lubben Social Network Scale), gait speed and physical function (Short physical performance battery [SPPB]). RESULTS: HC led 61.7% of the participants, and HAPPY was conducted twice weekly for 64% of the participants. There was significant improvement in the MoCA scores both in the HC and HAPPY leaders led groups. Overall physical function, chair-stand and balance domain improved significantly especially in the groups led by HC and those participating in twice-weekly exercises. There was significant improvement in perceived health, reduction in social isolation, improvement in frailty status and reduction of falls at 3 months. CONCLUSION: Community embedded peer-led program to promote healthy ageing like HAPPY can improve cognition, physical function, and frailty status, reduce social isolation, and improve perceived health. It takes a village to promote healthy ageing, and the need to have a life course approach to healthy longevity which must involve local government and ministerial organisations, non-profit organisations, industries, academia, and community to redesign health.","output":"Community-Based Peer-Led Intervention for Healthy Ageing and Evaluation of the HAPPY Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some occupational sectors, such as human health and care, food service, cultural and sport activities, have been associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than other sectors. To curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is preferable to apply targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions on selected economic sectors, rather than a full lockdown. However, the effect of these general and sector-specific interventions on the virus circulation has only been sparsely studied. We assess the COVID-19 incidence under different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions per economic activity during the autumn 2020 wave in Belgium. The 14-day incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases per the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACECBEL) sector is modelled by a longitudinal Gaussian-Gaussian two-stage approach. This is based on exhaustive data on all employees in all sectors. In the presence of sanitary protocols and minimal non-pharmaceutical interventions, many sectors with close contact with others show considerably higher COVID-19 14-day incidences than other sectors. The effect of stricter non-pharmaceutical interventions in the general population and non-essential sectors is seen in the timing of the peak incidence and the width and height of the post-peak incidence. In most sectors incidences returned to higher levels after the peak than before and this decrease took longer for the health and care sector. Sanitary protocols for close proximity occupations may be sufficient during periods of low-level virus circulation, but progressively less with increasing circulation. Stricter general and sector-specific non-pharmaceutical interventions adequately decrease COVID-19 incidences, even in close proximity in essential sectors under solely sanitary protocols.","output":"Confirmed COVID-19 Cases per Economic Activity during Autumn Wave in Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The current research on frontline medical staff in China fighting against COVID-19 has not yet addressed job satisfaction.

So far, COVID-19 is not fully contained, and new cases are arising on daily bases in various countries.

Full genome analysis revealed its resemblance with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus with minor variation in non-structural proteins. Both viruses use the common angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor to attach to the epithelial cells of the target organs. Currently, COVID-19 patients are treated with drugs that are used for lungs infections. However, ACE2 has high expression in other human organs such as kidney and testes. Thus, it is assumed that, like SARS, it may have adverse effects on other vital organs, which have dominant expression of ACE2. In testis, SARS affected patients displayed peritubular fibrosis, extensive germ cell disruption, damage of blood-testis barrier integrity and more frequent occurrence of apoptosis.

SettingParticipants were recruited at the Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia between May and October 2020. ParticipantsThose who had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive nasal/throat swab. Main outcomes and measuresSARS-CoV-2 antibody and cellular responses in children and adults. Seroconversion was defined by seropositivity in all three serological assays. ResultsAmong 108 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants, 57 were children (median age: 4, IQR 2-10) and 51 were adults (median age: 37, IQR 34-45). Using three established serological assays, a lower proportion of children seroconverted compared with adults [20/54 (37.0%) vs 32/42 (76.2%); (p<0.001)]. This was not related to viral load, which was similar in children and adults [mean Ct 28.58 (SD: 6.83) vs 24.14 (SD: 8.47)]. Age and sex also did not influence seroconversion or the magnitude of antibody response within children or adults. Notably, in adults (but not children) symptomatic adults had three-fold higher antibody levels than asymptomatic adults (median 227.5 IU/mL, IQR 133.7-521.6 vs median 75.3 IU/mL, IQR 36.9-113.6). Evidence of cellular immunity was observed in adults who seroconverted but not in children who seroconverted. Conclusion and RelevanceIn this non-hospitalized cohort with mild COVID-19, children were less likely to seroconvert than adults despite similar viral loads. This has implications for future protection following COVID-19 infection in children and for interpretation of serosurveys that involve children.

While the severity of most pulmonary viral infections, including influenza A virus (IAV), is linked to excessive inflammation, our mechanistic understanding of this observation remains largely unknown. Here we show that mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) protects against IAV infection via disease tolerance. Mice deficient in CypD (CypD-/- mice) are significantly more susceptible to IAV infection despite comparable antiviral immunity. Instead, this susceptibility resulted from damage to the lung epithelial barrier caused by a significant reduction of IL-22 production by conventional NK cells in IAV-infected CypD-/- mice. Transcriptomic and functional data revealed that the compromised IL-22 production by NK cells resulted from dysregulated lymphopoiesis, stemming from increased cell death in NK cell progenitors, as well as the generation of immature NK cells that exhibited altered mitochondrial metabolism. Importantly, following IAV infection, administration of recombinant IL-22 abrogated pulmonary damage and enhanced survival of CypD-/- mice.

However, in the long-term follow-up, weight loss failure and intractable severe reflux after primary LSG can necessitate further surgical interventions, and revisional sleeve gastrectomy (ReSG) can represent an option to correct these. METHODS From October 2008 to June 2013, 36 patients underwent an ReSG for progressive weight regain, insufficient weight, or severe gastroesophageal reflux in 'La Casamance' Private Hospital. All patients with weight loss failure after primary LSG underwent radiological evaluation. If Gastrografin swallow showed a huge unresected fundus or an upper gastric pouch dilatation, or if the computed tomography (CT) scan volumetry revealed a gastric tube superior to 250 cc, ReSG was proposed. RESULTS Thirty-six patients (34 women, two men; mean age 41.3 years) with a body mass index (BMI) of 39.9 underwent ReSG. Thirteen patients (36.1 %) had their original LSG surgery performed at another hospital and were referred to us for weight loss failure. Twenty-four patients (66.6 %) out of 36 had a history of gastric banding with weight loss failure. Thirteen patients (36.1 %) were super-obese (BMI > 50) before primary LSG. The LSG was realized for patients with morbid obesity with a mean BMI of 47.1 (range 35.4-77.9). The mean interval time from the primary LSG to ReSG was 34.5 months (range 9-67 months). The indication for ReSG was insufficient weight loss for 19 patients (52.8 %), weight regain for 15 patients (41.7 %), and 2 patients underwent ReSG for invalidating gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 24 cases the Gastrografin swallow results were interpreted as primary dilatation, and in the remaining 12 cases results were interpreted as secondary dilatation. The CT scan volumetry was realized in 21 cases, and it has revealed a mean gastric volume of 387.8 cc (range 275-555 cc). All 36 cases were completed by laparoscopy with no intraoperative incidents. The mean operative time was 43 min (range 29-70 min), and the mean hospital stay was 3.9 days (range 3-16 days). One perigastric hematoma was recorded. The mean BMI decreased to 29.2 (range 20.24-37.5); the mean percentage of excess weight loss was 58.5 % (25.3) (p < 0.0004) for a mean follow-up of 20 months (range 6-56 months). CONCLUSIONS The ReSG may be a valid option for failure of primary LSG for both primary or secondary dilatation. Long-term results of ReSG are awaited to prove efficiency.

In particular, to consider how to hold mass gathering events, it is important to clarify how the local infection prevalence, the number of spectators, the capacity proportion, and the implementation of preventions affect the infection risk. In this study, we used an environmental exposure model to analyse the relationship between infection risk and infection prevalence, the number of spectators, and the capacity proportion at mass gathering events in football and baseball games. In addition to assessing risk reduction through the implementation of various preventive measures, we assessed how face-mask-wearing proportion affects infection risk. Furthermore, the model was applied to estimate the number of infectors who entered the stadium and the number of newly infected individuals, and to compare them with actual reported cases. The model analysis revealed an 86%-95% reduction in the infection risk due to the implementation of face-mask wearing and hand washing. Among the individual measures, face-mask wearing was particularly effective, and the infection risk increased as the face-mask-wearing proportion decreased. A linear relationship was observed between infection risk at mass gathering events and the infection prevalence. Furthermore, the number of newly infected individuals was also dependent on the number of spectators and the capacity proportion independent of the infection prevalence, confirming the importance of considering spectator capacity in infection risk management. These results highlight that it is beneficial for organisers to ensure prevention compliance and to mitigate or limit the number of spectators according to the prevalence of local infection. Both the estimated and reported numbers of newly infected individuals after the events were small, below 10 per 3-4 million spectators, despite a small gap between these numbers.","output":"Assessment of COVID-19 risk and prevention effectiveness among spectators of mass gathering events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]even as appreciation washes through, reproductive care workers are increasingly stepping out to say that garlands are not enough.1 This emergent public reckoning comes on the heels of an extended scholarly rethinking of capitalism, as a growing group of scholars argue that capitalism is always already embedded in gendered and racialized relations of extraction and expropriation.2 Especially generative has been Karl Marx's remarkable historical account of capitalism's origins in a process he dubbed \\"primitive accumulation. \\"3 Intent on forestalling moralistic justifications for the system's origins, Marx argued that elites used a combination of land expropriation and violent vagrancy policing to produce both the starter capital and the \\"free labor\\" needed to bring that capital to life. Since Rosa Luxemburg, scholars have expanded that account to challenge the more and teleological formulations contained in other parts of Marx's larger oeuvre.4 Rather than see primitive accumulation as focused exclusively on domestic processes and ownership relations, subsequent theorists have pointed to the transnational, racialized, colonial, and gendered processes that characterized its emergence, along with the persistence of these putatively time-limited processes throughout capitalism's existence.5 Prompted by the deep inequities of neoliberalism, David Harvey has argued that the present, in fact, is best understood as a new episode of primitive accumulation, which he names \\"accumulation by dispossession. The term social reproduction first emerged in the 1970s and 1980s in the writings of Wages for Housework and Marxist feminist theorists.7 Focused on the work it takes to make and remake people, \\"reproductive labor,\\" these social reproduction theorists located an essential dynamic of capitalist accumulation in the production rather than the exploitation of labor power. Like other elements of primitive accumulation, one of the distinctive features of reproductive labor is that it is not \\"free labor\\" in the sense defined by Marx.9 A fundamental feature of the workings of capitalist labor, he argued, was that \\"the worker leaves the capitalist to whom he hires himself whenever he likes . . . but he cannot leave the whole class of purchasers . . . without renouncing his existence.","output":"Seeing with the Pandemic: Social Reproduction in the Spotlight"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-learning was a major study area during COVID-19 pandemic.

The use of percutaneous bone cement [polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)] injection for pain management and strengthening in pelvic bone metastasis has rarely been reported. To evaluate this method, we aimed to determine surgical outcomes and complications over a long-term follow-up period using a large patient group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 178 patients who underwent percutaneous cementoplasty for pelvic metastatic lesions, 201 in total. Surgical outcomes evaluated included pain reduction and improvement of ambulation. Mortality within 1 month after procedure and pulmonary embolism caused by thrombus, fat, tumor emboli, or bone cement were investigated as surgical complications. For long-term survivors, pain relapse and mechanical failure were analyzed. The mean follow-up period was 12.6 months, and there were 159 fatalities at last follow-up. RESULTS: The mean regional pain numerical rating scale scores decreased from 6.1 preoperatively to 2.4 1 month after procedure (p < 0.01). Gait function was maintained, worsened, and uncheckable in 68%, 24%, and 8% of patients, respectively, 1 month after procedure. Of long-term survivors followed up for > 12 months (n = 53), there were no significant changes in serial plain radiographs, and regional pain aggravation was observed in 9%. Pulmonary cement embolism and bone cement implantation syndrome was observed in 11% and 10%, respectively. However, all patients with these complications were asymptomatic.

METHODS: Retrospective, observational, consecutive case series of patients admitted with ICH to Maimonides Medical Center from March 1 through July 31, 2020, who had confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were analyzed. ICH rates among all strokes were compared to the same time period in 2019 in two-week time intervals. Correlation of systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to clinical outcomes were performed. RESULTS: Of 324 patients who presented with stroke, 65 (20%) were diagnosed with non-traumatic ICH: 8 had confirmed and 3 had highly suspected COVID-19. Nine (82%) had at least one associated risk factor for ICH. Three ICHs occurred during inpatient anticoagulation. More than half (6) suffered either deep or cerebellar hemorrhages; only 2 were lobar hemorrhages. Two of 8 patients with severe pneumonia survived.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, individuals must adopt preventive behaviors. However, to encourage behavior change, we must first understand current knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) that inform response to this health threat. METHODS: We explored KAPs among Venezuelans using a cross-sectional, internet-based questionnaire. The questionnaire explored individuals' knowledge about COVID-19; their attitudes toward the world's and the Venezuelan authorities' abilities to control it; and their self-reported practices. We also collected demographic data. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to predict the adoption of preventive behaviors based on demographic variables, individual knowledge level, and individual attitudes. RESULTS: 3122 individuals completed the questionnaire. Participants had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19. They expressed high levels of optimism that the world would eventually control COVID-19, but they were very pessimistic about the public authorities in Venezuela. Most participants adopted preventive practices. Binomial regression suggests younger people, less educated people, and manual laborers hold lower levels of knowledge, and these groups, as well as men, were less likely to adopt preventive practices. Knowledge, by itself, had no association with optimism and little association with self-reported practices. CONCLUSIONS: As other KAP studies in Latin America found, knowledge is not sufficient to prompt behavior change. Venezuelans' pessimism about their own country's ability should be explored in greater depth.

In this study, we evaluated engagement with daily testing, and assessed levels of adherence to the rules relating to behaviour following positive or negative test results. METHODS: We conducted a service evaluation of the pilot study, examining survey responses from a subset of those who responded to an evaluation questionnaire. We used an online cross-sectional survey offered to adult contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases who consented to daily testing. We used a comparison group of contacts who were not offered testing and instead self-isolated. RESULTS: Acceptability of daily testing was lower among survey respondents who were not offered the option of testing and among people from ethnic minority groups. Overall, 52% of respondents reported being more likely to share details of people that they had been in contact with following a positive test result, if they knew that their contacts would be offered the option of daily testing. Only 2% reported that they would be less likely to provide details of their contacts. On the days that they were trying to self-isolate, 19% of participants reported that they left the house, with no significant group differences. Following a negative test, 13% of respondents reported that they increased their contacts, but most (58%) reported having fewer risky contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that daily testing is potentially acceptable, may facilitate sharing contact details of close contacts among those who test positive for COVID-19, and promote adherence to self-isolation. A better understanding is needed of how to make this option more acceptable for all households. The impact of receiving a negative test on behaviour remains a risk that needs to be monitored and mitigated by appropriate messaging.

Two recycling solutions have been envisaged: the use of the filtering part alone or the joint introduction of the ear loops. Compared to the mixed polyolefin, the resulting recycled materials from filtering face masks have lower viscosity but comparable toughness and superior stiffness and strength. The presence of ear loops in the recycled improves the rigidity but slightly decrease the viscosity and worsen both the strength and toughness. Furthermore, conceiving an outdoor application, the stability to photo oxidation was investigated through an accelerated aging process.

METHODS: PubMed, Medline, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP Database were searched to collect all the literatures on ONFH and related risk factors after internal fixation of FNF from January 1th 2000 to July 1th 2020. Study extraction was performed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Endnote X9 and Excel 2019 were used for literatures extraction, management and data entry, and R Studio 3.6.5 software was used for Meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection were used to explore the sources of heterogeneity and the reliability of the evaluation results. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies with 5521 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that the incidence of ONFH after internal fixation for adult FNF was 14.5% [95% CI(0.126-0.165)]. Fracture displacement[OR=0.27, 95%CI(0.21-0.35)] and reduction quality [OR=0.15, 95%CI(0.09-0.27)] were related risk factors for ONFH. The results of subgroup rate analysis showed that the non-displaced fracture necrosis rate was 6.2%[95%CI(0.051-0.077)] and the displaced fracture necrosis rate was 20.4% [95%CI(0.166-0.249)];the good reduction fracture necrosis rate was 8.3%[95%CI(0.072-0.095)] and the poor reduction fracture necrosis rate was 35.5%[95%CI(0.233-0.500)]. The included literatures have good consistency and no publication bias. CONCLUSION: After 2000, the total incidence of ONFH after internal fixation of adult FNF has decreased, while the necrosis rates of patients with displaced fracture and poor reduction are still at a high level.

METHODS MTT assay and trypan blue staining were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity and antiviral ability of TS in cell culture. Apoptosis was measured to assess the safety of TS on Marc-145 cells. Time-of-addition assay, entry inhibition assay and virucidal assay were used to assess the antiviral action of TS. The effect of TS on host cellular gene expression was analysed by real-time PCR. Absolute quantification RT-PCR and western blot were used to study the inhibitory effect of TS on PRRSV N gene and protein expression. RESULTS Our results showed that 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) and 50% effective concentration (EC50) of TS were 59.86 0.3841 g/ml and 24.29 1.194 g/ml, respectively. The maximum non-cytotoxic concentration of TS on Marc-145 cells was 30 g/ml.

This study reviews our experience exploring the value of a combination of transthoracic echocardiography and contrast echocardiography for the differential diagnosis of proximal pulmonary artery masses. Between January 2018 and June 2021, 44 patients diagnosed with a mass attached to the major pulmonary artery and straddling the bilateral pulmonary arteries or pulmonary valve on transthoracic echocardiography were referred to this study. Contrast echocardiography was performed in 17 patients. Masses were diagnosed based on their site of attachment, shape, size, mobility, hemodynamic consequences on transthoracic echocardiography, and tissue perfusion on contrast echocardiographic perfusion imaging. Pathological data were collected from medical records and analyzed. The most frequent location of proximal pulmonary artery masses was the major pulmonary artery trunk. Twelve patients underwent complete mass resection, whereas nine patients underwent percutaneous pulmonary artery biopsy puncture and had a pathological diagnosis. Another 24 patients were confirmed with the validation methods. Contrast echocardiography has good sensitivity and specificity for differentiating thrombi from pulmonary artery sarcomas (PAS). The mass types were distributed as follows: thrombi (19, 43%), PAS (15, 34%), metastatic tumors (6, 14%), vegetations (3, 7%), and primary benign lesions (1, 2%). The majority of proximal pulmonary artery masses were thrombi or PAS. A combination of transthoracic echocardiography and contrast echocardiography offers advantages in the early identification of proximal pulmonary masses and provides clinically important information about the characteristics of masses, especially for differentiating thrombi from PAS.","output":"Multimodal echocardiography in the diagnosis of masses localized to the proximal portions of pulmonary arteries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership is a population-based longitudinal syndromic and sero-surveillance study. The study includes over 17,000 participants from six healthcare systems in North Carolina who submitted over 49,000 serology results. The purpose of this study is to use these serology data to estimate the cumulative proportion of the North Carolina population that has either been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or developed a measurable humoral response to vaccination. Methods Adult community residents were invited to participate in the study between April 2020 and February 2021. Demographic information was collected and daily symptom screen was completed using a secure, HIPPA-compliant, online portal. A portion of participants were mailed kits containing a lateral flow assay to be used in-home to test for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies. The cumulative proportion of participants who tested positive at least once during the study was calculated. A standard Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to illustrate the probability of seroconversion over time up to December 20, 2020 (before vaccines available). A separate analysis was performed to describe the influence of vaccines during an extended period through February 15, 2021. Results 17,688 participants contributed at least one serology result. Approximately two-thirds of the population were female and almost three-quarters were between 30 and 64 years of age. The average number of serology test results submitted per participant was 3.0 ({+/-}1.9). At December 20, 2020, the overall probability of seropositivity in the CCRP population was 32.6%. At February 15, 2021 the probability among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers was 49% and 83%, respectively. An inflection upward in the probability of seropositivity was demonstrated around the end of December, suggesting an influence of vaccinations, especially for healthcare workers. Among healthcare workers, those in the oldest age category (60+ years) were 38% less likely to have seroconverted by February 15, 2021. Conclusions Results of this study suggest more North Carolina residents may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the number of documented cases as determined by positive RNA or antigen tests. The influence of vaccinations on seropositivity among North Carolina residents is also demonstrated. Additional research is needed to fully characterize the impact of seropositivity on immunity and the ultimate course of the pandemic.","output":"Analysis of Accumulated SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion in North Carolina: The COVID-19 Community Research Partnership"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections today is lower than ever, the supply of safe blood products remains subject to contamination with known and yet to be identified human pathogens.

METHODS We utilised national completions data from universities between 2001 and 2018 and analysed data for students who had completed degrees labelled as public health at the bachelor's and master's by coursework level. RESULTS There have been 21,000 master's by coursework public health graduates since 2001, and 15,770 public health bachelor's degrees. Nearly two-thirds of all students study in a 'broad' degree, such as a Bachelor of Health Science or Master of Public Health. There has been an increase in the proportion of overseas students and a decreasing proportion of Indigenous students over this time. CONCLUSIONS Given the growth of graduates with public health degrees, there should be an increased focus on relevant job opportunities, as supply may be outpacing demand. Implications for public health: We note three potential issues with public health education and practice in Australia. Firstly, there may be an oversupply of graduates relative to opportunities. Secondly, there may be inconsistencies in the delivery of public health courses.

It can be asymptomatic or abortive, mild, moderate, severe and fulminant, i.e. having a septic course with multiple organ failure and shock. Typical leading symptoms of COVID-19 include: high fever poorly responding to drugs, severe loss of strength, chest pain, dyspnoea, headaches, bone and joint pain and muscle pain, and finally the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, other symptoms not related to the lower respiratory tract involvement are also mentioned as possible in numerous publications. These include gastrointestinal disorders, damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, catarrh of the upper respiratory tract, and dysfunctions of the sensory organs. The aim of this literature review was to determine the frequency of various head and neck dysfunctions that are part of COVID-19. Symptoms of conjunctivitis, nasal mucostis, pharyngits and laryngitis are reported by about 3/4 of patients, albeit they do not always occur at the same time, as in infections caused, for example, by rhinoviruses. Anosmia/hyposmia or ageusia/hypogeusia occur with a similar frequency. Symptoms of damage to the equilibrium system, such as dizziness, are reported by approx. 1/3 of patients, vertigo and hearing loss by approx. 5-6%, of patients, tinnitus by approx. 10% of patients. To date, reports of peripheral paresis of the facial nerve coexisting with COVID-19 are relatively scarce and the symptom is often included in the category of neurological symptoms, the frequency of which also corresponds to about 1/3 of COVID-19 cases. Importantly, both catarrhal and other symptoms listed herein may precede, co-occur or follow the onset of the leading symptoms of COVID-19. They can also be the only symptoms of this disease.

The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has received special attention as it is the means by which the virus enters the human host cells. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is one of the targeted regions of the Spike protein for therapeutics and neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. Though its function is not well-understood, the NTD is reported to acquire mutations and deletions that can accelerate the evolutionary adaptation of the virus driving antibody escape. Cellular processes are known to be regulated by complex interactions at the molecular level, which can be characterized by means of a graph representation facilitating the identification of key residues and critical communication pathways within the molecular complex. From extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire Spike for the wild-type and the dominant variant, we derive a weighted graph representation of the protein in two dominant conformations of the receptor-binding-domain; all-down and one-up. We implement graph theory techniques to characterize the relevance of specific residues at facilitating roles of communication and control, while uncovering key implications for fitness and adaptation. We find that many of the reported high-frequency mutations tend to occur away from the critical residues highlighted by our graph theory analysis, implying that these mutations tend to avoid targeting residues that are most critical for protein allosteric communication. We propose that these critical residues could be candidate targets for novel antibody therapeutics. In addition, our analysis provides quantitative insights of the critical role of the NTD and furin cleavage site and their wide-reaching influence over the protein at large.

Despite the various benefits, the use of the DCT apps has raised several issues, particularly in the area of data privacy. Thus, it is important for users to be aware of their privacy while using such apps. This study was conducted to identify the level of user awareness on data privacy and investigate whether the data privacy concern can influence the adoption of the MySejahtera application. A total of 505 responses were obtained from an online survey distributed through social media. The data were then analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) techniques. Empirical results found that the user awareness level on data privacy in using MySejahtera App is moderately high. The respondents are highly aware that their personal data were collected while using the app although they demonstrate less awareness on the privacy risk towards misusing of their personal data. The study also found out that data privacy concern does influence the adoption of MySejahtera App. Even though the awareness level towards their data privacy is considered high, it is believed that this finding is largely influenced by the enforcement made by the Malaysian Government to mitigate the CO VID-19 outbreak.

Results: There was considerable variation in the use of long-acting insulin analogues as a percentage of all insulins prescribed and dispensed across countries and continents. This ranged from limited use of long-acting insulin analogues among African countries compared to routine funding and use across Europe in view of their perceived benefits.

CONCLUSION: Community-family management mode under Internet-based MT monitoring is the valid continuation of clinical nursing for elderly patients with stable CHD, which plays an effective role in terms of daily monitoring indexes, stabilizing condition, improving disease cognition, reducing the readmission rate, and improving the prognostic quality of life of patients.","output":"Primary Exploration of Efficacy of Community-Family Management Mode under Internet-Based Mobile Terminal Monitoring in Elderly Patients with Stable Coronary Heart Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Microbial infection is the main cause of increased morbidity and mortality in burn patients, especially infections caused by multiple drug-resistant organisms (MDRO). The purpose of this study was to explore major microbial trends in burn patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at burn wards and intensive care units, where burn patients were admitted following an event of dust explosion. Data were collected for a number of variables including severity of burns, demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and therapeutic devices. RESULTS: A total of 1132 specimens were collected from 37 hospitalized burn patients with mean TBSA of 46.1%.The most commonly isolated species were Staphylococcus spp. (22.4%). The highest rate of antibiotic resistance was observed in carbapenemCresistant A. baumannii (14.6%), followed by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (11.3%). For each additional 10% TBSA, the isolation of MDRO increased 2.58C17.57 times (p < 0.05); for each additional 10% of the third-degree burn severity, the risk of MDRO significantly decreased by 47% (95% CI, 0.38C0.73, p < 0.001) by Cox model.

This study aimed to examine the within-person changes of anxiety in Argentinean healthcare workers during this pandemic, adjusting for main demographic factors, region, mental disorder history, and COVID-19 contagion. A longitudinal web survey (N = 305) was conducted during two time points of the pandemic, one of which was an infection peak. Anxiety significantly increased across time. However, there were significant interaction effects modulating anxiety levels. The largest anxiety increases occurred in healthcare workers who were wondering if they had contracted COVID-19 while symptomatic. Irrespective of the time point, anxiety was the highest in healthcare workers from a region inside the country who were wondering if they had contracted COVID-19, either asymptomatic or symptomatic. An interaction effect between the mental disorder history and the COVID-19 contagion suggested that the anxiety outcomes were mainly due to the concern about the COVID-19 contagion, rather than due to pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities. An increasing anxiety outcome may be expected among healthcare workers as the pandemic progresses. The uncertainty regarding COVID-19 contagion is a preventable and modifiable interacting factor to produce the worst anxiety outcomes among healthcare workers.","output":"Changes in healthcare workers anxiety during two time points of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The evaluation of children with purpuric rash and fever (PRF) is controversial.

We described all children aged 0C18 years with PRF in southern Israel during the period 2005 C 2016 and compared their microbiologic, laboratory, clinical and outcome characteristics in relation to various etiologies of this syndrome. METHODS: Data were summarized from electronic patient and microbiology files. Viral diagnoses were made by serology and/or PCR. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children with PRF were admitted; 30 (43.48%), 9 (13.04%) and 30 (43.48%) had a syndrome of bacterial, viral or non-established etiology, respectively. N. meningitidis infection was diagnosed in 16/69 (23.19%) patients and in 16/30 (53.33%) patients with bacterial etiology; 14/30 (46.67%) patients suffered from a non-invasive bacterial disease (9 with Rickettsial disease). Adenovirus and Influenza B (3 and 2 cases, respectively) represented the most frequent etiologic agents among patients with viral etiology. More patients with PRF of bacterial etiology were older, of Bedouin ethnicity, looked ill on admission, had higher rates of meningitis and were treated more frequently with antibiotics compared with patients with non-bacterial PRF. Fatality rates among patients with bacterial, viral and non-established etiology were 5/30 (16.7%), 0% and 2/39 (5.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although PFR was uncommon, high rates of meningococcal infections were recorded in children with PRF, which was associated with high fatality rates. Rickettsial infections were frequent, emphasizing the need for a high index of suspicion for this disease in endemic geographic areas.","output":"Purpuric rash and fever among hospitalized children aged 0C18 years: Comparison between clinical, laboratory, therapeutic and outcome features of patients with bacterial versus viral etiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has resulted in the ubiquity of health\\\\related information, disseminated using digital technology.

It is produced in substantial amounts as co-product from poultry processing plants and pig slaughterhouses. Keratin is packed by disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds. Based on the secondary structure, keratin can be classified into -keratin and -keratin. Keratinases (EC 3.4.-.- peptide hydrolases) have major potential to degrade keratin for sustainable recycling of the protein and amino acids. Currently, the known keratinolytic enzymes belong to at least 14 different protease families: S1, S8, S9, S10, S16, M3, M4, M14, M16, M28, M32, M36, M38, M55 (MEROPS database). The various keratinolytic enzymes act via endo-attack (proteases in families S1, S8, S16, M4, M16, M36), exo-attack (proteases in families S9, S10, M14, M28, M38, M55) or by action only on oligopeptides (proteases in families M3, M32), respectively. Other enzymes, particularly disulfide reductases, also play a key role in keratin degradation as they catalyze the breakage of disulfide bonds for better keratinase catalysis. This review aims to contribute an overview of keratin biomass as an enzyme substrate and a systematic analysis of currently sequenced keratinolytic enzymes and their classification and reaction mechanisms. We also summarize and discuss keratinase assays, available keratinase structures and finally examine the available data on uses of keratinases in practical biorefinery protein upcycling applications.","output":"Microbial enzymes catalyzing keratin degradation: Classification, structure, function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines will play a key role in ending the COVID-19 pandemic.

Deploying the stent retriever by actively pushing it into the thrombus increases the radial force with which the stent struts expand into the thrombus. OBJECTIVE To examine the active push deployment (APD) technique in an in vitro model and present our clinical experience with this technique. METHODS In an in vitro experiment we investigated the configuration of a Solitaire and a Trevo ProVue device (both 420 mm), depending on whether the devices were deployed using the APD technique or simple unsheathing. We retrospectively assessed the effectiveness and safety of this technique by analyzing 130 patients with large vessel occlusions (carotid T or M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery), who received endovascular treatment with a Trevo device (420 mm) that was deployed using the APD technique. RESULTS In vitro experiment: the APD technique improved apposition of the devices to the vessel wall. There was widening of 30% (Trevo) and 19% (Solitaire) at the cost of a shortening of 5% and 4%, respectively, when the devices were deployed in a carotid T model. Clinical study: the revascularization rate (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b) with the Trevo device was 90%. There were no retriever-associated dissections or perforations in 278 retrieval maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS The APD technique improves apposition of the tested devices to the vessel wall. The widening effect comes at the cost of minimal shortening of the devices.

We describe the novel use of smartphones, with Microsoft Teams, to live stream inpatient interactions, radiological images, pathology results, charts and patient review between an office based and ward team (virtual ward round) and for teaching medical students in secondary care. After Research and Ethics, Digital services and Information Governance approval we compared a smartphone and head worn device (Realwear HMT 1). Data collection was by participant questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann Whitney test. There was no statistically significant difference in audio and video feed quality between the smart phone (p value = 0.3) and Realwear device (p value = 0.41). However the smartphone was preferred during ward rounds and was 85% cheaper than the Realwear device. Urology medical staff numbers on the ward were reduced by 50%. Ward round efficiency improved as administrative tasks could be performed by the office team during the virtual ward round. Virtual ward rounds using smartphones can facilitate remote communication between staff, students and patients. Staff in isolation or shielding can also assist front line colleagues from home.

METHODS: In a matched cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, the impact of CP treatment on in-hospital mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, and the impact of CP treatment on time to hospital discharge was assessed using a stratified log-rank analysis. RESULTS: 64 patients who received CP a median of 7 days after symptom onset were compared to a matched control group of 177 patients. The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 12.5% and 15.8% in the CP and control groups, respectively (p = 0.52). There was no significant difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 C 2.20).

In spite of the large number of tumor-specific T cells, however, no anti-tumor activity could be measured in a therapeutic setting, in mice vaccinated with rLV. Accumulating evidence shows that, in the presence of malignancies, inhibition of T-cell activity may predominate overstimulation. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed that specific anti-tumor CD8(+) T cells fail to produce cytokines and express high levels of inhibitory receptors such as programmed death (PD)-1. Association of active immunization with chemotherapy or antibodies that block inhibitory pathways often leads to better anti-tumor effects. We show here that combining rLV vaccination with either cyclophosphamide or PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodies enhances rLV vaccination efficacy and improves anti-tumor immunity.","output":"Combination of lentivector immunization and low-dose chemotherapy or PD-1/PD-L1 blocking primes self-reactive T cells and induces anti-tumor immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current work, we discovered and analyzed the epidemiological paradox between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and malaria in the initial phase of the ongoing pandemic.

Multifaceted programmes targeting the continuum of neonatal care, with sustainability and scalability built into the design, can provide practical insights to solve this challenge. Cambodia has amongst the highest neonatal mortality rates in South-East Asia, with rural areas particularly affected. The primary objective of this study is the design, implementation, and assessment of the Saving Babies Lives programme, a package of interventions designed to reduce neonatal mortality in rural Cambodia. METHODS: This study is a five-year stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trial conducted in a rural Cambodian province with an estimated annual delivery rate of 6615. The study is designed to implement and evaluate the Saving Babies Lives programme, which is the intervention. The Saving Babies Lives programme is an iterative package of neonatal interventions spanning the continuum of care and integrating into the existing health system. The Saving Babies Lives programme comprises two major components: participatory learning and action with community health workers, and capacity building of primary care facilities involving facility-based mentorship. Standard government service continues in control arms. Data collection covering the whole study area includes surveillance of all pregnancies, verbal and social autopsies, and quality of care surveys.

Yet, such governments are increasingly facing budgetary strain as sources of tax revenue evaporate. If the financial burden on such governments can be eased, they may better address those aspects of pandemic response to which they are uniquely suited, such as coordinating resources and re\\\\allocating space within their communities. This paper investigates the role of Medicaid, traditionally the default insurer of the unemployed, as a stabilizing force on local government budgets. Using panel data from county governments during the Great Recession (2006C2012), we estimate the effect of state Medicaid generosity on public finances. We find that Medicaid mitigates the effect of unemployment shocks on county government expenditures, specifically safety\\\\net programs and debt. We apply these point estimates to extrapolate predictions based on contemporary state Medicaid generosity and local unemployment rates. In this way, we show that Medicaid continues to mitigate the financial strain on local government during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Applications For Practice: ? Local governments contribute heavily to hospital, health, and welfare services in the United States, and are an important implementor of pandemic policies. ? As the pandemic spreads, local governments incur additional expenditures in a time of depressed revenue. ? Often, the debate around Medicaid financing is framed around federal and state government budgets. However, local governments support the safety\\\\net for indigent residents by assuming a substantial role in the finance and delivery of health care and will likely benefit from this relief. ? Our findings indicate higher Medicaid generosity reduces the downstream economic strain on local governments emanating from labor market shocks. ? State and federal policy may establish grants to aid local governments during the pandemic, such as in the CARES Act of 2020. However, we establish that the Medicaid program is itself a channel by which state and federal governments can support local governments.","output":"Too small to fail: The role of Medicaid in mitigating pandemic\\\\related fiscal strain on local governments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inequality of wealth and its associated power has varied greatly over human history It is often thought that the main levelers of inequality were natural disasters such as epidemics or earthquakes, and social turmoil such as wars and revolutions Here we critically review evidence of the effects of such events on inequality from medieval times till the present We show that in spite of the marked differences in character and direct impact of the shocks we consider, most historical disasters were rather followed by a widening of wealth gaps This can be understood from the wealth distribution and institutional outlay of these societies at the moment of the shock, which to a large extent shaped both the impact and the institutional measures chosen in response to the crisis As most societies were characterized by economic and political skewness, the result mostly was a further widening of disparities Over the centuries, exceptions to this rule have occurred in situations where the ordinary people had strong leverage in shaping the response to the crisis through organizations such as guilds, fraternities, trade unions, cooperatives, and political movements Our results provide empirical support for the view that in nations where such leverage of ordinary people is weak, the responses to novel crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic may boost inequality","output":"Historical effects of shocks on inequality: the great leveler revisited"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smog disasters are becoming more and more frequent and may cause severe consequences on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas.

The interaction between spike protein and ACE2 receptor is a prerequisite for entering virion into the host cell. The present study is focussed on the spike protein of the SARS-COV 2, involving the comparison of binding affinity of new alpha strain modelled spike with previous strain spike (PDB ID:7DDN) using in silico molecular docking, dynamics and simulation studies. The molecular docking studies of the alpha strain modelled spike protein confirmed its higher affinity for the ACE2 receptor than the spike protein of the dominant strain. Similar computational approaches have also been used to investigate the potency of FDA approved drugs from the ZINC Database against the spike protein of new alpha strain modelled and old ones. The drug molecules which showed strong affinity for both the spike proteins are then subjected to ADME analysis.

The sequence of Chinese white pear genome (cv. 'Dangshansuli') along with the seven other species of Rosaceae has already been reported. Although, in these fruit crops, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the LYP family genes and their evolutionary history. RESULTS: In the existing study, eight Rosaceae species i.e., Pyrus communis, Prunus persica, Fragaria vesca, Pyrus bretschneideri, Prunus avium, Prunus mume, Rubus occidentalis, and Malus  domestica were evaluated. Here, we determined a total of 124 LYP genes from the underlined Rosaceae species. While eighteen of the genes were from Chinese white pear, named as PbrLYPs. According to the LYPs structural characteristics and their phylogenetic analysis, those genes were classified into eight groups (group LYK1, LYK2, LYK3, LYK4/5, LYM1/3, LYM2, NFP, and WAKL). Dispersed duplication and whole-genome duplication (WGD) were found to be the most contributing factors of LYP family expansion in the Rosaceae species. More than half of the duplicated PbrLYP gene pairs were dated back to the ancient WGD (~ 140 million years ago (MYA)), and PbrLYP genes have experienced long-term purifying selection. The transcriptomic results indicated that the PbrLYP genes expression was tissue-specific. Most PbrLYP genes showed differential expression in leaves under fungal pathogen infection with two of them located in the plasmalemma. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive analysis identified 124 LYP genes in eight Rosaceae species. Our findings have provided insights into the functions and characteristics of the Rosaceae LYP genes and a guide for the identification of other candidate LYPs for further genetic improvements for pathogen-resistance in higher plants.","output":"Genome-wide identification of lysin motif containing protein family genes in eight rosaceae species, and expression analysis in response to pathogenic fungus Botryosphaeria dothidea in Chinese white pear"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use and undesignated disposal of COVID-19 related personal protective equipments (PPEs) has resulted in a spike in the global mismanagement of plastic waste.

However, in designing CD8(+) T cell vaccines, the role of CD4(+) T cells in the induction and maintenance of memory CD8(+) T cells remains uncertain. In the present study, the necessity or not of CD4(+) T cells in the induction and maintenance of memory CD8(+) T cells was investigated in mice immunized with liposome-coupled CTL epitope peptides. When OVA-derived CTL epitope peptides were chemically coupled to the surfaces of liposomes and inoculated into mice, both primary and secondary CTL responses were successfully induced. The results were further confirmed in CD4(+) T cell-eliminated mice, suggesting that CD4(+) T cells were not required for the generation of memory CD8(+) T cells in the case of immunization with liposome-coupled peptides. Thus, surface-linked liposomal antigens, capable of inducing long-lived memory CD8(+) T cells without the contribution of CD4(+) T cells, might be applicable for the development of vaccines to prevent viral infection, especially for those viruses that evade humoral immunity by varying their surface proteins, such as influenza viruses, HIV, HCV, SARS coronaviruses, and Ebola viruses.","output":"Liposome-Coupled Peptides Induce Long-Lived Memory CD8(+) T Cells Without CD4(+) T Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has severely affected the mental health of elementary and middle school students in China, and has had a negative impact.

The unique clinical phenomena in severe COVID-19 can be perplexing, and they include disproportionately severe hypoxemia relative to lung alveolar-parenchymal pathology and rapid clinical deterioration, with poor response to O2 supplementation, despite preserved lung mechanics. Factors such as microvascular injury, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration in hemoglobin structure and function could play important roles. Overwhelming immune response associated with \\"cytokine storms\\" could activate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may result in consumption of nitric oxide (NO), a critical vasodilation regulator. In other inflammatory infections, activated neutrophils are known to release myeloperoxidase (MPO) in a natural immune response, which contributes to production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). However, during overwhelming inflammation, HOCl competes with O2 at heme binding sites, decreasing O2 saturation. Moreover, HOCl contributes to several oxidative reactions, including hemoglobin-heme iron oxidation, heme destruction, and subsequent release of free iron, which mediates toxic tissue injury through additional generation of ROS and NO consumption. Connecting these reactions in a multi-hit model can explain generalized tissue damage, vasoconstriction, severe hypoxia, and precipitous clinical deterioration in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

In this study, we investigated GPP and associated environmental factors of 23 lake systems in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) along an altitudinal range (from 2500 m to 4500 m). Results showed an increase in chlorophyll a (Chl a) content as altitude increased and a corresponding decrease as salinity increased. Furthermore, geographical patterns of GPP were higher at the mid-gradient and lower at the extreme gradient. Higher solar radiation and water temperatures, stronger evaporation and higher salinity levels, and lower pH and higher nutrient content were all driving mechanisms of GPP in low altitudinal lake systems within high latitudinal regions. Such conditions have collectively resulted in the current GPP pattern via the promotion or inhibition of phytoplankton growth and photosynthesis. Specifically, geographical features and climate change jointly drive algal growth and GPP of alpine lake systems via internal circulation processes; however, anthropogenic activities interfere with external circulation processes for most of lower-middle altitudinal lake systems, thus playing a certain role in regulating environmental factors and GPP alongside climate change.","output":"Driving mechanisms of gross primary productivity geographical patterns for Qinghai-Tibet Plateau lake systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Screening for chromosomal disorders, especially for trisomy 21, has undergone a number of changes in the last 50 years.

BACKGROUND The impact of SPLC on improving cosmesis, body image, pain, and QoL has not been evaluated in double-blinded randomized controlled trials (RCT). This approach therefore remains controversial. METHODS Between October 2011 and February 2014, 110 patients from 2 centers were randomly assigned to SPLC (n = 55) or 4PLC (n = 55). Primary endpoints were a validated cosmesis (3-24 points) and body image (5-20 points) score after 3 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included operative duration, postoperative pain, complications, QoL, and length of hospital stay. Patients, physicians, and nurses were blinded until the seventh postoperative day. RESULTS Demographics were equally distributed between both groups (mean age: 46 years, SD: 14, 62 females, 34 males). The SPLC-group showed superior mean cosmesis and body image compared with the 4PLC-group at 12-weeks (21 vs 16, P < 0.001 and 5 vs 6, P = 0.013, respectively) and at 1-year (24 vs 16, P < 0.001 and 5 vs 6, P < 0.017, respectively).

This study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. A quality improvement (QI) team was formed, and after obtaining the baseline data, problems were analysed using fish bone chart. A new policy of allowing birth companion was made and efforts made to sensitise and train the doctors and nurses posted in labour ward.

Simple interventions such as dress code for birth companions, curtains for ensuring privacy, display of posters and frequent reminders on WhatsApp groups were planned. RESULTS: The median value of women accompanied by birth companion marginally increased to 25% after the first PDSA cycle. Implementation of further changed ideas led to increase in median, which reached 66.6%. Thereafter, there was a decline, but by the end of 6 months, it was possible to attain the goal and sustain it.

Methods: Within an adult subset of the Virus Watch community cohort study, we sought to identify which non-household activities increased risk of acquisition of COVID19 infection and which accounted for the greatest proportion of nonhousehold acquired COVID19 infections during the second wave of the pandemic. Among participants who were undertaking antibody tests and self reporting PCR and lateral flow tests taken through the national testing programme, we identified those who were thought to be infected outside the household during the second wave of the pandemic. We used exposure data on attending work, using public or shared transport, using shops and other nonhousehold activities taken from monthly surveys during the second wave of the pandemic. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess the relative independent contribution of these exposures on risk of acquiring infection outside the household. We calculated Adjusted Population Attributable Fractions (APAF: the proportion of non-household transmission in the cohort thought to be attributable to each exposure) based on odds ratios and frequency of exposure in cases. Results: Based on analysis of 10475 adult participants including 874 infections acquired outside the household, infection was independently associated with: leaving home for work (AOR 1.20 (1.02 to 1.42) p=0.0307, APAF 6.9%); public transport use (AOR for use more than once per week 1.82 (1.49 to 2.23) p<0.0001, APAF for public transport 12.42%); and shopping (AOR for shopping more than once per week 1.69 (1.29 to 2.21) P=0.0003, APAF for shopping 34.56%). Other nonhousehold activities such as use of hospitality and leisure venues were rare due to restrictions and there were no significant associations with infection risk. Conclusions: A high proportion of the second wave of the pandemic was spent under conditions where people were being advised to work from home where possible, and to minimize exposure to shops, and a wide range of other businesses were subject to severe restrictions. Vaccines were being rolled out to high-risk groups. During this time, going to work was an important risk factor for infection but public transport use likely accounted for a lot of this risk.

We estimate the size of the COVID-19-related unemployment shock to be between 2 and 5 times larger than the typical unemployment shock, depending on race and gender, resulting in a significant increase in mortality rates and drop in life expectancy. We also predict that the shock will disproportionately affect African-Americans and women, over a short horizon, while the effects for white men will unfold over longer horizons.

This paper aims to describe different aspects of critical care in the FTA. For this, we reviewed official information about population size and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity in the FTA and literature on FTA ICU specificities. Persons living in or visiting the FTA are exposed to specific risks, mainly severe road traffic injuries, envenoming, stab or ballistic wounds, and emergent tropical infectious diseases. These diseases may require specific knowledge and critical care management. However, there are not enough ICU beds in the FTA. Indeed, there are 7.2 ICU beds/100 000 population in Guadeloupe, 7.2 in Martinique, and 4.5 in French Guiana. In addition, seriously ill patients in remote areas regularly have to be transferred, most often by helicopter, resulting in a delay in admission to intensive care. The COVID-19 crisis has shown that the health care system in the FTA is unready to face such an epidemic and that intensive care bed capacity must be increased. In conclusion, the critical care sector in the FTA requires upgrading of infrastructure, human resources, and equipment as well as enhancement of multidisciplinary care.

In late March 2020, the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt arrived at port in Guam after numerous U.S. service members onboard developed COVID-19. In April, the U.S. Navy and CDC investigated this outbreak, and the demographic, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings among a convenience sample of 382 service members serving aboard the aircraft carrier are reported in this study. The outbreak was characterized by widespread transmission with relatively mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection among this sample of mostly young, healthy adults with close, congregate exposures. Service members who reported taking preventive measures had a lower infection rate than did those who did not report taking these measures (e.g., wearing a face covering, 55.8% versus 80.8%; avoiding common areas, 53.8% versus 67.5%; and observing social distancing, 54.7% versus 70.0%, respectively). The presence of neutralizing antibodies, which represent antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2, among the majority (59.2%) of those with antibody responses is a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity. This report improves the understanding of COVID-19 in the U.S. military and among young adults in congregate settings and reinforces the importance of preventive measures to lower risk for infection in similar environments.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Serologic Responses from a Sample of U.S. Navy Service Members - USS Theodore Roosevelt, April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This analysis described the clinical features of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic in Ghana. Methods: Data were extracted from two national COVID-19 treatment centers in Ghana for over 11 weeks(from March to May 2020). Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed. Modified Ordered Logistic and Negative Binomial Regression analysis were applied to establish factors associated with illness severity and Non-communicable Disease (NCDs) counts respectively. All analysis was conducted at the 95% confidence level (p-value &#8804; 0.05) using Stata 16. Results: Among the 275 patients, the average age was 40.716.4, with a preponderance of males (54.5%). The three commonest symptoms presented were cough (21.3%), headache (15.7%), and sore throat (11.7%). Only 7.6% of the patients had a history of fever. Most patients were asymptomatic (51.65). Approximately 38.9% have an underlying co-morbid NCDs, with Hypertension (32.1%), Diabetes (9.9%), and Asthma (5.2%) being the three commonest. The odds of Moderate/severe (MoS) was significantly higher for those with unknown exposures to similar illness [aOR(95%CI) = 4.27(1.12-10.2)] compared with non-exposure to similar illness. An increased unit of NCD's count significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 MoS illness by 26%[cOR(95%CI) =1.26(1.09-1.84)] and 67% (adjusting for age) [aOR(95%CI)=1.67(1.13-2.49)]. Conclusion: The presence of cardiovascular co-morbidities dictated the frequency of reported symptoms and severity of COVID-19 infection in this sample of Ghanaians.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients included in RELACOEM, a LATAM registry of MS and NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19. METHODS: RELACOEM is a longitudinal, strictly observational registry of MS and NMOSD patients who suffer COVID-19 and Dengue in LATAM. Inclusion criteria to the registry were either: (1) a biologically confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis based on a positive result of a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal swab; or (2) COVID-19Ctypical symptoms (triad of cough, fever, and asthenia) in an epidemic zone of COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were performed on demographic and clinical variables. The cohort was later stratified for MS and NMOSD and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with hospitalizations/intensive critical units (ICU) admission. RESULTS: 145 patients were included in the registry from 15 countries and 51 treating physicians. A total of 129 (89%) were MS patients and 16 (11%) NMOSD. 81.4% patients had confirmed COVID-19 and 18.6% were suspected cases. 23 (15.8%) patients were hospitalized, 9 (6.2%) required ICU and 5 (3.4 %) died due to COVID-19.

This study addressed these gaps by examining (a) self-oriented anxiety and two forms of others-oriented anxiety (i.e., anxiety concerning others health and societal problems), (b) the associations between all these forms of anxiety and physical distancing practice during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (c) the hypothesized moderating role of community risk factors. The participants were 703 U.S. community-dwelling adults who completed an online survey. Geo-identifier data were extracted to identify the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and four social vulnerability indexes for the county in which each participant resided. Both forms of others-oriented anxiety were positively associated with physical distancing adoption, and the association was stronger among the participants residing in lower-risk communities (i.e., fewer confirmed COVID-19 cases, higher socioeconomic status, and better housing conditions). The studys novel findings reveal the protective role of anxiety, particularly anxiety concerning others well-being, in encouraging people to adopt physical distancing during a pandemic. However, the protective role of anxiety is contingent upon certain community risk factors.

We conducted qualitative interviews with SisterWeb doulas in 2020 and 2021 and organizational leaders in 2020. Overall, leaders and doulas reported that the contractor approach, in which doulas were paid a flat fee per client, did not adequately compensate doulas, who regularly attend trainings and provide additional support for their clients (e.g., referrals to promote housing and food security). Additionally, this approach did not provide doulas with healthcare benefits, which was especially concerning during the COVID-19 pandemic. As hourly, benefited employees, doulas experienced a greater sense of financial security and wellbeing from receiving consistent pay, compensation for all time worked, and benefits such as health insurance and sick leave, allowing some to dedicate themselves to birth work. Our study suggests that efforts to promote community doula care must integrate structural solutions to provide appropriate compensation and benefits to doulas, simultaneously advancing birth equity and equitable labor conditions for community doulas.","output":"My 9 to 5 Job Is Birth Work: A Case Study of Two Compensation Approaches for Community Doula Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility, especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses. Due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS-CoV-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions, which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Based on a VSV pseudovirus production system, a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities. The key parameters for this assay were optimized, including cell types, cell numbers, virus inoculum. When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics. The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples. The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, respectively.

The objective of this study is to describe characteristics and outcomes of maternal-newborn dyads with confirmed maternal SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, descriptive cohort study with data collection from charts of maternal-newborn dyads who delivered at 4 major New York City metropolitan area hospitals between March 1 and May 10, 2020, with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: There were a total of 149 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 149 newborns analyzed (3 sets of twins; 3 stillbirths). Forty percent of these mothers were asymptomatic. Approximately 15% of symptomatic mothers required some form of respiratory support, and 8% required intubation. Eighteen newborns (12%) were admitted to the ICU. Fifteen (10%) were born preterm, and 5 (3%) required mechanical ventilation. Symptomatic mothers had more premature deliveries (16% vs 3%, P = .02), and their newborns were more likely to require intensive care (19% vs 2%, P = .001) than asymptomatic mothers. One newborn tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which was considered a case of horizontal postnatal transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no distinct evidence of vertical transmission from mothers with SARS-CoV-2 to their newborns, we did observe perinatal morbidities among both mothers and newborns.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study recruited physicians working at frontline positions in university teaching and isolation hospitals in the Mid Delta Region of Egypt from April to May 2020. Data was collected through an electronic online survey. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed using General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 respectively. RESULTS: The study included 237 physicians, their mean age was 38.2  6.2 years and 58% of them were males. Overall, 78.9% and 43.8% of all participated physicians reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. 85% of respondents had children with a significant increase in the risk of anxiety (OR = 20.2). This study revealed that poor sleep quality, being a resident physician, disrupted social life, and stigma exposure due to COVID-19, were significant mediating factors for the observed anxiety (OR = 0.53,3.28,0.18,1.56 respectively) and depressive symptoms (OR = 0.51,1.39,0.56,1.9 respectively). However, working in isolation hospitals wasn't a significant contributing factor. CONCLUSION: The frontline physicians experienced a high rate of mental symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to -coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.

Worldwide demand for personal protective equipment has risen, with diminishing supplies and shortages reported. During the pandemic, charitable donations have been made by the public, aimed at helping medical staff. Based on the open data, we investigate the charitable in-kind donations received by a large medical center in northern Taiwan (Taipei Veterans General Hospital [TPEVGH]) in Taiwan during the pandemic. METHODS: The period of investigation was the first half of the year 2020. TPEVGH has received various public donations. The list of donations published on the hospital's official website was analyzed. The variables in the analysis were donation category, donation percentage, number of donations, and total donation amount. RESULTS: Most in-kind donations were food and beverages (55.1%), with a monetary value of 3 124 510 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) (24.3%). Medical equipment accounted for the second-highest number of items (34.8%) but was the highest monetary value (70.6%; 9 275 945 of 12 875 855 NTD). Daily necessities accounted for the lowest number of items (10.1%) and had a total monetary value of 475 400 NTD (3.7%). Over two-thirds were beverages (68.4%), all of which were bottles or cans for easy storage. Despite only five items (13.2%) being juice, the donation size was the largest, accounting for nearly half (47.1%) of the total monetary value. Only one item was fruit, which was high-class organic apples. The monetary value of this item was the highest (7.8%) among all donated food. Most donated snacks were biscuits. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most public donations to TPEVGH were food and daily necessities. While every donation should be appreciated, accepting high volumes of donations might incur donation management problems. Further research could be focused on managerial aspects, for example, quality and safety checking, storage, and distribution.","output":"In-kind donations to healthcare facilities during COVID-19: Experiences from a large medical center in northern Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is outbreak from China and infected more than 4,666,000 people and caused thousands of deaths.

METHODS An infection-control protocol was designed for dental healthcare in the Territorial Health and Social Services Authority (ASST) \\"Melegnano and Martesana\\" (Milan). Since specific guidance from central authorities was lacking, information was gathered from international public health organizations. The probability to visit asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was estimated and the occupational risk to dental staff calculated.

More than 40,000 CAM cases have been reported in India. The emergence of CAM cases in India has been attributed to environmental, host, and iatrogenic factors. Mucorales spore burden has been reported globally; however, their presence is higher in tropical countries such as India, contributing to the emergence of CAM. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with diabetes mellitus, haematological malignancies, solid organ transplants, corticosteroid therapy and neutropenia were more prone to mucormycosis, whereas in COVID-19 patients, virus-induced endothelial dysfunction, hyperglycaemia, and immune dysfunction following corticosteroid use increase the risk of acquiring mucormycosis. The interaction of Mucorales spores with the epithelial cells, followed by endothelial invasion, is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis. Endothelial damage and increased endothelial receptor expression induced by COVID-19 infection may predispose patients to CAM. COVID-19 infection may directly induce hyperglycaemia by damaging beta cells of the pancreas or by corticosteroid therapy, which may contribute to CAM pathogenesis. Iron acquisition from the host, especially in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or deferoxamine therapy, is an important virulence trait of Mucorales. Similarly, the hyperferritinaemia caused by COVID-19 may act as a source of iron for Mucorales growth and invasion. In addition, corticosteroid treatment reduces or abolishes the innate immune functions of phagocytic cells contributing to the pathogenesis of CAM. This review aims to discuss primarily the host and iatrogenic factors shared between COVID-19 and mucormycosis that could explain the emergence of CAM.","output":"Connecting the Dots: Interplay of Pathogenic Mechanisms between COVID-19 Disease and Mucormycosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important and frequently carried respiratory pathogen that has the potential to cause serious invasive diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 epidemic on mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients in our hospital. METHODS: We collected information on subjects treated with MT in 2019C2020, including age, sex, time from the onset to arterial sheath insertion, time from the onset to recanalization, the rate of lung infection and hemorrhagic transformation, modified Rankin scale (mRS), NHISS, and ASPECTS. RESULTS: The number of patients with MT decreased significantly by 26.6% in 2020 (p = 0.025). The pretreatment ASPECTS score for 2020 was significantly higher than 2019 (p = 0.004). Besides, the patients were more likely to develop lung infection (65 vs. 54.1%, p = 0.042) and had a higher risk of hemorrhagic transformation (47.4% vs. 30.4%, p = 0.005) in 2019. The discharged mRS reflected the worse short-term functional prognosis of patients with MT in 2019 (66 vs. 44.9%, p = 0.046).

Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19.

METHODS Between 2011 and 2015, 14 consecutive patients with 14 diCCF were treated with FD alone or in combination with other implants in a single institution. RESULTS A total of 21 sessions were performed in 14 patients. FD placement was technically successful in all cases without an adverse event. Patients were treated with FD alone (n = 5), FD and covered stents (n = 2), FD and coils (n = 7). A total of 59 FD (24 Pipeline Embolization Device, Medtronic; 35 p64 Flow Modulation Device, phenox), 291 coils, and 3 stent grafts were used. Three of 14 diCCF were completely occluded after the 1st session, a minor residual shunt was found in 7/14, and in the remaining 4/14 patients, the shunt volume was reduced significantly. The mean follow-up period encompassed 20 months. Additional treatment included transvenous coil occlusion (n = 3) and/or further FD deployment (n = 5). An asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion was encountered in 2 patients, related to an interruption of antiaggregation. At the last follow-up, 10/14 patients were free from ocular symptoms (71 %), 2 had residual exophthalmos, and no patient had clinical deterioration. CONCLUSION The usage of FD for the treatment of diCCF is straightforward. Injury of the cranial nerves can be avoided. In most cases, ocular symptoms improve. Several FD layers and/or an adjunctive venous coil occlusion are required. Complete occlusion of a diCCF may take weeks or months and long-term antiaggregation is required. In the future, a flexible stent graft might be a better solution.","output":"Direct carotid cavernous sinus fistulae: vessel reconstruction using flow-diverting implants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the risk of infection during urologic surgeries. Therefore possible hazards in tissue, blood, urine and aerosolized particles generated during surgery, are evaluated. Understanding the risk, recommendations for clinical practice are provided. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of available literature on urological and other surgical procedures in patients with virus infections such as HPV, HIV and hepatitis B and current publications on COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: Several possible pathways for viral transmission appear in the literature. Recent groups detected SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in the urine and faeces, even after negative pharyngeal swabs. In addition, viral RNA can be detected in the blood and several tissues. During surgery, viral particles are released, aerosole\\\\borne and present a certain risk for transmission and infection. However, there is currently no evidence on the exact risk for infection by the substances mentioned above. It remains unclear whether or not viral particles in the urine, blood or faeces are infectious. CONCLUSIONS: Whether SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 can be transmitted by aerosols remains controversial. In any case, standard surgical masks offer inadequate protection from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Full PPE including at least FFP\\\\2 masks and safety goggles should be used. Aerosolized particles might remain for a longer time in the operation theatre and contaminate other surfaces, like floors or computer input devices. Therefore scrupulous hygiene and disinfection of surfaces must be carried out. To prevent aerosolization during laparoscopic interventions, the pneumoperitoneum should be evacuated with suction devices. The use of virus proof HEPA filters is recommended. Local separation of anesthesia/intubation and operation theatre can reduce the danger of viral transmission. Lumbar anaesthesia should be considered especially in endourology. Based on current knowledge, COVID\\\\19 is no contraindication for acute urological surgery.

However, the type, rigor and pace of implementation of public policies have varied considerably between states. Little is known about the subnational (state) variation policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected daily information on public policies designed to inform the public, as well as to promote distancing, and mask use. The policies analyzed were: School Closure, Workplace Closure, Cancellation of Public Events, Restrictions on Gatherings, Stay at Home Order, Public Transit Suspensions, Information Campaigns, Internal Travel Controls, International Travel Controls, Use of Face Masks We use these data to create a composite index to evaluate the adoption of these policies in the 32 states. We then assess the timeliness and rigor of the policies across the country, from the date of the first case, February 27, 2020. RESULTS: The national average in the index during the 143 days of the pandemic was 41.1 out of a possible 100 points on our index.

The varying trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries afford the opportunity to assess the unique influence of 'macro-level' environmental factors and 'micro-level' psychological variables on both fear and perceived health. Here, we investigate predictors of fear and perceived health using machine learning as lockdown restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were introduced in Austria, Spain, Poland and Czech Republic. Over a seven-week period, 533 participants completed weekly self-report surveys which measured the target variables subjective fear of the virus and perceived health, in addition to potential predictive variables related to psychological factors, social factors, perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), and economic circumstances. Viral spread, mortality and governmental responses were further included in the analysis as potential environmental predictors. Results revealed that our models could accurately predict fear of the virus (accounting for approximately 23% of the variance) using predictive factors such as worrying about shortages in food supplies and perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), where interestingly, environmental factors such as spread of the virus and governmental restrictions did not contribute to this prediction. Furthermore, our results revealed that perceived health could be predicted using PVD, physical exercise, attachment anxiety and age as input features, albeit with smaller effect sizes. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of 'micro-level' psychological factors, as opposed to 'macro-level' environmental factors, when predicting fear and perceived health, and offer a starting point for more extensive research on the influences of pathogen threat and governmental restrictions on the psychology of fear and health.","output":"Predicting fear and perceived health during the COVID-19 pandemic using machine learning: A cross-national longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of subnormal stereoacuity in school children and to assess the factors associated with it. METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, a total of 2,376 school children without amblyopia and manifest squint were screened by the titmus fly test, Snellen chart, tests for heterophoria, anterior segment examination, and fundoscopy. Children with a manifest squint, amblyopia (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] <6/18), and history of ocular trauma or surgery, and one-eyed children were excluded. Cycloplegic refraction was done in children with uncorrected or undercorrected refractive errors, and stereoacuity was assessed again with spectacle correction. RESULTS: The prevalence of normal stereoacuity by titmus fly test was 93.18% with correction of refractive errors. Girls had slightly better stereopsis compared with boys. The subnormal stereoacuity was significantly associated with refractive error (P < 0.00001, significant at P < 0.05), unilateral refractive error (P < 0.00001, significant at P < 0.05), bilateral refractive error (P < 0.00001, significant at P < 0.05), anisometropia (P < 0.00001, significant at P < 0.05), ametropia (P < 0.00001, significant at P < 0.05), lower BCVA (P < 0.00001, significant at P < 0.05), hyperopia (P < 0.05, significant at P < 0.05), and heterophoria (P = 0.014, significant at P < 0.05).

The aim of this study is to assess the results of rectovaginal fistula repair and identify predictive factors for poor outcome. METHODS Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent rectovaginal fistula repair from 1988 to 2008 was performed. chi tests and logistical regression analysis were used to study treatment outcomes according to the following fistula characteristics: etiology, size, location, and number of prior attempts at fistula repair. In addition, patient factors such as age, body mass index, smoking history, comorbid condition of diabetes, use of steroid and immunosuppressive medications, number of prior vaginal deliveries, and presence of a diverting stoma were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 184 procedures were performed in 125 patients. Inflammatory bowel disease was the most common indication for surgery (45.6%), followed by obstetric injury (24%) and surgical trauma (16%). The mean duration of fistula presence was 31.2 months. The procedures performed included endorectal advancement flap (35.3%), gracilis muscle interposition (13.6%), seton placement (13.6%), and transperineal (8.7%) and transvaginal repair (8.1%). The overall success rate per procedure was 60%, with no difference in recurrence rates based on the type of repair. Patients with Crohn's disease had more recurrent fistulas (44.2% success per procedure; P < .01), although 78% eventually healed after an average of 1.8 procedures. Patients with obstetric injuries had an 89% success rate after an average of 1.3 procedures per patient, which is similar to the success rate for traumatic fistulas. Pouch vaginal fistulas had a 91% success rate after an average of 1.6 procedures per patient. The overall success rate per patient was 88% after multiple procedures with a mean follow-up of 16.3 months. Age, body mass index, diabetes, use of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, size and location of the fistula, number of vaginal deliveries, time interval between a recurrent episode and subsequent repair, and the presence of fecal diversion did not affect outcomes. The presence of Crohn's disease and a smoking history are strongly associated with rectovaginal fistula recurrence (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Despite a relatively low initial success rate (60%), most rectovaginal fistulas can be successfully repaired with subsequent operations.

METHODS: A chatbot-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And care seeking) was developed using the LINE app to evaluate the current Japanese epidemiological situation. LINE users could participate in the system either though a QR code page in the prefectures' websites or a banner at the top of the LINE app screen. COOPERA asked participants questions regarding personal information, preventive actions, and non-specific symptoms related to COVID-19 and their duration. We calculated daily cross correlation functions between the reported number of infected cases confirmed using polymerase chain reaction and the symptom-positive group captured by COOPERA. RESULTS: We analyzed 206,218 participants from three prefectures reported between March 5 and 30, 2020. The mean age of participants was 44.2 (standard deviation, 13.2) years.

The possibility of developing an effective vaccine for a novel pandemic virus is not assured. However, as we have seen with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, with sufficient resources and global focus, successful outcomes can be achieved in a relatively short period. However even when vaccine is available it will initially be scarce. When one becomes available, how should it be distributed? In this paper we explicate how ethical thinking that is carefully attuned to context is essential to decisions about how we should conduct vaccination in a pandemic where demand exceeds supply. We focus on two key issues. First, setting the aims for a pandemic vaccination programme. Second, thinking about the means of delivering a chosen aim. We outline how pandemic vaccine distribution strategies can be implemented with distinct aims, e.g. protecting groups at greater risk of harm, saving the most lives, or ensuring societal benefit. Each aim will result in a focus on a different priority population and each strategy will have a different benefit-harm profile. Once we have decided our aim, we still have choices to make about delivery. We may achieve at least some ends via direct or indirect strategies. Such policy decisions are not merely technical, but necessarily involve ethics. One important general issue is that such planning decisions about distribution will always be made under conditions of uncertainty about vaccine safety and effectiveness. However, planning how to distribute vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is even harder because we understand relatively little about the virus, transmission, and its immunological impact in the short and long term.","output":"How should we conduct pandemic vaccination?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"South Africa (SA) is a country of contrasts, with abundant resources, hard-won civil rights and a diverse population Woven into the fabric of our society is a large divide between its poorest and its wealthiest members In this article we highlight the vulnerabilities in our society that have been amplified by the COVID-19 crisis Based on recent projections, it is very likely that the healthcare system will be overwhelmed We acknowledge the recognition by government and civil society of these vulnerabilities, and note that difficult decisions will need to be made with regard to resource allocation Our plea, however, is to ensure that human dignity and the principle of distributive justice are maintained, and that when difficult decisions are made, vulnerable people do not suffer disproportionately Furthermore, it is of great concern that there is no national directive guiding resource allocation, prioritisation and triage decisions in both public and private hospitals The Health Professions Council of SA should, as a matter of urgency, issue guidance on priority-setting and triage decisions in the context of COVID-19, based on distributive justice principles","output":"Resource allocation during COVID-19: A focus on vulnerable populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Little is known about the neuronal substrates of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19 and their evolution during the course of the disease.

METHODS: Seven patients with variable clinical presentations of COVID-19-related encephalopathy were explored thrice with brain 18F-FDG-PET/CT, once in the acute phase, 1 month later and 6 months after COVID-19 onset. PET images were analysed with voxel-wise and regions-of-interest approaches in comparison with 32 healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients' neurological manifestations during acute encephalopathy were heterogeneous. However, all of them presented with predominant cognitive and behavioural frontal disorders. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the CSF was negative for all patients. MRI revealed no specific abnormalities for most of the subjects. All patients had a consistent pattern of hypometabolism in a widespread cerebral network including the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula and caudate nucleus.

Here, we investigated the role of RABL6A in pNET progression in vivo using a well-established model of the disease.

The agonist cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) of the stimulator of interferon gene (STING) are a group of very promising anticancer molecules that increase tumor immunogenicity by activating innate immunity. However, the tumor immune efficacy of CDNs is limited by several factors, including relatively narrow cytokine production, inefficient delivery to STING, and rapid clearance. In addition, a single adjuvant molecule is unable to elicit a broad cytokine response and thus cannot further amplify the anticancer effect. To address this problem, two or more agonist molecules are often used together to synergistically enhance immune efficacy. In this work, we found that a combination of the STING agonist CDG(SF) and the Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist 522 produced a broader cytokine response. Subsequently, we developed multicomponent nanovaccines (MCNVs) consisting of a PC7A polymer as a nanocarrier encapsulating the antigen OVA and adjuvant molecules. These MCNVs activate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to produce multiple proinflammatory factors that promote antigen cross-presentation to stimulate specific antitumor T-cell responses. In in vivo experiments, we observed that MCNVs triggered a strong T-cell response in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, resulting in significant tumor regression and, notably, a 100% survival rate in mice through 25 days without other partnering therapies. These data suggest that our nanovaccines have great potential to advance cancer immunotherapy with increased durability and potency.

Duodenojejunal bypass supports the foregut theory; however, its efficacy when used alone is not yet established. Methods During the period from January 2008 to December 2009, patients who underwent laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass (LDJB) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with or without morbid obesity were included. Patients who had a follow-up for less than 3 years were excluded. Patient baseline characteristics, change of body weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and diabetic treatments were analyzed. Results In total, 8 LDJB and 20 LRYGB patients were analyzed. The LDJB group had more number of male patients than the LRYGB group (LDJB 75% vs. LRYGB 30%, P = 0.030). Baseline BMI in the LRYGB group was higher than in the LDJB group (LDJB 27.0  2.5 vs. LRYGB 32.6  3.4, P < 0.001). Age, DM duration, baseline HbA1c, and C-peptide levels were similar. Longer operation time was needed to perform LDJB (LDJB 367.5  120.2 vs. LRYGB 232.9  41.1, P < 0.001), but no differences were observed in the hospital stay and complication rate between the 2 groups. At the third year of follow-up, the T2DM remission rate was observed in 40% of patients in the LRYGB group and 12.5% of patients in the LDJB group. Conclusion LDJB is not an effective method for controlling T2DM compared with LRYGB.

DESIGN: Prospective nationwide cohort study of characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2Cpositive children. Data collection utilized routine Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2Cspecific data. SETTING: All U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children less than 18 years old, admitted to U.K. PICUs between March 14, 2020, and June 13, 2020, and a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction. Children admitted to U.K. PICUs in 2019 with influenza provided comparison. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 76 PICU admissions among 73 children with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Prevalence of PICU admissions per million was 5.2 for children versus 260 for adults. Ten children (14%) were identified on routine screening. Seventeen children (23%) had pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Seventeen (23%) had coinfections. Invasive ventilation was required in seven of 17 children (41%) with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 versus 38 of 56 other severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 positive children (68%), with 77% requiring vasoactive support versus 43%, respectively. Seven children (10%) died. In comparison with influenza children, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 children were older (median [interquartile range]: 10 [1C13] vs 3 yr [1C8 yr]), more often Black or Asian (52% v 18%), higher weight z score (0.29 [C0.80 to 1.62] vs C0.41 [C1.37 to 0.63]), and higher deprivation index (3.3 [C1 to 6.3] vs 1.2 [C1.8 to 4.4]).

We collected structured data on personal and professional characteristics and qualitative data on home and work concerns. We analyzed qualitative data thematically and used bivariate analyses to evaluate variation in themes by frontline status and children's ages. Results: We included 1,806 participants in analysis and identified 10 key themes. The most frequently identified need/solution was for Community and Government Support (n = 545, 47.1%). When comparing frontline and nonfrontline physicians, those on the frontline more frequently raised concerns about Personal Health and Safety (67.8% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.001), Organizational Communication and Relationships (31.8% vs. 23.8%, p < 0.001), and Family Health and Safety (27.2 vs. 16.6, p < 0.001), while nonfrontline physicians more frequently addressed Patient Care and Safety (56.4% vs. 48.2%, p < 0.001) and Financial/Job Security (33.8% vs. 46.9%, p < 0.001).

Its impact on oncologic therapies and elective surgery has been described recently, and the literature provides guidelines regarding appropriate elective patient treatment during the pandemic. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on emergency surgery services has been poorly investigated up to now. METHODS: A 17-item web survey had been distributed to emergency surgeons in June 2020 around the world, investigating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on patients and septic diseases both requiring emergency surgery and the time-to-intervention in emergency surgery routine, as well as experiences with surgery in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Ninety-eight collaborators from 31 countries responded to the survey. The majority (65.3%) estimated the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on emergency surgical patient care as being strong or very strong. Due to the pandemic, 87.8% reported a decrease in the total number of patients undergoing emergency surgery and approximately 25% estimated a delay of more than 2 h in the time-to-diagnosis and another 2 h in the time-to-intervention. Fifty percent make structural problems with in-hospital logistics (e.g. transport of patients, closed normal wards etc.) mainly responsible for delayed emergency surgery and the frequent need (56.1%) for a triage of emergency surgical patients. 56.1% of the collaborators observed more severe septic abdominal diseases during the pandemic, especially for perforated appendicitis and severe septic cholecystitis (41.8% and 40.2%, respectively). 62.2% had experiences with surgery in COVID-19-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of The WSES COVID-19 emergency surgery survey are alarming. The combination of an estimated decrease in numbers of emergency surgical patients and an observed increase in more severe septic diseases may be a result of the fear of patients from infection with COVID-19 and a consecutive delayed hospital admission and diagnosis. A critical delay in time-to-diagnosis and time-to-intervention may be a result of changes in in-hospital logistics and operating room as well as intensive care capacities.

We sought to determine whether Internet search patterns can be useful for tracking COVID-19 spread, and whether these data could also be useful in understanding the clinical progression of the disease in 32 countries across six continents. Temporal correlation analyses were conducted to characterize the relationships between a range of COVID-19 symptom-specific search terms and reported COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country from January 1 through April 20, 2020. Increases in COVID-19 symptom-related searches preceded increases in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths by an average of 18.53 days (95% CI 15.98C21.08) and 22.16 days (20.33C23.99), respectively. Cross-country ensemble averaging was used to derive average temporal profiles for each search term, which were combined to create a search-data-based view of the clinical course of disease progression. Internet search patterns revealed a clear temporal pattern of disease progression for COVID-19: Initial symptoms of fever, dry cough, sore throat and chills were followed by shortness of breath an average of 5.22 days (3.30C7.14) after initial symptom onset, matching the clinical course reported in the medical literature. This study shows that Internet search data can be useful for characterizing the detailed clinical course of a disease. These data are available in real-time at population scale, providing important benefits as a complementary resource for tracking pandemics, especially before widespread laboratory testing is available.","output":"Internet search patterns reveal clinical course of COVID-19 disease progression and pandemic spread across 32 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A graph $X$ is defined inductively to be $(a_0,\\\\dots,a_{n-1})$-regular if $X$ is $a_0$-regular and for every vertex $v$ of $X$, the sphere of radius $1$ around $v$ is an $(a_1,\\\\dots,a_{n-1})$-regular graph.

Chapman, Linial and Peled studied HR-graphs of level 2 and provided several methods to construct families of graphs which are expanders\\"globally and locally\\". They ask whether such HR-graphs of level 3 exist. In this paper we show how the theory of Coxeter groups, and abstract regular polytopes and their generalisations, can lead to such graphs. Given a Coxeter system $(W,S)$ and a subset $M$ of $S$, we construct highly regular quotients of the 1-skeleton of the associated Wythoffian polytope $\\\\mathcal{P}_{W,M}$, which form an infinite family of expander graphs when $(W,S)$ is indefinite and $\\\\mathcal{P}_{W,M}$ has finite vertex links. The regularity of the graphs in this family can be deduced from the Coxeter diagram of $(W,S)$. The expansion stems from applying superapproximation to the congruence subgroups of the linear group $W$. This machinery gives a rich collection of families of HR-graphs, with various interesting properties, and in particular answers affirmatively the question asked by Chapman, Linial and Peled.","output":"Constructing highly regular expanders from hyperbolic Coxeter groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge graphs incompleteness has motivated many researchers to propose methods to automatically infer missing facts in knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embedding has been an active research area for knowledge graph completion, with great improvement from the early TransE to the current state-of-the-art ConvKB. ConvKB considers a knowledge graph as a set of triples, and employs a convolutional neural network to capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in the knowledge graph. However, it only utilizes the triple information, and ignores the rich information contained in relation paths. In fact, a path of one relation describes the relation from some aspect in a fine-grained way. Therefore, it is beneficial to take relation paths into consideration for knowledge graph embedding. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network-based embedding model PConvKB, which improves knowledge graph embedding by incorporating relation paths locally and globally. Specifically, we introduce attention mechanism to measure the local importance of relation paths. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective measure DIPF to compute the global importance of relation paths.

Design/methodology - First of all, this paper explored the prior research, the current status of sales support for SMEs, and the changes in the distribution industry due to COVID-19 pandemic. Based on Moon (2016)'s ABCD strategic model - Agility, Benchmarking, Convergence, and Dedication, the study then derived directions in which official distribution channels should move and the new distribution strategy for Korean SMEs to secure competitive advantage. Findings - First, in terms of 'Agility', in order to upgrade official distribution channels, which are currently at some competitive disadvantages compared to private distribution companies, we must quickly introduce technologies for the 4th industrial revolution, such as AI, Big Data, etc., and establish precise strategies to strengthen the capabilities of SMEs. Second, in terms of \`Benchmarking', the use of \\"Chamelezones\\" has been increasing to enhance the competitiveness of offline stores in line with recent ontact trends. Therefore, official distribution channels should also benchmark such cases, strengthening their competitiveness by utilizing offline spaces more efficiently and effectively. Third, in terms of 'Convergence', in line with the rapidly changing trend of the times, official distribution channels should also promote active partnerships with media commerce, e-commerce and ICT platforms, as well as cooperation with private retailers, and focus on creating synergy effects through them. Finally, from the perspective of 'Dedication', digitalization should be promoted step by step, finding the sector that can accelerate digital among the value chains of official distribution channels, and continuing to discuss how to digitize it realistically.

Previous studies summarized the literature on microbial AA patterns, most recently in 2017 (Sok et al. Journal of Dairy Science, 100, 5241-5249). The present study intended to identify the microbial AA pattern typical when feeding Central European diets and a maximum proportion of concentrate (PCO; dry matter (DM) basis) of 0.60. Data sets were created from the literature for liquid (LAB)- and particle (PAB)-associated bacteria, total bacteria and protozoa, including 16, 9, 27 and 8 studies and 36, 21, 60 and 18 diets respectively. Because the only differences detected between LAB and PAB were slightly higher Phe and lower Thr percentages in PAB (p < 0.05), results for bacteria were pooled. A further data set evaluated AA-N (AAN) as a proportion of total N in microbial fractions and a final data set estimated protozoal contributions to total microbial N (TMN) flow to the duodenum, which were used to calculate weighted TMN AA patterns. Protozoa showed higher Lys, Asp, Glu, Ile and Phe and lower Ala, Arg, Gly, Met, Ser, Thr and Val proportions than bacteria (p < 0.05). The AAN percentage of total N in bacteria and protozoa showed large, unexplained variations, averaging 79.0% and 70.6% (p > 0.05) respectively.

Objectives: To compare the immunopathology of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with that of nonCCOVID-19 ARDS, and to identify biomarkers associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Methods: Prospective observational monocenter study. Immunocompetent patients diagnosed with RT-PCRCconfirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and ARDS admitted between March 8 and March 30, 2020, were included and compared with patients with nonCCOVID-19 ARDS. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was mortality at Day 28. Flow cytometry analyses and serum cytokine measurements were performed at Days 1C2 and 4C6 of ICU admission. Measurements and Main Results: As compared with patients with nonCCOVID-19 ARDS (n = 36), those with COVID-19 (n = 38) were not significantly different regarding age, sex, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores but exhibited a higher Day-28 mortality (34% vs. 11%, P = 0.030). Patients with COVID-19 showed profound and sustained T CD4(+) (P = 0.002), CD8(+) (P < 0.0001), and B (P < 0.0001) lymphopenia, higher HLA-DR expression on monocytes (P < 0.001) and higher serum concentrations of EGF (epithelial growth factor), GM-CSF, IL-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1a, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL5/RANTES, and CCL20/MIP-3a.

Patients were divided into progression and recovery groups according to their outcomes. We evaluated CT images in terms of distribution of lesions and imaging manifestations. The manifestations included ground-glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, irregular line, and air bronchogram sign. RESULTS COVID-19 lesions showed mainly subpleural distribution, which was accompanied by bronchovascular bundle distribution in nearly 30% of the patients. The lower lobes of both lungs were the most commonly involved. In the follow-up, the progression group showed more involvement of the upper lobe of the left lung than the recovery group. GGO was the most common sign. As the disease progressed, round GGO decreased and patchy GGO increased. On follow-up CT, consolidation increased in the progression group while decreasing in the recovery group. Air bronchogram sign was more commonly observed at the initial examination (90.9%) than at follow-up (30%) in the recovery group, but there was no significant change in the progression group.

However, given significant safety constraints including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, sample collection becomes more difficult given traditional phlebotomy protocols. For such studies, a representative sample of the underlying population is paramount to elicit meaningful insights that capture the spread of the infection, particularly when different sub-populations face varying disease burden. We aimed to address these challenges by conducting a fully remote study to investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Massachusetts. Leveraging electronic study engagement and at-home self-collection of finger-prick samples, we enrolled 2,066 participants representative of the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts. SARS-CoV-2 total IgG seropositivity was 3.15%, and follow-up measurements at days 7, 15, 45, and 90 indicate a generally durable antibody response. A higher risk of infection was observed for healthcare workers and their cohabitants and those with comorbidities, as well as lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in the age groups of 18-29 and 50- 59-years-old.

This paper used Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) techniques to explore the clustering spatial patterns of TB treatment completion rates in 53 African countries and also their relationships with mobile phone use. Using an ESDA approach to identify countries with low TB treatment completion rates and reduced mobile phone use is the first step toward addressing issues related to poor TB outcomes. METHODS: TB notifications and treatment data from 2000 through 2015 that were obtained from the World Bank database were used to illustrate a descriptive epidemiology of TB treatment completion rates among African health systems. Spatial clustering patterns of TB treatment completion rates were assessed using differential local Moran's I techniques, and local spatial analytics was performed using local Moran's I tests. Relationships between TB treatment completion rates and mobile phone use were evaluated using ESDA approach. RESULT: Spatial autocorrelation patterns generated were consistent with Low-Low and High-Low cluster patterns, and they were significant at different p-values. Algeria and Senegal had significant clusters across the study periods, while Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, South Africa, and Cameroon had significant clusters in at least two time-periods. ESDA identified statistically significant associations between TB treatment completion rates and mobile phone use. Countries with higher rates of mobile phone use showed higher TB treatment completion rates overall, indicating enhanced program uptake (p < 0.05).

Initial research suggests that older adults are experiencing negative emotions and stress during social distancing and self-quarantining. Consistently, literature shows that pet ownership can mitigate some negative emotions, including stress and loneliness. Our goal was to explore the impact of pets on older adults who were restricting their social interactions during the first three to five weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was based on web-based survey data from 833 persons aged 60 and older in the United States. The sample age of respondents ranged from 60-85, with a majority (80.2%) female and White (95%). About 56% of the sample reported that they owned at least one pet. Respondents with pets did not significantly differ in stress or loneliness measures compared to those without pets. A majority of respondents reported engaging in more distance communication compared to before the pandemic. However, respondents with pets were less likely to report an increase in the following technology-mediated forms of communication: emails, texts, computers, and telephone (all p-values < .05) compared to those without pets. There was no significant difference in other coping mechanisms (e.g. exercise, alcohol intake) by pet ownership. These results suggest that respondents did not rely on pets to reduce stress or loneliness. However, pets may fill other communication/connection needs, and older adults may then rely less on communication with other people.

Results: The prevalence values observed were 44.6% for Low Cognitive Reappraisal and of 47.1% for High Emotional Suppression. The following factors were identified as associated: (a) with Low Cognitive Reappraisal: being aged 30 years old or more, practicing physical activity, worrying about social distancing and having positive emotions and feelings;and (b) with High Emotional Suppression: being heterosexual, non-white race/skin color, having security support or public administration, not sanitizing food, worrying about lack of physical activity and not having negative emotions. Conclusion: the adoption of emotion regulation strategies was associated with individual, contextual and emotional/behavioral characteristics.

Disinfection of used respirators by applying UVC light may enable safe reuse, reducing shortages. Here, UVC light is explored for disinfection of respirators. AIM: To determine whether UVC disinfection is applicable to enable repeated safe reuse of respirators. METHODS: The UVC chamber (BioShift?, Signify, The Netherlands) equipped with LP mercury discharge lamps emitting at 254 nm, was used to determine the sporicidal and virucidal effects. Respirators challenged with spores and viruses were exposed to various UVC energy levels. Deactivation of the biological agents was studied and UVC effects on particle filtration properties and respirator fit. FINDINGS: A 5-log reduction of G. thermophilus spore viability by a UVC dose of 1.1 J/cm(2) was observed. By simulating spores present in the middle of the respirators, a 5-log reduction was achieved at a UVC dose of 10 J/cm(2). SARS-CoV-2 viruses were inactivated by 4 logs upon exposure to 19.5 mJ/cm(2) UVC. In case UVC must be transmitted through all layers of the respirators to reach the spores and virus, a more than 5-log reduction was achieved using a UVC dose of 10 J/cm(2). Exposure to a six times higher UVC dose did not significantly affect the integrity of the fit nor aerosol filtering capacity of the respirator. CONCLUSION: UVC was shown to be a mild and effective way of respirator disinfection allowing for reuse of the UVC treated respirators.","output":"Respirator undersupply issues can safely be mitigated by applying UVC disinfection as demonstrated in challenges with Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores and SARS-CoV-2 virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Constructing accurate patient transfer networks between hospitals is critical for understanding the spread of healthcare associated infections through statistical and mathematical modeling, and for determining optimal screening and treatment strategies. The Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) provide valuable information on patient transfers from publicly obtainable claims databases, yet often give an incomplete picture due to missingness of patient tracking identifiers. We designed a novel imputation algorithm that enabled us to estimate the true number of patient transfers between each pair of hospitals in a state over a specified time period and age group in the presence of these missing identifiers. We then validated the algorithm's performance through a series of simulation experiments using the HCUP SID, and finally tested the algorithm on multiple states' genuine data. Our proposed method significantly reduced the total mean squared error in predicting the true number of transfers amongst hospitals for all simulation experiments, and it also yielded epidemic simulations that more closely approximated those corresponding to the true patient transfer network.","output":"Inferring patient transfer networks between healthcare facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare 30-day mortality in long-term care facility (LTCF) residents with and without COVID-19 and to investigate the impact of 31 potential risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 cases. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All residents of LTCFs registered in Senior Alert, a Swedish national database of health examinations in older adults, during 2019-2020. METHODS: We selected residents with confirmed COVID-19 until September 15, 2020, along with time-dependent propensity scoreCmatched controls without COVID-19. Exposures were COVID-19, age, sex, comorbidities, medications, and other patient characteristics. The outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3731 residents (median age 87 years, 64.5% female) with COVID-19 were matched to 3731 controls without COVID-19. Thirty-day mortality was 39.9% in COVID-19 cases and 5.7% in controls [relative risk 7.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.10-8.14]. In COVID-19 cases, the odds ratio (OR) for 30-day mortality was 2.43 (95% CI 1.56-3.79) in cases aged 80-84 years, 2.98 (95% CI 1.92-4.64) in cases aged 85-89 years, and 3.26 (95% CI 2.09-5.06) in cases aged 90 years, as compared with cases aged <70 years. Other risk factors for mortality among COVID-19 cases included male sex (OR, 2.56, 95% CI 2.19-3.00), neuropsychological conditions (OR, 2.18; 95% CI 1.75-2.70), impaired walking ability (OR, 1.46, 95% CI 1.19-1.80), urinary and bowel incontinence (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.22-1.85), diabetes (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14-1.62), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.69) and previous pneumonia (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.85). Nutritional factors, cardiovascular diseases, and antihypertensive medications were not significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In Swedish LTCFs, COVID-19 was associated with a large excess in mortality after controlling for a large number of risk factors. Beyond older age and male sex, several prevalent clinical risk factors independently contributed to higher mortality.

In terms of confirmed deaths per million inhabitants, as of October 22, Ecuador ranks fourth in the Americas and ninth worldwide according to data from the World Health Organization. In this report we estimate excess deaths due to any cause in Ecuador since the start of the lockdown measures on March 17, 2020 until October 22, 2020. METHODS: Estimates of excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the number of observed deaths from all causes and estimates of expected deaths from all causes. Expected deaths were estimated for the period March 17 to October 22, 2020 from forecasts of an ARIMA model of order (3,0,1) with drift which was applied to daily mortality data for the period January 1, 2014 to March 16, 2020. RESULTS: The number of all-cause excess deaths in Ecuador was estimated to be 36,922 (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 32,314C42,696) during the study period. The peak in all-cause excess mortality in Ecuador may have occurred on April 4, 2020, with 909 excess deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the real impact of the pandemic in Ecuador was much worse than indicated by reports from national institutions. Estimates of excess mortality might provide a better approximation of the true COVID-19 death toll. These estimates might capture not only deaths directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic but also deaths from other diseases that resulted from indirect effects of the pandemic.","output":"Measuring the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ecuador using preliminary estimates of excess mortality, March 17COctober 22, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the basic characteristics of clusters of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, and evaluate the generation time (Tg) and basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19.

The objective of this review is to discuss the practical aspects that can reduce complications after endoscopic procedures, and their management.

Topic search was made on PubMed using Neuroendoscopy, complications and neuroendoscopy, complication avoidance and neuroendoscopy, endoscopic neurosurgery, and minimally invasive neurosurgery. Relevant articles were selected after analyzing abstracts and/or topics. Endoscopic procedures are also associated with limitations such as obstruction in instruments manipulation, steep learning curve, blind area, difficulty in visualization, disorientation, loss of stereoscopic image and others. Neuroendoscopy is distinct from microsurgery and the surgeon has to learn endoscopic skills in addition to microsurgical techniques. Difficulties in controlling bleeding, working in a limited area, higher complication rate during the initial learning curve and longer operative time are some of the limitations. Attending live workshops, practicing on models, and hands on cadaveric workshops can reduce the learning curve. Proper case selection, multidisciplinary team approach, watching operative video, visiting other departments, observing a skillful endoscopic surgeon, lab training, and simulators can improve results and shorten the learning curve. Limitations of this review are that the search is limited to the English literature and personal experience of a single surgeon that may create some bias.

Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern innate immune and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for developing effective therapeutic strategies. While IFN-based therapies are generally expected to be beneficial during viral infection, clinical trials in COVID-19 have shown limited efficacy and potential detrimental effects of IFN treatment during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this failure remain unknown. In this study, we found that IFN induced ZBP1-mediated inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in human and murine macrophages and in the lungs of mice infected with -coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). In patients with COVID-19, expression of the innate immune sensor ZBP1 was increased in immune cells from those who succumbed to the disease compared with those who recovered, further suggesting a link between ZBP1 and pathology. In mice, IFN- treatment following -coronavirus infection increased lethality, and genetic deletion of Zbp1 or its Z domain suppressed cell death and protected the mice from IFN-mediated lethality during -coronavirus infection. Overall, our results identify that ZBP1 induced during coronavirus infection limits the efficacy of IFN therapy by driving inflammatory cell death and lethality. Therefore, inhibiting ZBP1 activity may improve the efficacy of IFN therapy, paving the way for the development of new and critically needed therapeutics for COVID-19 as well as other infections and inflammatory conditions where IFN-mediated cell death and pathology occur.","output":"ZBP1-dependent inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, and cytokine storm disrupt IFN therapeutic efficacy during coronavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In this paper, we aim to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among the major populations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: We search and include articles using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and medRxiv databases between Feb 202 and Feb 6th, 2021. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: The meta-analysis targets the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms of major populations including frontline/general healthcare workers (HCWs), the general adult population, and medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. To estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, we pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses. Results: In this meta-analysis, we identify and include 28 studies and 32 independent samples from 12 countries with a total of 15,072 participants in Africa. Ethiopia (7) and Egypt (6) had the largest number of studies. While many countries including, but not limited to, Algeria, Kenya, and Ghana had a high number of COVID-19 cases, as many as three quarters of African countries have no studies. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 27 studies was 37% (95%CI: 31-43%, I2 = 99.0%) and that of depression in 24 studies was 45% (95%CI: 36-51%, I2 = 99.5%) and that of insomnia in 9 studies was 28% (95%CI: 20-41%, I2 = 99.2%). The pooled prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in North Africa (44%, 55%, and 31%, respectively) are higher than the rates in Sub-Saharan Africa (31%, 30%, and 24%, respectively). Our analysis indicated high heterogeneity and varying prevalence rates of mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. Discussion: We discuss our findings that a) a scarcity of studies in several African countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases, b) high heterogeneity among the studies, c) the extent of prevalence of mental health symptoms in Africa to be high, and d) the pattern of mental health symptoms in Africa differs from elsewhere, i.e., more African adults suffer from depression rather than anxiety and insomnia during COVID 19 compared to adult population in other countries or regions.

In the case of diagnostic activities with SARS-CoV-2, this may also affect BSC that are operated at protection level 2; therefore, decontamination of all contaminated surfaces of the BSC may be required. In addition to fumigation with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), dry fogging of H(2)O(2)-stabilized peroxyacetic acid (PAA) represents another alternative to fumigation with formalin. However, to prove their efficacy, these alternatives need to be validated for each model of BSC. Methods: The validation study was performed on 4 different BSCs of Class II A2 using the Mini Dry Fog system. Results: An aerosol concentration of 0.03% PAA and 0.15% H(2)O(2) during a 30 min exposure was sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on bariatric surgery delivery and outcomes. SETTING: The Metabolic and Bariatric Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) collects data from 885 centers in North America. METHODS: The MBSAQIP database was evaluated with two cohorts described: the COVID-19 and the pre-COVID-19, receiving surgery in 2020 and 2015-2019 respectively. Yearly operative trends were characterized and bivariate analysis compared demographics and post-operative outcomes. Multivariable modelling evaluated thirty-day readmission, reintervention, reoperation, and factors associated with undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). RESULTS: We evaluated 834,647 patients, with 155,830 undergoing bariatric surgery during the 2020 pandemic year. A 12.1% reduction in total cases (177,208 in 2019 vs 155,830 in 2020, p<0.001) and 13.8% reduction in cases per center occurred (204.2 cases/center 2019 vs 176.1 cases/center 2020, p<0.001). Patients receiving bariatric surgery during the pandemic were younger with fewer comorbidities. Use of sleeve gastrectomy increased (74.5% vs 72.5%, p < 0.001) and surgery during COVID-19 was associated with reduced RYGB procedural selection (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.82-0.84, p < 0.001).

Data on immunogenicity and safety of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) are limited. METHODS: A multicentre observational study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the two-dose regimen BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in adult patients with AIIRD (n=686) compared with the general population (n=121). Serum IgG antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1/S2 proteins were measured 2-6 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Seropositivity was defined as IgG &#8805;15 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL. Vaccination efficacy, safety, and disease activity were assessed within 6 weeks after the second vaccine dose. RESULTS: Following vaccination, the seropositivity rate and S1/S2 IgG levels were significantly lower among patients with AIIRD versus controls (86% (n=590) vs 100%, p<0.0001 and 132.991.7 vs 218.682.06 BAU/mL, p<0.0001, respectively). Risk factors for reduced immunogenicity included older age and treatment with glucocorticoids, rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and abatacept. Rituximab was the main cause of a seronegative response (39% seropositivity). There were no postvaccination symptomatic cases of COVID-19 among patients with AIIRD and one mild case in the control group. Major adverse events in patients with AIIRD included death (n=2) several weeks after the second vaccine dose, non-disseminated herpes zoster (n=6), uveitis (n=2), and pericarditis (n=1). Postvaccination disease activity remained stable in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: mRNA BNTb262 vaccine was immunogenic in the majority of patients with AIIRD, with an acceptable safety profile.

Due to restraints in physical contacts, providers switched from face-to-face contacts to teletherapy, but prior experiences were mostly limited. The study aimed at assessing symptom dynamics, potentially increased adversities and factors influencing a successful transition into teletherapy in adolescent psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Thirty adolescent psychiatric outpatients participated in an interview-based study. The differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was measured by integrating patients' and psychiatrists' judgements. RESULTS: Patients who reported deteriorated symptoms and patients who showed (partial) improvement of symptomatology could be separated by feelings of isolation (specific to deterioration) and perceived reduction in school-associated stress (unique to improvement). Patients with worsening symptomatology showed a significantly higher degree of psychosocial disability before lockdown and at the first interview. Patients who deteriorated in their level of psychosocial functioning also reported negatively on teletherapy. These patients were verbally less differentiated concerning emotions and affect, reported introspection and rumination, and stated distinctly lower levels of perceived social support. Concerning adversities, no clear trend could be identified, but some patients reported increased domestic violence and neglect. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a higher degree of psychosocial disability suffer disproportionally from the crisis, so that an assessment of functioning should serve as a triage tool. Also, a screening of the perceived level of social support should be established before offering teletherapy. Additionally, the provision of strategies to enhance verbalisation and differentiation of emotions and affect might be beneficial.","output":"'The world somehow stopped moving': impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent psychiatric outpatients and the implementation of teletherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the utilization of Lean & Six Sigma quality initiatives in healthcare sector in India.

Big Five personality traits were measured years ago when the participants had first participated in the study. Results: Most participants felt anxious, engaged in preventive behaviors, and overestimated infection and fatality risks. Older age was associated with low anxiety, a low perception of infection risk, a high perception of fatality risk, and a little engagement in preventive behaviors. Women were more susceptible to the pandemic than men were, demonstrated by higher scores on all four items. Partial correlation analysis controlling for age and sex demonstrated positive associations among all four items except for infection risk perception and preventive behaviors. Anxiety and perceived infection risk were positively predicted by neuroticism and conscientiousness, respectively. Engagement in preventive behaviors was positively predicted by extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness.Discussion and Implications: We highlighted the critical distinction between infection and fatality risk perceptions and demonstrated the need to consider each individuals attributes.","output":"Associations among anxiety, risk perception, preventive behaviors, and personality in Japanese older adults aged 78 to 99 years during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to an increased burden on mental health. This study therefore investigated the development of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and suicidal ideation in the Netherlands during the first fifteen months of the pandemic and three nation-wide lockdowns. Methods: Participants of the Lifelines Cohort Study -a Dutch population-based sample- reported current symptoms of MDD and GAD, including suicidal ideation, according to DSM-IV criteria using a digital structured questionnaire. Between March 2020 and June 2021, 36,106 participants (aged 18-96) filled out a total of 629,811 questionnaires across 23 time points. Trajectories over time were estimated using generalized additive models and analyzed in relation to age, sex, and lifetime history of MDD/GAD to identify groups at risk. Results: We found non-linear trajectories for MDD and GAD with a higher number of symptoms and prevalence rates during periods of lockdown. The point prevalence of MDD and GAD peaked during the third hard lockdown at 2.88% (95% CI: 2.71%-3.06%) and 2.92% (95% CI: 2.76%-3.08%), respectively, in March 2021. Women, younger adults, and participants with a history of MDD/GAD reported significantly more symptoms. For suicidal ideation, we found a linear increase over time in younger participants which continued even after the lockdowns ended. For example, 4.63% (95% CI: 3.09%-6.96%) of 20-year-old participants reported suicidal ideation at our last measured time point in June 2021, which represents a 4.14x increase since the start of the pandemic. Conclusions: Our study showed greater prevalence of MDD and GAD during COVID-19 lockdowns suggesting that the pandemic and government enacted restrictions impacted mental health in the population. We furthermore found a continuing increase in suicidal ideation in young adults.

Based on 1000 tweets that were annotated by all five annotators, inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) was 0.80 for distinguishing\\"age\\"and\\"no age\\"tweets, and 0.95 for identifying the exact age among the\\"age\\"tweets on which the annotators agreed. A deep neural network classifier, based on a RoBERTa-Large pretrained model, achieved the highest F1-score of 0.914 (precision = 0.905, recall = 0.942) for the\\"age\\"class. When the age extraction was evaluated using the classifier's predictions, it achieved an F1-score of 0.855 (precision = 0.805, recall = 0.914) for the\\"age\\"class. When it was evaluated directly on the held-out test set, it achieved an F1-score of 0.931 (precision = 0.873, recall = 0.998) for the\\"age\\"class. We deployed ReportAGE on more than 1.2 billion tweets posted by 245,927 users, and predicted ages for 132,637 (54%) of them. Scaling the detection of exact age to this large number of users can advance the utility of social media data for research applications that do not align with the predefined age groupings of extant binary or multi-class classification approaches.","output":"ReportAGE: Automatically extracting the exact age of Twitter users based on self-reports in tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection presents clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to fatal respiratory failure. Despite the induction of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in convalescent individuals, the role of virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in the control of SARS-CoV-2 replication remains unknown. In the present study, we show that subacute SARS-CoV-2 replication can be controlled in the absence of CD8(+) T cells in cynomolgus macaques. Eight macaques were intranasally inoculated with 10(5) or 10(6) TCID(50) of SARS-CoV-2, and three of the eight macaques were treated with a monoclonal anti-CD8 antibody on days 5 and 7 post-infection. In these three macaques, CD8(+) T cells were undetectable on day 7 and thereafter, while virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were induced in the remaining five untreated animals. Viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs for 10C17 days post-infection in all macaques, and the kinetics of viral RNA levels in pharyngeal swabs and plasma neutralizing antibody titers were comparable between the anti-CD8 antibody treated and untreated animals. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the pharyngeal mucosa and/or retropharyngeal lymph node obtained at necropsy on day 21 in two of the untreated group but undetectable in all macaques treated with anti-CD8 antibody. CD8(+) T-cell responses may contribute to viral control in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but our results indicate possible containment of subacute viral replication in the absence of CD8(+) T cells, implying that CD8(+) T-cell dysfunction may not solely lead to viral control failure.","output":"Subacute SARS-CoV-2 replication can be controlled in the absence of CD8+ T cells in cynomolgus macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic, anti-viral agents have regained center stage in the arena of medicine.

It is noteworthy that all these nanofibrous catalysts exhibit efficient activities, mesoporous structures, and conductive carbon networks, which allow a feasible validation of the catalytic effects. Benefiting from the maximized atomic utilization, the atomic Co-Nx centers exhibit much higher reaction kinetic constant ( = 0.157 min-1 ) and mass activity toward the degradation of bisphenol A, far exceeding the Co nanocrystals ( = 0.082 min-1 ). However, for the volume activities, the single-atom catalyst does not show apparent advantages compared to the nanocrystal-based catalyst.

To evaluate the impact of relaxing social distancing restrictions on COVID-19 dynamics and control in the US, we developed a transmission dynamic model and calibrated it to US state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths from March to June 20(th), 2020, using Bayesian methods. We used this model to evaluate the impact of reopening, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, and case isolation on the COVID-19 epidemic in each state.

COVID-19 protocols have resulted in increased provision of telehealth in integrated primary care (IPC) but little is known about pediatric telehealth IPC utilization during the pandemic for diverse and traditionally underserved groups. METHODS: A comparative study was conducted to explore variability between in-person (pre-COVID-19; n = 106) and telehealth (mid-COVID-19; n = 120) IPC consultation utilization among children 1C19 years old served through a large, inner-city primary care clinic. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine the association between service delivery modality (i.e., in-person vs. telehealth) and attendance, referral concerns, and several sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Service delivery modality and attendance, referral concerns, and race/ethnicity were significantly associated. The odds of non-attendance were greater for children scheduled for telehealth, the odds of children with internalizing problems being scheduled for telehealth were greater than those with externalizing problems, and the odds of Black children being scheduled for telehealth were less compared to White children. CONCLUSION: Though telehealth has helped provide IPC continuity during COVID-19, findings from this study show troubling preliminary data regarding reduced attendance, increased internalizing concerns, and disparities in scheduling for Black patients.

Additionally, resident physicians considered patients under investigation (PUI) were furloughed from clinical practice. The necessity for supplemental learning in a virtual setting prompted the development of an online homeschooling curriculum that incorporated back to the basics textbook learning, application, and retention via virtual sessions for the quarantined and furloughed learners. Methods An online homeschooling curriculum was developed to replace the cancelled clinical experiences for EM residents and for those who were quarantined utilizing Google Classroom and Zoom teleconference software. After completion of their quarantine or return to normal rotation schedule, residents were asked to evaluate the homeschooling curriculum using an anonymous survey. Results A total of 12 residents participated in the homeschooling program over eight weeks during the spring of 2020. Of the nine residents surveyed, 88.8% percent felt the homeschooling added to their knowledge of EM, 100% found the online format easy to use, and 88.8% stated it helped maintain a sense of social connection to peers and faculty. Conclusion An online homeschooling program was considered an effective means of providing an opportunity for synchronous and continuous education for EM resident physicians.

The lockdown in response to COVID-19 may have resulted in lifestyle changes that affected sleep quality. For this reason, the objective of this study is to determine the difference in nursing students' sleep quality before and during the lockdown, put in place in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To meet this objective, we conducted a longitudinal observational study on 207 nursing students, with two cut-off points (February and April). The main dependent variable was sleep quality, measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and its seven components. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used for paired and unpaired data, as well as group-stratified analysis. The mean time students spent in bed was 7.6 h (standard deviation (SD) = 1.1 h) before lockdown and 8.5 h (SD = 1.2 h) during lockdown. The PSQI score got 0.91 points worse during lockdown (95% CI, -0.51, -1.31). Of the five components, five were statistically significantly affected (p &#8804; 0.05), and of these, the most changed were sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. When stratified by group, we observed differences in women, first-year students, second-year students, alcohol consumers, those of normal weight, and those that live with family.

METHODS: Participants were recruited through outpatient haemato-oncology practices. Patients and relatives were primarily made aware of the project by the treating physicians and recruited to participate in qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Nine patients and relatives were interviewed nationwide in individual qualitative interviews. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were other patient enrolment challenges. In many cases, participation was refused. The reasons included: not interested, the use of the terms psycho-oncology or person with a migration background, family denying permission to participate, no face-to-face interview due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as too much emotional distress and deterioration of health after prior consent. DISCUSSION: Enrolling study participants from vulnerable groups for a sensitive topic such as psycho-oncology entails multiple challenges. In order to achieve successful study inclusion, regular telephone and written exchanges with the respective practice staff proved to be helpful, allowing an overview of challenges to be gained and study inclusion to be evaluated and adjusted in a timely manner.

This study assessed the number of COVID-19 cases and potential secondary spread among 7,173 staff members and campers from 50 states, 13 countries, and U.S. military overseas bases at nine independently operated U.S. summer youth camps affiliated with the same organization. The camps implemented multiple prevention strategies including vaccination, testing, podding (cohorting), masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene during June-August 2021. Vaccination coverage was 93% among eligible persons aged 12 years.? All staff members (1,955) and campers (5,218) received site-specific, protocol-defined screening testing, which included prearrival testing and screening tests during the camp session (38,059 tests). Screening testing identified six confirmed COVID-19 cases (one in a staff member and five in campers) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (screening test positivity rate = 0.02%). Three additional cases (in two staff members and one camper) were identified based on symptoms and were confirmed by RT-PCR testing. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, isolation, and quarantine in a population with high vaccination coverage resulted in no known secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 identified during camp. Implementation of multicomponent strategies is critical for prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks in congregate settings, including overnight youth camps.","output":"Multicomponent Strategies to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Transmission  Nine Overnight Youth Summer Camps, United States, JuneCAugust 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the heart of the unparalleled crisis of COVID-19, healthcare workers (HCWs) face several challenges treating patients with COVID-19: reducing the spread of infection; developing suitable short-term strategies; and formulating long-term plans.

We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, and literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets (d < 20microns) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes O(100microns), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the infected individuals could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols (d<20microns) over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modeling. The model accounts for the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, 'exposure time' to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional 'safety distance' thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s) to O(1min) or even to O(1h) depending on the situation.

Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States, using case fatalities from February 29, 2020 up to April 25, 2020, when some states began reversing their interventions. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt, for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt, and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0.

Despite a plethora of information on the internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patients' resistance and compliance. It is not clear whether volume control ventilation or pressure control ventilation is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of resistance-compliance imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), and imputed pH. METHODS: Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control and volume control ventilation modes. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in resistance and compliance (6 pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, EELV, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS: Depending on differences in resistance and compliance, differences in VT ranged from 1% (with equal resistance and compliance) to 79%. Differences in EELV ranged from 2% to 109%, whereas differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive VT (ie, > 8 mL/kg) did not occur, but failure due to excessive EELV difference (ie, > 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between volume control and pressure control ventilation modes. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the 2 patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP.

We analyzed data from 967 participants of the InCHIANTI study, a community-dwelling cohort in the Chianti region, Italy. Relative abundance of ACE2 in plasma was assessed using a proteomics platform. CVD diagnoses, use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists: ACEi, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists, were ascertained. Multiple linear analyses were performed to examine the independent association of ACE2 with age, CVD, and RAAS antagonist use. Age was independently associated with lower log (ACE2) in persons aged &#8805; 55 years (STD ? = - 0.12, p = 0.0002). ACEi treatment was also independently associated with significantly lower ACE2 levels, and ACE2 was inversely associated with weight, and positively associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) status. There was a trend toward higher circulating ACE2 levels in hypertensive individuals, but it did not reach statistical significance. In a stratified analysis, the association between log (ACE2) and log (IL-6) was more evidenced in participants with PAD. Circulating ACE2 levels demonstrate curvilinear association with age, with older individuals beyond the sixth decade age having lower levels. ACEi was associated with greater circulating ACE2 levels. Interestingly, ACE2 was elevated in PAD and positively associated with inflammatory markers, suggesting compensatory upregulation in the setting of chronic inflammation.

However, how self-perceived ageism influences the quality of life in a sample of urban older adults remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to assess the status of self-perceived stigma among urban Chinese older adults, identify its relationship with quality of life, and further explore whether both attitude toward own aging and traditionality moderate this relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary data were collected through cross-sectional surveys among urban older adults in three provinces of China from October 2019 to December 2020. A total of 764 urban older adults were valid participants (effective response rate = 81.28%) and completed questionnaires via anonymous face-to-face interviews. Socio-demographic factors, self-perceived stigma, attitude toward own aging, traditionality, and quality of life were assessed using questionnaires that included the Self-perceived Stigma, Attitude Toward Own Aging, Traditionality, and SF-8 Scales. RESULTS: For urban Chinese older adults, the average score of self-perceived stigma was 2.041  0.726. Self-perceived stigma ( = ?0.391, p < 0.05) and attitude toward own aging ( = ?0.211, p < 0.05) both influenced quality of life. Additionally, attitude toward own aging ( = ?0.530, p < 0.05) and traditionality ( = ?0.525, p < 0.05) moderated the association between self-perceived stigma and quality of life. Simple slope analysis revealed that when the level of negative attitude toward own aging and traditionality was higher, the strength of the influence of self-perceived stigma on quality of life was stronger. CONCLUSION: Urban Chinese older adults were aware of the self-perceived stigma, which contributes to decreased quality of life. Attitude toward own aging and traditionality could moderate the association between self-perceived stigma and quality of life. When negative attitudes toward own aging and traditionality are higher, self-perceived stigma has a greater effect on the quality of life. More interventions related to relieving self-perceived stigma, traditionality, and negative attitude toward own aging should be considered to build a new modern society that emphasizes health, friendliness, well-being, and dignity for all ages.","output":"Association Between Self-Perceived Stigma and Quality of Life Among Urban Chinese Older Adults: The Moderating Role of Attitude Toward Own Aging and Traditionality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED We conducted a prospective study in a long-term care facility.

CT is a widely used medical screening method used to obtain high resolution images of the human body.

Based on this, we hereby propose an intelligent yet efficient CT scan-based COVID-19 classification algorithm that is able to discriminate negative from positive cases by evaluating the appearance of lungs. The algorithm is comprised of four main steps: preprocessing, features extraction, features reduction, and classification. In preprocessing, we employ the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to adjust the contrast of the image to enhance the details of the input image. We then apply the q-transform method to extract features from the CT scan. This method measures the grey level intensity of the pixels which reflects the features of the image. In the feature reduction step, we measure the mean, skewness and standard deviation to reduce overhead and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine are used as classifiers to classify the cases. The experimental results show accuracy rates of 98%, 98%, and 98.25% for each of the classifiers, respectively. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method is efficient, accurate, and flexible.

We explored medical students views of online learning during this pandemic at the Arabian Gulf University in Bahrain. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of students in years two, three and four (n= 559) using an electronic questionnaire. Data were collected from April 10 to May 5, 2021. The survey included three domains: behavioral, affective, and cognitive. We also analyzed the association between students perceptions and certain demographic and institutional factors. RESULTS: The number of respondents was 311 (response rate: 55.6%; 27.7% males, 72.3% females). Participants were generally satisfied with distance learning (54.6%), although they had less motivation (46.3%) and required more effort (32.2%). Most students preferred distance learning for theoretical parts, and face-to-face approach for practical components (73.3%). Participants reported that distance learning, improved interaction with instructors and classmates (45.6% and 48.9%, respectively), small group learning (47.6%), independent learning (75.3%) and problem-solving skills (44.7%). The students were comfortable with online assessment (60.1%), and reported improved achievement in written (42.1%) and practical examinations (46%), but not in professional skills grades (21.6%).

It can influence the quality of life and cause psychological problems that lead to depression and decreased self-esteem. We aimed to investigate the maternal, obstetrical and neonatal risk factors of urinary incontinence 3 to 12 months after childbirth. METHODS The Cochrane Library, Medline, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched for studies published from the inception of the databases up to December 2019, including any observational full-text papers. All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3. Of 338 articles reviewed, 20 studies were considered for meta-analysis. RESULTS The results of our study showed that vaginal delivery in contrast to cesarean section (OR = 3.74, 95% CI: [2.71, 5.15], P < 0.00001), UI in pregnancy (OR = 5.27, 95% CI: [3.40, 8.17], P < 0.00001), episiotomy (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: [1.05, 1.45], P < 0.01), perineal tear > grade 2, instrumental delivery in contrast to cesarean section, epidural or spinal anesthesia, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI and neonatal birthweight have a direct relationship with UI. CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed that urinary incontinence during pregnancy and vaginal births had the strongest relationship with postpartum urinary incontinence. Also, the maternal upright positions during labor did not reduce the likelihood of urinary incontinence. The awareness of this issue helps find effective strategies to reduce the likelihood of female urinary incontinence.","output":"Maternal, obstetrical and neonatal risk factors' impact on female urinary incontinence: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Understanding youth well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic can help appropriately allocate resources and inform policies to support youth. Objective: To examine caregiver-reported changes in the psychological well-being of their children 3 to 4 months after the start of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, and to examine the association of caregiver-reported COVID-19 exposure and family stressors with caregiver perceptions of child psychological well-being. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used an anonymous survey distributed via email from June 24 to July 15, 2020, to 350a?000 families of students attending public schools in Chicago, Illinois. The a priori hypotheses were that caregivers would report worsening in child psychological well-being during the closure period compared with preclosure and that exposure to COVID-19-related stressors would be associated with a higher probability of worsening child psychological well-being. Data were analyzed from September 10, 2020, to March 15, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were 7 mental health concerns and 5 positive adjustment characteristics reported by caregivers using a retrospective pre-post design. COVID-19 exposure and family stressors were also reported by caregivers. Results: Among 350a?000 families invited to participate, 32a?217 caregivers (10a?827 [39.3%] White, 8320 [30.2%] Latinx, 6168 [22.4%] Black; 2223 [8.1%] with multiple or other races/ethnicities) completed the survey on behalf of 49a?397 children in prekindergarten through 12th grade. Child-specific outcomes were reported for 40a?723 to 40a?852 children depending on the specific question. The frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth mental health concerns ranged from 0.1 percentage point (suicidal ideation or self-harm, reported by 191 caregivers [0.5%] preclosure vs 246 caregivers [0.6%] during closure; P < .001) to 28.3 percentage points (loneliness, reported by 1452 caregivers [3.6%] preclosure vs 13a?019 caregivers [31.9%] during closure; P < .001) higher after the end of in-person instruction compared with preclosure. Frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth positive adjustment characteristics ranged from -13.4 percentage points (plans for the future, reported by 18a?114 caregivers [44.3%] preclosure vs 12a?601 caregivers [30.9%] during closure; P < .001) to -30.9 percentage points (positive peer relationships, reported by 24a?666 caregivers [60.4%] preclosure vs 19a?130 caregivers [46.8%] during closure; P < .001) lower after the end of in-person instruction. Significant differences in COVID-19 exposure were observed across racial/ethnic (F3,27a?534 = 614.8; P < .001) and household income strata (F5,27a?506 = 842.0; P < .001). After accounting for covariates, all mental health concerns increased in probability (eg, angry: odds ratio, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.48-1.62]; P < .001) and all the positive adjustment characteristics decreased in probability (eg, hopeful or positive: odds ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.92]; P < .001) as COVID-19 exposure and family stressors increased. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and resulting exposure to stress were associated with worse youth psychological well-being, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive public health approach that prioritizes children's well-being and draws broad public attention to the mental health needs of youth.","output":"Caregiver Perceptions of Children's Psychological Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this work is to design an intelligent computing paradigm through LevenbergCMarquardt artificial neural networks (LMANNs) for solving the mathematical model of Corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) propagation via human to human interaction.

Simulation training leads to skill acquisition but circumstances about skill deterioration are unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate skill acquisition and retention after single-incision laparoscopic simulation training. METHODS From October 2013 to January 2014, 30 surgically naive participants underwent a SILS training curriculum and completed two validated tasks (peg transfer, precision cutting) with subsequent testing to assess acquisition of skills (baseline testing, BT). The participants were randomized into two groups and skill retention testing (RT) was measured after 4 weeks (group A) or 12 weeks (group B). Task completion was measured in time with penalties for inaccurate performance. RESULTS A SILS training curriculum was established. 90 % of the participants completed the training successfully and reached the required levels of proficiency. Comparison of BT and RT revealed significantly better RT performances for peg transfer and precision cutting in group A (P < 0.05). These effects were not seen for RT in group B. Evaluating the RT performance of both groups, group A showed a non-significant trend for improved peg transfer and precision cutting compared to group B. CONCLUSION A proficiency-based training curriculum for acquisition of basic SILS skills was successfully established in our department. The results of this study indicate that acquired SILS skills are well retained for a short period without training (4 weeks) but a longer non-training period (12 weeks) resulted in a significant loss of acquired skills. For enhancement of surgical skills, specialised SILS training curricula could be developed for novices and inexperienced surgeons; however, continuous training is essential to maintain these acquired skills.","output":"Prospective randomized assessment of acquisition and retention of SILS skills after simulation training."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The drastic rate at which the Thai education system and the Thai society have changed over the last few months has brought enormous uncertainty into the lives of people, especially those working as teachers.

The current disposal of solid waste is a burgeoning issue and it's in immediate need to shift the existing disposal processes to a sustainable manner. Circular economy (CE) is a conceptual model which is been used for better use of resources and minimization of waste in a closed loop approach which could be appropriate for waste management. In this context, the present review illustrates the effective use of biodegradable and non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste in a closed loop integrated refinery platforms for the recovery of bioenergy resources and for the production of value added products. The biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be treated by advanced biological processes with the simultaneous production of bioenergy such as biohydrogen, biomethane, bioelectricity, etc., and other value added products like butanol, ethanol, methanol etc. The scheme illustrates the closed loop approach, the bioenergy generated from the biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for the operation of internal combustion engines and the energy could be further used for processing the waste. The non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for construction and pavement processes. Overall the study emphasizes the paradigm shift of solid waste management concepts from linear economy to a circular economy following the \\"Zero Waste\\" concept.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study that surveyed pharmacy RPDs and preceptors across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The questionnaires are comprised of two sections: demographic information and characteristics of the residency candidates. Over a five-month period (May 1, 2020 - September 30, 2020), the survey was sent electronically to the participants. Results: Of the 78 surveys returned, 68 surveys were included (RPDs: 36, Preceptors: 32) and 12 surveys (15.17%) were excluded due to incompleteness. Number of RPDs responded to the survey represents (65%) of the total RPDs in Saudi Arabia. The mean response scores from the results of the Likert scale [strongly agree (1) - strongly disagree (5)] - suggest that a candidate's performance during the interview (mean score = 1.5), their professional appearance (1.5), an alignment between a candidate's interests and the program focus (1.6), and previous hospital experience (1.8) mattered most. While being from the same region (3.4), having an advanced degree (2.8) and the cumulative Grade Point Average (2.7) mattered the least. We find that previous hospital experience (29%), familiarity with the program (16%), research experience (15%), Saudi Commission for Health Specialists aggregate score (10%), and letters of recommendation (4%) are considered the top five factors.

We used a consulting room to set up our simulations because currently the clearance time between consultations is the controlling factor that limits the patient turnover rate. The results suggest the inlet/suction of the air purifier unit should be lifted above the floor to achieve better clearance efficiency, with up to 40% improvement possible. If multiple air purifiers are used, the combined efficiency can increase to 62%.

METHODS: We conducted a 5-year observational cohort study of MDR-TB patients at a tertiary care center in India. Participants with Mtb isolates resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, and moxifloxacin (at the 0.5 g/mL threshold) were analyzed according to receipt of high-dose moxifloxacin (600 mg daily) as part of a susceptibility-guided treatment regimen. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models assessed the relationship between high-dose moxifloxacin and unfavorable treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Of 354 participants with MDR-TB resistant to moxifloxacin, 291 (82.2%) received high-dose moxifloxacin. The majority experienced good treatment outcomes (200 [56.5%]), which was similar between groups (56.7% vs 54.0%, P = .74). Unfavorable outcomes were associated with greater extent of radiographic disease, lower initial body mass index, and concurrent treatment with fewer drugs with confirmed phenotypic susceptibility.

Overall, these preclinical studies have opened new avenues for the development of novel pharmacological treatments specifically targeting the synaptic activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors.","output":"NMDA and AMPA Receptor Autoantibodies in Brain Disorders: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fire blight remains a serious threat to commercial apple production in the USA and worldwide. Other diseases and spray damage can result in fire blight-like symptoms that can lead to misdiagnosis and affect disease management strategies. Accurate and timely detection of the fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora, is extremely important to deploy appropriate and timely measures to reduce fire blight epidemics in commercial apple orchards. We tested two commercial lateral flow immunoassays (AgriStrip?, and Pocket Diagnostics kit), Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to diagnose E. amylovora infected samples in lab and field settings. The AgriStrip? and Pocket Diagnostics kits were able to detect actively growing bacteria up to 10(6) cfu/ml bacterial concentration. Pocket Diagnostics kit had less specificity and showed positive tests for E. pyrifolia in addition to E. amylovora. The LAMP assay showed high specificity for E. amylovora and was able to detect up to 10(3) cfu/ml bacterial concentrations. The qPCR assay was also able to detect bacterial cells up to 10(?3) cfu/ml bacterial concentration with highly specific E. amylovora detection. Grower surveys and comparative cost-benefit analysis indicated that immunoassay kits are less expensive, easier to use, and require less technical expertise for on-site fire blight diagnosis than LAMP and qPCR. However, the choice of a specific diagnostic assay depends on the time, sensitivity, and specificity required for the detection of fire blight and its management.

For the prevention of AKI among patients with COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend using isotonic crystalloid solutions for expansion of intravascular volume, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and using a conservative fluid management strategy in patients with respiratory failure. For the diagnosis of AKI, we suggest that any patient with COVID-19 presenting with an elevated serum creatinine level without available historical values be considered as having AKI. If serum creatinine testing is not available, we suggest that patients with proteinuria should be considered to have possible AKI. We suggest expansion of the use of point-of-care serum creatinine and salivary urea nitrogen testing in community health settings, as funding and availability allow. For the management of patients with AKI and COVID-19 in LMICS, we recommend judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation. For patients requiring dialysis who do not have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using peritoneal dialysis (PD) as first choice, where available and feasible.

METHODS: The heartbeat of the crime signal is constructed by overlapping the weekly time they were suffered. This study is based on more than 220,000 crimes reported to the Mexico City Police Department between January 2016 and March 2020 to capture the day and time of crimes and detect moments of the week in which the intensity exceeds the average frequency. A new metric for the temporal concentration of crime is constructed for different types of crime and regions of the city based on the corresponding heartbeats. RESULTS: The temporal concentration of crime is a stable signature of different types of crime. The intensity of robberies and theft is more homogeneous from Monday to Sunday, but robberies of a bank user are highly concentrated in a week, meaning that few hours of the week capture most of the burning moments. The concentration is not homogeneously distributed in the city, with some regions experiencing a much higher temporal concentration of crime. CONCLUSIONS: Crime is highly concentrated when observed in its weekly patterns, but different types of crime and regions exhibit substantially distinct concentration levels.

The HIRAN domain is critical for recognition of the stalled replication fork during the replication process and acts as a sensor to initiate the damaged DNA checkpoint. It is a conserved domain widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms and is present in several DNA-binding proteins from all kingdoms. Here we showed that distant species have important differences in key residues that affect affinity for ssDNA. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that different HIRAN domains might affect fork reversal and translesion synthesis through different metabolic processes. To address this question, we predicted the tertiary structure of both yeast and human HIRAN domains using molecular modeling. Structural dynamics experiments showed that the yeast HIRAN domain exhibited higher structural denaturation than its human homolog, although both domains became stable in the presence of ssDNA. Analysis of atomic contacts revealed that a greater number of interactions between the ssDNA nucleotides and the Rad5 domain are electrostatic. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of the HIRAN domain of Rad5 and may guide us to further elucidate differences in the ancient eukaryotes HIRAN sequences and their DNA affinity.

Therefore, investigating the effects of purple seed stain (PSS) on seed quality (germination and vigor) and seed composition (nutrition) is critical. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of PSS on seed harvest index, seed germination, seed vigor, and seed composition components (protein, oil, fatty acids, and sugars). A field experiment was initiated in 2019 in Stoneville, MS, at the Delta Research and Extension Center (DREC) on a Commerce silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Fluventic Epiaquepts). Soybean variety Credenz 4748 LL was used. The results showed that infected (symptomatic) seed had a 5.5% greater Seed Index (based on 100 seed weight) when compared to non-infected (non-symptomatic, as control) seed. Non-infected seed had greater percent germination and seedling vigor when compared to infected seed. Germination was 30.9% greater and vigor was 58.3% greater in non-infected seed. Also, the results showed that infected seed with PSS had higher protein content and some amino acids. No changes in total oil and fatty acids. Sucrose and stachyose were lower in infected seed than in non-infected seed. The research showed that PSS impacted seed health and seed quality (germination and vigor) and seed composition (protein, sugars, and some amino acids). Purple stained seed should be avoided when planting and should be managed properly as low germination is a potential risk. Planting population should be adjusted accordingly due to lack of germination and vigor if PSS is present.

It is widely distributed in the tropics and subtropics. The primary ornamental part of the plant is its colorful and unusual bracts, rich in the stable pigment betalain. The developmental mechanism of the bracts is not clear, and the pathway of betalain biosynthesis is well characterized in Bougainvillea. RESULTS At the whole-genome level, we found 23,469 protein-coding genes by assembling the RNA-Seq and Iso-Seq data of floral and leaf tissues. Genome evolution analysis revealed that Bougainvillea is related to spinach; the two diverged approximately 52.7 million years ago (MYA). Transcriptome analysis of floral organs revealed that flower development of Bougainvillea was regulated by the ABCE flower development genes; A-class, B-class, and E-class genes exhibited high expression levels in bracts. Eight key genes of the betalain biosynthetic pathway were identified by homologous alignment, all of which were upregulated concurrently with bract development and betalain accumulation during the bract initiation stage of development. We found 47 genes specifically expressed in stamens, including seven highly expressed genes belonging to the pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathways. BgSEP2b, BgSWEET11, and BgRD22 are hub genes and interacted with many transcription factors and genes in the carpel co-expression network. CONCLUSIONS We assembled protein-coding genes of Bougainvilea, identified the floral development genes, and constructed the gene co-expression network of petal, stamens, and carpel. Our results provide fundamental information about the mechanism of flower development and pigment accumulation in Bougainvillea, and will facilitate breeding of cultivars with high ornamental value.","output":"Transcriptome analyses shed light on floral organ morphogenesis and bract color formation in Bougainvillea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of favipiravir combined with inhaled interferon beta-1b in adult patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

The current study sought to define OOP costs incurred by patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection. METHODS: Privately insured patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection between 2013 and 2017 were identified from the IBM MarketScan database. Total and OOP costs were calculated within 1 year prior to and 1 year post surgery. A multivariable linear regression model was used to estimate total OOP costs relative to patient demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 10,935 patients, 7289 (66.7%) had primary colon cancer while 3643 (33.3%) had rectal cancer. Median total costs were US$93,967 (IQR US$51027C168,251). Median OOP costs were US$4417 (IQR US$2519C6943), or 4.5% (IQR 2.2C8.1%) of total costs. OOP costs varied over the course of patient care; specifically, median OOP costs in the preoperative period were US$432 (IQR US$130C1452) versus US$2146 (IQR US$851C3525) in the perioperative period and US$969 (IQR US$327C2239) in the postoperative period.

METHODS: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titres of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titres measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titres were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred, while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases.

In this original research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analyzed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories during the ascendant phase of the epidemiological curve, we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6 and 99.5%, respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the ICT was found at CT &lt;22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations. Conclusion: The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 min at the peak of the pandemic. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently-used molecular techniques.","output":"Development and Potential Usefulness of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip Diagnostic Assay in a Pandemic Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has unmasked mankinds vulnerability to biological threats. Although higher age is a major risk factor for disease severity in COVID-19, several predisposing risk factors for mortality are related to low cardiorespiratory and metabolic fitness, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Reaching physical activity (PA) guideline goals contribute to protect against numerous immune and inflammatory disorders, in addition to multi-morbidities and mortality. Elevated levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, being non-obese, and regular PA improves immunological function, mitigating sustained low-grade systemic inflammation and age-related deterioration of the immune system, or immunosenescence. Regular PA and being non-obese also improve the antibody response to vaccination. In this review, we highlight potential physiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that are affected by regular PA, increase the host antiviral defense, and may determine the course and outcome of COVID-19. Not only are the immune system and regular PA in relation to COVID-19 discussed, but also the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and hormonal systems, as well as skeletal muscle, epigenetics, and mitochondrial function.","output":"Potential Physiological and Cellular Mechanisms of Exercise That Decrease the Risk of Severe Complications and Mortality Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quality of service (QoS) requirements for live streaming are most required for video-on-demand (VoD), where they are more sensitive to variations in delay, jitter, and packet loss. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is the most popular technology for live streaming and VoD, where it has been massively deployed on the Internet. DASH is an over-the-top application using unmanaged networks to distribute content with the best possible quality. Widely, it uses large reception buffers in order to keep a seamless playback for VoD applications. However, the use of large buffers in live streaming services is not allowed because of the induced delay. Hence, network congestion caused by insufficient queues could decrease the user-perceived video quality. Active Queue Management (AQM) arises as an alternative to control the congestion in a routers queue, pressing the TCP traffic sources to reduce their transmission rate when it detects incipient congestion. As a consequence, the DASH client tends to decrease the quality of the streamed video. In this article, we evaluate the performance of recent AQM strategies for real-time adaptive video streaming and propose a new AQM algorithm using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to improve the user-perceived video quality. The LSTM forecast the trend of queue delay to allow earlier packet discard in order to avoid the network congestion. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the competing AQM algorithms, mainly in scenarios where there are congested networks.","output":"Improving Perceived Quality of Live Adaptative Video Streaming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This text discusses the role of civil society in public action to face the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil Based on a pragmatic approach, the study examines the collective actions promoted by civil society actors in Brazil, highlighting the characteristics, scope, and limits in the governance of this crisis The study uses documental analysis to observe the recent mobilization of civil society in the country and field research to explore the reality of the city of Florianpolis The results offer an overview of the performance of invisible networks of civil society actors, pointing out the challenges and outcomes of their actions The findings suggest the need for further studies exploring the role, perspectives, and dilemmas of civil society in the production of experimentalist governance in response to the numerous challenges posed by the pandemic at the local level ? 2020, Fundacao Getulio Vargas All rights reserved","output":"Civil society mobilization in coping with the effects of covid-19 in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Shotgun metagenomics has been used clinically for diagnosing infectious diseases. However, most technical assessments have been limited to individual sets of reference standards, experimental workflows, and laboratories. METHODS: A reference panel and performance metrics were designed and used to examine the performance of shotgun metagenomics at 17 laboratories in a coordinated collaborative study. We comprehensively assessed the reliability, key performance determinants, reproducibility, and quantitative potential. FINDINGS: Assay performance varied significantly across sites and microbial classes, with a read depth of 20 millions as a generally cost-efficient assay setting. Results of mapped reads by shotgun metagenomics could indicate relative and intra-site (but not absolute or inter-site) microbial abundance. INTERPRETATION: Assay performance was significantly impacted by the microbial type, the host context, and read depth, which emphasizes the importance of these factors when designing reference reagents and benchmarking studies. Across sites, workflows and platforms, false positive reporting and considerable site/library effects were common challenges to the assay's accuracy and quantifiability. Our study also suggested that laboratory-developed shotgun metagenomics tests for pathogen detection should aim to detect microbes at 500 CFU/mL (or copies/mL) in a clinically relevant host context (10^5 human cells/mL) within a 24h turn-around time, and with an efficient read depth of 20M.

In fall 2020, The Los Angeles Football Club Youth Leadership Program (LAFC YLP) developed seven virtual sport-based PYD videos and one workshop for 120 socially vulnerable youth and their families. All virtual activities were designed to teach life skills through sport and play. Our study sought to explore the accessibility of the virtual sport-based PYD activities, the lived experiences of youth participants during lockdown, and learning outcomes of youth and families who participated in the program. We developed a mixed methods study using an online survey and virtual platform to allow youth to share photos, draw pictures, and leave comments about their lived experiences. Our findings indicated 53 youth and their families participated in the virtual sport-based PYD program and reported the activities were accessible, enjoyable, and challenging for the youth participants. In addition, 26 youth shared photos, images, or posts about their lived experiences. Our thematic analysis of the photos, images, and posts indicated the virtual sport-based PYD activities facilitated positive emotional responses, positive peer interaction, engagement with family, and utilization of environmental resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Both receptor binding and membrane fusion activities are mediated by the virus spike glycoprotein(5C7). As with other class-I membrane-fusion proteins, the spike protein is post-translationally cleaved, in this case by furin, into the S1 and S2 components that remain associated after cleavage(8C10). Fusion activation after receptor binding is proposed to involve the exposure of a second proteolytic site (S2), cleavage of which is required for the release of the fusion peptide(11,12). Here we analyse the binding of ACE2 to the furin-cleaved form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using cryo-electron microscopy. We classify ten different molecular species, including the unbound, closed spike trimer, the fully open ACE2-bound trimer and dissociated monomeric S1 bound to ACE2. The ten structures describe ACE2-binding events that destabilize the spike trimer, progressively opening up, and out, the individual S1 components. The opening process reduces S1 contacts and unshields the trimeric S2 core, priming the protein for fusion activation and dissociation of ACE2-bound S1 monomers. The structures also reveal refolding of an S1 subdomain after ACE2 binding that disrupts interactions with S2, which involves Asp614(13C15) and leads to the destabilization of the structure of S2 proximal to the secondary (S2) cleavage site.","output":"Receptor binding and priming of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for membrane fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The invasion of the mosquito salivary glands by Plasmodium sporozoites is a critical step that defines the success of malaria transmission and a detailed understanding of the molecules responsible for salivary gland invasion could be leveraged towards control of vector-borne pathogens. Antibodies directed against the mosquito salivary gland protein SGS1 have been shown to reduce Plasmodium gallinaceum sporozoite invasion of Aedes aegypti salivary glands, but the specific role of this protein in sporozoite invasion and in other stages of the Plasmodium life cycle remains unknown. METHODS: RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9 were used to evaluate the role of A. aegypti SGS1 in the P. gallinaceum life cycle. RESULTS: Knockdown and knockout of SGS1 disrupted sporozoite invasion of the salivary gland. Interestingly, mosquitoes lacking SGS1 also displayed fewer oocysts. Proteomic analyses confirmed the abolishment of SGS1 in the salivary gland of SGS1 knockout mosquitoes and revealed that the C-terminus of the protein is absent in the salivary gland of control mosquitoes. In silico analyses indicated that SGS1 contains two potential internal cleavage sites and thus might generate three proteins. CONCLUSION: SGS1 facilitates, but is not essential for, invasion of A. aegypti salivary glands by P. gallinaceum and has a dual role as a facilitator of parasite development in the mosquito midgut. SGS1 could, therefore, be part of a strategy to decrease malaria transmission by the mosquito vector, for example in a transgenic mosquito that blocks its interaction with the parasite.","output":"Aedes aegypti SGS1 is critical for Plasmodium gallinaceum infection of both the mosquito midgut and salivary glands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo A pandemia da COVID-19  um exemplo de grande emergncia que desafia a administrao pblica ocasionalmente.

This led us to hypothesize that early application of APRV in patients with ARDS would allow pulmonary function to recover faster and would reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation as compared with low tidal volume lung protective ventilation (LTV). METHODS A total of 138 patients with ARDS who received mechanical ventilation for <48 h between May 2015 to October 2016 while in the critical care medicine unit (ICU) of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive APRV (n = 71) or LTV (n = 67). The settings for APRV were: high airway pressure (Phigh) set at the last plateau airway pressure (Pplat), not to exceed 30 cmH2O) and low airway pressure ( Plow) set at 5 cmH2O; the release phase (Tlow) setting adjusted to terminate the peak expiratory flow rate to  50%; release frequency of 10-14 cycles/min. The settings for LTV were: target tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight; Pplat not exceeding 30 cmH2O; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) guided by the PEEP-FiO2 table according to the ARDSnet protocol. The primary outcome was the number of days without mechanical ventilation from enrollment to day 28. The secondary endpoints included oxygenation, Pplat, respiratory system compliance, and patient outcomes. RESULTS Compared with the LTV group, patients in the APRV group had a higher median number of ventilator-free days {19 [interquartile range (IQR) 8-22] vs. 2 (IQR 0-15); P < 0.001}. This finding was independent of the coexisting differences in chronic disease. The APRV group had a shorter stay in the ICU (P = 0.003). The ICU mortality rate was 19.7% in the APRV group versus 34.3% in the LTV group (P = 0.053) and was associated with better oxygenation and respiratory system compliance, lower Pplat, and less sedation requirement during the first week following enrollment (P < 0.05, repeated-measures analysis of variance). CONCLUSIONS Compared with LTV, early application of APRV in patients with ARDS improved oxygenation and respiratory system compliance, decreased Pplat and reduced the duration of both mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.","output":"Early application of airway pressure release ventilation may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the basis of a compartment model, the epidemic curve is investigated when the net rate $$ of change of the number of infected individuals $I$ is given by an ellipse in the $$-$I$ plane which is supported in $[I_{\\\\ell}, I_h]$.

Initially, we investigated the meiotic progression of bovine oocytes matured in vitro in the presence of trichostatin A (TSA). We then evaluated histone H3k9 acetylation levels in oocytes exposed to different TSA concentrations, and the relative expression of genes linked to oocyte competence. Finally, we studied pre-implantation embryonic development by analyzing the cleavage, blastocysts, and hatching rates.

Age (HR 1.05, 5 years increments, 95 %CI 1.01-1.10), body mass index (HR 1.06, 2 units increments, 95 %CI 1.02-1.10), chronic kidney disease (HR 1.57, 95 %CI 1.11-2.22), and heart failure (HR 1.52, 95 %CI 1.04-2.22) were independently associated with the primary outcome (Fig. 1). Conclusions Women hospitalized for Covid-19 were older and had less prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities than men. While female sex was associated with a lower risk of transfer to ICU or in-hospital death, Covid-19 remains associated with considerable morbi-mortality in women, especially in those with cardiovascular diseases.","output":"Cardiovascular Comorbidities and Covid-19 in Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter identifies from leadership literature salient aspects of leadership perceived as useful for midwifery leadership development.

In this study, we aim to identify the determinants of anxiety in physicians on duty in coronavirus wards or quarantine centers. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative survey with an additional qualitative item. Five constructs of workload, exhaustion, family strain, feeling of protection, and anxiety were measured using items from two validated tools. Modifications were made for regional relevance. Factor analysis was performed showing satisfactory Cronbach alpha results. Overall, 103 physicians completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: T-test results revealed significant associations between gender and anxiety. Structural equation modeling identified that high workload contributed to greater exhaustion ( = 0.41, R(2) = 0.17, p < 0.001) and greater family strain ( = 0.47, R(2) = 0.22, p < 0.001). Exhaustion ( = 0.17, p < 0.005), family strain ( = 0.34, p < 0.001), and feelings of protection ( = ? 0.30, p < 0.001) significantly explained anxiety (R(2) = 0.28). Qualitative findings further identified specific needs of physicians with regard to protective equipment, compensation, quarantine management, resource allocation, security and public support, governance improvement, and health sector development. CONCLUSIONS: It is imperative to improve governmental and social support for physicians and other healthcare providers during the corona pandemic. Immediate attention is needed to reduce anxiety, workload, and family strain in frontline practitioners treating coronavirus patients, and to improve their (perceptions of) protection.

Chemically preserved and unpreserved aliquots of a groundwater sample were spiked with a known amount of Cr(VI), then analyzed in tandem with sets of preserved and unpreserved performance test samples over 28 days. The studies showed that while Cr(VI) appears to be relatively stable over 28 days, it may be sensitive to minor matrix changes after collection.

Deregulated complement activation may fuel thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby exacerbating cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation and multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) can elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we have compared the clinical efficacy of the C5-targeting mAb eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe, mainly non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in CRP and IL-6 levels, associated with marked lung function improvement and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS. C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile of anti-C3 treatment was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, a greater decline of median LDH levels and more prominent lymphocyte recovery within the first 7 days of treatment. These early clinical results offer important insight into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19. They point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways and set the stage for larger prospective trials that will benchmark these complement-targeting agents in COVID-19.","output":"Complement C3 vs C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19: early clinical findings reveal differential biological efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to forward the implementation of an operational evidence-based state screening program of common diseases in Ukraine, where currently no state-based and evidence-based screening (EBS) exists.

METHODS: Four needs-based research actions were led among citizens and healthcare professionals, based on multidimensional empowerment. Internal Strengths and Weaknesses of the ongoing implementation process were identified through these studies, whereas external Opportunities and Threats were determined by the present socio-cultural and political context. This SWOT analysis is likely to guide future state-based initiatives to accomplish EBS implementation in Ukraine. RESULTS: Internal Strengths are the bottom-up multidimensional empowerment approach, teaching of EBS and the development of an internet-based platform Screening adviser to assist shared decision making for person-centred EBS programs. Internal Weaknesses identified for the Family Doctors are a heterogeneous screening and the risk of decreasing motivation to screen. External Opportunities include the ongoing PHC reform, the existent WONCA and WHO support, and the existence of EBS programs in Europe. External Threats are the lack of national guidelines, not fully introduced gate keeping system, the vulnerable socio-economic situation, the war situation in the East of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We started EBS implementation through research actions, based on a multidimensional empowerment of citizens, HCP and in EBS pathways involved stakeholder teams, to foster a sustainable operational human resource to get involved in that new EBS pathway to implement.

This study was conducted to address the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among patients with depression based at a teaching hospital in Malaysia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional online study among patients with depression from University Malaya Medical Centre, using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Montgomery-?sberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Assessment (MADRS-S), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP), and Social Media Addiction during COVID-19 Pandemic (SMACOP). Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients participated in this study. The mean total of the KAP score is 12.65 (SD = 2.65), with knowledge section (mean = 7.34 [SD = 2.13]), attitudes section (mean = 2.63 [SD = 0.58]), and practices section (mean = 2.69 [SD = 1.00]). They scored moderately on the MADRS-S (mean = 21.03 [SD = 4.62]) and ISI (mean = 20.25 [SD = 4.62]) but had high GAD-7 scores (mean = 16.8 (SD = 6.27]). From the multiple logistic regression analyses, depressive symptoms of greater severity (MADRS-S 18-34) are significantly associated with more severe insomnia (P &lt; .001, adjusted OR = 9.101, 95% CI: 3.613-22.924). Furthermore, the high anxiety level is associated with the younger age group (P = .029, Adjusted OR = 2.274, 95% CI: 1.090-4.746), greater severity of insomnia (P &lt; .001, Adjusted OR = 22.9, 95% CI: 6.145-85.343), and higher risk of COVID-19 related social media addiction (P = .011, adjusted OR = 2.637, 95% CI: 1.253-5.550). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the high levels of sleep disturbances and anxiety symptoms experienced by outpatients with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are closely linked to the younger age group and at-risk social media addiction related to COVID-19.

The exact effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system are not well determined, however lessons from prior viral epidemics suggest that such infections can trigger acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias and heart failure via direct and indirect mechanisms.

Simulation results show that the carbon tariff impositions of developed countries on China will decrease the export to EU, the USA, and Japan but increase the export of China to other countries associated with the trade diversion in China. The USA and EU impose carbon tariffs on China, which will have a serious impact on Chinas export trade, especially for the export trade of energy-intensive industries. When Japan imposes carbon tariff on the exports of China, the positive influence on the export trade is weaker compared to the situation that the USA and EU imposed on China. Furthermore, imposing carbon tariffs on China will improve its trade structure; promote its agriculture, petroleum, and natural gas exploration and electricity industries; reduce its export trade volume of coal mining, petroleum products, and energy-intensive and other industries; decrease the export trade share of energy-intensive industries; and increase the export trade share and services of other industries. In this regard, China should reduce the carbon content of export products initiatively. On the one hand, China can solve this problem by levying carbon tax, developing emerging industries, and strengthening the research and development of low-carbon technologies.

More precisely, I present an empirical experiment that investigates the following three questions: (a) Are ordinary people willing to ascribe deceptive intentions to artificial agents? (b) Are they as willing to judge a robot lie as a lie as they would be when human agents engage in verbal deception? (c) Do people blame a lying artificial agent to the same extent as a lying human agent? The response to all three questions is a resounding yes.

Early attempts to control COVID-19 altered these assumptions with daycares/schools closing and the heavy shift to remote work. This calls into question whether couples tended to fall back on familiar gendered patterns to manage work and family, or if they adopted new strategies for the unique pandemic situation. We addressed this question using a sample of 274 dual-earner couples with young children. We content coded couples' qualitative responses about their plans for managing childcare and work commitments and used these codes in a latent class analysis to identify subgroups. Seven classes were identified, with 36.6% of the sample using strategies where women did most or all childcare, 18.9% of the sample using strategies that were not clearly gendered or egalitarian, and 44.5% of the sample using unique egalitarian strategies. We also obtained data from 133 of these couples approximately 7 weeks later regarding their well-being and job performance. Results suggested that women in the Remote Wife Does It All class had the lowest well-being and performance. There were nuanced differences between the egalitarian strategies in their relationships with outcomes, with the Alternating Days egalitarian category emerging as the overall strategy that best preserved wives' and husbands' well-being while allowing both to maintain adequate job performance.

This survey was conducted to assess the pre-Covid-19 pandemic standard of practice for head and neck oncology patients and the treatment modifications introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic in UK. METHODOLOGY: The UK National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Head and Neck Clinical Studies Group initiated a multi-centre survey using questionnaire to investigate the effect on feeding tube practice, radiotherapy (RT) fractionation and volumes, use of chemotherapy in the neo-adjuvant, adjuvant and palliative setting, the use of immunotherapy in the palliative setting, access to radiology and histopathology services, availability of surgical procedures. RESULTS: 30 centres were approached across UK; 23 (76.7%) centres responded and were included in the survey. There were differences in the standard practices in feeding tube policy, RT dose and fractionation as well as concurrent chemotherapy use. 21 (91%) participating centres had at least one treatment modification. 15 (65%) centres initiated a change in radical RT; changing to either a hypofractionation or acceleration schedule. For post-operative RT 10 centres (43.5%) changed to a hypofractionation schedule.12 (52.2%) centres stopped neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients; 13 (56.5%) centres followed selective omission of chemotherapy in concurrent chemo-radiotherapy patients, 17 (73.9%) centres changed first-line chemotherapy treatment to pembrolizumab (following NHS Englands interim guidance) and 8 (34.8%) centres stopped the treatment early or offered delays for patients that have been already on systemic treatment.

However, ExoN proofreading activity of CoVs leads to their protection from several NAs. Therefore, potential platforms based on the development of efficient NAs with broad-spectrum efficacy against human CoVs should be explored. This study was then aimed to present an overview on the development of NAs-based drug repurposing for targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by computational analysis. Afterwards, the clinical development of some NAs including Favipiravir, Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Tenofovir, and Remdesivir as potential inhibitors of RdRp, were surveyed.

This paper describes a simple unsupervised monitoring system that can automatically detect if an elderly individual's pattern of presence deviates substantially from the recent past. The proposed system uses a small set of low-cost motion sensors and analyzes the produced data to establish an individual's typical presence pattern. Then, the algorithm uses a distance function to determine whether the individual's observed presence for each day significantly deviates from their typical pattern. Empirically, the algorithm is validated on both synthetic data and data collected by installing our system in the residences of three older individuals. In the real-world setting, the system detected, respectively, five, four, and one deviating days in the three locations. The deviating days detected by the system could result from a health issue that requires attention. The information from the system can aid caregivers in assessing the subject's health status and allows for a targeted intervention.

Despite implementation of work-hour restrictions, residency remains a balancing act between patient care, surgical and clinical education, medical record documentation, and research endeavors. The added challenge of balancing these duties with life outside of the hospital further complicates the situation. Multiple studies have documented the stress associated with residency training, highlighting the prevalence of emotional exhaustion, detachment from people both in and out of the hospital, and a concerning rate of clinical depression among residents. Moreover, this emotional exhaustion has been shown to directly correlate with residents' clinical performance and abilities to carry out academic duties. More recently, feelings of isolation and detachment have been exacerbated by the necessity of COVID-19 precautions and change in clinical duties. The Accreditation for Graduate Medical Education (ACGM) now requires all residencies to include programming that focuses on resident well-being. Programs have implemented various strategies in an effort to help their trainees cope with the stress associated with residency and beyond. Despite the variety in approaches of programs, these initiatives have the similar objective of teaching resilience and the ability to navigate stressors in a healthy and effective manner.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission is associated with inhalation of contaminated respiratory droplets and could causes severe complications. Until today several waves of infections have been observed despite implementation of strict health policies. Decisions for such sanitary measures are based on population health monitoring. Unfortunately, for COVID-19, a significant proportion of individuals are asymptomatic but play a role in the virus transmission. To overcome these limitations, several strategies were developed including genome quantification in wastewater that could allow monitoring of the health status of population, since shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in patient stool is frequent. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was established and several countries implemented this approach to allow COVID-19 outbreak monitoring. In France, the OBEPINE project performed a quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater samples collected from major wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) since March 2020. In the greater Paris area 1101 samples (507 for five WWTP and 594 for sewer) were collected. This 16 months monitoring allows us to observe the outbreak dynamics. Comparison of WBE indicators with health data lead to several important observation; the good level of correlation with incidence rates, the average 3 days lead time, and the sensitivity (WBE change when incidence is > to 7/100000 inhabitants). We also compared the local monitoring (city level) with the regional monitoring, to help cluster identification. Moreover, variants of concern (VOC) emerged due to the selection pressure. We developed a specific RT-qPCR method targeting the deletion H69-V70 in the spike protein, using this deletion as a proxy of the B.1.1.7 presence in the wastewater. With this data we demonstrate the predominant role played by this strain in the third wave.

The relocation was not possible in many states in the Northeast, as the health system poorly assisted the interior of these states.

However, healthcare bodies worldwide recognized early on that a triumph against COVID-19 could only be achieved by maintaining the infrastructure of healthcare systems and their capacity to accommodate a potentially overwhelming increase in critical patient care needs.

Background. Foam and gauze are two types of wound fillers used for negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Differences in the wound healing effects of foam and gauze have been observed clinically. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of NPWT on the wound bed using foam and gauze. METHODS A porcine peripheral wound model was treated with NPWT at 0, -75 mmHg, or -125 mmHg for 72 hours. The effects of foam and gauze on the wound bed were compared, and the force required to remove the dressings was measured. Sections of biopsies from the wound bed with an overlying dressing were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa and were examined histologically. RESULTS The force ratio needed to remove the wound filler from the wound bed after treatment with negative pressure was greater for foam than for gauze. NPWT caused the wound bed tissue to grow into the foam, while there was no such ingrowth into gauze. Furthermore, beneath the foam there was more leukocyte infiltration, tissue disorganization, disruption of contact among cells, and differences in size among cells. The results were similar regardless of the level of negative pressure. CONCLUSION More force was required to remove foam compared to gauze following NPWT, which may have been due to greater ingrowth into foam. These findings may explain the patient discomfort and wound bed disruption upon removal of foam.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the widely recognised benefits of electronic health records (EHRs), their full potential has not always been achieved, often as a consequence of the implementation process. As more countries launch national EHR programmes, it is critical that the most up-to-date and relevant international learnings are shared with key stakeholders. METHODS: A rapid umbrella review was undertaken in collaboration with a multidisciplinary panel of knowledge-users and experts from Ireland. A comprehensive literature review was completed (2019) across several search engines (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ProQuest, Cochrane) and Gray literature. Identified studies (n = 5,040) were subject to eligibility criterion and identified barriers and facilitators were analysed, reviewed, discussed and interpreted by the expert panel. RESULTS: Twenty-seven literature reviews were identified which captured the key organizational, human and technological factors for a successful EHR implementation according to various stakeholders across different settings. Although the size, type and culture of the healthcare setting impacted on the organizational factors, each was deemed important for EHR success; Governance, leadership and culture, End-user involvement, Training, Support, Resourcing, and Workflows. As well as organizational differences, individual end-users also have varying Skills and characteristics, Perceived benefits and incentives, and Perceived changes to the health ecosystem which were also critical to success. Finally, the success of the EHR technology depended on Usability, Interoperability, Adaptability, Infrastructure, Regulation, standards and policies, and Testing. CONCLUSION: Fifteen inter-linked organizational, human and technological factors emerged as important for successful EHR implementations across primary, secondary and long-term care settings. In determining how to employ these factors, the local context, individual end-users and advancing technology must also be considered.","output":"Successfully implementing a national electronic health record: a rapid umbrella review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic impact on the global supply systems is continuously on the rise creating an increasing ripple effect across the automotive supply chain network.

This newly established master (2019) is equipping groups of students with different religions and worldviews for chaplaincy and leadership. The religiously and culturally plural learning environment that the master is aiming for doesn't just foster understanding of cross-religious and cross-cultural situations and contexts. It also has ambitions of shaping and altering the learning perspectives in professional chaplaincy training towards acknowledging the importance of co-formation, not just formation, in order to emphasize the meaning of relationships in learning processes and not merely the enhancement of individual knowledge and skill acquirement. This article will reflect on the learning situation of an internship module during the spring of 2020 in the master programme mentioned above, when social C or rather physical C distancing suddenly was the rule among the population due to the covid-19 pandemic. How does one teach and learn the skills necessary for generic chaplaincy, existential care and religiously-/worldview-based leadership while being confined to home? The article draws on practice theory and empirical research from other contexts in order to derive learning outcomes for this particular internship module and establishes crucial questions around internship within academic theology in the Nordic context. The main questions are: What is the educational gain from the pluralily referred to above, and what happens to internship training when the spatial circumstances for professional practice are changed into mandatory physical distancing? The article claims that working on these two questions relates to overarching questions around the place of practice in Nordic academic theology. An implicit question is whether it is possible to view practice as something happening only in a confined space.

Chronic hemodialysis makes social distancing difficult to achieve. Alternatively, kidney transplantation could increase the severity of COVID-19 due to therapeutic immunosuppression and contribute to saturation of intensive care units. For these reasons, kidney transplantation was suspended in France during the first epidemic wave. Here, we retrospectively evaluated this strategy by comparing the overall and COVID-19 related mortality in kidney transplant recipients and candidates over the last three years. Cross-interrogation of two national registries for the period 1 March and 1 June 2020, identified 275 deaths among the 42812 kidney transplant recipients and 144 deaths among the 16210 candidates. This represents an excess of deaths for both populations, as compared with the same period the two previous years (mean of two previous years: 253 in recipients and 112 in candidates). This difference was integrally explained by COVID-19, which accounted for 44% (122) and 42% (60) of the deaths in recipients and candidates, respectively. Taking into account the size of the two populations and the geographical heterogeneity of virus circulation, we found that the excess of risk of death due to COVID-19 was similar for recipients and candidates in high viral risk area but four-fold higher for candidates in the low viral risk area. Thus, in case of a second epidemic wave, kidney transplantation should be suspended in high viral risk areas but maintained outside those areas, both to reduce the excess of deaths of candidates and avoid wasting precious resources.","output":"IMPact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the moRTAlity of kidney transplant recipients and candidates in a French Nationwide registry sTudy (IMPORTANT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents models of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in individual countries and globally in 2020 based on the statistical characteristics of the spread in the given countries or regions (in particular, in Hubei province).

The country classifier we developed is based on the relative variability indicator of the confirmed cases variable. This classification indicator is compared with a set of data-driven thresholds, the crossing of which determines the degree of spread of the epidemic in a given country. The article was written between April 2020, when the pandemic had been suppressed in China and was raging in Europe and the USA, and August 2020, as a new wave of local resumed outbreaks appeared in many countries.

In the deep crystalline bedrock of the Fennoscandian Shield at Olkiluoto, Finland, opposing gradients of abiotic methane and ancient seawater-derived sulfate create a terrestrial sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). We used chemical and isotopic data coupled to genome-resolved metaproteogenomics to demonstrate active life and, for the first time, provide direct evidence of active anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in a deep terrestrial bedrock. Proteins from Methanoperedens (formerly ANME-2d) are readily identifiable despite the low abundance (1%) of this genus and confirm the occurrence of AOM. This finding is supported by 13C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon. Proteins from Desulfocapsaceae and Desulfurivibrionaceae, in addition to 34S-enriched sulfate, suggest that these organisms use inorganic sulfur compounds as both electron donor and acceptor. Zerovalent sulfur in the groundwater may derive from abiotic rock interactions, or from a non-obligate syntrophy with Methanoperedens, potentially linking methane and sulfur cycles in Olkiluoto groundwater. Finally, putative episymbionts from the candidate phyla radiation (CPR) and DPANN archaea represented a significant diversity in the groundwater (26/84 genomes) with roles in sulfur and carbon cycling.

In endemic areas, conducting educational interventions is necessary to change preventive behaviors of CL. This study aimed to investigate the effect of an educational intervention based on the BASNEF model on CL preventive behavior in students. METHODS: The present quasi-experimental study examined 80 students living in endemic areas of leishmaniasis in Isfahan province, Iran based on the BASNEF model. The required data were collected twice before and two months after the educational intervention based on a questionnaire whose validity and reliability had been already proven in other studies. The intervention was performed in three educational sessions for the students in the intervention group and 1 educational session for teachers and parents. Data were analyzed by SPSS (VER26) using the chi-square test, independent t-test, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and Paired t-test. RESULTS: After intervention, the mean scores of Knowledge (P < 0.001), attitude (P = 0.02), subjective norms (P = 0.04), behavioral intention (P < 0.001), and behavior (P = 0.02) indicated significant differences between the intervention and control groups, but an increase in mean scores of enabling factors was not significant (P = 0. 93).

Objective To evaluate the impact of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) targeting CVD risk in community health centers (CHCs). Design, Setting, and Participants This cluster randomized clinical trial included 70 CHC clinics randomized to an intervention group (42 clinics; 8 organizations) or a control group that received no intervention (28 clinics; 7 organizations) from September 20, 2018, to March 15, 2020. Randomization was by CHC organization accounting for organization size. Patients aged 40 to 75 years with (1) diabetes or atherosclerotic CVD and at least 1 uncontrolled major risk factor for CVD or (2) total reversible CVD risk of at least 10% were the population targeted by the CDSS intervention. Interventions A point-of-care CDSS displaying real-time CVD risk factor control data and personalized, prioritized evidence-based care recommendations. Main Outcomes and Measures One-year change in total CVD risk and reversible CVD risk (ie, the reduction in 10-year CVD risk that was considered achievable if 6 key risk factors reached evidence-based levels of control). Results Among the 18 578 eligible patients (9490 [51.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 58.7 [8.8] years), patients seen in control clinics (n = 7419) had higher mean (SD) baseline CVD risk (16.6% [12.8%]) than patients seen in intervention clinics (n = 11 159) (15.6% [12.3%]; P < .001); baseline reversible CVD risk was similarly higher among patients seen in control clinics. The CDSS was used at 19.8% of 91 988 eligible intervention clinic encounters. No population-level reduction in CVD risk was seen in patients in control or intervention clinics; mean reversible risk improved significantly more among patients in control (-0.1% [95% CI, -0.3% to -0.02%]) than intervention clinics (0.4% [95% CI, 0.3% to 0.5%]; P < .001). However, when the CDSS was used, both risk measures decreased more among patients with high baseline risk in intervention than control clinics; notably, mean reversible risk decreased by an absolute 4.4% (95% CI, -5.2% to -3.7%) among patients in intervention clinics compared with 2.7% (95% CI, -3.4% to -1.9%) among patients in control clinics (P = .001). Conclusions and Relevance The CDSS had low use rates and failed to improve CVD risk in the overall population but appeared to have a benefit on CVD risk when it was consistently used for patients with high baseline risk treated in CHCs. Despite some limitations, these results provide preliminary evidence that this technology has the potential to improve clinical care in socioeconomically vulnerable patients with high CVD risk.

Here we show that CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable spike binding to the cellular receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonal antibodies. We also found that in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, the simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, and combines the advantages of antibody cocktails with those of single-molecule approaches.","output":"Bispecific IgG neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants and prevents escape in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Both SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistent infection have been reported, but sequence characteristics in these scenarios have not been described. We assessed published cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistence, characterizing the hallmarks of reinfecting sequences and the rate of viral evolution in persistent infection. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed was conducted to identify cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistence with available sequences. Nucleotide and amino acid changes in the reinfecting sequence were compared to both the initial and contemporaneous community variants. Time-measured phylogenetic reconstruction was performed to compare intra-host viral evolution in persistent SARS-CoV-2 to community-driven evolution. RESULTS: Twenty reinfection and nine persistent infection cases were identified. Reports of reinfection cases spanned a broad distribution of ages, baseline health status, reinfection severity, and occurred as early as 1.5 months or >8 months after the initial infection. The reinfecting viral sequences had a median of 17.5 nucleotide changes with enrichment in the ORF8 and N genes. The number of changes did not differ by the severity of reinfection and reinfecting variants were similar to the contemporaneous sequences circulating in the community. Patients with persistent COVID-19 demonstrated more rapid accumulation of sequence changes than seen with community-driven evolution with continued evolution during convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody treatment.

PBL uses a case-based approach in small group discussions to enhance medical learning . Social distancing restrictions of the Covid19 pandemic have limited in person small group interactions to online conferencing platforms. Here we pilot the feasibility and acceptability of an online PBL based curriculum across separate institutions for pediatric pulmonary fellowship training during a global pandemic. METHODS Ten Pediatric Pulmonary fellows from three institutions were asked to participate in online PBL sessions via Zoom?. Two groups of five fellows met quarterly over two separate sessions: 1) to review a specific patient case to establish learning objectives and 2) to discuss what was learned and to evaluate their performance during PBL. PBL sessions were also attended by a pulmonary attending who served as group tutor to facilitate discussion and ensure educational goals were met. Satisfaction and content-based surveys were completed following each PBL session. RESULTS Ten fellows participated across three institutions. Most were female (8/10) with an MD degree (n=8);2 with a DO degree. There were 3 first year, 3 second year, and 4 third year fellows. Most were new to PBL (8/10) and all were interested in trying PBL. To date, 2 PBL sessions have been completed. Most judged their knowledge about the specific patient case as 'some knowledge' prior to each PBL (63% & 67%). Following completion of each PBL, most felt 'a lot learned' (80% & 75%) and confident to very confident to teach others about the case (100% & 100%). Content based quiz scores were stable or improved (81% to 82% & 70% to 85% correct) following PBL. PBL tutors rated the PBL sessions on a Likert scale as 8.5 out of 10 in effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS So far, online PBL learning is both acceptable and feasible for casebased learning for pediatric pulmonary fellows across three institutions with overall positive trends in contentbased test performance as well as positive satisfaction reviews. Two more PBL sessions are planned. Given the ability to administer small group PBL sessions virtually, there is potential for larger scale trials of virtual PBL in pediatric pulmonology training across multiple institutions. Virtual PBL is a possible unifying and effective strategy to enhance small group discussion-based learning when in-person sessions are precluded.","output":"Online problem based learning for pediatric pulmonary fellowship training: A novel strategy during a global pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective removal of dental plaque is a key measure to prevent and control common oral diseases and to maintain the long-term effect of dental prostheses.

Mature females were divided into 4 groups, thus being maintained for 96a?h in one of the following conditions: control at neutral pH (Ctr); Al at neutral pH (Al); acidic pH (Ac), and Al at acidic pH (Al-Ac). pH alone did not influence Al bioconcentration in the brain.

Aluminum bioconcentration was higher in the brain than in the liver and ovaries in Al-exposed animals (Al and Al-Ac), and higher in the brain than in the ovaries in the Ctr and Ac groups. The liver bioconcentrates more Al than the ovaries in the females from the Ctr and Ac groups. Aluminum and/or acidic pH did not alter ?fsh gene expression, while ?lh gene expression decreased in females from the Al group.

Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies, TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as PD-L1 expression on B cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by GzmB expression, was significantly diminished. However, both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully capable to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon TCR stimulation.

Implementing a patient-driven surgical safety checklist might enhance the way critical information is given and increase patient involvement in their own safety throughout the surgical pathway. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a Surgical Patient Safety Checklist (PASC) for use by surgical patients. METHOD: This was a prospective study, involving patient representatives, multidisciplinary healthcare professionals and elective surgical patients to develop and validate PASC using consensus-building techniques in two Norwegian hospitals. A set of items intended for PASC were rated by patients and then submitted to Content Validation Index (CVI) analyses. Items of low CVI went through a Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) Hazard Scoring process, as well as a consensus process before they were either kept or discarded. Reliability of patients PASC ratings was assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient analysis. Lastly, the face validity of PASC was investigated through focus group interviews with postoperative patients. RESULTS: Initial development of PASC resulted in a checklist consisting of two parts, one before (32 items) and one after surgery (26 items). After achieving consensus on the PASC content, 215 surgical patients from six surgical wards rated the items for the CVI analysis on a 1-4 scale and mostly agreed on the content. Five items were removed from the checklist, and six items were redesigned to improve PASCs user-friendliness. The total Scale-level index/Average (S-CVI/Ave) before revision was 0.83 and 0.86 for pre- and post-operative PASC items, respectively. Following revision, these increased to 0.86 and 0.93, respectively. The PASC items reliability score was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 0.98). The qualitative assessment identified that patients who used PASC felt more in control of their situation; this was achieved when PASC was given to them at what they felt was the right time and healthcare professionals took part in its usage. CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary perioperative care staff and surgical patients agreed upon PASC content, the checklist ratings were reliable, and qualitative assessment suggested good face validity. PASC appears to be a usable and valid checklist for elective surgical patients across specialties.

These also impact on surgical specialties not directly involved in the management of patients infected with the coronavirus. The Spine Section, the interdisciplinary professional political arm of the German Spine Society (DWG), the Professional Association for Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (BVOU), and the Federal Association of German Neurosurgeons (BDNC) conducted a survey on the collateral effects of the pandemic on spine surgery in Germany. METHOD: This cross-sectional study included outpatient, day-patient and inpatient facilities caring for patients with spinal disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was designed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of inpatients and outpatients with spinal disorders and to assess the economic ramifications in the various settings. RESULTS: All members of the Spine Section (n = 134) were invited to participate in the questionnaire consented by BVOU and BDNC. The questions were answered anonymously, and the personal data entered did not permit any de-anonymisation. All in all, 68% (n = 91) of the respondents completed the survey in full. Based on the type of employment (practice 30%, practice/staff: 45% and staff: 25%) and range of activities (conservative: 5%, conservative/operative: 75%, operative: 20%) the survey by the Spine Section can be regarded as representative. 95% of the practices/outpatient clinics reported a decline in their number of patients. In addition, the number of operations performed fell by 36% (SD 17%). The percentage of elective procedures declined from approximately 78% to 6%. As a result, more than half of the physicians anticipated moderate (20a-a40%) economic challenges and 25% major (> 50%) financial problems.

Polyphenols have been widely shown protective efficacy against various PD symptoms. However, data on their effect on physio-pathological mechanisms underlying this disease are still lacking. In the present work, we evaluated the activity of a mixture of polyphenols and micronutrients, named A5(+), in the murine neuroblastoma cell line N1E115 treated with 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), an established neurotoxic stimulus used to induce an in vitro PD model. We demonstrate that a pretreatment of these cells with A5(+) causes significant reduction of inflammation, resulting in a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-, IL-6, TNF-, and CXCL1), a reduction in ROS production and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2, and a decrease in apoptotic mechanisms with the related increase in cell viability. Intriguingly, A5(+) treatment promoted cellular differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, as evident by the enhancement in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, a well-established dopaminergic neuronal marker. Overall, these results demonstrate the synergic and innovative efficacy of A5(+) mixture against PD cellular pathological processes, although further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying its beneficial effect.","output":"The Protective Effect of a Unique Mix of Polyphenols and Micronutrients against Neurodegeneration Induced by an In Vitro Model of Parkinsons Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: This study compares two pathways for patients undergoing MUA for FS, one where physiotherapy advice is only given to the patient (Group 1), and the other where supervised hydrotherapy and physiotherapy occur post operatively (Group 2).

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to measure the effect of physiotherapy on post-operative OSS, with pre-operative OSS as the only covariate. Results: The results for post-operative OSS were significantly greater for Group 2 than for Group 1 (40.7 for NHS and 44.7 for private, improvement of 17.32 for NHS and 18.23 for Private). The estimated effect of physiotherapy on postoperative OSS was an increase of 3.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5-4.8). Conclusions: We detected a statistically significant increase in postoperative OSS in patients treated for frozen shoulder with MUA + physiotherapy compared with patients receiving MUA plus advice alone. These results suggest that physiotherapy does confer a real benefit, however the increased OSS is below the clinically significant level. Therefore, in a resource poor environment, such as may exist after COVID in many health care systems, MUA plus physio advice alone gives an excellent outcome for the treatment of FS.","output":"Manipulation under anaesthetic for frozen shoulder: Does post-operative supervised physiotherapy affect the outcome?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les infections respiratoires reprsentent une part majeure des infections humaines.

We focus on a strong adaptive behaviour, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards non-quarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of active phase. We show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one, and that in SIR model a late adoption of measures requires inactive quarantine to reach containment.","output":"Active and inactive quarantine in epidemic spreading on adaptive activity-driven networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical trials are a fundamental tool used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs and medical devices and other health system interventions.

One COVID-19 patient with vesicles was treated by bullectomy for last resort, and its characteristics of the patients perioperative laboratory tests was analyzed. The pathological findings of bullectomy were described and compared with those of common bulla cases. Results: Patients infected with COVID-19 showed more dependence on ventilator, occurrence of super resistant bacteria, and prone to vesicle formation than common bulla (p<0.05). Disease severity is associated with age, sex, and usage of ventilator, ECMO and antibiotics, super resistance bacteria and vesicle formation (p<0.05). The average mortality rate of COVID-19 patients was 4.10% (25.4% in severe patients, 0.00% in mild patients). Interestingly, the mortality rate further increased in severe patients with pulmonary vesicles than those without pulmonary vesicles (35.7% vs 22.4%, p=0.0442).

Although great efforts have recently been devoted to the interaction of specific antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2, it still remains largely unknown how the other serum proteins affect the infection of the SARS-CoV-2.

It is found that non-specific immunoglobulins (Ig) indeed cannot effectively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD while human serum albumin (HSA) may have some potential in blocking its infection (to ACE2). More importantly, we find that the RBD can cause significant structural changes in Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), by which SARS-CoV-2 may hijack the metabolic pathway of ApoE to facilitate its cell entry. The present study enhances the understanding of the role of protein corona in the bio-behaviors of SARS-CoV-2, which may aid the more precise and personalized treatment for COVID-19 infection in the clinic.","output":"Interaction of serum proteins with SARS-CoV-2 RBD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, an unprecedented coronavirus pandemic has emerged and has spread around the world.

Further, COVID-19 pandemic-associated ARDS is now a major cause of mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of ALI is explained by injury to both the vascular endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. The disruption of the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers occurs in response to both systemic and local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies that evaluate the association of genetic polymorphisms with disease risk did not yield many potential therapeutic targets to treat and revert lung injury. This failure is probably due in part to the phenotypic complexity of ALI/ARDS, and genetic predisposition may be obscured by the multiple environmental and behavioral risk factors. In the last decade, new research has uncovered novel epigenetic mechanisms that control ALI/ARDS pathogenesis, including histone modifications and DNA methylation. Enzyme inhibitors such as DNMTi and HDACi may offer new alternative strategies to prevent or reverse the vascular damage that occurs during lung injury.

Limited data are available on the epidemiology of the outbreak. However, reported cumulative incidence data as well as death counts are available for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. We utilized a simple, two parameter mathematical model of epidemic growth and control, to characterize epidemic growth patterns in West Africa, to evaluate the degree to which the epidemic is being controlled, and to assess the potential implications of growth patterns for epidemic size. Models demonstrated good fits to data. Overall basic reproductive number (R0) for the epidemic was estimated to be between 1.6 and 2.0, consistent with prior outbreaks. However, we identified only weak evidence for the occurrence of epidemic control in West Africa as a whole, and essentially no evidence for control in Liberia (though slowing of growth was seen in Guinea and Sierra Leone).

We analyzed 205 publications in total and 18 in detail. Our research questions were related to the main findings about the success of implementation of online FC and recommendations for future research. The findings indicated that those who had used FC approaches in face-to-face or blended learning environments more successfully continued to use them in online environments than those who had not used it before. The SLR opened possible questions for future research, such as the effectiveness of the FC for different courses and contexts, the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement, and students data protection.

Here, we investigated the role of the host cell's unfolded protein response (UPR) in infection of the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). In mammalian cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein GRP78/BiP functions as the principal sensor for the induction of the UPR and interacts with three mediators: kinase/endonuclease inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Acute infection with LCMV resulted in a selective induction of the ATF6-regulated branch of the UPR, whereas pathways controlled by PERK and IRE1 were neither activated nor blocked. Expression of individual LCMV proteins revealed that the viral glycoprotein precursor (GPC), but not that of other viral proteins, was responsible for the induction of ATF6. Rapid downregulation of the viral GPC during transition from acute to persistent LCMV infection restored basal levels of UPR signaling. To address a possible role of ATF6 signaling in LCMV infection, we used cells deficient in site 2 protease (S2P), a metalloprotease required for the activation of ATF6. Cells deficient in S2P showed significantly lower levels of production of infectious virus during acute but not persistent infection, indicating a requirement for ATF6-mediated signaling for optimal virus multiplication. In summary, acute LCMV infection seems to selectively induce the ATF6-regulated branch of the UPR that is likely beneficial for virus replication and cell viability, but it avoids induction of PERK and IRE1, whose activation may be detrimental for virus and the host cell.","output":"Role of the host cell's unfolded protein response in arenavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"De novo drug discovery of any therapeutic modality (e g antibodies, vaccines or small molecules) historically takes years from ideareclinic to the market and it is therefore not a short-term solution for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Therefore, drug repurposing a the discovery novel indication areas for already approved drugs - is perhaps the only approach able to yield a short term relieve Here we describe computational screening results suggesting that certain members of the drug class of gliptins are inhibitors of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases 3CLpro and PLpro The oral bioavailable antidiabetic drug class of gliptins are safe and have been introduced clinically since 2006 and used by millions of patients since then Based on our repurposing hypothesis the nitrile containing gliptins deserve further investigation as potential anti-COVID19 drugs","output":"Gliptin Repurposing for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European Burden of Disease Network (burden-eu) joins 271 members from 50 countries.

Although the perception of the severity of this public health emergency did not directly predict irrational consumer behavior, the effect was mediated by PS and NM independently and serially. These findings reveal that people who strongly perceive scarcity and are prone to negative attitudes are more likely to demonstrate irrational consumer behaviors (such as rushing to buy and hoard living supplies) once the public perceives a public health emergency as severe.

The theoretical model consists of four reinforcing (R) feedback loops (R1, R2, R3 and R4), respectively, which explain how the understanding of community resilience in the informal settlement maps on to the relative achievement systems archetype. Negative reinforcing behaviour would explain the lack of understanding of community resilience, while positive reinforcing behaviour indicates how an understanding of community resilience develops.

Various factors could explain this trend, including changes in demographic characteristics of infected persons, and the improvement of case management. To date, no study has been performed to investigate the evolution of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in Switzerland, while also accounting for risk factors. MethodsWe investigated the trends in COVID-19 related mortality (in-hospital and in-intermediate/intensive-care) over time in Switzerland, from February 2020 to May 2021, comparing in particular the first and the second wave. We used data from the COVID-19 Hospital-based Surveillance (CH-SUR) database. We performed survival analyses adjusting for well-known risk factors of COVID-19 mortality (age, sex and comorbidities) and accounting for competing risk. ResultsOur analysis included 16,030 episodes recorded in CH-SUR, with 2,320 reported deaths due to COVID-19 (13.0% of included episodes). We found that overall in-hospital mortality was lower during the second wave of COVID-19 compared to the first wave (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.69 - 0.72, p-value < 0.001), a decrease apparently not explained by changes in demographic characteristics of patients. In contrast, mortality in intermediate and intensive care significantly increased in the second wave compared to the first wave (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.42 - 1.55, p-value < 0.001), with significant changes in the course of hospitalisation between the first and the second wave. ConclusionWe found that, in Switzerland, COVID-19 mortality decreased among hospitalised persons, whereas it increased among patients admitted to intermediate or intensive care, when comparing the second wave to the first wave. We put our findings in perspective with changes over time in case management, treatment strategy, hospital burden and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Further analyses of the potential effect of virus variants and of vaccination on mortality would be crucial to have a complete overview of COVID-19 mortality trends throughout the different phases of the pandemic.","output":"Evolution of COVID-19 mortality over time: results from the Swiss hospital surveillance system (CH-SUR)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM Riboflavin (vitamin B2) activated by ultraviolet (UV) light, produces active oxygen which damages cell membrane and prevents replication of the carrier of diseases (viruses, bacteria, protozoa) in all blood products. The aim of this study was to establish the influence of the process of photo inactivation in pathogens using riboflavin and UV rays on the concentration of coagulation factor VIII:C (FVIII:C) and proteins in plasma that were treated before freezing. METHODS The examination included 20 units of plasma, separated from whole blood donated by voluntary blood donors around 6 hours from the moment of collection. The units were pooled and separated in to two groups: one consisted of 10 control units and the other of 10 experimental units. Experimental units of the plasma were treated by riboflavin (35 mL) and UV rays (6.24 J/mL, 265-370 nm) on Mirasol aparature (Caridian BCT Biotechnologies, USA) in approximate duration of 6 minutes. Furthermore, 35 mL of saline solution was added to the control plasma. One sample for examining was taken from the control plasma (KG) and two residual were taken from experimental plasma after the addition of riboflavin either before (EG1) or post illumination (EG2). Results. Comparing the mean values of FVIII:C (%) we noticed statistically significantly higher level in the EG1 group than in the EG2 group (65.00 +/- 4.52 vs. 63.20 +/- 4.73; t = 4.323, p = 0.002), while between the KG and experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) there was no statistically significant difference in the concentration of FVIII:C.

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with COVID-19 with Aspergillus isolated from respiratory cultures. RESULTS: A total of seven patients with COVID-19 who had one or more positive respiratory cultures for Aspergillus fumigatus were identified, all of whom were mechanically ventilated in the ICU. Four patients were classified as putative IPA. The median age was 79 years, and all patients were male. The patients had been mechanically ventilated for a mean of 6.8 days (range: 1-14 days) before Aspergillus isolation. Serum galactomannan level was positive for only one patient. The majority of our cases received much higher doses of glucocorticoids than the dosage with a proven mortality benefit. All four patients died.

The present experiment was designed to evaluate the potential of two native nodule endophytic bacterial strains, viz. Bacillus aryabhattai AS03 (MT645244) and Rhizobium pusense AS05 (MT645243), isolated from contaminated sites to be considered remediation tool to minimize the effect of Cr toxicity on Macrotyloma uniflorum var. Madhu. The two nodule endophytic bacterial strains AS03 and AS05 exhibited tolerance to 1800 and 3000 ppm of Cr(VI) respectively in vitro when cultured alone. AAS analysis confirmed higher accumulation of Cr(VI) in roots and less accumulation in shoots which is dose-specific (bio-inoculant) either treated alone or combined. Complete absence of Cr accumulation approximately 99% in shoots of Macrotyloma was observed owing to synergistic effect of both the strains (biochar-based formulation). This study also suggests increased shoot and root length, nodule nos., and leghemoglobin content of the plant at 60 days indicating the plant growth-promoting effects of both the strains. ROS and antioxidant enzymes of the plant recorded decreasing trend in inoculated plants. However, a significant increment in transpiration rate, total photosynthetic rate, intracellular CO(2) conc., and stomatal conductance in leaves was observed owing to dual inoculation. Our findings corroborate the supremacy of synergistic effect of both the strains applied in the form of biochar-based biofertilizer in enhancing growth and tolerance index of M. uniflorum cultivated in Cr(VI)-stressed soil. This investigation depicts the efficiency of the two nodule bacteria as a mixed inoculant to alleviate Cr toxicity and making the seeds safe for consumption.

The United States federal GND originally introduced to Congress by Representative Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Markey in 2019 has received the most attention. Since then, however, multiple other climate policy proposals that share the GNDs integrated multi-sectoral approach have emerged. To date, there has been minimal comparative assessment of these different proposals that build from a GND framework. As cities, regions, and countries around the world plan recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and respond to worsening economic inequities, racial injustices, and climate disruptions, the need to study policies that simultaneously address environmental, economic, and social issues with an integrated approach is stronger than ever. This paper reviews 14 GND-style policy proposals across multiple levels of government, from municipal to multi-national, comparing their structure, level of detail, and goals. We find that GND frameworks are emerging as a new, multi-faceted policy approach to confront the complex, multiple drivers of climate change with greater scope than traditional market-based and behavior-based strategies.","output":"Green New Deal proposals: Comparing emerging transformational climate policies at multiple scales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems globally.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the degree to which expanding fecal immunochemical testCbased colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A previously developed simulation model was adopted to estimate how much COVID-19 may have contributed to colorectal cancer outcomes. The model included the US population estimated to have completed colorectal cancer screening preCCOVID-19 according the American Cancer Society. The model was designed to estimate colorectal cancer outcomes between 2020 and 2023. This analysis was completed between July and December 2020. EXPOSURES: Adults screened for colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer cases detected by stage. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimates of colorectal cancer outcomes across 4 scenarios: (1) 9 months of 50% colorectal cancer screenings followed by 21 months of 75% colorectal cancer screenings; (2) 18 months of 50% screening followed by 12 months of 75% screening; (3) scenario 1 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests; and (4) scenario 2 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests. RESULTS: In our simulation model, COVID-19Crelated reductions in care utilization resulted in an estimated 1 176 942 to 2 014 164 fewer colorectal cancer screenings, 8346 to 12 894 fewer colorectal cancer diagnoses, and 6113 to 9301 fewer early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses between 2020 and 2023. With an abbreviated period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 588 844 colorectal cancer screenings and 2836 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1953 (68.9%) were early stage. In the event of a prolonged period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 655 825 colorectal cancer screenings and 2715 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1944 (71.6%) were early stage. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that the increased use of fecal immunochemical tests during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased colorectal cancer screening participation and more colorectal cancer diagnoses at earlier stages. If our estimates are borne out in real-world clinical practice, increasing fecal immunochemical testCbased colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic could mitigate the consequences of reduced screening rates during the pandemic for colorectal cancer outcomes.","output":"Model-Based Estimation of Colorectal Cancer Screening and Outcomes During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To improve the detection and molecular identification of infectious bronchitis virus (avian coronavirus), two reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed. As 'diagnostic#10; PCR', a set of consensus nested primers was selected from highly conserved stretches of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. As 'phylogeny' PCR, a fragment of the spike protein gene (S1) was amplified and the PCR products were directly sequenced. To study the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses from various outbreaks, studies of molecular epizootiology were performed in Sweden, a Nordic region, where the occurrence of natural cases of the disease is relatively low and the occasional use of live vaccine(s) is well recorded and monitored. The disease appeared in the region in 1994, associated with production problems among layers of various ages. During outbreaks in 1995 and 1997, both layers and broilers were affected. To reduce losses, a live attenuated vaccine has been applied since 1997. By examining 12 cases between 1994 and 1998, molecular epizootiology revealed that, before 1997, the viruses had gene sequences very similar to strains of the Massachusetts serotype. However, comparative sequence analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the identity was not 100% to any of the strains of this serotype that we analysed. A virus related to the Dutch-type strain, D274, was also identified on one farm. Surprisingly, from 1997, the year that vaccination commenced with a live Massachusetts serotype vaccine, the majority of viruses detected had S1 sequences identical to the live Massachusetts vaccine strain. This genetic relation to the vaccine virus was also confirmed by N gene sequence analysis. The studies of molecular epizootiology reveal a strong probability that the vaccination had lead to the spread of the vaccine virus, causing various disease manifestations and a confusing epizootiological situation in the poultry population.","output":"Molecular epizootiology of infectious bronchitis virus in Sweden indicating the involvement of a vaccine strain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Adaptive Logistic Model (ALM) of epidemics incorporates the results of infection mitigation effects on the course of an epidemic, and well describes the histories of the COVID-19 epidemics in many countries, including the United States.

Methods: We studied 144 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center in intensive or subintensive care units. Those with previous thyroid dysfunctions or taking interfering drugs were excluded. Differently from previous reports, TSH, FT3, FT4, thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg autoantibodies (TgAb) were measured at baseline and every 3-7 days. C-reacting protein (CRP), cortisol and IL-6 were also assayed. Results: The majority of patients had a normal TSH at admission, usually with normal FT4 and FT3. Low TSH levels were found either at admission or during hospitalization in 39% of patients, associated with low FT3 in half of the cases. FT4 and Tg levels were normal, and TgAb-negative. TSH and FT3 were invariably restored at the time of discharge in survivors, whereas were permanently low in most deceased cases, but only FT3 levels were predictors of mortality. Cortisol, CRP and IL-6 levels were higher in patients with low TSH and FT3 levels. Conclusions: Almost half of our COVID-19 patients without interfering drugs had normal TFTs both at admission and during follow-up. In this series, the transient finding of low TSH with normal FT4 and low FT3 levels, inversely correlated with CRP, cortisol and IL-6 and associated with normal Tg levels, is likely due to the cytokine storm induced by SARS-Cov-2 with a direct or mediated impact on TSH secretion and deiodinase activity, and likely not to a destructive thyroiditis.","output":"The spectrum of thyroid function tests during hospitalization for SARS COV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optimizing healthcare resources is a major goal for any healthcare administrator.

Objectives: To assess the outcome of patients who switched from IV ABT or TCZ to SC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A survey was conducted in December 2020 in partnership with the national AFP-RIC patient association to assess the outcome and satisfaction of patients who switched from ABT or TCZ IV to SC during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We also analysed the outcome of patients who switched from IV ABT or TCZ to SC in the rheumatology department of Cochin Hospital during the lockdown in April/may 2020. Articular activity parameters (swollen joint count, pain joint count, visual analogic pain scale, CRP, DAS-28 activity score) were assessed at medical visits before and 6 months after switching from IV to SC. The data collected from the AFP-RIC patient association and the rheumatology department of Cochin Hospital were then aggregated and analyzed by Chisquare and Wilcoxon tests. Results: 81 patients responded to the survey carried out by AFP-RIC patient association, including 29 treated with IV ABT (n=15, 52%) or TCZ (n=14, 48%). 17/29 (59%) were offered to switch from IV to SC, 14/17 patients (82%) accepted and 7 patients were still receiving ABT or TCZ SC injections in December 2020.

METHODS e retrospectively analysed the 200 donors and recipients who underwent a planned laparoscopic nephrectomy at two hospitals between September 1998 and December 2006. The impact of donor right kidney and multiple donor renal arteries on operative time, hospital stay, graft function, and donor and recipient complications were analysed. RESULTS Of the total cohort (n=200), 140 (70%) were classified as Simple LLDN (left live donor kidney with single renal artery). The Complex LLDN group (n=60) contained all right-sided kidney (n=28) and left-sided kidneys with multiple renal arteries (n=32). Baseline characteristics, extraction time, conversion to open, length of admission, overall graft function and complication rates were similar between the simple and complex groups. The second warm ischaemic time in the Simple LLDN group was slightly shorter than the Complex LLDN group (32 versus 36 min P=0.016). The 1-month post-operative recipient serum creatinine level was lower in the Simple LLDN group when compared with the Complex LLDN group (117 versus 125 mol/L P=0.025). There was no difference in post op dialysis, acute rejection within 3 months or graft survival between the Simple and Complex LLDN groups.

Classical PID has been recognized as a disorder with loss of function of the immune system. Recent studies have unveiled disorders with immune dysfunction with autoimmunity, autoinflammation, allergy, or predisposition to malignancy. Some of them were caused by an augmented immune function or a defect in immune regulation. With this background, the term inborn errors of immunity (IEI) is now used to refer to PID in the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) classification. More than 400 responsible genes have been identified in patients with IEI so far, and importantly, many of them identified lately were caused by a heterologous mutation. Moreover, the onset is not necessarily in childhood, and we started seeing more and more IEI patients diagnosed in adulthood in the clinical settings. Recent advances in genetic analysis, including whole-exome analysis, whole-genome analysis, and RNA-seq have contributed to the identification of the disease-causing gene mutation. We also started to find heterogeneity of phenotype even in the patients with the same mutation in the same family, leading us to wonder if modifier gene or epigenetic modification is involved in the pathogenesis. In contrast, we accumulated many cases suggesting genetic heterogeneity is associated with phenotypic homogeneity. It has thus become difficult to deduce a responsible gene only from the phenotype in a certain type of IEI. Current curative therapy for IEI includes hematopoietic cell transplantation and gene therapy. Other curative therapeutic modalities have been long waited and are to be introduced in the future. These include a small molecule that inhibits the gain-of-function of the molecule- and genome-editing technology. Research on IEI will surely lead to a better understanding of other immune-related disorders including rheumatic diseases and atopic disorders.","output":"Inborn errors of immunityrecent advances in research on the pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Leprosy is a multi-system disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Whilst uncommon in the developed world, cases continue to rise in developing nations with up to 200,000 new cases reported annually. 1We report a case of lepromatous leprosy in a parturient residing in Scotland. Case Report: A 26-year-old primigravida presented in early pregnancy following a history of nosebleeds and widespread rash. The patient was a sickle-cell carrier but was otherwise well with no allergies. A diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy with erythema nodosum reaction was made and treatment commenced with prednisolone and combination therapy with rifampicin, clofazimine and dapsone. The pregnancy was complicated by anaemia and thrombocytopaenia with mild splenomegaly. Anaemia was thought to be secondary to Dapsone-related haemolysis, and thrombocytopaenia was thought most likely to be gestational. She developed neuropathic leg pain and hypoaesthesia but this resolved during the pregnancy. Renal and liver function remained normal and there were no symptoms or signs of autonomic dysfunction with normal postural blood pressure readings and normal ECG. After multi-disciplinary discussion, induction of labour was planned due to concerns over fetal growth. The patient was screened for SARS-CoV-2 and this was positive, though the patient remained asymptomatic. The patient was not considered to be infectious and standard infection control procedures were observed. Anaesthetic options for analgesia in labour and anaesthesia for potential operative delivery were discussed at several occasions during pregnancy and OAA Labour Pains translated information sheets were given to the patient. Following induction of labour, the patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery with no anaesthetic intervention required. Discussion: Leprosy is uncommon in developed nations but may occur in the UK as the population becomes more diverse. Leprosy raises many potential challenges for the anaesthetist including;cutaneous changes (which may be of particular significance if occurring over sites of intravenous access or lower lumbar region), neuropathies, myopathies, autonomic dysfunction, haematological derangements (including anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and agranulocytosis) and liver and renal impairment. Drug therapies for leprosy may in themselves be associated with blood dyscrasias, hepatitis, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathies. Anaesthetic management should be informed by the presence of any complications, most notable thrombocytopaenia or peripheral neuropathies. The possibility of autonomic dysfunction should be considered regardless of which anaesthetic modality is chosen and care taken to actively manage hypotension. The patients SARS-CoV-2 status was a further factor influencing the risk-benefit assessment of anaesthetic options in this case.","output":"P.137 A case of leprosy in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has affected all crucial aspects of daily life, including; food security, education, gender relation, mental health, and environmental air pollution, in addition to the impact of the lockdown that had far-reaching effects in different strata of life.

Compounds 13, 14, and 15a-c were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity on SARS-COV-2 (NRC-03-nhCoV) virus in Vero-E6 cells. Isopropyl triester 13 and triacid 14 demonstrated superior inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 compared to carboxamides 15a-c. MTT cytotoxicity assays showed that the CC(50) (50% cytotoxicity concentration) of 13, 14, and 15a-c ranged from 159.1 to 741.8 M and their safety indices ranged from 2.50 to 39.1. Study of the viral inhibition via different mechanisms of action (viral adsorption, replication, or virucidal property) showed that 14 had mild virucidal (60%) and inhibitory effects on virus adsorption (66%) at 20 M concentrations. Compound 13 displayed several inhibitory effects at three levels, but the potency of its action is primarily virucidal. The inhibitory activity of compounds 13, 14, and 15a-c against the enzyme SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) was evaluated. Isopropyl triester 13 had a significant inhibition activity against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with an IC(50) of 2.58 M. Large substituents on the macrocyclic template significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of the compounds. Study of the docking of the compounds in the SARS CoV-2-M(pro) active site showed that the most potent macrocycles 13 and 14 exhibited the best fit and highest affinity for the active site binding pocket.

In most cases, the bleeding will be self-limited, resolving after discontinuation of anticoagulation for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Occasionally, however, bleeding can be problematic, resulting in significant postoperative morbidity or even mortality. The purpose of the present study was to review cases of early postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding after gastric bypass to identify possible risk factors and examine outcomes. METHODS A prospective weight loss surgery patient database was reviewed to examine the cases occurring from January 2005 to July 2008. Patients with early postoperative bleeding were identified. The demographics and co-morbidities were compared between those with and without postoperative bleeding. The outcomes of interest included the transfusion requirement, postoperative morbidity, need for reoperation, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS A total of 776 patients had undergone gastric bypass during the study period. Of these, 26 (3.3%) were identified with early postoperative bleeding. No significant differences were found in the demographics between the patients with early postoperative bleed and those without. Of the patients with early postoperative bleeding, the most common presenting sign or symptom was tachycardia (46%) followed by melena (32%) and hematemesis (18%). The transfusion requirement range was 0-11 U (average 3.2 U/patient). Of the 26 patients, 4 (15%) required intensive care unit admission and 8 (31%) required reoperation. Four gastrointestinal leaks, one stomal ulceration, and one gastrogastric fistula were identified in the early postoperative bleeding group. One patient (3.8%) in the early postoperative bleeding group died. Compared with nonbleeding patients, those with early postoperative bleeding had a significantly longer hospital stay (4.8 versus 3, P <.0001) and greater mortality rate (7.1% versus .9%, P <.01). CONCLUSION Postoperative bleeding is a significant complication after gastric bypass surgery. Although in many cases, the bleeding will be self-limited, it can result in additional notable complications. In the present study, postoperative bleeding contributed to significantly longer hospital stays and resulted in 1 death. A patient with bleeding after gastric bypass should raise due concern, with attention to the potential attendant complications.","output":"Gastrointestinal bleeding after gastric bypass surgery: nuisance or catastrophe?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Many exceptional researchers, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) face structural disadvantages in applying for research grants. Public engagement and crowdfunding make it possible for researchers to directly seek support from the public, by engaging large groups of people who make small contributions to support a project. This manuscript synthesizes global qualitative evidence and describes a WHO-TDR public engagement and crowdfunding pilot programme. Methods: We searched six databases for primary qualitative and mixed-methods research. We used a thematic synthesis approach and assessed our findings using the GRADE-CERQual approach. A crowdfunding approach to finance research studies was tested through a pilot programme, with a focus on infectious diseases of poverty. TDR Global mentors provided support for five finalists to engage the public and develop crowdfunding campaigns. Results: Nine studies were included in the qualitative evidence synthesis. Themes were developed into seven key findings, including the need for extensive public engagement, the potential for crowdfunding to open a communication channel between researchers and the public, key correlates of crowdfunding success and the risks of crowdfunding health research with associated mitigation strategies. The TDR pilot programme received 121 entries from 37 countries. Five LMIC-based researchers received training and joined a working group.

Cultures of assessment also shape identities, social relations, and the knowledge and behavior recognized as legitimate by a profession. Therefore, the combination of technology and assessment within medical education is worthy of review. Online proctoring services have become more prevalent during the Covid-19 pandemic, as a means of continuing high-stakes invigilated examinations online. With criticisms about increased surveillance, discrimination, and the outsourcing of control to commercial vendors, is this simply \\"moving exams online\\", or are there more serious implications? What can this extreme example tell us about how our technologies of assessment influence relationships between trainees and medical education institutions? EVIDENCE: We combine postdigital and postphenomenology approaches to analyze the written component of the 2020 online proctored United Kingdom Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) membership exam. We examine the scripts, norms, and trust relations produced through this example of online proctoring, and then locate them in historical and economic contexts. We find that the proctoring service projects a false objectivity that is undermined by the tight script with which examinees must comply in an intensified norm of surveillance, and by the interpretation of digital data by unseen human proctors. Nonetheless, such proctoring services are promoted by an image of data-driven innovation, a rhetoric of necessity in response to a growing problem of online cheating, and an aversion, within medical education institutions, to changing assessment formats (and thus the need to accept different forms of knowledge as legitimate). IMPLICATIONS: The use of online proctoring technology by medical education institutions intensifies established norms, already present within examinations, of surveillance and distrust. Moreover, it exacerbates tensions between conflicting agendas of commercialization, accountability, and the education of trustworthy professionals. Our analysis provides an example of why it is important to stop and consider the holistic implications of introducing technological \\"solutions\\", and to interrogate the intersection of technology and assessment practices in relation to the wider goals of medical education.","output":"A Matter of Trust: Online Proctored Exams and the Integration of Technologies of Assessment in Medical Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.","output":"How can airborne transmission of COVID-19 indoors be minimised?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly infectious and pathogenic.

It has a varied presentation ranging from common fever to atypical presentation as encephalitis. This study aimed to analyze the demographic and clinical profile of dengue patients admitted to a tertiary care center in Tamilnadu. Methodology This retrospective study was performed by collecting patient data from the medical records department for the years 2012 to 2014. A total of 150 patients with 50 patients from each year were selected. The patient's demographic data, clinical profile, management, and outcome were noted. Patients were divided into three groups as per the World Health Organization's 2009 classification. Results Most dengue cases occurred from October to December (70.7%). The number of male and female patients was almost equal (77 [51.3%] and 73 [48.7%], respectively). The middle-aged group (21-40 years) was commonly affected (54%). The mean age was 29  13.20 years. Fever was the most common symptom (100%), followed by lethargy (81.3%) and myalgia (60.7%). Overall, 10% of patients had comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. Moreover, 22.7% of patients had dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue was seen in 19.3% of patients. A significant difference was noted in the total count, comorbidities, serositis, and the duration of hospitalization between the groups. No mortality was recorded in the study population. Conclusions Dengue is very common in the middle-aged group. Patients with severe dengue had significant leucopenia, several comorbidities, and serositis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity ratio and distribution of viral loads within a cohort of asymptomatic patients screened prior hospitalization or surgery, stratified by age category. MATERIALS/METHODS: We retrospectively studied data on SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR detection in respiratory tract samples of asymptomatic patients screened pre-hospitalization or pre-surgery in nine Belgian hospitals located in Flanders over a 12-month period (1 April 2020C31 March 2021). RESULTS: In total, 255925 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and 2421 positive results for which a viral load was reported, were included in this study. An unweighted overall SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR positivity ratio of 1.27% was observed with strong spatiotemporal differences. SARS-CoV-2 circulated predominantly in 80+ year old individuals across all time periods except between the first and second COVID-19 wave and in 20C30 year old individuals before the second COVID-19 wave. In contrast to the first wave, a significantly higher positivity ratio was observed for the 20C40 age group in addition to the 80+ age group compared to the other age groups during the second wave. The median viral load follows a similar temporal evolution as the positivity rate with an increase ahead of the second wave and highest viral loads observed for 80+ year old individuals. CONCLUSION: There was a high SARS-CoV-2 circulation among asymptomatic patients with a predominance and highest viral loads observed in the elderly.

In anticipation of subsequent waves, reliable prediction of disease severity is essential for critical care capacity management and may enable earlier targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this study is to develop and externally validate a prognostic model/clinical tool for predicting COVID-19 critical disease at presentation to medical care. Methods: This is a retrospective study of a prognostic model for the prediction of COVID-19 critical disease where critical disease was defined as ICU admission, ventilation, and/or death. The derivation cohort was used to develop a multivariable logistic regression model. Covariates included patient comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and laboratory values. Model performance was assessed on the validation cohort by concordance statistics. The model was developed with consecutive patients with COVID-19 who presented to University of California Irvine Medical Center in Orange County, California. External validation was performed with a random sample of patients with COVID-19 at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia. Results: Of a total 3208 patients tested in the derivation cohort, 9% (299/3028) were positive for COVID-19. Clinical data including past medical history and presenting laboratory values were available for 29% (87/299) of patients (median age, 48 years [range, 21-88 years]; 64% [36/55] male). The most common comorbidities included obesity (37%, 31/87), hypertension (37%, 32/87), and diabetes (24%, 24/87). Critical disease was present in 24% (21/87). After backward stepwise selection, the following factors were associated with greatest increased risk of critical disease: number of comorbidities, body mass index, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, % lymphocytes, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin I, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27-88 years]; 55% [22/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26/40). Model discrimination in the validation cohort was high (concordance statistic: 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.01). A web-based tool was developed to enable clinicians to input patient data and view likelihood of critical disease. Conclusions and Relevance: We present a model which accurately predicted COVID-19 critical disease risk using comorbidities and presenting vital signs and laboratory values, on derivation and validation cohorts from two different institutions.

Indeed, the first step in viral entry is the binding of the viral trimeric spike protein to ACE2. Abundantly present in human epithelial cells of many organs, ACE2 is also expressed in the human brain. ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular 44-residues segment. This C-terminal segment contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) targeting protein interacting domains called PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ). Here, we identified the human PDZ specificity profile of the ACE2 PBM using the high throughput holdup assay and measuring the binding intensities of the PBM of ACE2 against the full human PDZome. We discovered 14 human PDZ binders of ACE2 showing significant binding with dissociation constants values ranging from 3 to 81 M. NHERF, SHANK, and SNX27 proteins found in this study are involved in protein trafficking. The PDZ/PBM interactions with ACE2 could play a role on ACE2 internalization and recycling that could benefit for the virus entry. Interestingly, most of the ACE2 partners we identified are expressed in neuronal cells, such as SHANK and MAST families, and modifications of the interactions between ACE2 and these neuronal proteins may be involved in neurological symptoms of COVID-19.","output":"PDZ-containing proteins targeted by the ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Our understanding of how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted decision-making for women planning to conceive is unclear.

Methods: An online questionnaire of closed- and open-ended questions was utilized to capture pregnancy planning behaviors and reported behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in women planning pregnancy between January and July 2020. Closed-ended questions were analyzed quantitatively, and thematic framework analysis was utilized for open-ended responses. Results: A total of 504 questionnaires were included for analysis. The majority of respondents lived in the United Kingdom. Ninety-two percent of the women were still planning a pregnancy but over half (n = 267) reported that COVID-19 had affected their plans, with 72% of these (n = 189) deliberately postponing pregnancy. Concerns were predominantly over changes in antenatal care, but also fear of adverse effects of the virus on mother and baby. From the thematic analysis (n = 37), lack of services to remove contraceptive devices and provide fertility treatment were also cited. In contrast, 27% (n = 71) reported bringing their pregnancy plans forward; common themes included recalibration of priorities and cancelled or changed plans. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic influenced pregnancy-planning behaviors with many women reporting postponement of pregnancy.

Herein, we further explore the potential signaling cascades associated with this anti-TGEV activity in ST cells. Ouabain, a representative cardenolide, was found to potently diminish TGEV titers and inhibit the TGEV-induced production of IL-6 in a dose dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 37 nM and 23 nM respectively. By pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing, we demonstrated that PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling was induced in TGEV-infected ST cells, and ouabain imparted a degree of anti-TGEV activity via further augmentation of this existing PI3K_PDK1 axis signaling, in a manner dependent upon its association with the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Finally, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or PDK1 by BX795 antagonized the anti-viral activity of ouabain and restored the TGEV virus titer and yields.

Acute respiratory failure (n = 154) and septic shock (n = 54) were their most frequent causes of ICU admission. Septic shock occurred in 170 patients (77%) and mechanical ventilation was required in 186 patients (84%); renal replacement therapy was initiated in 70 patients (32%). Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 101 patients. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 39.7%. Although antibiotherapy was adequate in 92.3% of cases, hospital mortality reached 28.8%. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were age (OR 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02-1.08)), male sex (OR 2.83 (95% CI: 1.16-6.91)) and renal replacement therapy (OR 3.78 (95% CI: 1.71-8.36)). Co-morbidities, macrolide administration, concomitant bacteremia or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU, mortality of pneumococcal CAP remains high despite adequate antimicrobial treatment. Baseline demographic data and renal replacement therapy have a major impact on adverse outcome.","output":"Epidemiology and outcome of severe pneumococcal pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit: a multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Delivering physical and behavioral health services in a single setting is associated with improved quality of care and reduced health care costs. Few health systems implementing integrated care develop conceptual models and targeted measurement strategies a priori with an eye toward adoption, implementation, sustainment, and evaluation. This is a broad challenge in the field, which can make it difficult to disentangle why implementation is or is not successful. Method This paper discusses strategic implementation and evaluation planning for a pediatric integrated care program in a large health system. Our team developed a logic model, which defines resources and community characteristics, program components, evaluation activities, short-term activities, and intermediate and anticipated long-term patient-, clinician-, and practice-related outcomes. The model was designed based on research and stakeholder input to support strategic implementation and evaluation of the program. For each aspect of the logic model, a measurement battery was selected. Initial implementation data and intermediate outcomes from a pilot in five practices in a 30-practice pediatric primary care network are presented to illustrate how the logic model and evaluation plan have been used to guide the iterative process of program development. Results A total of 4,619 office visits were completed during the two years of the pilot. Primary care clinicians were highly satisfied with the integrated primary care program and provided feedback on ways to further improve the program. Members of the primary care team and behavioral health providers rated the program as being relatively well integrated into the practices after the second year of the pilot. Conclusions This logic model and evaluation plan provide a template for future projects integrating behavioral health services in non-specialty mental health settings, including pediatric primary care, and can be used broadly to provide structure to implementation and evaluation activities and promote replication of effective initiatives.","output":"Strategic Implementation Planning for Integrated Behavioral Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main contribution of this article is to report general statistics about COVID-19 in Brazil, based on analysis of accumulated series of confirmed cases, deaths and lethality rates, in addition to presenting graphs of moving averages for states and municipalities.

By about 2010, however, the opioid crisis, featuring unprecedented use and public health burden, had accelerated into full force in North America, largely muting attention to the psycho-stimulant issue until recently. Recent surveillance data on drug use and related mortality/morbidity from the present decade has documented a marked resurgence of psycho-stimulant use and harms especially in at-risk populations, commonly in direct combination with opioids, across North America, resulting in a twin epidemic comprised of opioids and psycho-stimulants We briefly review select epidemiological data indicators for these developments from the United States and Canada; in the latter jurisdiction, related evidence has been less prevalent and systematic but corroborating the same trends. Evidently, the (widely ongoing) focus on the opioid epidemic as a mono-type drug problem has become an anachronism that requires urgent and appropriate correction. We then briefly consider existing, evidence-based options for C prevention and treatment C interventions targeting psycho-stimulant use and harms, which are substantially more limited and/or less efficacious than those available for problematic opioid use, while presenting major gaps and challenges. The observed resurgence of psycho-stimulants may, indirectly, relate to recent efforts towards curtailing (medical) opioid availability, thereby accelerating demand and supply for both illicit opioids and psycho-stimulants. The presently unfolding twin epidemic of opioids and psycho-stimulants, combined with limited intervention resources, presents an acute challenge for public health and may crucially undermine actively extensive efforts to reduce opioid-related health harms in North America.","output":"Resurgent, twin or silent epidemic?

Yet, whether and how the immunological changes brought about by HIV will affect the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 acute infection and impact the effectiveness of vaccines remain unclear. We discuss the intersection of COVID-19 in HIV-infected individuals. RECENT FINDINGS: People living with HIV (PLWH) may be at increased risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 mediated disease complication due to functional impairment of the immune system and persistent inflammation, which can be ameliorated by antiretroviral therapy. Importantly, limited data suggest that current approved vaccines may be safe and efficacious in PLWH.

Methods: A comprehensive search was undertaken from April 2020 to 22nd January 2021 using multiple electronic databases. A systematic review protocol was developed and published on PROSPERO registration; CRD42020181481. A random-effects model was used to compute pooled estimates of anxiety, depression, PTSD, insomnia and suicidal thoughts. Findings: Our search yielded 11,295 studies and of those 287 met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of 206 studies revealed minimal differences in prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among HCPs compared with the public during the pandemic but higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts/ideation or self-harm (11% vs 5.8%) and lower prevalence of wellbeing (28.2% vs 52.6%) among the public compared to HCPs. Interpretation: The pandemic has led to a high mental health burden especially amongst HCPs and higher suicidal ideation and lower wellbeing in general public which warrants further investigation and management globally.

Common mental disorders have multifaceted implications on maternal and fetal health outcomes during pregnancy with long-running economic and social sequels. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of common mental disorder and associated factors among pregnant mothers in eastern Ethiopia, Kersa and Haramaya Health, and Demographic surveillance sites. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Kersa and Haramaya health and demographic surveillance sites from January 30 to April 30, 2021. World Health Organization Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to measure common mental disorder among 1,015 randomly selected pregnant women. Data were collected face-to-face using open data kit software. Logistic regression was fitted to identify factors associated with common mental disorders. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of common mental disorders (SRQ > 6) among pregnant women was 37.5% (95% CI: 34.5, 40.5). Current substance use (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.37, 2.88), intimate partner violence (AOR = 2.67, 95% CI 2.02, 3.53), null parity (AOR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.65, 5.84), gestational age [first trimester (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.01, 4.93) and third trimester (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.31, 2.31)], history of abortion (AOR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.27, 3.24), and absence of antenatal care follow-up (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.08, 1.89) were significantly associated with common mental disorder during pregnancy.

PURPOSE To assess the feasibility of three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (3D CBCT) fusion imaging with \\"virtual probe\\" positioning, to predict ablation volume in lung tumors treated percutaneously. MATERIAL AND METHODS Pre-procedural computed tomography contrast-enhanced scans (CECT) were merged with a CBCT volume obtained to plan the ablation. An offline tumor segmentation was performed to determine the number of antennae and their positioning within the tumor. The volume of ablation obtained, evaluated on CECT performed after 1 month, was compared with the pre-procedural predicted one. Feasibility was assessed on the basis of accuracy evaluation (visual evaluation [VE] and quantitative evaluation [QE]), technical success (TS), and technical effectiveness (TE). RESULTS Seven of the patients with lung tumor treated by percutaneous thermal ablation were selected and treated on the basis of the 3D CBCT fusion imaging. In all cases the volume of ablation predicted was in accordance with that obtained. The difference in volume between predicted ablation volumes and obtained ones on CECT at 1 month was 1.8 cm(3) (SD  2, min. 0.4, max. 0.9) for MW and 0.9 cm(3) (SD  1.1, min. 0.1, max. 0.7) for RF.

Although antihypertensive drugs are widely available, in many patients blood pressure control to guideline-recommended target values is not achieved. Several device-based approaches have been introduced to lower blood pressure; most of these strategies aim to modulate autonomic nervous system activity. Clinical trials have moved from including patients with resistant hypertension receiving intensive pharmacological treatment to including patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in the presence or absence of antihypertensive medications. Renal sympathetic denervation is the most extensively investigated device-based therapy for hypertension, and randomized, sham-controlled trials have provided proof-of-principle data for its blood pressure-lowering efficacy. Unilateral electrical baroreflex activation, endovascular baroreflex amplification and pacemaker-mediated cardiac neuromodulation therapy have yielded promising results in observational trials, which need to be confirmed in larger, adequately powered, sham-controlled trials. Until further evidence becomes available, device-based therapy for hypertension should not be considered for routine treatment. However, when considering a device-based treatment for hypertension, the underlying pathophysiology in each patient has to be taken into consideration, and the procedural risks weighed against the cardiovascular risk attributable to the elevated blood pressure.

However, daratumumab is a costly treatment and is administered indefinitely until disease progression. Therefore, it is unclear whether it is cost-effective to use daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with reserving its use until later lines of therapy. METHODS: We created a Markov model to compare healthcare costs and clinical outcomes of transplant-ineligible patients treated with daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with a strategy of reserving daratumumab until the second-line. We estimated transition probabilities from randomized trials using parametric survival modeling. Lifetime direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for first-line daratumumab versus second-line daratumumab from a US payer perspective. RESULTS: First-line daratumumab was associated with an improvement of 0.52 QALYs and 0.66 discounted life-years compared with second-line daratumumab. While both treatment strategies were associated with considerable lifetime expenditures ($1,434,937 v $1,112,101 in US dollars), an incremental cost of $322,836 for first-line daratumumab led to an ICER of $618,018 per QALY. The cost of daratumumab would need to be decreased by 67% for first-line daratumumab to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Using daratumumab in the first-line setting for transplant-ineligible patients may not be cost-effective under current pricing. Delaying daratumumab until subsequent lines of therapy may be a reasonable strategy to limit healthcare costs without significantly compromising clinical outcomes.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using a deidentified COVID-19 registry abstracted from the electronic health record at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, the only academic institution in the state encompassing the main university hospitals and ambulatory sites statewide. Children aged 18 years or younger who underwent RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between 11 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were included in the study. The primary outcome of interest was positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, and the primary exposure of interest was race/ethnicity.

Local anaesthetic medical thoracoscopy (LAT) is a well-established diagnostic, therapeutic and preventative procedure in undiagnosed pleural effusions. Patients were traditionally admitted for a mean of 3.4 days and had a large bore drain inserted post LAT and pleurodesis was performed. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to provide day case LAT with IPC placement without pleurodesis to minise transmission risk. We thus describe our local experience. LAT is performed in theatre under conscious sedation. Methods: All the notes of patients requiring day case LAT between July 2020-Dec 2020 were analysed. Basic demographics were collected as well as diagnoses and what interventions were performed. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed. Results: 13 patients underwent day case LAT. All had negative preoperative Covid-19 swabs. Mean age was 69.7 years (range 24C82). 10 were male and 3 female. Definite diagnoses included 5 lung cancers, 4 mesotheliomas and 2 fibrinous pleuritis. The lung did not deflate, not allowing for biopsies in 2 patients. Non-malignant diagnoses are currently presumed. 10 IPCs and 1 large bore drain were inserted due to 1 immedidate complication (surgical emphysema). 1 patient developed an empyema within 30days. 8 out of the 10 IPCs have already been removed due to pleurodesis occuring (mean number of days 27.5, range 16C72). All patients were discharged on the same day except 1 patient who required a large bore drain and stayed overnight. Conclusions: We have thus transformed our service after more than a decade of providing LAT as an inpatient service. This is a small cohort of patients but proves the feasibility and safety of day case LAT with massive reduction in inpatient stay.

At the same time, dengue outbreaks were occurring in two of the Federated States of Micronesia's other three states. The cause of AFI was suspected to be dengue; however, by the end of October, only one of 39 samples was positive for dengue. The objective of the investigation was to establish the cause of the outbreak. METHODS A line list was created and data analysed by time, place, person and clinical features. Reported symptoms were compared with the published symptoms of several diagnoses and laboratory testing undertaken. RESULTS Of the 168 suspected cases, 62% were less than 20 years of age and 60% were male. The clinical features of the cases were not typical for dengue but suggestive of respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were subsequently collected and found to be positive for influenza. Public health measures were undertaken and the AFI returned to expected levels. DISCUSSION Clinical diagnosis of acute febrile illness (AFI) can often be difficult and misleading. This can mean that opportunities for preventive measures early on in an outbreak are missed.

A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in a real-world setting is needed. OBJECTIVE: To assess the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of the BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection 13 to 24 days after immunization in a real-world setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study used data from a 2.6 million-member state-mandated health care system in Israel. Participants included all individuals aged 16 years and older who received 1 dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 19, 2020, and January 15, 2021. Data were analyzed in March 2021. EXPOSURE: Receipt of 1 dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Information was collected regarding medical history and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test and COVID-19 symptoms from 1 day after first vaccine to January 17, 2021. Daily and cumulative infection rates in days 13 to 24 were compared with days 1 to 12 after the first dose using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models. RESULTS: Data for 503 875 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.7 [14.7] years; 263 228 [52.4%] women) were analyzed, of whom 351 897 had follow-up data for days 13 to 24. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2484 individuals (0.57%) during days 1 through 12 and 614 individuals (0.27%) in days 13 through 24. The weighted mean (SE) daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in days 1 through 12 was 43.41 (12.07) infections per 100 000 population and 21.08 (6.16) infections per 100 000 population in days 13 through 24, a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 51.4% (95% CI, 16.3%-71.8%). The decrease in incidence was evident from day 18 after the first dose.

As vaccination programs roll out globally and social distancing is relaxed, future SARS-CoV-2 trends are uncertain. Methods We analysed prevalence trends and their drivers using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab-positivity data from round 12 (between 20 May and 7 June 2021) and round 13 (between 24 June and 12 July 2021) of the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, with swabs sent to non-overlapping random samples of the population ages 5 years and over in England. Results We observed sustained exponential growth with an average doubling time in round 13 of 25 days (lower Credible Interval of 15 days) and an increase in average prevalence from 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%) in round 12 to 0.63% (0.57%, 0.18%) in round 13. The rapid growth across and within rounds appears to have been driven by complete replacement of Alpha variant by Delta, and by the high prevalence in younger less-vaccinated age groups, with a nine-fold increase between rounds 12 and 13 among those aged 13 to 17 years. Prevalence among those who reported being unvaccinated was three-fold higher than those who reported being fully vaccinated. However, in round 13, 44% of infections occurred in fully vaccinated individuals, reflecting imperfect vaccine effectiveness against infection despite high overall levels of vaccination. Using self-reported vaccination status, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection in round 13 of 49% (22%, 67%) among participants aged 18 to 64 years, which rose to 58% (33%, 73%) when considering only strong positives (Cycle threshold [Ct] values < 27); also, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of 59% (23%, 78%), with any one of three common COVID-19 symptoms reported in the month prior to swabbing. Sex (round 13 only), ethnicity, household size and local levels of deprivation jointly contributed to the risk of higher prevalence of swab-positivity. Discussion From end May to beginning July 2021 in England, where there has been a highly successful vaccination campaign with high vaccine uptake, infections were increasing exponentially driven by the Delta variant and high infection prevalence among younger, unvaccinated individuals despite double vaccination continuing to effectively reduce transmission. Although slower growth or declining prevalence may be observed during the summer in the northern hemisphere, increased mixing during the autumn in the presence of the Delta variant may lead to renewed growth, even at high levels of vaccination.","output":"Exponential growth, high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine effectiveness associated with Delta variant in England during May to July 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work reports cation distribution, magnetic, structural, and morphological studies of rare-earth Pr doped cobalt ferrite nanoparticles CoFe2-xPrxO4 (x=0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 at. %) fabricated by sol-gel auto-combustion method. X-ray diffraction analysis, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED), and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscopy were utilized to study the structural and morphological characteristics of the prepared samples.

Cation distribution was inferred from the XRD patterns using MAUD program. FESEM analysis revealed the spherical-shaped particles with dimensions close to the data extracted from XRD analysis and HRTEM images confirmed it. FTIR measurements revealed the presence of two prominent stretching vibrational modes confirming the successful formation of ferrite spinel structure. Magnetic properties of the nanoparticles were measured at two different temperatures 300 K and 10 K. For the low temperature of 10 K a high sensitive measurement method as Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometry was used and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) recorded the magnetic data at 300 K. Comparison of the magnetic results exhibited a significant enhancement with temperature drop due to the reduction in thermal fluctuations. Paramagnetic nature of rare-earth ions may be the main reason for MS decrement from 76 emu/g (x=0.0) to 60 emu/g (x=0.02) at 300 K.

People infected with SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit no or mild non-specific symptoms; thus, they may contribute to silent circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool samples, monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in waste water (WW) has been proposed as a complementary tool to investigate virus circulation in human populations.AimTo test if the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in WW correlates with the number of symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers.MethodWe performed a time-course quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw WW samples collected from several major WW treatment plants in Greater Paris. The study period was 5 March to 23 April 2020, including the lockdown period in France (from 17 March).ResultsWe showed that the increase of genome units in raw WW accurately followed the increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genome could be detected before the epidemic grew massively (around 8 March). Equally importantly, a marked decrease in the quantities of genome units was observed concomitantly with the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases, 29 days following the lockdown.ConclusionThis work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in WW could generate important additional information for improved monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 circulation at local or regional levels and emphasises the role of WW-based epidemiology.","output":"Evaluation of lockdown effect on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics through viral genome quantification in waste water, Greater Paris, France, 5 March to 23 April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the information stream has overflowed with accurate information, misinformation, and constantly changing guidelines.

Oncological patients are the most affected populations since these days. Because of decreasing numbers in surgery and endoscopy, gastric cancer patients had difficulties in treatment and diagnoses. Therefore, the early and long-term results may be affected during the pandemic. In this study, we aimed to evaluate pandemia effects on gastric cancer surgery in a single center. PATIENTS-METHODS: Patients were categorized as the COVID group and the Pre-COVID group. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study. In the COVID period, 50 patients underwent gastric cancer surgery, while 64 were operated on in the pre-COVID period. Patients demographics and clinical and pathological outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in both periods among patient characteristics such as age, gender, and body mass index. Pre-operative laboratory results were similar between two groups. Although there was no difference in operation types, an increase was detected in Clavien-Dindo grade 3 and higher complications during the COVID period. During the pandemic, there was a significant difference in the pathological outcomes. Peritoneal cytology-positive patients were h?gher in the COVID group. More lymphovascular invasions were also detected in the COVID period. Finally, it resulted stage differences between two groups.

Factors associated with NAb titers were analyzed using Ordinary Least Squares regression model. The median age of the study participants was 37 years (IQR, 30.0-54.5) and 55.1% (27/49) of which were male. The median time to blood collection (for NAb analysis) from illness onset, viral clearance and discharge were 43.0 days (IQR, 36.0-50.0), 27.0 days (IQR, 20.5-37) and 17.0 days (IQR, 15.0-33.0), respectively. Patients had a median NAb titer of 1: 40 (IQR, 1:15-1:120). NAbs were not detected in two asymptomatic children who quickly cleared the virus.

Adverse events such as fever and decreased oxygen saturation, which are often seen after REGN-COV2 administration, are generally transient, but predicting these events is useful in developing a monitoring plan for patients. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 76 patients who received REGN-CoV2 between August and September 2021. The clinical course of the patients' fever and oxygen administration was collected from their medical records, and the patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of these adverse events, and the underlying pathology and blood sampling data were compared. Parameters that showed significant differences were further examined by Fisher's exact probability test to see if the use of appropriate thresholds would significantly correlate with the occurrence of adverse events. Findings Of the 76 patients, 47 had fever of 38.5{degrees}C or higher within 24 hours after administration, and 27 of these patients had a body temperature of 37.5{degrees}C or lower before administration. Oxygen was required in 14 cases, 5 of which required oxygen more than 24 hours after administration of REGN-COV2, and additional treatment such as dexamethasone was given as a transition to moderate disease. Among the parameters analyzed, except for fever before administration, lymphocyte count and IFN{lambda}3 showed significant differences between the fever and non-fever groups. There was also a significant difference in ferritin and CRP between the oxygen required and non-required groups. This was also the case in the comparison excluding patients who had fever before administration. In addition to IFN{lambda}3, ferritin, and CRP, there was a significant difference in LDH between the group that required additional treatment and the group that did not. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the prediction threshold for fever and non-fever groups. The sensitivity and specificity were 55% and 79%, respectively with odds ratio 4.746 (95% CI: 1.666 to 14.12) when lymphocytes counts <950/L was used (p=0.004).

In addition, it aims to explore the value of social cognitive theory (SCT) in explaining these experiences. DESIGN Exploratory, deductive approach. METHODS Qualitative, audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted from eight women who were members of a private Facebook group'. Data were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis, and SCT was used as a theoretical lens through which the data were interrogated. RESULTS A number of themes were identified from the women's experiences, with analysis uncovering the superordinate theme 'increased self-efficacy' which provided an understanding of how the group impacted women's experiences and aided them in breastfeeding success. The sub-themes of education, accessibility, online community, normalization, and extended goals provided a more detailed understanding of how self-efficacy was increased through group membership. CONCLUSION The symbiotic relationship between members of a social media group facilitates greater breastfeeding success and a longer duration of breastfeeding through the central concept of the SCT: reciprocal determinism. Therefore, it is posited that the SCT is a suitable theory of behaviour change which can potentially be used to develop interventions aiming to increase breastfeeding rates and duration.","output":"Women's experience of social media breastfeeding support and its impact on extended breastfeeding success: A social cognitive perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to compare the utility and efficacy of the LigaSure system and standard surgical clips for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The medical records of 473 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between May 2011 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. The patients were divided into the LigaSure (n = 125) and Hem-o-lok (n = 348) groups, based on the device used to ligate the vascular pedicle. Owing to differences in the patient characteristics, a 1:2 propensity score matching was performed. In the final matched cohort, 375 patients were included for analysis. The median initial prostate-specific antigen level was not significantly different between the two groups. The median surgical and console times were significantly shorter for the LigaSure group than for the Hem-o-lok group (p < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). The number of specimens with positive surgical margins was significantly lower in the LigaSure group than in the Hem-o-lok group (24.8 vs 40.8%, p = 0.002). The number of specimens with positive surgical margins for pathological stage T2 cases was also significantly lower in the LigaSure group than in the Hem-o-lok group (17.0 vs 37.5%, p < 0.001). However, non-focal positive surgical margins and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates at 1 year postoperatively were not significantly different (11.2 vs 18.4%, p = 0.075 and 91.2 vs 92.8%, p = 0.565, respectively). The LigaSure system was associated with fewer positive surgical margins and shorter operation time, indicating that it could be a useful alternative to Hem-o-lok clips for controlling the prostatic pedicle in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, despite its high costs.","output":"LigaSure versus the standard technique (Hem-o-lok clips) for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a propensity score-matched study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is known that research into human genes is heavily skewed towards genes that have been widely studied for decades, including many genes that were being studied before the productive phase of the Human Genome Project.

After several analyses, in January 2020, the World Health Organization temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It is found that 2019-nCoV is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients and it is found to be transmitted through the saliva and the fecoCoral routes since its spread is through potential person-to-person transmission route which is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet/contact in nature. Dental surgeons are at tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to aerosols, saliva, blood, and other body fluids and the handling of sharp instruments and also may encounter patients with suspected or confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and will have to act diligently not only to provide care but also at the same time prevent nosocomial spread of infection. The significance of this review is that oral health providers must be aware and be prepared to tackle any imminent infectious diseases like the present coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, which can be life threatening to susceptible patients. This review provides a brief outline of the epidemiology, symptoms, mode of transmission, specific recommendations for dental practice that are suggested for patient screening, infection control strategies to block the person-to-person transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals, and patient management protocol since there are certain chances of encountering oral emergencies such as acute pulpitis, periapical periodontitis, abscess, dental trauma, children's oral emergencies, and oro-maxillofacial infections during this period.

Its stabilizing effect in dark skin has been debatable. However, randomized controlled trials regarding NB-UVB ability to control disease activity are lacking. PURPOSE To assess stabilizing effect of NB-UVB in comparison to systemic corticosteroids, the mainstay in vitiligo stabilization, in skin photo-types (III-V). METHODS This is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective study. Eighty patients with active non-segmental vitiligo (NSV) (Vitiligo disease activity (VIDA) 2) were randomized to either NB-UVB and placebo (NB-placebo) or NB-UVB and dexamethasone OMP therapy (NB-OMP) for 6 months. Sixty four patients completed the study, 34 in the NB-OMP group and 30 in the NB-placebo group. Patients were evaluated fortnightly according to presence or absence of symptoms/ signs of activity. RESULTS In spite of earlier control of disease activity observed in the NB-OMP group, it was comparable in both groups by the end of the study period. Disease activity prior to therapy, but not extent, was found to influence control of activity in both groups. Thus, NB-UVB is a safe sole therapeutic tool in vitiligo management. Not only does it efficiently achieve repigmentation, but also it is a comparable stabilizing tool to systemic corticosteroids in spite of slightly delayed control. CONCLUSION NB-UVB is the only well-established vitiligo therapy that can be used solely whenever corticosteroids are contraindicated or immune-suppression is unjustified. Nonetheless, its combination with corticosteroids expedites response and improves compliance.","output":"Efficacy of Narrow Band UVB with or without OMP in Stabilization of Vitiligo activity in skin photo-types (III -V): A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicenter study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Gross deformity of the foot in Charcot neuroarthropathy can lead to collapse and subsequent ulceration, infection, amputation, or premature death. This study evaluated healing of midfoot ulcerations of Charcot neuroarthropathy using PriMatrix, a novel acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix. METHODS In this retrospective analysis, 20 patients with ulcerations of the midfoot associated with Charcot neuroarthropathy were treated with either PriMatrix in addition to standard wound care (PriMatrix group,n = 12) or standard wound care alone (control group, n = 8). All patients had chronic, nonhealing foot ulcerations of at least 2250 mm(3) for a minimum of 30 days duration. All foot ulcerations were full thickness with subcutaneous involvement. Ankle brachial index 0.90 and/or transcutaneous oximetry (TcPo(2)) 40 mm Hg at the periulcer site was necessary for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had acute or chronic osteomyelitis of the foot. RESULTS Demography, risk factors, baseline severity of Charcot neuroarthropathy, and wound volume (control 4078 mm(3), PriMatrix 3737.5 mm(3), P = nonsignificant) were similar between treatment groups. Mean time to healing in the PriMatrix group (116 days, 95% CI = 109-123) was significantly shorter than in the control group (180 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 171-188); P < .0001. A significantly faster rate of healing was observed with PriMatrix (87.9 mm(3)/wk, 95% CI = 115.2% to 60.6%) compared with control (59.0 mm(3)/wk, 95% CI = 72.8% to 45.3%); P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS The significantly faster rate of healing and steeper slope of volume reduction in the PriMatrix group warrants further investigation into its effects on healing of neuropathic ulcerations and potential limb salvage.","output":"Acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix for treatment of chronic ulcerations of the midfoot associated with Charcot neuroarthropathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cover legend: Kelley et al.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of high-flow nasal cannula for COVID-19 on population-level mortality and ventilator availability. METHODS: We constructed dynamical (deterministic) simulation models of high-flow nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation use for COVID-19 in the U.S. Model parameters were estimated through consensus based on published literature, local data, and experience. We had two outcomes: (1) cumulative number of deaths and (2) days without any available ventilators. We assessed the impact of various policies for use of high-flow nasal cannula (with or without \\"early intubation\\") versus a scenario where high-flow was unavailable. RESULTS: The policy associated with the fewest deaths and the least time without available ventilators combined the use of high-flow nasal cannula for patients not urgently needing ventilators with the use of early mechanical ventilation for these patients when at least 10% ventilator supply was not in use. At the national level, this strategy resulted in 10,000 - 40,000 fewer deaths than if high-flow nasal cannula were not available. Additionally, with moderate national ventilator capacity (30,000-45,000 ventilators), this strategy led to up to 25 (11.8%) fewer days without available ventilators. For a 250-bed hospital with 100 mechanical ventilators, the availability of 13, 20, or 33 high-flow nasal cannulas prevented 81, 102, and 130 deaths, respectively.

During the first wave of the pandemic, Italy, and especially its Northern regions around the Po Valley, faced severe consequences in terms of infected individuals and casualties (more than 31,000 deaths and 255,000 infected people by mid-May 2020). While the spread and effective impact of the virus is primarily related to the lifestyles and social habits of the different human communities, environmental and meteorological factors also play a role. Among these, particulate pollution may directly impact the human respiratory system or act as virus carrier, thus behaving as potential amplifying factor in the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Enhanced levels of PM(2.5) and PM(10) particles in Northern Italy were observed over the 2-month period preceding the virus pandemic spread. Threshold levels for PM(10) (< 50 g/m(3)) were exceeded on 20C35 days over the period JanuaryCFebruary 2020 in many areas in the Po Valley, where major effects in terms of infections and casualties occurred, with levels in excess of 80 g/m(3) occasionally observed in the 1C3 weeks preceding the contagious activation around February 25, 2020. Threshold values for PM(2.5) indicated in WHO air quality guidelines (< 25 g/m(3)) were exceeded on more than 40 days over the period JanuaryCFebruary 2020 in large portions of the Po Valley, with levels up to 70 g/m(3) observed in the weeks preceding the contagious activation. In this paper, PM(10) particle measurements are compared with epidemiologic parameters data. Specifically, a statistical analysis is carried out to correlate the infection rate, or incidence of the pathology, the mortality rate, and the case fatality rate with PM concentrations. The study considers epidemiologic data for all 110 Italian provinces, as reported by the Italian Statistics Institute, over the period 20 FebruaryC31 March 2020. Corresponding PM(10) concentrations covering the period 15C26 February 2020 were collected from the network of air quality monitoring stations run by different regional and provincial environment agencies. The case fatality rate is found to be highly correlated to the average PM(10) concentration, with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and a slope of the regression line of (6.7  0.3)  10(?3) m(3)/g, which implies a doubling (from 3 to 6%) of the mortality rate of infected patients for an average PM(10) concentration increase from 22 to 27 g/m(3). Infection and mortality rates are also found to be correlated with PM(10) concentrations, with correlation coefficients being 0.82 and 0.80, respectively, and the slopes of the regression lines indicating a doubling (from 1 to 2) of the infection rate and a tripling (from 0.1 to 0.3) of the mortality rate for an average PM(10) concentration increase from 25 to 29 g/m(3). Considerations on the exhaled particles sizes, their concentrations and residence times, the transported viral dose and the minimum infective dose, in combination with PM(2.5) and PM(10) pollution measurements and an analytical microphysical model, allowed assessing the potential role of airborne transmission through virus-laden PM particles, in addition to droplet and the traditional airborne transmission, in conveying SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory system. In specific circumstances which can be found in indoor environments, the number of small potentially infectious particles coalescing on PM(2.5) and PM(10) particles is estimated to exceed the number of infectious particles needed to activate COVID-19 infection in humans.","output":"Assessment of the potential role of atmospheric particulate pollution and airborne transmission in intensifying the first wave pandemic impact of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In two previous papers we have proposed models to estimate the Covid-19 epidemic when the number of daily positive cases has a bell shaped form that we call a mode.

In Hungary, the sectors most affected by the epidemic (e.g., hospitality, tourism, automotive) had an intense impact, as the consequences of restrictions on mobility and social distance emerged in the very early stages of the crisis. The survey was conducted in July 2021 after the end of the second wave of the epidemic, with a total of 613 participants. Our results confirmed that the coronavirus crisis had a significant impact on the respondents feelings of job insecurity and financial situation. There is a significant connection between the downsizing of Hungarian small and medium-sized enterprises and the feeling of job insecurity among employees.

We aimed to assess the presence of abnormal cardiovascular resonance imaging (CMR) findings in patients recovered from moderate-to-severe COVID-19, and its association with markers of disease severity in the acute phase. METHODS: Fifty-eight (49%) survivors from the prospective COVID MECH study, underwent CMR median 175 [IQR 105-217] days after COVID-19 hospitalization. Abnormal CMR was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% or myocardial scar by late gadolinium enhancement. CMR indices were compared to healthy controls (n=32), and to circulating biomarkers measured during the index hospitalization. RESULTS: Abnormal CMR was present in 12 (21%) patients, of whom three were classified with major pathology (scar and LVEF<50% or LVEF<40%). There was no difference in the need of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and vital signs between patients with versus without abnormal CMR after 6 months. SARS-CoV-2 viremia and concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers were not associated with persistent CMR pathology. Cardiac troponin T and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations on admission, were higher in patients with CMR pathology, but these associations were not significant after adjusting for demographics and established cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: CMR pathology 6 months after moderate-to-severe COVID-19 was present in 21% of patients and did not correlate with severity of the disease. Cardiovascular biomarkers during COVID-19 were higher in patients with CMR pathology, but with no significant association after adjusting for confounders.

Declaring public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) is a cornerstone of the IHR. Here we review how PHEIC are formally declared, the diseases for which such declarations have been made from 2007 until 2020 and justifications for such declarations. KEY FINDINGS: Six events were declared PHEIC between 2007 and 2020: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Ebola (West African outbreak 2013-2015, outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo 2018-2020), poliomyelitis (2014 to present), Zika (2016) and COVID-19 (2020 to present). Poliomyelitis is the longest PHEIC. Zika was the first PHEIC for an arboviral disease. For several other emerging diseases a PHEIC was not declared despite the fact that the public health impact of the event was considered serious and associated with potential for international spread. RECOMMENDATIONS: The binary nature of a PHEIC declaration is often not helpful for events where a tiered or graded approach is needed. The strength of PHEIC declarations is the ability to rapidly mobilize international coordination, streamline funding and accelerate the advancement of the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics under emergency use authorization. The ultimate purpose of such declaration is to catalyse timely evidence-based action, to limit the public health and societal impacts of emerging and re-emerging disease risks while preventing unwarranted travel and trade restrictions.","output":"Public Health Emergencies of International Concern: A Historic Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To conduct a systematic review and meta\\\\analysis to characterize inflammatory markers in comparisons of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS\\\\C) versus severe/non\\\\severe COVID\\\\19, severe MIS\\\\C versus non\\\\severe MIS\\\\C, and among age groups of MIS\\\\C.

In diatoms and green algae, plasma-membranes are moderately to highly permeable to CO2 but effectively impermeable to HCO3 - . Here, CO2 and HCO3 - membrane permeabilities were measured using an 18 O-exchange technique on two species of haptophyte algae, Emiliania huxleyi and Calcidiscus leptoporus, which showed that the plasma membranes of these species are also highly permeable to CO2 (0.006 to 0.02 cm  s-1 ) but minimally permeable to HCO3 - . Increased temperature and CO2 generally increased CO2 membrane permeabilities in both species, possibly due to changes in lipid composition or CO2 channel proteins. Changes in CO2 membrane permeabilities showed no association with the density of calcium carbonate coccoliths surrounding the cell, which could potentially impede passage of compounds. Haptophyte plasma membrane permeabilities to CO2 were somewhat lower than those of diatoms but generally higher than membrane permeabilities of green algae. One caveat of these measurements is that the model used to interpret 18 O-exchange data assumes that carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes 18 O-exchange, is homogeneously distributed in the cell. The implications of this assumption were tested by using a two-compartment model with an inhomogeneous distribution of carbonic anhydrase to simulate 18 O-exchange data and then inferring plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities from the simulated data. This analysis showed that the inferred plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities are minimal estimates but should be quite accurate under most conditions.","output":"Influence of temperature and CO2 on plasma-membrane permeability to CO2 and HCO3 - in the marine haptophytes Emiliania huxleyi and Calcidiscus leptoporus (Prymnesiophyceae)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Collective action between international donors is central to the mobilisation of global solidarity in global health. This is especially important in mental health where resources remain extremely limited. In this paper I investigate global collective action in mental health financing, looking at the responsiveness of international donors to mental health needs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). I analyse factors at the level of recipient countries (needs, interests, policy environment) associated with allocation of development assistance for mental health (DAMH) using a two-part regression model applied to a time series cross-sectional dataset of 142 LMICs between 2000 and 2015. Findings reveal that international donors' disbursements are not well aligned with mental health needs of recipient countries, and, moreover, contextual factors might be playing more prominent roles in resource allocation. Countries are more likely to receive DAMH if they experience significant outbreaks of infectious diseases or have lower gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and lower market openness. Selected recipient countries are more likely to receive higher DAMH amounts per capita if they have lower GDP per capita, higher government health expenditure, or higher mortality rates due to conflicts or natural disasters. Past DAMH recipients are more likely to be selected and, when selected, to receive higher DAMH amounts per capita. My results demonstrate that more holistic collective action amongst international donors is required to address mental health needs in LMICs. Investments should better reflect needs, particularly during and after emergencies such as COVID-19, and could be amplified by leveraging synergies across other health conditions and sectors.","output":"Global collective action in mental health financing: Allocation of development assistance for mental health in 142 countries, 2000-2015."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the relationship between US stock market returns (S&P500) and three indicators of the market, namely implied volatility, implied correlation and liquidity.

INTRODUCTION It is widely acknowledged that a population health and equity approach is needed to improve the overall health of the population. The health service and delivery system plays an important role in this approach. Despite this, system transformation to address health inequities has been slow. This is due, in part, to the lack of evidence-based guidance on how health service and delivery systems can address and measure health equity integration. Most studies focus on health equity integration in the public health sector at a provincial or national level, but less is known about integration within the health service and delivery system. More information is needed to understand how that transformation is occurring, or could occur, to make a meaningful contribution toward improving population health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE to demonstrate that a long-term tunneled central venous catheter (LTCVC) implanted by a nephrologist is safe, effective, and associated with excellent results. METHODS A retrospective study analyzed 149 consecutively performed temporary-to-long-term tunneled central venous catheter conversions in the operating room (OR) from a dialysis facility from March 2014 to September 2017. The data collected consisted of the total procedures performed, demographic characteristics of the study population, rates of success, aborted procedure, failure, complications, and catheter survival, and costs. RESULTS the main causes of end stage renal disease (ESRD) were systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, 37.9% each. Patients had a high number of previous arteriovenous fistula (1.72  0.84) and temporary catheter (2.87  1.9) attempts until a definitive vascular access was achieved, while the preferred vascular site was right internal jugular vein (80%). Success, abortion, and failure rates were 93.3%, 2.7% and 4%, respectively, with only 5.36% of complications (minors). Overall LTCVC survival rates over 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 93.38, 71.81, 54.36, and 30.2%, respectively, with a mean of 298  280 days (median 198 days). The procedure cost was around 496 dollars.

Although the overall structures of human and bat virus S proteins are similar, there are key differences in their properties, including a more stable precleavage form of human S and about 1,000-fold tighter binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human receptor.

The aim was to investigate the viral kinetics and factors associated with viral clearance during lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination treatment in non-severe patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-four patients were retrospectively enrolled. Viral RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR assay from sputum or throat swab samples at different time points. The patterns of viral kinetics were characterized, and factors associated with rapid viral clearance, which was defined as viral RNA undetectable within two weeks, were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS All patients achieved viral RNA negativity and were discharged from the hospital. Furthermore, 48 (75%) and 16 (25%) patients achieved rapid and delayed viral clearance, respectively. The lymphocyte counts of rapid viral clearance patients (1.40 [1.20-1.80]  109/L) were higher, when compared to delayed viral clearance patients (1.00 [0.70-1.47]  109/L) (p=0.024).

Between 30% and 40% of the sample indicated dysfunctions in their general health (39.5%) and frequent physical (33.9%) and mental distress (31.8%). Adjusting for age and gross family income, women with autoimmune diseases presented higher prevalence of frequent limitations for daily activities (aPOR 2.00; 95% CI 1.05C3.81), poor general health (aPOR 3.52; 95% CI 1.90C6.49), frequent mental distress (aPOR 2.19; 95% CI 1.19C4.03), and dissatisfaction with life (aPOR 4.86; 95% CI 1.82C12.95) compared to those who did not report autoimmune diseases. No associations with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were observed. CONCLUSIONS. Quality-of-life dysfunctions were highly prevalent in this population of gynecologic cancer patients.

The method is based on the availability of a target-binding nanobody, which is then rigidly attached to two scaffolds: (1) a Fab-fragment of an antibody directed against the nanobody, and (2) a nanobody-binding protein A fragment fused to maltose binding protein and Fab-binding domains. The overall ensemble of [~]120 kDa, called Legobody, does not perturb the nanobody-target interaction and facilitates particle alignment in cryo-EM image processing. The utility of the method is demonstrated for the KDEL receptor, a 23 kDa membrane protein, resulting in a map at 3.2[A] overall resolution with density sufficient for de novo model building, and for the 22 kDa RBD of SARS-CoV2 spike protein, resulting in a map at 3.6 [A] resolution that allows analysis of the binding interface to the nanobody.

There were fears that health services would not be able to care for high numbers of COVID-19 patients. AIM To describe and review the emergency response of a public primary and community health-care organisation in Stockholm, Sweden, to the demand for care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during March-July 2020, and summarise preparations for the months to follow. METHODS This was a rapid implementation action research case study, which also draws on one author's experience as Chief Executive Officer and other members' experience in an emergency management group. RESULTS Sweden experienced similar mortality per million population to the UK, despite the different public health strategy used to address the COVID-19 outbreak. The Stockholm-integrated public primary and community health-care service, serving a population of 2.3 million, made many changes quickly. One change included coordinating non-acute private health-care services, following the local government emergency directive to do so. DISCUSSION It is possible that the fast and effective response by management and services in primary and community health care reduced infection and hospital demand, which contributed to a lower mortality than otherwise expected. The actions and preparations described for Stockholm's response may provide ideas for other health-care systems. The partnership research approach between the Karolinska Medical University and the Region Stockholm health-care system used in this project shows that rapid research methods have advantages for both partners in an emergency situation.","output":"Management of the emergency response to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden, and winter preparations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum La musculation  haute intensit en tl-rducation prsente de nombreuses plus-values pour amliorer la qualit de vie de personnes atteintes de paralysie crbrale.

Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including mania. We present a case of a middle aged man presenting with acute mania with psychotic symptoms 20 days post COVID infection in the absence of prior psychiatric illness. This report highlights the need for rigorous neuropsychiatric assessment in patient with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Method A 52-year-old man of West African origin with past history of hypertension and no previous history of mental health illness presented with acute manic symptoms on background of two weeks of high fever, diarrhoea, mild headache, dry cough and anosmia. He was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID PCR test. He was under self-isolation along with his family members who exhibited mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, none of them required hospital admission. He was initially fearful to seek medical attention but was brought in by family after exhibiting behaviour changes, obsession with toilet cleaning, reckless spending and getting aggressive approximately two weeks after the onset of acute upper respiratory symptoms. He presented elated in mood with pressure of speech and grandiose ideas. Investigations like neuroimaging and bloods were unremarkable. Initial psychiatric assessment found symptoms consistent with acute mania and he was detained under the Mental Health Act. During admission, he was sexually disinhibited and agitated on the ward requiring IM antipsychotics. He was treated with high dose of Olanzapine and Sodium valproate and his symptoms subsided within two weeks. Result This case emphasises the manifestation of neuropsychiatric illness post COVID-19 without a background of psychiatric illness, hypoxemia and cerebral infarction. Based on the CORONERVE Programme and latest retrospective Lancet cohort studies, the period between 14 and 90 days after diagnosis, 5.8% COVID-19 survivors had their first recorded diagnosis of psychiatric illness. It is also important to consider other organic disease given the simultaneous diagnosis of COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to confirm here due to the lack of a validated CSF-PCR assay, previous reports have implicated SARS-CoV-2 in the development of viral encephalitis, and this remains an important differential. Conclusion Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of patients with COVID-19 developing neuropsychiatric complications post SARS-CoV-2 infection, mandating the need for vigilant initial neuropsychiatric assessment and possibly follow-up care in 3 months.","output":"Acute mania with psychotic symptom in post COVID-19 patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: In early December 2019, the first clusters of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were identified in Wuhan, China and attributed to a novel coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Kuwait reported its first cases of COVID-19 on February 24th 2020 and since then the number of cases has been increasing rapidly. Methods and Findings: This is a retrospective single-center study of consecutive 417 COVID-19 patients admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad hospital between 24/2/2020 and 24/5/2020. The mean age of cohort was 45.35 years (S.D. 17.16) and 62.8% of cases were males. Patients were divided into four groups; Asymptomatic group, symptomatic group with mild form of the disease, ICU survivors and ICU death. In total, 39.3% of patients were asymptomatic, 41% were symptomatic with mild symptoms, 5.3% were admitted to ICU and recovered and 14.4% died. Mean age of ICU patients was 53.61 years (S.D. 13.43). Comorbidities were more prevalent in ICU death group when compared to other groups (p<0.05) including Diabetes (40%), Hypertension (46.7%), Asthma (20.3%) and cardiovascular disease (21.7%). Blood biochemistry analysis showed that ICU death group had a characteristic abnormal pattern of certain markers upon admission in the ICU. Including significantly high WBC and neutrophil counts (P<0.05) and prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P<0.05). D-dimer, C-reactive protein and Procalcitonin (PCT) showed significantly high levels in ICU admissions and in ICU death group in particular (P<0.05). Kidney injury complications were reported in 65% of ICU death group (P<0.05) which also showed significantly elevated urea levels (P<0.05). We also reported rapid deteriorating kidney function (eGFR) in ICU death cases during ICU stay until the outcome was reached. Conclusions: In this single-center study of 417 COVID19 patients in Kuwait. The disease showed varying degree of severity ranging from asymptomatic status to death. Our comprehensive laboratory analysis revealed distinct abnormal patterns of markers that are associated with poor prognosis. Our dynamic profiling of eGFR in COVID-19 ICU patients highlight potential role of renal markers in forecasting disease outcome and perhaps identify patients at risk of poor outcome.","output":"Clinical characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Kuwait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted 3 population-based cross-sectional surveys, at 1-month intervals, to estimate the prevalence and time-trend of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Puducherry, India Seropositivity rate increased from 4 9% to 34 5% over 2 months and was 20-fold higher than the number of diagnosed cases of infection [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Emerging Infectious Diseases is the property of Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Prevalence and Time Trend of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Puducherry, India, August--October 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In addition to direct health threats of the COVID-19 pandemic, societies are experiencing significant harms and burdens associated with measures to mitigate the effects of the virus In this context, a possible vaccine is perhaps the most highly regarded prospect to combat the novel coronavirus and enable societies to lift COVID related restrictions Governments and other institutions around the world have invested large amounts of resources into the development, testing, and production capacity for several different vaccines When vaccines become available, public health authorities will need information about the concerns and decision-making considerations of constituents We outline here the key findings from interviews with residents of Ontario, Canada, (n=40) in July and August of 2020 regarding their views, concerns, and intentions with respect to a prospective COVID-19 vaccine In particular, participants expressed concern about the safety and efficacy of any prospective vaccine that is developed in a short timeframe, despite eagerness to eventually take it Additionally, participants expressed considerations that, while not directly related to vaccines, nevertheless factored into their attitudes about accepting a possible COVID vaccination These included how successful governments have managed COVID-19 so far, existing relationships with healthcare providers, and how they have assessed their risk of contracting or becoming very ill from COVID-19 Trust in science, regulators, and governments will play a critical role in the successful deployment of a COVID-19 vaccine Governments and public health institutions can take actions to earn trust Implementing monitoring programs for long-term adverse effects would measure and potentially mitigate risk of unforeseen effects Supports that provide financial and social stability during the wait for rigorously tested vaccines may increase trust in governments to act in the best interest of their constituents","output":"34 COVID-19, vaccination, and trust: an interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 79-year-old woman who was on chronic hemodialysis due to diabetic nephropathy and had previously undergo surgery for radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in her right wrist needed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for stenosis at the juxta-anastomotic access site.

For this production, light is the main limiting factor. We investigated the potential of intercanopy lighting (ICL) using light emitting diodes (LEDs) to improve blackberry fruit yield in a crop with a spring and an autumn production cycle. During the spring production cycle three light treatments were applied: only natural light (no ICL), 93 or 185 mol m-2 s-1 ICL In summer the lateral shoots were cut back and 93 mol m-2 s-1 ICL was applied to all plants after cutting back, investigating a possible carryover effect of supplemental light in spring on autumn production. Fresh fruit yield in spring increased by 79 and 122% with 93 and 185 mol m-2 s-1 ICL, respectively, compared to no ICL. This represents 3.6 and 2.8% increase in harvestable product for every additional 1% of light. A yield component analysis and leaf photosynthesis measurements were conducted. Maximum photosynthetic capacity (A max) for leaves at 185 mol m-2 s-1 ICL was about 50% higher, and LAI was 41% higher compared to no ICL. ICL increased the number of fruiting laterals per cane, and this explained 75% of the increase in yield. ICL at 185 mol m-2 s-1 resulted in a higher yield compared to no ICL, primarily as a result of higher total dry matter production. Furthermore, a higher fraction of dry matter partitioned to the fruits (0.59 compared to 0.52) contributed to yield increase, whereas fruit dry matter content and fruit quality (sugar and acid content) was not affected by ICL. Averaged over the three light treatments autumn yield was 47% lower than spring yield. Autumn yield was 10% higher for plants at ICL 93 mol m-2 s-1 in spring and 36% higher for plants at 185 mol m-2 s-1 in spring compared to no ICL in spring. This increased autumn yield was caused by more fruiting laterals (less necrotic buds). It is concluded that management practices in spring can have a carryover effect on the autumn production. This is the first scientific paper on the potential for applying LED ICL in blackberries.

Such diseases are transmitted to humans through their interaction with animals in the food value chain including through the consumption of bush meat. Climate change has also facilitated the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. The lack of adequately enforced food-safety standards in managed agricultural production systems creates the necessary conditions for diseases to mutate into highly contagious strains. The lack of food safety measures in handling, packaging and sales of food increases risks of cross-species contamination. Finally, increasing anti-microbial resistance, combined with rapid urbanization and global interconnectedness allows diseases to spread rapidly among humans. Thus, part of the reconstruction efforts, post covid19, should include prioritizing proactive investments in food safety. The key to stave off another such pandemic lies in integrating one-health knowledge on zoonotic diseases along with food safety measures along the food value chain.

Furthermore, I maintain that the civil law rather than the Anglo-American law on directors' duty of care provides boards with a more expansive scope of discretion to confront the unusual challenges associated with the COVID-19 because these governance regimes are tailored to the unique features of companies and markets.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of IRS Tyr632, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and AKT that is involved in the insulin action mechanism was decreased by TNF-, whereas Deglusterol increased their phosphorylations, leading to an increase of glucose uptake rate by 190% through glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) compared with TNF--treated group in C2C12 cells. In addition to insulin signaling activation, Deglusterol treatment resulted in significantly greater mRNA expressions of IRS (190%) and GLUT4 (140%) as well as that of leptin (260%) and adiponectin (140%), which are indicators of insulin sensitivity. In animal models with type 2 diabetes, the blood glucose concentrations in the Deglusterol-administered group were significantly reduced by 50% compared with the control group. Deglusterol suppressed insulin resistance and restored insulin sensitivity, which contributed to lowering blood glucose concentrations in the insulin-resistant models, suggesting its potential as a blood glucose-lowering agent for people at high risk of type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.","output":"Lowering of Blood Glucose Levels with the Peptide Mixture Deglusterol in In Vitro and In Vivo Models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide.

These well-tolerated but still unlicensed vaccines encode distinct HPV antigens (E2 versus E6+E7) to elicit cell-mediated immune responses; their clinical efficacy, as measured by HSIL regression or cure, was modest when compared with placebo or surgery (conization), but both proved highly effective in clearing HPV infection, which should help further optimize strategies for enhancing vaccine immunogenicity, toward an ultimate goal of preventing malignancies in millions of patients who are living with persistent, oncogenic HPV infection but are not expected to benefit from current, prophylactic vaccines. The major roadblocks to a highly efficacious and practical product remain challenging and can be classified into five categories: (i) getting the vaccines into the right cells for efficient expression and presentation of HPV antigens (fusion proteins or epitopes); (ii) having adequate coverage of oncogenic HPV types, beyond the current focus on HPV-16 and -18; (iii) directing immune protection to various epithelial niches, especially anogenital mucosa and upper aerodigestive tract where HPV-transformed cells wreak havoc; (iv) establishing the time window and vaccination regimen, including dosage, interval and even combination therapy, for achieving maximum efficacy; and (v) validating therapeutic efficacy in patients with poor prognosis because of advanced, recurrent or non-resectable malignancies.

Children younger than 19 years, in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR, were included. RESULTS: 1443 children were included. Median age was eight years; 3.3 % were admitted to the intensive care unit, 1.8 % required assisted mechanical ventilation, and mortality was 1.9 %. In multivariate models, the development of pneumonia was the main risk factor for mortality, with an odds ratio (OR) of 6.45 (95 % CI: 1.99, 20.89); patients who required intubation had an OR of 8.75 (95 % CI: 3.23, 23.7).

However, emerging results on the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility or COVID-19 outcomes are conflicting, and their robustness remains uncertain. In this context, this project aims at quantifying the proportion of SARS-CoV-S antibody seroprevalence, studying the changes in antibody levels over time, and analyzing the association between smoking status and infection using seroprevalence data. The added value of this research is that the current smoking status of the population to be studied will be biochemically verified, in order to avoid the bias associated with self-reported smoking status. As such, the results from this survey may provide actionable metric to study the role of smoking in SARS-CoV-2 spread, and therefore implement the most appropriate public health measures to control the pandemic. The research design involves a 6-month prospective cohort study with serial sampling of the same individuals. Each participant will be surveyed about their demographics and COVID-19-related information, and blood sampling will be collected upon recruitment and at specified follow-up time points (namely, after 8 and 24 weeks). Blood samples will be screened for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and serum cotinine. Overall, we expect to find a higher prevalence of antibodies in individuals at high-risk for viral exposure (i.e., healthcare or other essential workers), according to previous literature, and to refine current estimates on the association between smoking status and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.

However, the profiling of nascent transcripts, which often include nonpolyadenylated RNAs, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Here, we separately sequenced total RNAs (Total RNAseq) and mRNAs (mRNAseq) from the same HIV-1-infected human CD4(+) T cells. We found that many nonpolyadenylated RNAs were differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, and we identified 8 times more differentially expressed genes at 12 h postinfection by Total RNAseq than by mRNAseq. These expression changes were also evident by concurrent changes in introns and were recapitulated by later mRNA changes, revealing an unexpectedly significant delay between transcriptional initiation and mature mRNA production early after HIV-1 infection. We computationally derived and validated the underlying regulatory programs, and we predicted drugs capable of reversing these HIV-1-induced expression changes followed by experimental confirmation. Our results show that combined total and mRNA transcriptome analysis is essential for fully capturing the early host response to virus infection and provide a framework for identifying candidate drugs for host-directed therapy against HIV/AIDS. IMPORTANCE In this study, we used mass sequencing to identify genes differentially expressed in CD4(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection. To our surprise, we found many differentially expressed genes early after infection by analyzing both newly transcribed unprocessed pre-mRNAs and fully processed mRNAs, but not by analyzing mRNAs alone, indicating a significant delay between transcription initiation and mRNA production early after HIV-1 infection. These results also show that important findings could be missed by the standard practice of analyzing mRNAs alone. We then derived the regulatory mechanisms driving the observed expression changes using integrative computational analyses. Further, we predicted drugs that could reverse the observed expression changes induced by HIV-1 infection and showed that one of the predicted drugs indeed potently inhibited HIV-1 infection. This shows that it is possible to identify candidate drugs for host-directed therapy against HIV/AIDS using our genomics-based approach.","output":"Deep sequencing of HIV-infected cells: insights into nascent transcription and host-directed therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected individuals of all categories, irrespective of their geographical locations, professions, gender, or race.

Though UHC is a long-term goal, its importance and relevance have only increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first step on the road to UHC is to define and develop essential packages of health services (EPHSs), a list of clinical and public health services that a government has deemed a priority and is to provide. However, the nature of these lists of services in low- and lower-middle-income countries is largely unknown. This study examines the contents of 45 countries' EPHSs to determine the inclusion of essential UHC (EUHC) services as defined by the Disease Control Priorities, which comprises 21 specific essential packages of interventions. EPHSs were collected from publicly available sources and their contents were analyzed in two stages, firstly, to determine the level of specificity and detail of the content of EPHSs and, secondly, to determine which essential UHC services were included. Findings show that there are large variations in the level of specificity among EPHSs and that though EUHC services are included to a large extent, variations exist regarding which services are included between countries. The results provide an overview of how countries are designing EPHSs as a policy tool and are progressing toward providing a full range of EUHC services.

The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a model that was developed to assess the factors influencing the assimilation of a new technology. We used the UTAUT model to examine the associations between the attitudes and perceptions of psychiatrists in Israel toward telepsychiatry and their intention to use it. METHODS: An online, close-ended questionnaire based on a modified UTAUT model was distributed among psychiatrists in Israel. Seventy-six questionnaires were completed and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The behavioral intention of Israeli psychiatrists to use telepsychiatry was relatively low, despite their perceptions of themselves as capable of high performance with low effort. Nonetheless, they were interested in using telepsychiatry voluntarily. Experience in telepsychiatry, and to a lesser extent, facilitating conditions, were found to be positively correlated with the intention to use telepsychiatry. Psychiatrists have a positive attitude toward treating patients by telepsychiatry and perceive its risk as moderate. DISCUSSION: Despite high performance expectancy, low effort expectancy, low perceived risk, largely positive attitudes, high voluntariness, and the expectancy for facilitating conditions, the intention to use telepsychiatry was rather low. This result is explained by the low level of experience, which plays a pivotal role. We recommend promoting the facilitating conditions that affect the continued use of telepsychiatry when initiating its implementation, and conclude that it is critical to create a sense of success during the initial stages of experience.","output":"The Attitudes and Perceptions of Israeli Psychiatrists Toward Telepsychiatry and Their Behavioral Intention to Use Telepsychiatry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A compartmental model is proposed to predict the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) spread.

The evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact and undetected recovery rates remain below 5%; however, variations are larger in recovery rate, death rate, reinfection rate, sequestration adherence and release rate from sequestration. Projections based on the current situation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the number of deaths would most likely have been significantly lower in states that opened up. Additionally, we predict that decreasing contact rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown compliance (from the current ~15% to ~30%) will eradicate infections in Texas within a year.

These environmental disturbances during early life potentially alter the incidence of inflammatory disorders as well as priming of immune responses. Infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni is widely studied for its ability to alter immune responsiveness and is associated with variations in coinfection, allergy, and vaccine efficacy in endemic populations. OBJECTIVE: Exposure to maternal schistosomiasis during early life, even without transmission of infection, can result in priming effects on offspring immune responses to bystander antigenic challenges as related to allergic responsiveness and vaccination, with this article seeking to further clarify the effects and underlying immunologic imprinting. METHODS: Here, we have combined a model of chronic maternal schistosomiasis infection with a thorough analysis of subsequent offspring immune responses to allergy and vaccination models, including viral challenge and steady-state changes to immune cell compartments. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that maternal schistosomiasis alters CD4+ responses during allergic sensitization and challenge in a skewed IL-4/B-cell-dominant response to antigenic challenge associated with limited inflammatory response. Beyond that, we have uncovered previously unidentified alterations to CD8+ T-cell responses during immunization that are dependent on vaccine formulation and have functional impact on the efficacy of vaccination against viral infection in a murine hepatitis B virus model. CONCLUSION: In addition to steady-state modifications to CD4+ T-cell polarization and B-cell priming, we have traced these modified CD8+ responses to an altered dendritic cell phenotype sustained into adulthood, providing evidence for complex priming effects imparted by infection via fetomaternal cross talk.","output":"Fetomaternal immune cross talk modifies T-cell priming through sustained changes to DC function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread across the world. During this COVID-19 pandemic, several variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have been found. Some of these new variants like the VOC-202012/01 of lineage B.1.1.7 or the most recently B.1.617 emerging in India have a higher infectiousness than those previously prevalent. We propose a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations to investigate potential consequences of the appearance of a new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain in a given region. The proposed mathematical model incorporates the presymptomatic and asymptomatic subpopulations in addition to the more usual susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered subpopulations. This is important from a realistic point of view since it has been found recently that presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are relevant spreaders of the SARS-CoV-2. Using the next-generation matrix method, we find the basic reproduction number, [Formula: see text] , an important threshold parameter that provides insight regarding the evolution and outcome of a certain instance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The local and global stability of system equilibria are also presented. In particular, for the global stability we construct a Lyapunov functional and use the LaSalle invariant principle to prove that if the basic reproduction ratio is less than unity, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. On the other hand, if [Formula: see text] the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.

A total of 4657 participants underwent antibody testing. Positive PCR and/or antibody tests were followed by PCR and serological testing of household contacts.Findings: One child tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence in children increased with age (OR: 111 per year, P=0009). In children with reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2, probability of seroconversion was also higher in older children (children 6 - <12 OR: 11, and 12 - <18 years OR: 32 vs. children <6 years). Follow-up of household contacts showed incomplete seroconversion in most families. Seroconversion rates were higher in families, where the index patient was an adult than in families with paediatric index cases (OR: 179, P=0047).Interpretation: Seroprevalence in children increases with age, also in children with known exposure to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a lower infectibility of younger children. Infectiousness of children may be lower than adults, as lower seroconversion rates characterised families of paediatric index cases compared to families of adult index cases.

Consequently, pMDIs contribute 3.5% of the NHS's CO2 equivalent emissions (2). Local and national guidelines (NICE, British Thoracic Society) have attempted to increase use of LCFIs, but their effects and factors influencing success are unknown. Aim: To investigate temporal and geographical variation in LCFI dispensing in England over five years. Methods: Clinical commissioning group (CCG) dispensed items (March 2016-February 2021) were obtained from openprescribing.net for five classes of inhaler where a choice between pMDIs and LCFIs is available: short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs), long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), ICS plus LABA inhalers (ICS/LABA) and ICS/LABA plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist inhalers (ICS/LABA/LAMA). CCG population age profiles were obtained from the Office for National Statistics. CCG emergency hospital admission and mortality rates were obtained from Public Health England. CCG formularies and guidelines were reviewed to identify where guidance is available to prescribers. To control for total inhaler dispensing, the key measure used is the %LCFI: the number of LCFI items dispensed relative to the total number of pMDI and LCFI items. Multivariate regression models were used to investigate geographical variation. Results: The total annual %LCFI increased from 19.5% to 26.3% over the study period. This was driven by the introduction of ICS/LABA/LAMA inhalers in 2018, as %LCFI decreased for SABA, ICS and ICS/LABA inhalers. %LCFI varied between classes. In the final year, it ranged from 6% for both SABA and ICS inhalers, to 41.2% and 43.9% for ICS/LABA and ICS/LABA/LAMA inhalers, respectively. Interestingly, the cost per item for ICS/LABA and ICS/LABA/LAMA inhalers was similar for both pMDIs and LCFIs, but for SABA and ICS inhalers LCFIs were more expensive. %LCFI in the final year varied between CCGs (10.7% to 30.9%). The North West, and Birmingham and London areas had consistently higher %LCFI for all classes. For SABA and ICS inhalers, both the presence of advice on climate change in CCG guidelines or formularies, and greater CCG asthma prevalence, were significantly associated with higher %LCFI (p<0.05). The proportion of CCG population <15 years had a significant negative association with %LCFI for ICS and ICS/LABA inhalers (p<0.05). There were no clinically significant associations between %LCFI and either emergency hospital admission or mortality rates. Conclusion: Current initiatives have not been successful in increasing the use of LCFIs, indicating limited implementation of guidelines for unknown reasons. Further action is required to reduce the carbon footprint of inhaler prescribing. Actions to address the financial disincentives to LCFI prescribing, CCG leadership (e.g. guidelines) and the appropriate use of LCFI in young people should be considered. Research into facilitators and barriers to LCFI use would support this. An important limitation is the use of dispensed items data rather than the number of inhalers, although there is no evidence that the number of inhalers per item varies between pMDIs and LCFIs. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted prescribing patterns and long-term NHS projects.","output":"Low Carbon Footprint Inhalers in England: a Review of Dispensing Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A high-performing health care system strives to achieve universal access, affordability, high-quality care, and equity, aiming to reduce inequality in outcomes and access Using data from the 2020 commonwealth Fund International Health Policy survey, we report on health status, socioeconomic risk factors, affordability, and access to primary care among Us adults compared with ten other high-income countries We highlight health experiences among lower-income adults and compare income-related disparities between lower- and higherincome adults across countries Results indicate that among adults with lower incomes, those in the Us fare relatively worse on affordability and access to primary care than those in other countries, and income-related disparities across domains are relatively greater throughout The presence of these disparities should strengthen the resolve to find solutions to eliminate income-related inequality in affordability and primary care access","output":"Income-Related Inequality In Affordability And Access To Primary Care In Eleven High-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic uprooted economies, infected millions, and altered behaviors.

Background: In the current pandemic, the RACF workforce has been required to work under stressful conditions, with immense mental and physical pressures, resulting in anxiety and stress felt towards their jobs. Study design and methods: We electronically surveyed both clinical and non-clinical staff at public and private RACFs in Australia in June and August 2020. The survey asked a mix of openended and closed questions about preparedness for the pandemic, information flow, experience with personal protective equipment (PPE), management of suspected COVID cases, restrictions on visitors, and impact on RACF staff personal and home life. Quantitative data were analysed in SPSS;qualitative data using content analysis. Results: We received 371 responses: 198 from clinical staff and 168 from non-clinical staff. Respondents were between 20-71 years old, and 87% were female most commonly from Victoria (28%) or New South Wales (28%). The majority (80%) felt that Australian RACFs were well-prepared for the pandemic and 87% agreed that relevant healthcare authorities were contactable for information needed. A total of 37% reported challenges in estimating and ordering appropriate quantities of protective equipment. Ninety percent of facilities reported screening residents for possible symptoms and 77% introduced precautions or quarantine measures to protect residents. Most participants (98%) reported their RACF implemented restrictions on visitor access and 43% reported unfair or abusive treatment by family or friends of the residents. Commonly reported personal impacts included: workload increase, stress, emotional toll, family issues and fatigue. Support from colleagues as well as training, de-brief sessions and frequent meetings were identified as helpful facilitators during this time. Conclusion: We identified a wide range of practices and coping strategies among Australian RACFs. Whilst a majority of respondents reported coping well, a large proportion reported struggling both mentally and physically. Factors reported as helpful by the respondents may assist RACFs in planning for future pandemics. Implications for research, policy and practice: Understanding the challenges faced by all levels of staff within RACFs may aid decision-makers on a range of different levels - researchers, aged care providers, local/regional/state health departments and national leaders within government to help inform the development of interventions that may help the sector to recover, as well as prepare for potential future outbreaks. Of particular importance, are interventions or initiatives that focus on supporting the physical and mental health of staff i.e. those that prevent or minimise worker fatigue, emotional burnout and stress.

Early in 2020, RACF nurses experienced a greater overall workload and some had their staff hours reduced by their employers due to financial constraints caused by the outbreak. What this paper adds This paper offers a comprehensive insight into how RACF staff coped both individually and as part of the facility overall during the COVID crisis. It identified that a commonly reported source of stress was first-hand verbal abuse from family or friends of residents in response to visitor and lockdown restrictions implemented by the authorities. The paper highlighted that whilst the majority of respondents felt that RACFs were well prepared for managing residents during the pandemic, some facilities experienced significant problems with workloads, PPE and human resourcing. Furthermore, the survey showed that on an individual level, some staff experienced significant mental and physical stress during the outbreak.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian residential aged care facility (RACF) workforce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe, questions have arisen about the approach healthcare systems should adopt in order to optimally manage patient influx.

Indirect effects through human behaviors ie interrelationships between climatic variables and people mobility are significantly positive and should be considered to correctly assess the effects of climatic factors. Since climate is per se purely exogenous, climate tend to strengthen the effect of mobility on virus spread. The net effect from climate on Covid-19 outbreak will thus result from the direct negative effect of climatic variables and from the indirect effect due to the interaction between mobility and them. Direct negative effects from climatic factors on Covid-19 outcomes - when they are significant - are partly compensated by positive indirect effects through human mobility.

This is matched by the availability of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are computationally expensive to perform on very large datasets and thousands of molecular descriptors. Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on QC. Here we show how to achieve compression with datasets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands (whole cell screening datasets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and data re-uploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches.

In the present study, anticancer potential of three ethno-medicinally important species i.e., B. bipinnata, B. biternata and B. pilosa were tested. For in-vitro evaluation, an MTT (Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) assay was performed against cervical cancer cells (HeLa), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG), and adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549). For in vivo evaluation, Artemia salina, Danio rerio, and Caenorhabditis elegans were used. Among all the tested extracts, the ethanol extract of B. biternata appeared to have highest anticancer activity, and the compounds responsible for this activity were identified to be Tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl), 4-hydroxy-2,4'-dimethoxychalcone, and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. This is the first report of the isolation of Tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate from the genus Bidens and the first report of 4-hydroxy-2,4'-dimethoxychalcone and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol from B. biternata. Among the isolated compounds, 4-hydroxy-2,4'-dimethoxychalcone showed the highest anticancer activity with an LD50 value of 236.7 g/mL.

DESIGN, SETTING: A before\\\\and\\\\after study in four metropolitan EDs in New South Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 1491 consecutive patients tested by standard multiplex PCR during JulyCDecember 2016, and 2250 tested by rapid PCR during JulyCDecember 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admissions; ED length of stay (LOS); test turnaround time; patient receiving test result before leaving the ED; ordering of other laboratory tests. RESULTS: Compared with those tested by standard PCR, fewer patients tested by rapid PCR were admitted to hospital (73.3% v 77.7%; P < 0.001) and more received their test results before leaving the ED (67.4% v 1.3%; P < 0.001); the median test turnaround time was also shorter (2.4 h [IQR, 1.6C3.9 h] v 26.7 h [IQR, 21.2C37.8 h]). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital was also lower in the rapid PCR group for both children under 18 (50.6% v 66.6%; P < 0.001) and patients over 60 years of age (84.3% v 91.8%; P < 0.001). Significantly fewer blood culture, blood gas, sputum culture, and respiratory bacterial and viral serology tests were ordered for patients tested by rapid PCR. ED LOS was similar for the rapid (7.4 h; IQR, 5.0C12.9 h) and standard PCR groups (6.5 h; IQR, 4.2C11.9 h; P = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Rapid PCR testing of ED patients for influenza virus and RSV was associated with better outcomes on a range of indicators, suggesting benefits for patients and the health care system.

The model was calibrated using the demographics, policies, and interventions implemented in the state. Then, using the calibrated model, we simulated possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate due to leakage of infected cases with high-transmission variants, during a period without recorded cases of locally acquired infections, known in Australian settings as zero community transmission. We also examined how the threat of new variants reduces given a range of vaccination levels. Specifically, the model calibration covered the first-wave period from early March 2020 to May 2020. Predicted epidemic trajectories were simulated from early February 2021 to late March 2021. Our simulations showed that one infected agent with the ancestral (A.2.2) variant has a 14% chance of crossing a threshold of sustained community transmission (SCT) (i.e., > 5 infections per day, more than 3 days in a row), assuming no change in the prevailing preventative and counteracting policies. However, one agent carrying the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant has a 43% chance of crossing the same threshold; a threefold increase with respect to the ancestral strain; while, one agent carrying the delta (B.1.617.2) variant has a 60% chance of the same threshold, a fourfold increase with respect to the ancestral strain. The delta variant is 50% more likely to trigger SCT than the alpha variant. Doubling the average number of daily tests from  6,000 to 12,000 results in a decrease of this SCT probability from 43 to 33% for the alpha variant. However, if the delta variant is circulating we would need an average of 100,000 daily tests to achieve a similar decrease in SCT risk. Further, achieving a full-vaccination coverage of 70% of the adult population, with a vaccine with 70% effectiveness against infection, would decrease the probability of SCT from a single seed of alpha from 43 to 20%, on par with the ancestral strain in a naive population. In contrast, for the same vaccine coverage and same effectiveness, the probability of SCT from a single seed of delta would decrease from 62 to 48%, a risk slightly above the alpha variant in a naive population. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of even a small number of people infected with high-transmission variants dramatically increases the probability of sustained community transmission in Queensland. Until very high vaccine coverage is achieved, a swift implementation of policies and interventions, together with high quarantine adherence rates, will be required to minimise the probability of sustained community transmission.","output":"Risk of sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Queensland, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reports the measures taken to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on O&G services in a tertiary referal centre and their outcomes.

Data including age, diagnosis, operation, duration of preoperative and postoperative hospital stay, COVID-19 status were recorded. COVID-19 status of the patients was diagnosed with a nasopharyngeal swab test. Thirty-seven (20%) of 177 operations were performed because of gynaecologic reasons. The rest of them were caesarean sections (C/S). In gynaecologic cases, 22 (59%) of 37 were emergent operations, nine (24%) cases were oncologic and six (16%) cases were elective gynaecological surgeries. On the other hand, 43 (30%) of 140 patients, who underwent caesarean sections, were urgent surgeries. The rest were elective and planned caesarean sections. Only five patients (2.8%) who had undergone caesarean sections were tested positive for COVID-19. No COVID-19 transmission to staff was recorded in this period. Measures against the COVID-19 pandemic must be multidisciplinary and is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease to staff in close contact.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? COVID-19 pandemic has been a crucial health problem worldwide. Healthcare workers work intensely to protect people from the pandemic. It is especially important to protect healthcare professionals and hospitalized patients from virus transmission. Therefore, utilization of personal protective equipment such as masks, gloves and goggles is obligatory, and hygiene rules such as sanitization of hands are strictly followed.What the results of this study add? This study adds the experience and success of a tertiary centre regarding the measure against COVID-19 to the literature. No viral transmission was detected to healthcare workers and other patients from COVID-19 patients. Hence, measures that mentioned in the present study should be an example to other centres for protection against pandemic.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? As mentioned above, measures that are explained in the present study should be an example to other centres for protection against the pandemic.

The objectives of this study are to characterize the findings and patterns on a chest radiograph (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) that are most important in the postacute phase and to evaluate how these changes correlate with clinical data, spirometry, and impulse oscillometry (IOS). This was a retrospective study of 29 patients who underwent CXR, CT, spirometry, and IOS. The inclusion criteria were age >18 years and persistent respiratory symptoms after four weeks. The exclusion criteria were radiological exams with low technical quality and non-COVID-19 acute lung diseases. The inferential analysis was carried out with the chi-square ((2)) or Fisher's exact test to evaluate the interrelationships between the clinical and COVID-19 variables according to spirometry, IOS, CT, and CXR. In our sample, 19 patients were women (65.5%). The predominance of abnormal spirometry was associated with CT's moderate/severe degree of involvement (p = 0.017; 69.2%, CI 95%: 44.1%C94.3%). There was no significant association between IOS and tomographic and radiographic parameters. A significant association was found between the classifications of the moderate/severe and normal/mild patterns on CT and CXRs (p = 0.003; 93.3%, CI 95%: 77.8%C100%). Patients with moderate/severe impairment on CXR were associated with a higher frequency of hospitalization (p = 0.033; 77.8%, CI 95%: 58.6%C97.0%) and had significantly more moderate/severe classifications in the acute phase than the subgroup with normal/mild impairment on CXR (p = 0.017; 88.9%, CI 95%: 74.4%C100%).

We stratified analyses by month of infection to study temporal trends and conducted subgroup analyses by long-term care residency. RESULTS: During the observation period, 56 476 individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were reported; 41 049 (72.7%) of these were younger than 60 years, and 29 196 (51.7%) were female. Proportion of cases shifted from older populations (> 60 yr) to younger populations (10C39 yr) over time. Overall, 5383 (9.5%) of individuals were admitted to hospital; of these, 1183 (22.0%) were admitted to the ICU, and 712 (60.2%) of these received invasive mechanical ventilation. Mean LOS for individuals in the ward, ICU without invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU with invasive mechanical ventilation was 12.8 (standard deviation [SD] 15.4), 8.5 (SD 7.8) and 20.5 (SD 18.1) days, respectively.

We aimed to understand migrant worker concerns and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic to address these during the crisis and inform on comprehensive support needed after the crisis. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with migrant workers diagnosed with COVID-19. The participants were recruited from a COVID-19 mass quarantine facility in Singapore through a purposive sampling approach. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis performed to derive themes in their collective experience during the crisis. RESULTS: Three theme categories were derived from 27 interviews: migrant worker concerns during COVID-19, coping during COVID-19 and priorities after COVID-19. Major stressors in the crisis included the inability to continue providing for their families when work is disrupted, their susceptibility to infection in crowded dormitories, the shock of receiving the COVID-19 diagnosis while asymptomatic, as well as the isolating conditions of the quarantine environment. The workers coped by keeping in contact with their families, accessing healthcare, keeping updated with the news and continuing to practise their faith and religion. They looked forward to a return to normalcy after the crisis with keeping healthy and having access to healthcare as new priorities. CONCLUSION: We identified coping strategies employed by the workers in quarantine, many of which were made possible through the considered design of care and service delivery in mass quarantine facilities in Singapore. These can be adopted in the set-up of other mass quarantine facilities around the world to support the health and mental well-being of those quarantined.

In Iran, online education has received growing attention because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to compare the effects of interactive and non-interactive e-learning on midwives' knowledge and self-efficacy. Methods: This quasi-experimental study involved 76 midwives working in prenatal care in health centres who were randomly divided into two groups: interactive e-learning via computers and non-interactive e-learning via mobile applications. Knowledge and self-efficacy were measured pre- and post-intervention using an online questionnaire and differences were analysed using the chi-squared and t tests. Results: Knowledge scores in nutrition, exercise, and overall care during pregnancy increased significantly in both groups in the post-intervention phase. Self-efficacy scores increased in exercise and overall care in the interactive e-learning group. The self-efficacy scores for all four studied items improved significantly in the smartphone group. The two groups' knowledge and self-efficacy scores were not significantly different post-intervention. Conclusions: E-learning had positive effects on the knowledge and self-efficacy of midwives. The researchers suggest using these approaches alongside conventional in-service education methods.

To our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation of an ALTO protocol completed. Methods: A multi-disciplinary group of ED providers, pharmacists, and nursing developed an ALTO program for HFHS using existing best practices and publications for implementation at all 9 HFHS EDs. This included 5 hospitals and 4 free-standing EDs, which see approximately 450,000 patient visits annually in total. Henry Ford Hospital (HFH) ED, a 100,000 annual patient visit quaternary care center, was amongst the 9 EDs included. After finalization of a protocol, we implemented an ALTO Quicklist, an organized section of non- opiate pain medications for indicated conditions, into our electronic medical record (EMR, Figure 1). Prior to implementation of our ALTO program in November 2019, we provided education surrounding the new tools and protocols to EM providers and nursing staff in different forums including staff meetings, grand rounds, nursing huddles and also email. Feedback was provided to all departments via system meetings and email communication at 4-month and 8-month intervals post-program kick off to monitor progress. A list of all opioids on HFHS pharmaceutical formularies was reviewed and a standard conversion factor to MME was applied to calculate a total number of MME administered per patient encounter (Figure 2). Only opiate medications administered in the ED were included. MME per patient encounter were compared in two groups: pre-intervention (November 2016 through October 2019;n=1, 317, 466) to the 1-year period post implementation (December 2019 through November 2020;n=366, 404). MME per patient encounter were compared for these time periods across HFHS EDs and for each department and the percentage change was calculated. Results: Opiate administration decreased across the entire HFHS from 2.76 MME per patient encounter to 2.62 MME per patient encounter, a 5.1% decrease overall. Only one of 9 EDs did not see any decrease. The other 8 EDs ranged from 0.5% to 29.4% decrease. Sub-analysis showed opiate administration at the HFH ED decreased from 4.60 MME per patient encounter to 4.28 MME per patient encounter, a 6.8% decrease. Conclusions: The HFHS ALTO program decreased opiate administration across the entire system, however, the goal of a 15% reduction in opiate administration was not met. The COVID-19 pandemic likely confounded these results with an increase in acuity and length of boarding in the ED juxtaposed against a decrease in patient volume seen across the country. Additionally, opiate administration was not stratified among discharged, admitted and intubated patients. Continued ALTO program education is ongoing as is further study with more nuanced data analysis, including specific ALTO medication utilization and provider level data. Other departments in the system, such as observation and surgical specialties, have expressed interest in developing similar protocols and QuickLists.

The Tisler reef is a marine protected area located under a ferry 'highway' that connects Norway and Sweden. Cold-water coral reefs are recognised as being important hotspots of both biodiversity and biomass, they function as breeding and nursing grounds for commercially important fish and are essential in providing ecosystem functions. Whilst studies have shown that fishery, ocean warming, and acidification threaten them, the effects of noise pollution on cold-water coral reefs remains unstudied. To study the severity of noise pollution at the Tisler reef, a long-term acoustic recorder was deployed from 19 January 2020 until 26 May 2020. From 15 March COVID-19 lockdown measures stopped passenger vessel traffic between Norway and Sweden. This study found that the overall noise levels were significantly lower after border closure, due to reduced ferry traffic, wind speeds and sea level height. When comparing the median hourly noise levels of before versus after border closure, this study measured a significant reduction in the 63-125 Hz 1/3 octave band noise levels of 8.94  0.88 (MAD) dB during the day (07:00:00-19:59:59) and 1.94  0.11 (MAD) dB during the night (20:00:00-06:59:59). Since there was no ferry traffic during the night, the drop in noise levels at night was likely driven by seasonal changes, i.e. the reduction in wind speed and sea level height when transitioning from winter to spring. Taking into account this seasonal effect, it can be deduced that the COVID-19 border closure reduced the noise levels in the 63-125 Hz 1/3 octave bands at the Tisler reef by 7.0  0.99 (MAD) dB during the day. While the contribution of, and changes in biological, weather-related and geophysical sound sources remain to be assessed in more detail, understanding the extent of anthropogenic noise pollution at the Tisler cold-water coral reef is critical to guide effective management to ensure the long-term health and conservation of its ecosystem functions.","output":"Measuring Sound at a Cold-Water Coral Reef to Assess the Impact of COVID-19 on Noise Pollution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The geographic areas in the United States most affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have changed over time.

There are no reliable candidate biomarkers for monitoring and predicting the response to SCIT. The present study aims to identify novel biomarkers for early predicting the efficacy of SCIT in pediatric AR patients based on multiple cytokine profiling. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 72 children with house dust mite (HDM)-induced AR who were assigned to receive SCIT. The serum samples were collected and multiple cytokine profiling was conducted by Luminex assay at baseline. All patients were followed-up for 1 year and then categorized into effective and ineffective group based on their efficacy, and levels of 48 selected cytokines were tested and compared between the two groups. The potential cytokines were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a cohort with 54 responders and 26 non-responders. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of 72 children completed one-year follow-up schedule with 46 included in effective group and 23 in ineffective group. The results of multiple cytokine profiling showed that 15 cytokines (eotaxin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-, IL-12(p40), IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-4, MIF, MIP-1, RANTES, SCF, SDF-1 and VEGF) were dysregulated between effective and ineffective group (all P < 0.05). Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate analysis models highlighted that serum eotaxin, IFN-, IL-4 and MIF levels closely associated with the efficacy of SCIT in pediatric HDM-induced AR patients. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves revealed potential values of these four biomarkers in predicting the response to SCIT. Further ELISA validation results in the cohort of 80 pediatric patients demonstrated that serum eotaxin and IL-4 levels were elevated in responders while IFN- levels decreased in responders (all P < 0.05). ROC curves demonstrated that serum IL-4 exhibited more reliable accuracy in predicting SCIT efficacy than eotaxin and IFN-. CONCLUSION: Our discoverCvalidation study suggested that cytokines including IL-4, eotaxin and IFN-  may serve as robust biomarkers for early predicting response of SCIT in children with HDM-induced AR.

A progressive loss of gut barrier function (leaky gut) leads to enhanced translocation of microbial products, which in turn contributes as endotoxins to inflammaging. Th17 T cell represents the main immune sentinels in the gut epithelium, preventing aggression from commensal and pathogenic microbes. As HIV infection deeply affects gut Th17 function and increases gut permeability, microbial translocation occurs at high level in people living with HIV (PLWH) and has been associated with the development of non-AIDS comorbidities. Although the inflammatory role of endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide produced by Gram-negative bacteria is well-established, fungal products such as -D-glucan emerge as new contributors. In addition, PLWH are more frequently infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV) than the general population. CMV infection is a well-described accelerator of immune aging, through the induction of expansion of dysfunctional CD8 T-cells as well as through enhancement of gut microbial translocation. We critically review immune mechanisms related to bacterial and fungal translocation, with a focus on the contribution of CMV coinfection in PLWH. Improving gut barrier dysfunction, microbial composition, and reducing microbial translocation constitute emerging strategies for the prevention and treatment of HIV-associated inflammation and may be relevant for age-related inflammatory conditions.","output":"Aging With Grace for People Living With HIV: Strategies to Overcome Leaky Gut and Cytomegalovirus Coinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guinea, like many other African countries, has been facing an unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, since March 2020.

The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 in the nonsurvivors (n = 5) were significantly higher than those in the survivors (P = 0.043 and 0.0001, respectively), while the levels of IL-5, IL-17A, and IL-22 were significantly lower (P = 0.001, 0.012, and 0.043, respectively). The IL-4/IL-17A ratio has the potential to be a good predictor (AUC = 0.94, P < 0.05, sensitivity = 88.89%, specificity = 92.31%) and an independent risk factor (OR, 95% CI: 3.772, 1.188-11.975; P < 0.05) for intermittent positive pressure ventilation (n = 9).

Strategies to reduce workplace stress are needed. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a stress reduction strategy, an Internet-based Mantram Repetition Program (MRP), for nurses caring for hospitalized Veterans. METHODS: A one group pre-/post-test design was used to assess change in nurses' perceived outcomes after participating in the MRP. A post-test-only design was used to assess hospitalized Veterans' perceptions of nursing presence and satisfaction with care. Qualitative interviews were used to supplement quantitative data. FINDINGS: Patients perceived high levels of presence and satisfaction with care. Post MRP, nurses perceived increased mindfulness, compassion satisfaction, spiritual well-being, and nursing presence. Increased mindfulness was associated with greater compassion satisfaction and less burnout. DISCUSSION: For nurses working on the front lines of patient care, the potential for experiencing stress and burnout is a reality. Participating in a MRP could lessen these effects and facilitate nursing presence.","output":"Being present: Examining the efficacy of an Internet Mantram Program on RN-delivered patient-centered care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The welding arc behavior in a wire arc additive manufacturing process was studied while building a ten-layer wall over a base plate using a cold metal transfer (CMT) power source. The real-time recorded welding current, voltage, thermal cycles at the base plate, and the synchronized high-speed arc images with each deposited layer were used to understand the arc behavior. A gradual increase in the peak temperature was noticed from the first layer to the fifth layer, and the same decreased with the subsequent deposition of the layers. The intensity of the welding arc was high during the boost phase of the CMT cycle, where most of the base plate and the electrode melting happens. For a given process parameter, the welding arc intensity gradually increased from the first layer to the fifth layer while remained approximately similar from the fifth layer to the tenth layer. The effect of this arc intensity variation was reflected in the consistency of the deposited bead profile. It was observed that the bead width gradually increased from the first layer to the fourth layer and remained approximately the same from fifth to the tenth layer.","output":"Arc Behavior in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has challenged medical providers.

METHODS AND MATERIALS We retrospectively identified all patients with benign SVC syndrome treated to stent placement between January 2003 and December 2015 (n = 59). Only cases with both clinical and imaging follow-up were included (n = 47). In 33 (70%) of the patients, the obstruction was due to a central line or pacemaker wires, and in 14 (30%), the cause was fibrosing mediastinitis. Covered stents were placed in 17 (36%) of the patients, and 30 (64%) patients had an uncovered stent. Clinical and treatment outcomes, complications, and the percent stenosis of each stent were evaluated. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all cases at first attempt. Average clinical and imaging follow-up in years was 2.7 (range 0.1-11.1) (covered) and 1.7 (range 0.2-10.5) (uncovered), respectively. There was a significant difference (p = 0.044) in the number of patients who reported a return of symptoms between the covered (5/17 or 29.4%) and uncovered (18/30 or 60%) groups. There was also a significant difference (p = < 0.001) in the mean percent stenosis after stent placement between the covered [17.9% (range 0-100)  26.2] and uncovered [48.3% (range 6.8-100)  33.5] groups. No significant difference (p = 0.227) was found in the time (days) between the date of the procedure and the date of clinical follow-up where a return of symptoms was reported [covered: 426.6 (range 28-1554)  633.9 and uncovered 778.1 (range 23-3851)  1066.8]. One patient in the uncovered group had non-endovascular surgical intervention (innominate to right atrial bypass), while none in the covered group required surgical intervention. One major complication (SIR grade C) occurred that consisted of a pericardial hemorrhagic effusion after angioplasty that required covered stent placement. There were no procedure-related deaths. CONCLUSION Both covered and uncovered stents can be used for treating benign SVC syndrome. Covered stents, however, may be a more effective option at providing symptom relief and maintaining stent patency if validated by further studies.","output":"Comparison of Covered Versus Uncovered Stents for Benign Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Obstruction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: In spring 2020, high numbers of children presented with acral pernio\\\\like skin rashes, concurrent with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic.

METHODS: A pediatric\\\\specific dermatology registry was created by the Pediatric Dermatology COVID\\\\19 Response Task Force of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology (SPD) and Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) and was managed by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia using REDCap. RESULTS: Data from 378 children 0\\\\18 years entered into the registry between April 13 and July 17, 2020 were analyzed.

At Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH), a virtual intensive care unit (vICU) was used amid the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to detail the novel adaptations and rapid expansion of the vICU that were applied to achieve patient-centric solutions while protecting staff and patients families during the pandemic. METHODS: The planned vICU implementation was redirected to meet the emerging needs of conversion of COVID-19 ICUs, including alterations to staged rollout timing, virtual and in-person staffing, and scope of application. With the majority of the hospital critical care physician workforce redirected to rapidly expanded COVID-19 ICUs, the nonCCOVID-19 ICUs were managed by cardiovascular surgeons, cardiologists, neurosurgeons, and acute care surgeons. HMH expanded the vICU program to fill the newly depleted critical care expertise in the nonCCOVID-19 units to provide urgent, emergent, and code blue support to all ICUs. RESULTS: Virtual family visitation via the Consultant Bridge application, palliative care delivery, and specialist consultation for patients with COVID-19 exemplify the successful adaptation of the vICU implementation. Patients with COVID-19, who were isolated and separated from their families to prevent the spread of infection, were able to virtually see and hear their loved ones, which bolstered the mental and emotional status of those patients. Many families expressed gratitude for the ability to see and speak with their loved ones. The vICU also protected medical staff and specialists assigned to COVID-19 units, reducing exposure and conserving personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Telecritical care has been established as an advantageous mechanism for the delivery of critical care expertise during the expedited rollout of the vICU at Houston Methodist Hospital. Overall responses from patients, families, and physicians are in favor of continued vICU care; however, further research is required to examine the impact of innovative applications of telecritical care in the treatment of critically ill patients.","output":"Rapid Implementation and Innovative Applications of a Virtual Intensive Care Unit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reading the Special Issue This Special Issue opens with an editorial from Margareth Broodkoorn, previous Chief Nursing Officer at the Ministry of Health (2019-2021).

The results showed that a decreasing of DBP was observed from thermophilic phase and 43.26% of DBP was degraded after composting. The bacterial biomass and diversity during composting were reduced under DBP stress, so delaying the decomposition of organic matter. Moreover, the changes in bacterial community were observed since the thermophilic phase of DBP-contaminated composting.

COVID-19 is transmitted through airborne droplets formed during coughing and sneezing and from the saliva of infected patients. Medical healthcare workers are often at risk of infection. This study measured the aerosol derived from the droplets of patients during the conversation. Methods: Overall, 25 patients aged 21 to 87 years were enrolled. The amount of droplets from the patient was measured under the following four conditions: 1) no conversation with the mask on;2) conversation with the mask on;3) conversation without the mask;and 4) no conversation without the mask. Particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 m or less (PM2.5) and PM with a diameter of 10 m or less (PM10) were measured as representative aerosols at a position of 1 meter from the patients. Results: The concentrations of PM2.5 (g/m3) were as follows: 22.7  10.2 before the conversation with the mask, 24.2  10.2 during the conversation with the mask, 32.3  14.7 during the conversation without the mask, and 23.1  9.9 after the conversation without the mask. The concentrations of PM10 (g/m3) were as follows: 39.8  18.2 before conversation with the mask, 41.9  18.5 during conversation with the mask, 55.5  27.2 during conversation without the mask, and 40.4  17.8 after conversation without the mask. The variations in the PM2.5 and PM10 correlated negatively with the age of patients (PM2.5: R = -0.51, p = 0.0009 and PM10: R = -0.53, p = 0.0063).

PIP5K-immunoreactivity was localized for the first time in the muscle spindles, in which it was found in I-bands of polar regions of intrafusal muscle fibers and also in sensory nerve terminals abutting on equatorial regions of the muscle fibers. This finding indicates the involvement of PIP5K in the proprioception and suggests somehow complicated mechanisms of its involvement because of its heterogeneous localization in intra-I-band structures. In DRG, on the other hand, PIP5K-immunoreactivity was shown to be localized heterogeneously, but not evenly, over apposed plasma membranes of both neurons and ganglionic satellite cells in immune electron microscopy. In addition, no peripheral nerve terminals of DRG showing its distinct immunoreactivity were found in most peripheral fields of nociception and any other sensory perception except for the proprioception through muscle spindles. In contrast, numerous central terminals of DRG in the spinal posterior horn were immunoreactive for it.

METHODS: This prospective study examined the effects of neurophysiological reactivity to positive and threatening interpersonal stimuli, indexed by the late positive potential (LPP) event-related potential, in conjunction with exposure to interpersonal pandemic-related stressors in the prediction of internalizing symptom changes from before to during the pandemic. Emerging adults (n= 75) initially completed measures of internalizing symptoms and an interpersonal emotional images task while an electroencephalogram was recorded pre-pandemic and were recontacted during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 to complete measures of exposure to pandemic-related stressful events and current internalizing symptoms. RESULTS: Results indicated that emerging adults experienced numerous stressful events associated with the pandemic, as well as overall increases in symptoms of depression and traumatic intrusions during the pandemic. Furthermore, significant interactions between LPP reactivity to positive and threatening interpersonal stimuli and interpersonal stress exposure emerged in the prediction of internalizing symptoms, controlling for baseline symptoms. Under high exposure to interpersonal stressors, reduced positive LPPs predicted increases in depressive symptoms while enhanced threatening LPPs predicted increases in traumatic intrusions.

STUDY DESIGN A case-control study: LS using tackers (n=35, tacker group) compared with LS using sutures (n=65, suture group). In addition to clinical evaluation of prolapse, all patients were evaluated for urinary incontinence (ICIQ-SF), dorsolumbar pain, overall quality of life (SF-36 score), and overall improvement in symptoms (PGI-I), one year after LS. RESULTS The patient characteristics (age, initial stage of prolapse,) were comparable in the two groups, as was operating time (240 vs. 210min, p=0.18). There was no significant between-group difference in terms of anatomical correction (median post-operative ICS stage: 0 in both groups, p=0.26) or post-operative complication rates. The incidence of de novo low back pain appearing after LS was equivalent in both groups (50% vs. 25%, in the tacker and suture groups, respectively, p=0.11). However, there was a significant difference in lumbar pain intensity evaluated using the visual analog scale (4 (IQR 0-6.5) vs. 0 (IQR 0-4) in the tacker and suture groups, respectively; p=0.01), and in post-operative quality of life, which was better in patients in the suture group according to all the questionnaires. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the use of tackers for prosthesis fixation to the promontory does not increase the incidence of post-operative dorsolumbar pain, but may increase its intensity and decrease quality of life.","output":"Satisfaction, quality of life and lumbar pain following laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy: suture vs. tackers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2(1C5). Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal neutralizing titers ranging from undetectable in 33% to below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers >1:5000. Antibody cloning revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) as low as single digit ng/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.","output":"Convergent Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Convalescent Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Life chaos, the perceived inability to plan for and anticipate the future, may be a barrier to the HIV care continuum for people living with HIV who experience incarceration.

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor. Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.","output":"CT Scanning in Suspected Stroke or Head Trauma: Is it Worth Going the Extra Mile and Including the Chest to Screen for COVID-19 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Very limited investigations have been conducted exploring risk factors for injury in water polo players. A gap remains in the literature regarding identification of variables that should be considered as part of player screening evaluations. PURPOSE: To estimate whether previous injury, changes in strength, range of motion (ROM) or upward scapular rotation (UR) are related to shoulder injuries in water polo players. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cohort study METHODS: Thirty-nine international-level players participated (19 males). Shoulder internal (IR) and external rotation (ER) peak torque was measured using an isokinetic device (CONtrex MJ). Shoulder ROM was measured passively using standard goniometry. Scapular UR was measured using a laser digital inclinometer. At baseline players were divided into groups: those with and without previous shoulder injuries. Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the study variables between groups. After nine months, a second analysis compared the same athletes, who were then grouped by those who had or had not sustained new injuries. Effect sizes were calculated with a Hedges g. Chi squared analysis compared proportion of injured players with and without previous injury. RESULTS: Eighteen participants (46%) had previous injuries at baseline. Players with a previous injury showed higher peak torques for IR (0.620.15 vs 0.540.13N/kg, p=0.04, g=0.60); larger loss of IR ROM (9.99.1 vs 4.17.5, p=0.04, g=0.68), but no statistical difference in UR (p=0.70). After nine months, there were no statistical strength differences between groups. Loss of IR ROM was significantly higher in the injured group (9.89.8 vs 4.06.7, p=0.04, g=0.68), as well as UR (13.03.0 vs 10.43.3, p=0.01, g=0.81). History of previous injury was significantly related to developing a new injury (OR 6.5, p=0.02). Logistic regression found previous injury and UR most important contributors to injury risk. CONCLUSIONS: Previous injury, changes in IR ROM and UR are related to new shoulder injuries in water polo, but further variables such as rest, training load, or psychosocial factors may explain the incidence of new injuries.

METHOD: The CLOT-COVID Study (thrombosis and antiCoaguLatiOn Therapy in patients with COVID-19 in Japan Study: UMIN000045800) was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 among 16 centers in Japan from April 2021 to September 2021, and we tried to capture the status of the patients in the fourth and fifth waves of the COVID-19 infections in Japan. We enrolled consecutive hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had a positive polymerase chain reaction test obtained from the hospital databases. RESULTS: Among 2894 patients with COVID-19, 1245 (43%) received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The proportion of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis increased according to the severity of the COVID-19 in 9.8% with mild COVID-19, 61% with moderate COVID-19, and 97% with severe COVID-19. The types and doses of anticoagulants varied widely across the participating centers. During the hospitalization, 38 patients (1.3%) and 126 (4.4%) underwent ultrasound examinations for the lower extremities and contrast-enhanced computed tomography examinations, respectively, and 55 (1.9%) developed thrombosis, mostly venous thromboembolism (71%). The incidence of thrombosis increased according to the severity of the COVID-19 in 0.2% with mild COVID-19, 1.4% with moderate COVID-19, and 9.5% with severe COVID-19. Major bleeding occurred in 57 patients (2.0%) and 158 (5.5%) died, and 81% of them were due to respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In the present large-scale observational study, pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was common especially in patients with severe COVID-19, and management strategies varied widely across the participating centers.

METHODS: This study involves a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database containing data on all consecutive patients treated for a T2E between 2003 and 2017 in a single center. Technical success was defined as absence of endoleak in the final angiographic control after treatment. Clinical success was defined as absence of sac growth over 5 mm in the contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed a year thereafter. Statistics included Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. RESULTS: A total of 528 elective EVARs were performed in the period. Thirty-six of these (6.8%) developed a T2E requiring reintervention, a median of 37.9 months after EVAR. Twenty-five percent of the treatments were performed more than 5 years after intervention. Twenty-eight of the 36 treatments were performed via transarterial embolization. For this technique, technical success was 71.4% and clinical success was 62.5%. A subsequent reintervention was required in 35.7% of patients. In this cohort, the rate of aneurysm rupture was 10.7% (n = 3/28), open surgical conversion was needed in 2 of 28 cases (7.1%), and rate of aneurysm-related death was 14.3% (n = 4/28) over follow-up.

To reduce that risk, guidelines recommend to systematically perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) before extubation in order to mimic the postextubation physiological conditions. SBT is usually performed with a T-piece disconnecting the patient from the ventilator or with low levels of pressure-support ventilation (PSV). However, work of breathing is lower during PSV than during T-piece. Consequently, while PSV trial may hasten extubation, it may also increase the risk of reintubation. We hypothesise that, compared with T-piece, SBT performed using PSV may hasten extubation without increasing the risk of reintubation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study is an investigator-initiated, multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing T-piece vs PSV for SBTs in patients at high risk of reintubation in ICUs. Nine hundred patients will be randomised with a 1:1 ratio in two groups according to the type of SBT. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, defined as the number of days alive and without invasive mechanical ventilation between the initial SBT (day 1) and day 28. Secondary outcomes include the number of days between the initial SBT and the first extubation attempt, weaning difficulty, the number of patients extubated after the initial SBT and not reintubated within the following 72 hours, the number of patients extubated within the 7 days following the initial SBT, the number of patients reintubated within the 7 days following extubation, in-ICU length of stay and mortality in ICU, at day 28 and at day 90.

Currently, no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics are available to treat VEEV exposure and resultant disease manifestations. The C-terminus of the VEEV non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) facilitates cell-specific and virus-specific host factor binding preferences among alphaviruses, thereby providing targets of interest when designing novel antiviral therapeutics. In this study, we utilized an overexpression construct encoding HA-tagged nsP3 to identify host proteins that interact with VEEV nsP3 by mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analyses of the putative interactors identified 42 small molecules with the potential to inhibit the host interaction targets, and thus potentially inhibit VEEV. Three inhibitors, tomatidine, citalopram HBr, and Z-VEID-FMK, reduced replication of both the TC-83 strain and the Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain of VEEV by at least 10-fold in astrocytoma, astroglial, and microglial cells. Further, these inhibitors reduced replication of the related New World (NW) alphavirus Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in multiple cell types, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Time-course assays revealed all three inhibitors reduced both infectious particle production and positive-sense RNA levels post-infection. Further evaluation of the putative host targets for the three inhibitors revealed an interaction of VEEV nsP3 with TFAP2A, but not eIF2S2. Mechanistic studies utilizing siRNA knockdowns demonstrated that eIF2S2, but not TFAP2A, supports both efficient TC-83 replication and genomic RNA synthesis, but not subgenomic RNA translation. Overall, this work reveals the composition of the VEEV nsP3 proteome and the potential to identify host-based, broad spectrum therapeutic approaches to treat new world alphavirus infections.","output":"Inhibitors of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus Identified Based on Host Interaction Partners of Viral Non-Structural Protein 3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Refugees share a common experience of displacement from their country of origin, migration, and resettlement in an unfamiliar country.

The objective of this review was to identify the incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19, determine the onset of their symptoms and the risk factors of anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia or dysgeusia for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar on 15th May 2020, with search terms including SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, COVID-19, hyposmia, anosmia, ageusia and dysgeusia. The articles included were cross sectional studies, observational studies and retrospective or prospective audits, letters to editor and short communications that included a study of a cohort of patients. Case reports, case-series and interventional studies were excluded. DISCUSSION: A total of 16 studies were selected. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction was higher in Europe (34 to 86%), North America (19 to 71%) and the Middle East (36 to 98%) when compared to the Asian cohorts (11 to 15%) in COVID-19 positive patients. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 negative patients was low in comparison (12 to 27%). Total incidence of smell and taste dysfunction from COVID-19 positive and negative patients from seven studies was 20% and 10% respectively.

However, it remains a challenging task due to (1) the diversity of scale in the medical image targets and (2) the complex context environments of medical images, including ambiguity of structural boundaries, complexity of shapes, and the heterogeneity of textures. To comprehensively tackle these challenges, we propose a novel and effective iterative edge attention network (EANet) for medical image segmentation with steps as follows. First, we propose a dynamic scale-aware context (DSC) module, which dynamically adjusts the receptive fields to extract multi-scale contextual information efficiently. Second, an edge-attention preservation (EAP) module is employed to effectively remove noise and help the edge stream focus on processing only the boundary-related information. Finally, a multi-level pairwise regression (MPR) module is designed to combine the complementary edge and region information for refining the ambiguous structure.

We compared both vaccination offers following two commonly used frames in vaccination informational campaigns: alerting to the risks of no vaccination for the child itself vs. those in their community. We find that vaccination intention was twice as high when risks to the child are emphasized, relative to risks to the community. Exploratory analyses suggest that these effects may differ between white and non-white mothers. Whilst communication directed at adult vaccination against COVID-19 generally focuses on risks of infecting others, communication about vaccination of children may benefit from emphasizing risks to the children themselves.

The resulting specification permits a flexible yet parsimonious model structure with a very low computational cost. This is especially crucial at the onset of the pandemic when the data is scarce and the uncertainty is abundant. Full sample results show that countries including US, Brazil and Russia are still not able to contain the pandemic with the US having the worst performance. Furthermore, Iran and South Korea are likely to experience the second wave of the pandemic. A real-time exercise show that the proposed structure delivers timely and precise information on the current stance of the pandemic ahead of the competitors that use rolling window.

In case of doubtful minority, medical examinations may be carried out to assess skeletal and dental age. Our objective was to analyse the age assessments regarding individuals of doubtful minority assertion at the Medico-legal Institute of the University Hospital of Montpellier since 2018. METHODS: Expert reports of forensic age assessments performed during the 2018C2021 period were reviewed. Demographic data and results from medical and radiological investigations based on AGFAD recommendations were recorded in each case. When available, conclusions of judicial investigations about the individuals actual age were collected. RESULTS: A total of 265 reports were compiled. Age assessments predominantly concerned males (97.7%) and the main reported country of origin was sub-Saharan Africa (80.4%). The mean reported age was 16.3  0.8 years. The individuals stated age was compatible with the age assessment in 31 cases (11.7%), while expert reports concluded that the age of majority had been reached in 131 cases (49.4%). In cases of discrepancies, the average difference between the stated and the assessed lowest possible age (= assessed minimum age) was 2.7  2.3 years and 6.9  3.8 years between the stated and the most probable age. Age assessments could be compared with actual ages determined by court proceedings in 27 cases, with established ages being systematically higher than the assessed minimum ages (mean difference = 4.4  4.0 years). The difference between actual and stated ages ranged from 1.8 up to 18.9 years (mean difference = 6.4  4.0 years). The used protocol never led to any age overestimation in this population.

This process is apparent in the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants which have the potential to undermine vaccination efforts and cause further outbreaks. Predictive vaccinology points to a future of pandemic preparedness in which vaccines can be developed preemptively based in part on predictive models of viral evolution. Thus, modeling the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein evolution could have value for mRNA vaccine development. Traditionally, in silico sequence evolution has been modeled discretely, while there has been limited investigation into continuous models. Here we present the Viral Predictor for mRNA Evolution (VPRE), an open-source software tool which learns from mutational patterns in viral proteins and models their most statistically likely evolutionary trajectories. We trained a variational autoencoder with real-time and simulated SARS-CoV-2 genome data from Australia to encode discrete spike protein sequences into continuous numerical variables. To simulate evolution along a phylogenetic path, we trained a Gaussian process model with the numerical variables to project spike protein evolution up to five months in advance. Our predictions mapped primarily to a sequence that differed by a single amino acid from the most reported spike protein in Australia within the prediction timeframe, indicating the utility of deep learning and continuous latent spaces for modeling viral protein evolution. VPRE can be readily adapted to investigate and predict the evolution of viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 in temporal, geographic, and lineage-specific pathways.","output":"Modeling the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein evolution in continuous latent space using a neural network and Gaussian process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Many of the drugs commonly used for the treatment of COVID-19 cause QT interval prolongation and increase the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of a large population of pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and compare them with patients with severe cases of influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of Brazilian data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Information System, gathered from January 1st to July 14th, 2020. The sample included 4,784 patients (2,570 with confirmed COVID-19, 659 with influenza, 1,555 with ORV). Outcome measures included clinical features, preexisting comorbidities, pediatric intensive care unit admissions, need for ventilatory support, and death. RESULTS: Compared with the influenza and ORV groups, the COVID-19 group had a higher proportion of newborns and adolescents, as well as lower frequencies of fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and desaturation. Although use of invasive ventilatory support was similar among groups, death rate was highest for COVID-19 (15.2% vs. 4.5% vs. 3.2%, p<0.001), with death risk more than three times the other groups (adjusted OR=3.7 [95% CI 2.5-5.6]). The presence of two or more comorbidities further increased this risk (OR=4.8 [95% CI 3.5-6.6]). Preexisting comorbidities were reported in 986 patients with severe COVID-19 (38%).

Other viruses, co-detected with RSV, may play a role in the severity of respiratory outcomes. METHODS This prospective epidemiologic study of severe LRTI incidence among children born 35 weeks gestational age at 3 sites in Brazil (2008-2010) followed a birth cohort for 1 year post-enrollment. Nasal washes from subjects with LRTI were tested for respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe LRTI requiring hospitalization associated with RSV infection. Secondary outcomes included identification of viruses associated with LRTI, alone or coinfections, and risk factors associated with severe LRTI. RESULTS Among 303 subjects, 176 (58.1%) experienced LRTI. Among these subjects, 162 had samples tested using polymerase chain reaction; 27.8% (45/162) experienced severe LRTI. More subjects with severe LRTI were infected with RSV (30/45, 66.7%) than with other viruses. RSV was present in 33.1% (143/432) of LRTI events tested, 57.3% (82/143) were coinfections. RSV was the virus most frequently associated with severe LRTIs (34/56 events, 60.7%); 50% (17/34 events) single and 50% coinfections. Significantly longer hospital stays were associated with LRTI events involving RSV coinfections compared with RSV single infections (P = 0.012). Infants with severe LRTIs had significantly lower mean RSV-IgG levels at study entry compared with those with nonsevere or no LRTIs (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the association of RSV alone or as a coinfection with severe LRTI and reinforces the importance of providing adequate prophylaxis for susceptible infants.","output":"The burden of single virus and viral coinfections on severe lower respiratory tract infections among preterm infants: a prospective birth cohort study in Brazil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: New coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. There is not enough data for managing acute myeloid leukemia patients with concomitant infection with SARS-COV-2. This is a report of a unique case with acute leukemia and SARS-CoV-2 infection that recovered from both. Case Presentation: a 44-year man was admitted with fever and sweating. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Pan-cytopenia was detected and a bone marrow biopsy revealed acute leukemia. During his management, the patient developed a dry cough. He was transferred to our center for chemotherapy. Chest CT scan revealed bilateral peripheral patchy ground-glass infiltra-tions, indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two weeks later, after antiviral and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, he developed severe dyspnea and became bedridden. Modified chemotherapy was started. He was rapidly recovered and developed complete remission. Conclusions: Immune system response to SARS-CoV-2 is under investigation. Cytokine storm was postulated for acute respiratory distress syndrome in these patients. Severe dyspnea in our patient may be due to cytokine storms and some degrees of leukostasis.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA VAC therapy is widely used, but can be expensive and difficult to apply; it also fails in some patients. METHODS A randomized prospective study of 87 patients (N = 45 in the GSUC arm and N = 42 in the VAC arm) was undertaken between October 2006 and May 2008. The study comprised patients with acute wounds resulting from trauma, dehiscence, or surgery. RESULTS Demographics and wound characteristics were similar in both groups. There were significant reductions in wound surface area and volume in each group. In the GSUC group, the reductions in wound surface area and volume were 4.5%/day and 8.4%/day, respectively (P < 0.001 for both), and in the VAC group, this was 4.9%/day and 9.8%/day, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The reductions in wound surface area and volume were similar in both groups (P = 0.60 and 0.19, respectively, for the group-by-time interaction). The estimated difference (VAC - GSUC) was 0.4% (95% confidence interval: -1.0, 1.7) for wound surface area and 1.4% (95% confidence interval: -0.7, 3.5) for volume. The mean cost per day for GSUC therapy was $4.22 versus $96.51 for VAC therapy (P < 0.01) and the average time required for a GSUC dressing change was 19 minutes versus 31 minutes for a VAC dressing change (P < 0.01). The sum of pain intensity differences was 0.50 in the GSUC group compared with 1.73 for the VAC group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS GSUC is noninferior to VAC with respect to changes in wound volume and surface area in an acute care setting. In addition, GSUC dressings were easier to apply, less expensive, and less painful.","output":"A prospective randomized trial comparing subatmospheric wound therapy with a sealed gauze dressing and the standard vacuum-assisted closure device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

AIMS: To examine the association between undertaking general practice experience and the perceptions of general practice as an appealing future career among prospective medical applicants. To identify socioeconomic factors associated with obtaining general practice experience. DESIGN & SETTING: Cross-sectional questionnaire study in the UK. METHOD: Participants were UK residents aged 16 years and seriously considering applying to study medicine in 2019/2020. They were invited to take part via the University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT). Questionnaire data were analysed using a linear regression of general practice appeal on general practice experience, adjusting for career motivations and demographics, and a logistic regression of general practice experience on measures of social capital and demographics. RESULTS: Of 6391 responders, 4031 were in their last year of school. General practice experience predicted general practice appeal after adjusting for career motivation and demographics (b = 0.37, standard error [SE] = 0.06, P<0.00001). General practice experience was more common among students at private (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31 to 2.08, P<0.0001) or grammar schools (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.72, P = 0.03) and in the highest socioeconomic group (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.28 to 2.05, P<0.0001), and less likely among students of other ethnicity (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.20 to 0.67, P = 0.0011).

The aim of the present study was to describe patient experiences with this procedure. METHODS A qualitative, descriptive design was used and patients were recruited from three county hospitals and one university hospital in Sweden. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews with 13 patients who underwent awake fiberoptic intubation. A qualitative content analysis extracted theme, categories, and subcategories. RESULTS From the patient statements, one main theme emerged, feelings of being in a vulnerable situation but cared for in safe hands, which were described in five categories with 15 subcategories. The categories were: a need for tailored information, distress and fear of the intubation, acceptance and trust of the staff's competence, professional caring and support, and no hesitation about new awake intubation. The patients felt they lacked information about what to expect and relied on the professionals' expertise. Some patients felt overwhelmed by the information they were given and wanted less specific information about the equipment used but more information about how they would be cared for in the operating room. Undergoing awake intubation was an acceptable experience for most patients, whereas others experienced it as being painful and terrifying because they felt they could not breathe or communicate during the procedure itself. CONCLUSIONS Tailored information about what to expect, ensuring eye contact and breathing instruction during the procedure seems to reduce patient distress when undergoing awake fiberoptic intubation.

The striking predilection that osteosarcoma shows for metastatic spread to lung suggests properties and/or lung interactions that generate tissue-specific survival and proliferation advantages. While these mechanisms remain overall poorly defined, studies have begun to describe biological elements important to metastasis. Mechanisms described to date include both cell-autonomous adaptations that allow disseminated tumor cells to survive the stressors imposed by metastasis and intercellular signaling networks that tumor cells exploit to pirate needed signals from surrounding tissues or to recruit other cells that create a more favorable niche. Evidence suggests that cell-autonomous changes are largely driven by epigenetic reprogramming of disseminated tumor cells that facilitates resistance to late apoptosis, manages endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors, promotes translation of complex transcripts, and activates clotting pathways. Tumor-host signaling pathways important for lung colonization drive interactions with lung epithelium, mesenchymal stem cells, and mediators of innate and adaptive immunity. In this chapter, we highlight one particular pathway that integrates cell-autonomous adaptations with lung-specific tumor-host interactions. In this mechanism, aberrant Np63 expression primes tumor cells to produce IL6 and CXCL8 upon interaction with lung epithelial cells. This tumor-derived IL6 and CXCL8 then initiates autocrine, osteosarcoma-lung paracrine, and osteosarcoma-immune paracrine interactions that facilitate metastasis. Importantly, many of these pathways appear targetable with clinically feasible therapeutics. Ongoing work to better understand metastasis is driving efforts to improve outcomes by targeting the most devastating complication of this disease.","output":"Targetable Intercellular Signaling Pathways Facilitate Lung Colonization in Osteosarcoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has increased stress, fear, and anxiety for many people.

The purpose of this study is to understand how mental health clinicians and case workers at a refugee-serving mental health clinic are successfully shifting their face-to-face practice to telemental health, the obstacles they encounter, and what resources they have found to be helpful. Two main themes emerged from the data: (1) refugee mental health providers display initiative and flexibility in their adaptation to telemental health and (2) providers reported numerous obstacles to effective telemental health, including client barriers, tech barriers, communication issues, and the challenge of reading nonverbal cues virtually. By better understanding telemental health when working with refugees, clinical social workers will be more effective in meeting the needs of a population with significant mental health needs and limited mental healthcare access.","output":"Telemental Health Use and Refugee Mental Health Providers Following COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives: The short-term reported antibody response to SARS-COV-2 vaccination in dialysis patients is high, with a seroconversion response rate up to 97%. Data on the long-term durability of this response are scarce. Our objective was to characterize the long-term anti-spike antibody level in dialysis patients. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: In an observational study, we measured SARS-COV-2 anti-spike antibody levels in dialysis patients who completed 2 doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA SAR S-COV-2 vaccine at 1, 3 and 6 months after the second vaccine dose. We compared the response to dialysis patients who were infected with COVD-19 and to a control group of healthcare-employees. Results: One hundred and forty-two dialysis patients who had been vaccinated (ages 64  11.9 years, 61% male), 33 dialysis patients who had COVID-19 infection (ages 54  14.3 years, 55% male) and 104 individuals in the control group (ages 50  12.2 years, 44% male) were included. The response rate in the vaccinated dialysis patients was 94%, 78% and 73% at 1, 3 and 6 months after the second vaccine dose. In the COVID-19 infected dialysis group and in the control group, the response rate remained at 100% over 6 months. The percentage of change in antibody levels between one and 6 months was ?66% in the vaccinated dialysis group, ?28% in the control group (p < 0.001) and +48% in dialysis patients who had been infected with COVID-19 (p < 0.001). A non-responder status at 6 months was associated with a lower albumin level. No serious adverse events following vaccination were reported. In conclusion: the initially high response rate to the BNT162b2 vaccine in dialysis patients decreases rapidly. Our results indicate that an early booster (3rd) dose, at three months after the second dose, may be advised for this population to preserve the humoral immunity.","output":"Waning Humoral Response 3 to 6 Months after Vaccination with the SARS-COV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine in Dialysis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Political decisions and trends regarding coal use for electricity generation developed differently in the UK and Germany, despite being subject to relatively similar climate protection targets and general political and economic conditions.

An exhibition centre was repurposed within ten days as an ad-hoc 3200-bed medical facility (CCF@EXPO) to isolate and treat infected patients amidst concerns of potential COVID-19 transmissions to healthcare staff. This paper deconstructs the implementation of the CCF@EXPO infection prevention and control (IPC) innovation and elicits critical factors which enabled zero transmission of COVID-19 to staff during 100 days of operation using an implementation science framework. Methods: This study employed retrospective analysis using the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. The CCF@EXPO IPC innovation comprised five key elements: (a) physical environment, (b) work practices, (c) tools and technology, (d) staff training, and (e) audits. Contextual assessment was conducted for baseline and 100 th day of CCF@EXPO operations. Actions taken to improve scores between these timepoints were mapped against the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) tool to surface key implementation strategies. Results: Positive shifts were observed in all constructs of the i-PARIHS framework, between baseline and 100 th day. The largest shifts were in work practices, tools and technology, and staff training. Key implementation strategies used included: rapid Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, identifying champions, team building, creating a culture of collaborative learning, multi-disciplinary teamwork, transparency in communications and decision-making, and skillful facilitation. Conclusions: Rapid PDSA cycles anchored by principles to ensure staff safety, was the key approach used in implementation of the CCF@EXPO IPC innovation.

Large-scale and long-term studies of O3 pollution in China are few due to highly limited direct ground and satellite measurements. This study offers a new perspective to estimate ground-level O3 from solar radiation intensity and surface temperature by employing an extended ensemble learning of the space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model, together with ground-based observations, remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and an emission inventory. A full-coverage (100%), high-resolution (10 km) and high-quality daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) ground-level O3 dataset covering China (called ChinaHighO3) from 2013 to 2020 was generated. Our MDA8 O3 estimates (predictions) are reliable, with an average out-of-sample (out-of-station) coefficient of determination of 0.87 (0.80) and root-mean-square error of 17.10 (21.10) g/m3 in China. The unique advantage of the full coverage of our dataset allowed us to accurately capture a short-term severe O3 pollution exposure event that took place from 23 April to 8 May in 2020. Also, a rapid increase and recovery of O3 concentrations associated with variations in anthropogenic emissions were seen during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. Trends in O3 concentration showed an average growth rate of 2.49 g/m3/yr (p < 0.001) from 2013 to 2020, along with the continuous expansion of polluted areas exceeding the daily O3 standard (i.e., MDA8 O3 = 160 g/m3). Summertime O3 concentrations and the probability of occurrence of daily O3 pollution have significantly increased since 2015, especially in the North China Plain and the main air pollution transmission belt (i.e., the 2 + 26 cities). However, a decline in both was seen in 2020, mainly due to the coordinated control of air pollution and ongoing COVID-19 effects.

The mechanisms underlying this rich viral diversity are unknown, but they may be linked to unique immunological features that allow bats to act as asymptomatic viral reservoirs. Vertebrates respond to viral infection by inducing IFNs, which trigger antiviral defenses through IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Although the IFN system of several bats is characterized at the genomic level, less is known about bat IFN-mediated transcriptional responses. In this article, we show that IFN signaling in bat cells from the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) consists of conserved and unique ISG expression profiles. In IFN-stimulated cells, bat ISGs comprise two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast, human ISGs lack this decline phase and remained elevated for longer periods. Notably, in unstimulated cells, bat ISGs were expressed more highly than their human counterparts. We also found that the antiviral effector 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease, which is not an ISG in humans, is highly IFN inducible in black flying fox cells and contributes to cell-intrinsic control of viral infection.

This study represents the first assessment of rates of anxiety and depression in the general population of Ireland during the pandemic. AIMS: Our first aim was to estimate the probable prevalence rates of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression and to identify sociodemographic risk factors associated with screening positive for GAD or depression. Our second aim was to determine if COVID-19 related anxiety was highest amongst those in society at greatest risk of morality from COVID-19. METHOD: Self-report data were collected from a nationally representative Irish sample (N = 1041) online between March 31 and April 5; the first week of the nationwide quarantine measures. Recognized cut-off scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used to estimate rates of GAD and depression. Correlates of screening positive for GAD or depression were assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: GAD (20.0%), depression (22.8%) and GAD or depression (27.7%) was common. Screening positive for GAD or depression was associated with younger age, female sex, loss of income due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection.

However, the sudden shift to remote and online learning, as a result of social isolation during COVID-19, has created a social disconnect, making these immediate regulatory supports less accessible. A need was identified for strategies to support collaborative learning regulation when learning remotely and online. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on models of self-, co, and socially shared learning regulation, a series of resources were developed for students, teachers and parents to support effective online collaborative learning. These strategies embedded evidence-based principles of learning drawn from the learning sciences, including elaboration, retrieval, dual coding and concrete examples. Findings: A set of ten student resources have been developed, accompanied by supporting information and strategies for teachers and families. These resources have been shared with schools across Australia. Originality/value: These evidence-based strategies are valuable, as they are addressing an identified urgent community need. Based on the science of learning, these strategies are original in synthesising effective learning techniques with the three forms of learning regulation to encourage student connection and collaboration in online and remote learning.","output":"Promoting individual and group regulation through social connection: strategies for remote learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 belongs the Coronavirinae family.

It represents 15% of idiopathic NS in adults and the proportion of cases decreases with age as other entities such as membranous nephropathy become more common. Kidney damage associated with Toxicodendron species toxicity is quite rare but there are three lesions already described: proliferative glomerulonephritis, arteritis and membranous nephropathy. Here we report a case of MCD associated to Toxicodendron toxicity. Methods: A 47 year old mexican woman with no history of chronic diseases was referred to the nephrology office. She has a positive familiar history for diabetes and hypertension and she was recently vaccinated for COVID-19. She was referred for proteinuria incidentally found during routine tests three months ago which has been persistent on urinary testing afterwards, she recalls a Toxicodendron spp (poison ivy) exposure which led to an self-limited dermatitis 5 days before the first urinary test was taken. Initial workup showed 3.54 gr/24h proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia (3.2 gr/L) and hypercholesterolemia (256 mg/dl) and a nephrotic syndrome diagnosis was made. Further testing included negative HIV, HCV and HBV serology, normal C3 and C4 levels and negative anti-PLA2R, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, antinuclear antibodies. Normal kidneys were visualized on ultrasound. A kidney biopsy was performed and reported a minimal change disease. Steroid glucocorticoids was administered with methylprednisolone for three days and she was discharged with oral glucocorticoid for maintenance. On ambulatory follow up the patient had a dramatic improvement of the proteinuria. Results: A 47 year old woman developed proteinuria a few days after ivy poison exposure with a subsequent nephrotic syndrome.

We used immunocytochemistry with an organelle-specific antiserum to investigate the morphologic changes of the GA during infection of L2 murine fibroblasts with MHV-A59. Twenty-four hours after infection the GA was fragmented and translocated in the center of syncytia, while the microtubular network was also rearranged displaying radiating elements toward the center of syncytia. Two fusion-defective mutants, which contain an identical amino acid substitution in the cleavage signal sequence of the spike glycoprotein (S), induced fragmentation of the GA. However, the GA migrated only partially to the centers of syncytia during infection with these mutants. Revertant viruses, in which the above mutation was corrected, had fusion properties and GA staining similar to wtMHV-A59. Experiments with brefeldin A (BFA), which induces redistribution of the GA into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), revealed that an intact GA for a period of 4C16 hr postinfection, is required for coronavirus replication and syncytia formation. Thus, during MHV infection, syncytia formation is associated with fragmentation of the GA, followed by a previously undescribed phenomenon of migration of the organelle into the centers of syncytia. The fragmentation of the GA, however, may occur without the formation of syncytia. Therefore, two distinct mechanisms may be responsible for the fragmentation of the GA and its subsequent migration to the center of syncytia.","output":"Syncytia Formation Induced by Coronavirus Infection Is Associated with Fragmentation and Rearrangement of the Golgi Apparatus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The epilepsy team at a district general hospital embarked on a quality improvement (QI) drive as part of the RCPCH Epilepsy Quality Improvement Programme (EQIP). The team comprising of consultant, epilepsy nurse and physician associate, used quality improvement tools and learning from EQIP to improve the care of children and young people with epilepsy. Objectives The purpose of this presentation is to share the outcomes and learning from the quality improvement project. Methods The initial purpose of the project was to devise and implement a feedback tool to use with children and families to create a patient centred service with an ongoing feedback loop. The various tools we used included: 1. Driver diagram to breakdown the task into primary, secondary and ideas for change 2. Process mapping 3. Multiple Tests for change - for example the first test was a simple question to family to ask if they wanted to take part 4. Plan Do Study Act cycle for evaluation and reform of process 5. Periodic discussions with EQIP team & RCPCH&Us to guide the progress. The feedback with the new feedback form was then achieved from 42 respondents. Results Reflection/Learning from the QI process: 1. Being part of a national drive and in company of other teams with similar goals was inspiring and created enthusiasm which is paramount in this initiative. 2. The advice from peers, EQIP team and RCPCH&Us was useful in reforming the feedback questions. 3. The tests of change broke down the steps in easily manageable steps and the driver diagram created a visual representation of task. 4. The improved teamwork and bonding within the team improved the ability to respond to the challenge posed by Covid19 and the epilepsy care was able to continue without any significant impact 5. The platform thus created helped other innovative ideas to flourish to improve care. For example the Team created a WhatsApp video service for families to send videos to, so that prompt review and advice can be given. Some of the feedback results include.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that treatment with the ACE inhibitor Ramipril affects organ-specific ACE2 receptor mRNA and protein expression as well as the serum metabolome in BioBreeding (BB) rats. Twelve male BioBreeding rats were randomly divided into a Ramipril (10 mg/kg body weight) treatment group or a control group (N = 12;n = 6 per group) over a period of seven days. Ramipril treatment resulted in the reduction of acylcarnitines (C3CC6) out of 64 metabolites. Among the different organs studied, only in the lungs did Ramipril treatment significantly increase both Ace2 mRNA and ACE2 receptor membrane protein levels. Increased ACE2 receptor lung expression after Ramipril treatment was not associated with differences in ACE2 serum concentrations between experimental groups.

The variables missing for more than 20% of the people were removed. Chi-Square and Pearsons correlation coefficient were used to remove the clinical variables having less importance with respect to the probability of being discharged or mortality. The LightGBM model was used for classification. The data were split into train and test in the ratio of 0.8:0.2. This gave an output of survival and mortality probability. [Image: see text] RESULTS: The model gave a result with an accuracy of 0.64, a precision of 0.73, a recall of 0.64, an F1 score of 0.66, and an area under the curve of 0.79.

Because it is clinically difficult to differentiate between COP and SOP, this study investigated characteristics that could distinguish between COP and SOP. METHODS: The medical records of patients who underwent lung biopsy for a diagnosis of OP at a single tertiary hospital from January 2016 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients had pathologically proven OP, including 16 diagnosed with COP and 69 diagnosed with SOP. The most common cause of SOP was infectious pneumonia, observed in 57 (82.6%) of the 69 patients, followed by cancer and radiation pneumonitis. The pathogens causing infectious pneumonia were identified in 45 (65.2%) patients. There were no differences in age, sex, and lung function between the COP and SOP groups. Median body mass index was significantly lower (P = 0.030), and median time from symptom onset to hospital admission significantly shorter (P = 0.006), in the SOP than in the COP group. Fever was more common in the SOP group (P = 0.024), and CURB 65, an index of pneumonia severity, tended to be higher in the SOP group (P = 0.017). Some laboratory results differed significantly between the two groups. Lymphocyte counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were significantly higher in the COP than in the SOP group (P = 0.012). Radiologic findings showed that effusion was more common in the SOP group (P = 0.036).

The nature of autoregulation dysfunction in these conditions is unclear. We therefore evaluated autoregulation in 30 patients with preeclampsia, 30 patients with CHTN, and 20 patients with GHTN and compared them with a control group of 30 normal pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN The autoregulatory index (ARI) was calculated with the use of simultaneously recorded cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler ultrasound), blood pressure (noninvasive arterial volume clamping), and end-tidal carbon dioxide during a 7-minute period of rest. ARI values of 0 and 9 indicate absent and perfect autoregulation, respectively. We use analysis of variance with Bonferroni test vs a control group. Data are presented as mean  standard deviation. RESULTS ARI was significantly reduced in preeclampsia (ARI, 5.5  1.6; P = .002) and CHTN (ARI, 5.6  1.7; P = .004), but not in GHTN (ARI, 6.7  0.8; P = 1.0) when compared with control subjects (ARI, 6.7  0.8).

This was not true for women with GHTN or control subjects who later experienced preeclampsia. CONCLUSION Pregnant women with CHTN or preeclampsia (even after exclusion of superimposed preeclampsia) have impaired autoregulation when compared with women with GHTN or normal pregnancy.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional study. METHODS: All adult virtual clinical encounters from March to May 2020 with a principal diagnosis of ARS were reviewed for demographic data and the presence or absence of an antibiotic prescription during the coronavirus shut down in Massachusetts. In-person clinical encounters from March to May 2019 were similarly examined as a control. The rate of antibiotic prescription was compared between virtual (2020) and in-person (2019) visits for ARS diagnoses. RESULTS: There were 2,075 patients in March to May 2020 and 3,654 patients March to May 2019 who received an ARS principal diagnosis at their virtual and in-person outpatient visits, respectively. There was a statistically significant lower rate of antibiotic prescriptions for ARS in 2020 (72.1%) versus 2019 (76.7%).The odds ratio for an antibiotic prescription for ARS was 0.783 (95% confidence interval, 0.693-0.86; P < .001) for patients seen in the 2020 cohort versus the 2019 cohort.

Participants (n = 892; M(age) = 12.77, SD = 0.74; range 11C15; 49.5% male) were randomized by school (n = 8) to receive either weekly SoMe (n = 483) or control sessions (lessons as usual; n = 409) over 4 weeks in their classroom. Participants completed surveys at four timepoints (baseline, 1-week post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-up) assessing body dissatisfaction, dietary restraint, strategies to increase muscles (primary outcomes), self-esteem and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes), and internalization of appearance ideals and appearance comparison (exploratory outcomes). Modest positive intervention effects were found in dietary restraint and depressive symptoms at 6-month follow-up in girls but few positive effects emerged for boys.

Knowledge about the mode of transmission as well as assessing the effectiveness of the preventive measures would aid in containing the outbreak of the coronavirus. Presently, respiratory droplets, physical contact and aerosols/air-borne have been reported as the modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission of the virus. Besides, some of the other possible modes of transmission are being explored by the researchers, with some studies suggesting the viral spread through fecal-oral, conjunctival secretions, flatulence (farts), sexual and vertical transmission from mother to the fetus, and through asymptomatic carriers, etc. Aim: The primary objective was to review the present understanding and knowledge about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and also to suggest recommendations in containing and preventing the novel coronavirus. METHODS: A review of possible modes of transmission of the novel SARS-CoV-2 was conducted based on the reports and articles available in PubMed and ScienceDirect.com that were searched using keywords, 'transmission', 'modes of transmission', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'novel coronavirus', and 'COVID-19'. Articles referring to air-borne, conjunctiva, fecal-oral, maternal-fetal, flatulence (farts), and breast milk transmission were included, while the remaining were excluded. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The modes of transmission linked to SARS-CoV-2 were identified and the available literature on each of these is described in detail in view of the possibilities of viral transmission through various modes of transmission. The review provides updated and necessary information on the possible modes of transmission for the health care workers and the lay public under one umbrella that can also be considered during framing guidelines in order to prevent and control the viral spread.","output":"Possible modes of transmission of Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines is essential for the pandemic control. This study systematically reviewed available evidence on effectiveness of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines in the general population, for improved vaccine policies and strategies. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Using several keywords, a search of Scopus, PubMed, Google scholar and Hinari databases was conducted from December 1, 2020 to June 9, 2021. Eligible studies comprising original studies reporting effectiveness of the vaccines, were included following PRISMA guidelines. Individual studies were assessed for quality using National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute quality assessment tool. A total of 1766 titles were retrieved and 11 were included, out of which only 5 were peer-reviewed. Although data availability was limited, studies suggest equivalent effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality. Vaccine effectiveness increased steadily to about 35 days, with an enhanced effectiveness following the second dose. SHORT CONCLUSION: BNT162 and ChAdOx1 vaccines were associated with equivalent and high effectiveness which increased with time and a second dose in the general population. This encourages continued practice of other preventive measures, particularly during the first week of vaccination, and reinforces the need for a second dose.","output":"A systematic review of effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines in the general population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work was designed to investigate antithrombotic drug utilization and its link with the socioeconomic characteristics of specific population groups in Hungary by a comparative analysis of data for prescriptions by general practitioners and the redeemed prescriptions for antithrombotic drugs.

According to our findings, although deprivation is a significant determinant of mortality due to thromboembolic diseases, clusters can be identified that represent exemptions to this rule: an eastern part of Hungary, consisting of two highly deprived counties, had significantly lower mortality than the country average; by contrast, the least-deprived northwestern part of the country, consisting of five counties, had significantly higher mortality than the country average. The fact that low socioeconomic status in general and poor adherence to antithrombotic drugs irrespective of socioeconomic status were associated with increased mortality indicates the importance of more efficient control of preventive medication and access to healthcare in all districts of the country to reduce mortality due to thromboembolic diseases.","output":"Antithrombotic Preventive Medication Prescription Redemption and Socioeconomic Status in Hungary in 2016: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Infectious Disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak originated recently at Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has already spread rapidly to more than 200 countries and has been declared a pandemic by WHO. It is caused by a beta-coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2. There is no definitive cure, either drug or vaccine, to treat or prevent this viral disease. Recently, the crystal structure of the main protease Mpro has been determined. Mpro is responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the polyprotein essential for the viral replication and transcription, which makes it an important drug target. The discovery of new drug molecules may take years before getting to the clinics. So, considering urgency we performed molecular docking studies using FDA approved drugs to identify molecules that could potentially bind to the substrate-binding site and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). We used the Glide module in Schrodinger software suite to perform molecular docking studies followed by MM-GBSA based energy calculations to score the hit molecules. Molecular docking and manual analysis suggest that several drugs may bind and potentially inhibit Mpro.

A delay in health-seeking behavior could increase the disease severity of patients in the prehospital setting. The combination of COVID-19-related missions and augmented disease severity in the prehospital environment could result in an increase in the number and severity of physician-staffed prehospital interventions, potentially putting a strain on this highly specialized service. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate if the COVID-19 pandemic influences the frequency of physician-staffed prehospital interventions, prehospital mortality, illness severity during prehospital interventions, and the distribution in the prehospital diagnoses. METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted on prehospital charts from March 14, 2020 through April 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, in an urban area. Recorded data included demographics, prehospital diagnosis, physiological parameters, mortality, and COVID-status. A modified National Health Service (NHS) National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was calculated for each intervention to assess for disease severity. Data were analyzed with univariate and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: There was a 31% decrease in physician-staffed prehospital interventions during the period under investigation in 2020 as compared to 2019 (2019: 644 missions and 2020: 446 missions), with an increase in prehospital mortality (OR = 0.646; 95% CI, 0.435 C 0.959). During the study period, there was a marked decrease in the low and medium NEWS groups, respectively, with an OR of 1.366 (95% CI, 1.036 C 1.802) and 1.376 (0.987 C 1.920). A small increase was seen in the high NEWS group, with an OR of 0.804 (95% CI, 0.566 C 1.140); 2019: 80 (13.67%) and 2020: 69 (16.46%). With an overall decrease in cases in all diagnostic categories, a significant increase was observed for respiratory illness (31%; P = .004) and cardiac arrest (54%; P < .001), combined with a significant decrease for intoxications (-58%; P = .007). Due to the national test strategy at that time, a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result was available in only 125 (30%) patients, of which 20 (16%) were positive. CONCLUSION: The frequency of physician-staffed prehospital interventions decreased significantly. There was a marked reduction in interventions for lower illness severity and an increase in higher illness severity and mortality.

Substantial early discontinuation rates are reported by many programs, which may be misconstrued as program failure. However, PrEP use may be non-continuous and still effective, since HIV risk fluctuates. Real-world PrEP use phenomena, like restarting and cyclical use, and the temporal characteristics of these use patterns are not well described. The objective of our study was to characterize and identify predictors of use patterns observed in large PrEP scale-up programs in Africa. METHODS We analysed demographic and clinical data routinely collected during client visits between 2017 and 2019 in three Jhpiego-supported programs in Kenya, Lesotho and Tanzania. We characterized duration on/off PrEP and, using ordinal regression, modelled the likelihood of spending additional time off and identified factors associated with increasing cycle number. The Andersen-Gill model was used to identify predictors of time to PrEP discontinuation. To analyse factors associated with a client's first return following initiation, we used a two-step Heckman probit. RESULTS Among 47,532 clients initiating PrEP, approximately half returned for follow-up. With each increase in cycle number, time off PrEP between use cycles decreased. The Heckman first-step model showed an increased probability of returning versus not by older age groups and among key and vulnerable population groups versus the general population; in the second-step model older age groups and key and vulnerable populations were less likely in Kenya, but more likely in Lesotho, to return on-time (refill) versus delayed (restarting). CONCLUSIONS PrEP users frequently cycle on and off PrEP. Early discontinuation and delays in obtaining additional prescriptions were common, with broad predictive variability noted. Time off PrEP decreased with cycle number in all countries, suggesting normalization of use with experience. More nuanced measures of use are needed than exist for HIV treatment if effective use of PrEP is to be meaningfully measured. Providers should be equipped with measures and counselling messages that recognize non-continuous and cyclical use patterns so that clients are supported to align fluctuating risk and use, and can readily restart PrEP after stopping, in effect empowering them further to make their own prevention choices.","output":"HIV PrEP is more than ART-lite: Longitudinal study of real-world PrEP services data identifies missing measures meaningful to HIV prevention programming."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying the extent to which breakthrough infections are contributing to the spread of COVID-19 can help guide vaccination policies and other infection prevention and control protocols to promote public health and safety.

We sought to characterize asthmatics admitted with COVID-19 early in the pandemic, determine if baseline factors are associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and if the use of ICS may mitigate the severity of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of hospitalized asthma patients >18 years testing positive for SARS-CoV2 from March to June 2020 was performed. Baseline demographic and asthma variables were collected. COVID-19 outcomes and laboratory values were extracted and compared between sex, race, ethnicity, and ICS use.

It has also been found effective for treatment-resistant mood disorders. Previous studies suggest a relationship between BPD and endogenous opioids, therefore our case report investigates the effect of BUP/N on a patient diagnosed with BPD. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old female diagnosed with BPD, having recurrent visits to the emergency department (ED) for self-harm/suicidality was treated with BUP/N. Usage of crisis services, ED visits, and hospital admissions were tracked from 15 months prior to BUP/N to 15 months after using BUP/N. Since starting BUP/N, the length and frequency of mental health-related hospital admissions decreased drastically, as did the number of times that she reached out to community crisis services. Since the dosing adjustment to 6 mg in Oct 2020, there have been no calls to the community crisis lines. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest pharmacological treatment targeting BPD as a disorder of distress tolerance and self-soothing mediated by the opioid system is an effective individual healing attempt.

As a result of RBCI (relative binding capacity index) analysis conducted to rank flavonoids in terms of their interactions with the target proteins, (-)-epicatechin gallate interacted strongly with all the proteins studied. The results obtained from molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) methods also supported this data. According to Lipinski's rule of five, (-)-epicatechin gallate showed drug-likeness properties. Although this molecule is not capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), it was concluded that (-)-epicatechin gallate can be evaluated as a candidate molecule in drug development studies against 2019-nCoV since it was not the substrate of P-gp (P-glycoprotein), did not inhibit any of the cytochrome Ps, and did not show AMES toxicity or hepatotoxicity on eukaryotic cells.","output":"In silico analysis of the interactions of certain flavonoids with the receptor-binding domain of 2019 novel coronavirus and cellular proteases and their pharmacokinetic properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Most medical school applicants use the internet as a source of information when applying for medical school.

This impact has been drastic on the supplier side and, as a consequence of disruptions, strong reductions of production have been estimated. Such a circumstance forces companies to propose innovative best practices of supply chain risk management aimed at facing vulnerability generated by COVID-19 and pursuing industrial improvements in manufacturing and production environments. As a part of supply chain strategy, supplier selection criteria should be revised to include pandemic-related risks. This article aims to propose an answer to such a problem. In detail, a comprehensive tool designed as a hybrid combination of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods is suggested to manage important stages connected to the production development cycle and to provide companies with a structured way to rank risks and easily select their suppliers. The main criteria of analysis will be first identified from the existent literature. Risks related to COVID-19 will be then analysed in order to elaborate a comprehensive list of potential risks in the field of interest. The Best Worst Method (BWM) will be first used to calculate criteria weights. The Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) will be then applied to rank and prioritize risks affecting suppliers. The effectiveness of the approach will be tested through a case study in the sector of automotive industry. The applicability of the designed MCDM framework can be extended also to other industrial sectors of interest. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Current methods utilised in clinical practice are intermittent and only provide a snapshot of fetal wellbeing, thus key signs of fetal demise could be missed. Continuous fetal monitoring (CFM) offers the potential to alleviate these issues by providing an objective and longitudinal overview of fetal status. Various CFM devices exist within literature; this review planned to provide a systematic overview of these devices, and specifically aimed to map the devices design, performance and factors which affect this, whilst determining any gaps in development. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, EMCARE, BNI, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Pubmed databases. Following the deletion of duplicates, the articles titles and abstracts were screened and suitable papers underwent a full-text assessment prior to inclusion in the review by two independent assessors. RESULTS: The literature searches generated 4,885 hits from which 43 studies were included in the review. Twenty-four different devices were identified utilising four suitable CFM technologies: fetal electrocardiography, fetal phonocardiography, accelerometry and fetal vectorcardiography. The devices adopted various designs and signal processing methods. There was no common means of device performance assessment between different devices, which limited comparison. The device performance of fetal electrocardiography was reduced between 28 to 36 weeks gestation and during high levels of maternal movement, and increased during night-time rest. Other factors, including maternal body mass index, fetal position, recording location, uterine activity, amniotic fluid index, number of fetuses and smoking status, as well as factors which affected alternative technologies had equivocal effects and require further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of CFM devices have been developed, however no specific approach or design appears to be advantageous due to high levels of inter-device and intra-device variability.","output":"A systematic scoping review to identify the design and assess the performance of devices for antenatal continuous fetal monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We extend previous studies on the impact of masks on COVID-19 outcomes by investigating an unprecedented breadth and depth of health outcomes, geographical resolutions, types of mask mandates, early versus later waves and controlling for other government interventions, mobility testing rate and weather. We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in new cases (-3.55 per 100K), deaths (-0.13 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (-2.38 percentage points) up to 40 days after the introduction of mask mandates both at the state and county level. These effects are large, corresponding to 14% of the highest recorded number of cases, 13% of deaths, and 7% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states. Given the recent lifting of mandates, we estimate that the ending of mask mandates in these states is associated with a decrease of -3.19 percentage points in mask adherence and 12 per 100K (13% of the highest recorded number) of daily new cases with no significant effect on hospitalizations and deaths. Lastly, using a large novel survey dataset of 847 thousand responses in 69 countries, we introduce the novel results that community mask adherence and community attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Preventive health measures against COVID-19 can reduce the health burden significantly by containing the transmission. A few research have been undertaken on the effectiveness of preventive strategies such as mask use, hand washing, and keeping social distance in preventing COVID-19 transmission. The main aim of this study was to determine the association of the preventive measures with the reduction of transmission of COVID-19 among people. Data was collected during January 06, 2021 to May 10, 2021 from 1690 participants in Bangladesh. A validated questionnaire was used to collect both the online and offline data. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association among the variables. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 11.5% (195 of 1690) among the population. Age, gender, occupation and monthly income of the participants were significantly associated with the likelihood of following the preventive measures. The risk of infection and death reduced significantly among the participants following preventive measures (p = .001). The odds of incidence was lower among the participants using masks properly (OR: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01C0.43), maintaining social distances (OR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01C0.33), avoiding crowded places (OR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02C0.19) and hand shaking (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.09C0.41).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN BALB/c nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with IGF-1R-expressing human bone sarcoma xenografts (OS-1, EW-5, and EW-8) which showed high, modest, or no response, respectively, to R1507, a monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of IGF-1R. An IGF-1R-negative tumor (OS-33), unresponsive to IGF-1R inhibitors, was examined as well. Mice were injected with (111)In-R1507. Biodistribution and immuno-SPECT/computed tomography imaging studies were carried out 1, 3, and 7 days p.i. in mice with OS-1 and EW-5 xenografts and 3 days p.i. in mice with EW-8 and OS-33 xenografts. RESULTS Biodistribution studies showed specific accumulation of (111)In-R1507 in OS-1 and EW-5 xenografts (27.5  6.5%ID/g and 14.0  2.8%ID/g, 3 days p.i., respectively). Most importantly, (111)In-R1507 uptake in IGF-1R positive, but unresponsive, EW-8 xenografts (6.5  1.5%ID/g, 3 days p.i.) was similar to that of the IGF-1R-negative OS-33 tumor (5.5  0.6%ID/g, 3 days p.i.).

In response to the challenges posed by the pandemic, the South African government disbursed R500 billion (US$ 2 879 935 450) economic and social relief package (ESRP) to help fight the negative effects of COVID-19 on the economy and cushion vulnerable societies from extreme poverty for 6 months (May to October 2020). Of interest to this chapter is the delivery of targeted assistance to households and individuals to relieve poverty and social distress. A qualitative research approach was adopted. Data was gathered from authoritative secondary sources, while a thematic approach was utilised to analyse the data. A major finding of this chapter is that the ESRP intervention was necessary to cushion households against income induced food insecurity by providing a social grant, food parcel and unemployment benefits, including paid holidays. However, the intervention was affected by numerous issues including administrative bottlenecks, inadequacy given that the average South African household size is much bigger, irregular costing of food parcels as well as travel and contact restrictions.

METHODS Selective review of the relevant literature, including current guidelines and meta-analyses, concerning diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for chronic leg ulcers. RESULTS The main types of causally directed treatment are: vein surgery to eliminate pathological reflux, interventions to improve the circulation in arterial occlusive disease, and treatment of underlying diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION Physicians providing modern evidence-based management of chronic leg ulcers should make use of their own clinical experience in combination with the best current scientific evidence.

The circulating level of CTSL was elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and was positively correlated with disease course and severity. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection increased CTSL expression in human cells in vitro and human ACE2 transgenic mice in vivo, while CTSL overexpression, in turn, enhanced pseudovirus infection in human cells. CTSL functionally cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and enhanced virus entry, as evidenced by CTSL overexpression and knockdown in vitro and application of CTSL inhibitor drugs in vivo. Furthermore, amantadine, a licensed anti-influenza drug, significantly inhibited CTSL activity after SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and prevented infection both in vitro and in vivo.

Despite of their paramount importance, the transmission routes of SARS-Cov-2 still remain debated among various sectors.

Existing experimental data showed that coronavirus survival was negatively impacted by ozone, high temperature and low humidity. Here, regression analysis showed that the spread of SARS-Cov-2 was reduced by increasing ambient ozone concentration level (48.83C94.67 g/m3) (p-value = 0.039) and decreasing relative humidity (23.33C82.67%) (p-value = 0.002) and temperature (?13.17-19 C) (p-value = 0.003) observed for Chinese cities during Jan-March 2020.

In addition to establishing the exact criteria regarding whether treatment for a newly arriving patient shows a sufficient likelihood of success, it is also necessary to ask whether patients already undergoing treatment whose prospects are low should be moved into palliative care if new patients with better prospects arrive. This question has led to divergent ethical guidelines. This paper explores the distinction between withholding and withdrawing medical treatment during times of scarcity. As a first central point, the paper argues that a revival of the ethical distinction between doing and allowing would have a revisionary impact on cases of voluntary treatment withdrawal. A second systematic focus lies in the concern that withdrawal due to scarcity might be considered a physical transgression and therefore more problematic than not treating someone in the first place. In light of the persistent disagreement, especially concerning the second issue, the paper concludes with two pragmatic proposals for how to handle the ethical uncertainty: (1) triage protocols should explicitly require that intensive care attempts are designed as time-limited trials based on specified treatment goals, and this intent should be documented very clearly at the beginning of each treatment; and (2) lower survival prospects can be accepted for treatments that have already begun, compared with the respective triage rules for the initial access of patients to intensive care.","output":"Withdrawal of intensive care during times of severe scarcity: Triage during a pandemic only upon arrival or with the inclusion of patients who are already under treatment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The 2017-2018 influenza season in the US was marked by a high severity of illness, wide geographic spread, and prolonged duration compared with recent previous seasons, resulting in increased strain throughout acute care hospital systems. OBJECTIVE: To characterize self-reported experiences and views of hospital capacity managers regarding the 2017-2018 influenza season in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this qualitative study, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted between April 2018 and January 2019 with a random sample of capacity management administrators responsible for throughput and hospital capacity at short-term, acute care hospitals throughout the US. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Each participants self-reported experiences and views regarding high patient volumes during the 2017-2018 influenza season, lessons learned, and the extent of hospitals preparedness planning for future pandemic events. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using thematic content analysis. Outcomes included themes and subthemes. RESULTS: A total of 53 key hospital capacity personnel at 53 hospitals throughout the US were interviewed; 39 (73.6%) were women, 48 (90.6%) had a nursing background, and 29 (54.7%) had been in the occupational role for more than 4 years. Participants experiences were categorized into several domains: (1) perception of strain, (2) effects of influenza and influenza-like illness on staff and patient care, (3) immediate staffing and capacity responses to influenza and influenza-like illness, and (4) future staffing and capacity preparedness for influenza and influenza-like illness. Participants reported experiencing perceived strain associated with concerns about preparedness for seasonal influenza and influenza-like illness as well as concerns about staffing, patient care, and capacity, but future pandemic planning within hospitals was not reported as being a high priority. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this qualitative study suggest that during the 2017-2018 influenza season, there were systemic vulnerabilities as well as a lack of hospital preparedness planning for future pandemics at US hospitals.

Using a sample of 172 supervisor-subordinate dyads, we find that incongruence on power distance orientation increases subordinate job strain. Supervisor-subordinate incongruence resulted in more job strain which, in turn, resulted in lower job performance. Results reveal that the alignment of subordinates cultural values with those of their supervisors may mitigate negative experiences and facilitate more positive work outcomes.","output":"The Impact of Supervisor-Subordinate Incongruence in Power Distance Orientation on Subordinate Job Strain and Subsequent Job Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Academic collections, such as COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), contain a large number of scholarly articles regarding COVID-19 and other related viruses These articles represent the latest development in combating COVID-19 pandemic in various disciplines However, it is difficult for laypeople to access these articles due to the term mismatch problem caused by their limited medical knowledge In this article, we present an effort of helping laypeople to access the CORD-19 collection by translating and expanding laypeople's keywords to their corresponding medical terminology using the National Library of Medicine's Consumer Health Vocabulary We then developed a retrieval system called Search engine for Laypeople to access the COVID-19 literature (SLAC) using open-source software Utilizing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's FAQ questions as the basis for developing common questions that laypeople could be interested in, we performed a set of experiments for testing the SLAC system and the translation and expansion (T&E) process Our experiment results demonstrate that the T&E process indeed helped to overcome the term mismatch problem and mapped laypeople terms to the medical terms in the academic articles But we also found that not all laypeople's search topics are meaningful to search on the CORD-19 collection This indicates the scope and the limitation of enabling laypeople to search on academic article collection for obtaining high-quality information","output":"Translation and Expansion: Enabling Laypeople Access to the COVID-19 Academic Collection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: At present, the focus of the fighting against COVID-19 in China is shifting to strictly prevent the entrance of cases from abroad and disease transmission. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to better understand the clinical features of imported cases from overseas countries, which is conductive to formulate the corresponding countermeasures. This study aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 cases imported from Russia through the Suifenhe port, in order to identify baseline and clinical data associated with disease progression and present corresponding countermeasures. METHODS: All COVID-19 cases imported from Russia through the Suifenhe port were included in this retrospective study. According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh edition), imported COVID-19 cases were divided into asymptomatic infection, mild, moderate, severe, and critical groups. Baseline and clinical data, including age, gender, comorbidities, disease severity, symptoms at onset, body temperature, white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte (LYMPH) count, lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), C-reactive protein (CRP), oxygenation index (OI), and the use therapeutic modalities were obtained on admission, and then compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 375 COVID-19 cases imported from Russia through Suifenhe port were included, of whom the asymptomatic infection, mild, moderate, severe, and critical groups accounted for 4.0%, 13.9%, 75.5%, 5.3%, and 1.3%, respectively. The majority of the imported COVID-19 cases were men (61.9%) with a median age of 38.72 years who had no comorbidity (87.7%). Nearly one-third of them (33.1%) were asymptomatic at onset, and common initial symptoms included fever (36.5%), cough (36.0%), pharyngeal discomfort (12.3%), expectoration (8.0%), and chest tightness (5.3%). In total, 180 (48%) and 4 (1.1%) enrolled imported cases received nasal tube oxygen inhalation therapy and high-flow oxygen absorption, respectively; the remaining patients did not undergo oxygen therapy. The values of age, body temperature, WBC, LYMPH, LYM%, CRP, and OI were 38.72  10.50, 35.10  7.92, 5.59  1.97, 1.67  0.68, 31.05  10.22, 8.00  14.75, and 389.03  74.07, respectively. Gender, age, LYMPH, LYM%, symptoms at onset, cough, fever, other rare symptoms, and oxygen therapy showed significant differences between groups (P = 0.036, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, = 0.045, < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with domestic confirmed patients, COVID-19 patients who arrived at China from Russia through the Suifenhe port had significantly different clinical features, and the differences in gender, age, LYMPH, LYM%, symptoms at onset, cough, fever, other rare symptoms, and oxygen therapy between groups were statistically significant. Therefore, detailed and comprehensive countermeasures were developed to manage and prevent another outbreak based on these clinical features.","output":"Clinical features of 375 COVID-19 cases imported from Russia through the Suifenhe port and countermeasures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P91 Table 1(a) Most frequently observed bacterial species (b) Culture type positivity with relation to rates of mortality(a) Bacteria Number isolated (b) Culture Type Number of positives Number of deaths Positivity mortality Enterococcus 67 Urine 104 28 26.9% Escherichia 65 Blood 76 28 36.8% Staphylococcus 64 Skin 40 16 40% Pseudomonas 24 Sputum & BAL 33 20 60.6% Klebsiella 12 Stool 13 5 38.5% Streptococcus 12 Central venous line 8 4 50% ConclusionBacterial infection is observed far more frequently in COVID-19 patients than previously reported and adversely affects morbidity and mortality.

High CDOM absorption in the Mandovi Estuary (Goa) during spring inter-monsoon (SIM) is largely driven by both in-situ production and anthropogenic activities. Here we presented the CDOM variation in the estuary during SIM of 2014 to 2018 and compared it with that of 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak imposed lockdown was implemented. During 2020, low CDOM absorption was observed at the mid-stream of the estuary as compared to the previous years, which could be attributed to low autochthonous production and less input from anthropogenic activities. On the other hand, high CDOM observed at the mouth during 2020 is linked to the autochthonous production, as seen from the high concentrations of chlorophyll a. High CDOM in the upstream region could be due to both autochthonous production and terrestrially derived organic matter. Sentinel- 2 satellite data was also used to look at the variations of CDOM in the study region which is consistent with in-situ observations. Apart from this, the concentration of nutrients (NO3-, NH4+ and SiO44-) in 2020 was also low compared to the previous reports. Hence, our study clearly showed the impact of anthropogenic activities on CDOM build-up and nutrients, as the COVID-19 imposed lockdown drastically controlled such activities in the estuary.","output":"Variations of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter in the Mandovi Estuary, Goa, During Spring Inter-Monsoon: A Comparison With COVID-19 Outbreak Imposed Lockdown Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The objectives of the study were to identify the psychological impacts of lockdown on medical students due to COVID-19 and to discover the educational perplexities being faced by these students during the lockdown. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Medical College (SSRMC), Mauritius. Questions were designed after an extensive review of the literature, so as to ensure relevance to meet the objectives of the study. RESULTS: Out of 700 undergraduate medical students, 663 participated, which equates to a response rate of 95%. 348 (52.5 %) of the students were stationed in their hometown and the remaining 315 (47.5 %) were stationed in Mauritius. 464(70%) of the students suffered from the psychological impacts of lockdown whereas 634(95.6%) of students suffered from the educational impact thereof. Mauritian students suffered a greater educational impact aOR4.236[1.606-11.173].

We also examined hACE2 gene expression in eight global populations from HapMap3. RESULTS: Four missense mutations showed significant minor allele frequency difference between Asians and Caucasians. Molecular dynamic demonstrated that two of these variants (K26R and I468V) may affect binding characteristics between S protein of the virus and hACE2 receptor. We also noted marginal differences in gene expression for some populations in HapMap3 as compared to the Chinese population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were collected retrospectively between September 2009 and May 2019. Electronic medical records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, treatment details and outcomes. All patients were treated according to local protocol based on the national UK SABR Consortium guidelines. Risk-adapted treatment schedules were used depending on the size and the location of the tumour (54 Gy in three fractions, 55 Gy in five fractions, 60 Gy in eight fractions or 50 Gy in 10 fractions). Overall survival outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS In total, 412 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 76 years (range 48-93 years). Histological confirmation was obtained in 233 cases (56.6%). The median overall survival for all patients was 42.3 months (95% confidence interval 37.3-47.3 months), with 3- and 5-year overall survival of 52.8% and 37.3%, respectively. For biopsy-proven patients (56.6%), 3- and 5-year overall survival was 57.3% and 40.1%, respectively. With respect to overall survival, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no significant difference in survival by technique (volume-modulated arc therapy versus conformal; three-dimensional computed tomography versus four-dimensional computed tomography), tumour location, smoking status at first contact, pre-treatment tumour stage or pre-treatment standardised uptake value.

METHODS A retrospective review of patients undergoing primary or reoperative robotic ARS at a tertiary referral center between 2012 and 2017 was performed. Perioperative outcomes and long-term symptom resolution were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 200 patients were included (38 reoperative and 162 primary ARS). Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups. Seven (18.4%) of the reoperative patients had two or more prior foregut operations. Patients in the reoperative group had a longer operative time (226 vs. 180 min, p < 0.001). There were no conversions to open technique, and one patient in the reoperative group (2.6%) had an intraoperative perforation. Twenty of the 38 reoperative patients (52.6%) were discharged within 24 h as compared to 109/162 primary patients (64.9%) (p = 0.09).

Our research focuses on the reduction of fatal risks due to NCDIs and the citizens preferences about health programs and intervention to reduce premature death due to NCDIs. Governments and health authorities need reliable evidence and information to prioritize the interests of their citizens. One crucial piece of evidence to justify the resources spent on NCDIs is the value derived from the interventions on prevention and NCDIs control. This concept is usually called Value of Statistical Life (VSL), meaning the monetary value that individuals place on changes in the risk levels of life- threatening events. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, our study will estimate the statistical value of life for selected interventions for the prevention and control of NCDIs at both national and sub-national levels in the context of Iran. This paper reports the development of a national protocol through Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) method. METHODS AND DESIGNS: Our study comprises several stages: (a) a literature review to identify the attributes and levels of the prevention programs and Willingness to Pay (WTP) for reducing the NCDIs fatal risks; (b) experimental design to assessing, prioritizing, and finalizing the identified attributes and levels; (c) instrumental design to conduct face-to-face structured survey interviews of 3180 respondents aged 18C69 across the entire country; (d) statistical analysis to estimate the results through the Mixed Multinomial logit (MMNL) model.

The occurrence of COVID-19 diagnosis increased, independently of other variables, with pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.60; p < .001), neutrophil below normal range (OR: 4.15; p < .05), lactate dehydrogenase (OR: 2.09; p < .01) and sodium above normal range (OR: 2.34; p < .01). In patients with possible respiratory acute affections we found a higher neutrophil, higher monocyte, a higher NLR and a more elevation in d-dimer. In the Sepsis group showed higher level of white blood cell, C-reactive protein, d-dimer, and procalcitonin. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that patients with COVID-19 have typical radiological and laboratory characteristics. The parameters highlighted in the study can help identify COVID-19 patients, also highlighting which are the main differential diagnoses to be made and the parameters that facilitate the differential diagnosis.","output":"Parameters associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 in emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shortage of reagents and consumables required for the extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples has led many laboratories to investigate alternative approaches for sample preparation. Many groups recently presented results using heat processing method of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this methodology. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes to optimise the heat treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed results published elsewhere, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used universal transport media (UTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, leading to a risk of reporting false-negative results. This emphasises the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most suitable reagents to use depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, a heat processing method is effective with very consistent Ct values and a sensitivity of 96.2% when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method.

The adolescents shared experiences of anxiety related to the earthquakes and their consequences and considered these to be a normal part of their life. Anxiety and feelings of endangerment not only related to their own experiences but were also connected to the impact of earthquakes on their social environment, such as the restoration of buildings. Several sources of support (e.g., talking, social cohesion) were mentioned to deal with the negative consequences of the earthquakes. A lack of trust in the government was an additional main theme, with adolescents mentioning several needs, potentially relevant to policymakers in the Netherlands. Growing up in the gas extraction area of Groningen had many consequences on the adolescents in the study, who felt inhibited from expressing feelings of anxiety and fear.

Several factors may underpin this, including reduced transmission of seasonal viruses and improved adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). However, little is known about how ICS use has changed during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To identify prescribing patterns for asthmatics during the pandemic. METHODS: Using the OpenPrescribing database, we retrospectively analyzed prescribing patterns of ICS, salbutamol and peak flow meters from January 2019 to January 2021 across England. In addition, using a sample asthma cohort at 3 primary care practices in London, we assessed individual prescription patterns. RESULTS: A sharp increase in national ICS prescriptions occurred in March 2020 representing a 49.9% increase compared with February 2020. The sample cohort included 1132 patients (762 ICS treated across both years). Overall ICS adherence improved in 2020 (P < .001), with the proportion of patients meeting good adherence (75%) increasing from 33.9% to 42.0% (P < .001). The March 2020 spike predominantly reflected improved adherence rather than a hoarding effect of multiple inhalers. Female gender and increasing age were associated with the most significant improvements in adherence. A similar spike in salbutamol occurred in March 2020; however, an overall reduction in salbutamol prescriptions occurred in 2020 (P = .039). National figures highlighted a progressive increase in prescription of peak flow meters over 2020. CONCLUSION: ICS adherence rates remain low; however, a modest improvement in adherence was observed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, despite its prevalence in clinical settings, we believe there is insufficient recognition and exploration of TSD in our work with children and adolescents. Because TSD is not often formally addressed during training, therapists across the spectrum of clinical child psychology and psychiatry are often left with the belief that disclosures are rare or inherently negative occurrences that should be avoided. As a byproduct, therapists often develop a blind spot to many disclosures that they make and are thus underprepared to navigate the complex decision-making process that surrounds TSD. In our article, we address the elephant in the room: that most therapists disclose in some form or other. In addressing this topic, we hope to encourage replacement of avoidance and silence with discourse and reflection around TSD occurrences. We explore developmental considerations pertinent to child and adolescent clients as well as suggest a framework for TSD decisions. We feel that improved supervision and clinical practice around TSD is a worthy and achievable aim that merits further recognition, consideration and educational focus.","output":"Therapist self-disclosure: Let's tackle the elephant in the room."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lassa Fever (LF) remains a health burden in several endemic areas of Nigeria, and its toll remains unabated over several decades. Although most studies have focused on virological and clinical considerations, few studies have attempted to address the perceived psychosocial component of LF disease in Nigeria. Evaluation of stigmatization and discrimination faced by LF survivors is an important step in improving individual health and protecting public health. This study aimed to assess LF-associated stigmatization associated among staff and students of the University of Benin. Descriptive analyses of 600 consenting respondents (300 staff and 300 students) sampled using pretested questionnaires was conducted, and the Chi-square test was used to test for significant association between perceived LF stigmatization and predefined variables. LF was a potential cause of stigmatization in a higher proportion of student (n = 162, 57.9%) than staff (n = 112, 39.9%). LF-associated stigmatization among students was significantly associated with sex (p = 0.012) and poor knowledge (p = 0.013) of LF transmission and prevention. A greater tendency for stigmatization was observed among females than males.

Nasal epithelial cells are an important site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings on the endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS Endotypes of CRSwNP are characterized by type 1, type 2 and type 3 inflammation according to patterns of inflammatory cells and the cytokines expressed in nasal tissue. Nasal epithelial cells show the highest expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, among all investigated cells in the respiratory tree. SARS-CoV-2 infection likely leads to increased activation of T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Recent studies further suggest that ACE2 may be upregulated by type 1 and downregulated by type 2 inflammatory cytokines in nasal epithelial cells. SUMMARY Expression of ACE2 in nasal epithelial cells is influenced by inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. Type 1 inflammation in nasal tissue may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by upregulating ACE2 expression. However, clinical association between CRSwNP and COVID-19 is still unclear.","output":"Inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP and responses to COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is elevated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. IL-6 regulates acute-phase proteins, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a key lung anti-protease. We investigated the protease-anti-protease balance in the circulation and pulmonary compartments in SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 ARDS (nsARDS) and the effects of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist) on anti-protease defence in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Levels and activity of AAT and neutrophil elastase (NE) were measured in plasma, airway tissue and tracheal secretions (TA) of people with SARS-CoV-2 ARDS or nsARDS. AAT and IL-6 levels were evaluated in people with moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection who received standard of care +/- tocilizumab. FINDINGS: AAT plasma levels doubled in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. In lung parenchyma AAT levels were increased, as was the percentage of neutrophils involved in NET formation. A protease-anti-protease imbalance was detected in TA with active NE and no active AAT. The airway anti-protease, secretory leukoprotease inhibitor was decreased in SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs and cleaved in TA. In nsARDS, plasma AAT levels were elevated but TA samples had less AAT cleavage, with no detectable active NE in most samples. Induction of AAT in ARDS occurred mainly through IL-6. Tocilizumab down-regulated AAT during SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERPRETATION: There is a protease-anti-protease imbalance in the airways of SARS-CoV-2-ARDS patients. This imbalance is a target for anti-protease therapy.","output":"Protease-anti-protease compartmentalization in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS: Therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a challenge faced by clinicians and their patients, especially concerning whether to proceed with biologics and immunosuppressive agents in the background of a global outbreak of a highly contagious new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2).

However, it can be difficult for users to understand how a predicate was chosen, and these approaches are limited to errors that can be resolved through deletion. In contrast, data errors may be due to group-wise errors, such as missing records or systematic value errors. This paper presents Reptile, an explanation system for hierarchical data. Given an anomalous aggregate query result, Reptile recommends the next drill-down attribute,and ranks the drill-down groups based on the extent repairing the group's statistics to its expected values resolves the anomaly. Reptile efficiently trains a multi-level model that leverages the data's hierarchy to estimate the expected values, and uses a factorised representation of the feature matrix to remove redundancies due to the data's hierarchical structure. We further extend model training to support factorised data, and develop a suite of optimizations that leverage the data's hierarchical structure.

Scattered cases have reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines may promote thyroid disease, including Graves disease (GD). However, the effect of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on GD remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the response of thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAB) to inactivated SARS-COV-2 vaccines. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to observe the differences in thyroid function and TRAB trends between pre-vaccination (n=412) and post-vaccination (n=231) groups at an interval of 2 months. We then retrospectively observed the differences in serum thyroid function and TRAB levels at 3 months before (n=280), 1 month before (n=294), 1 month after (n=306), and 3 months after (n=250) vaccination. Subsequently, 173 GD patients who were not vaccinated with inactivated SARS-COV-2 vaccines were selected for a prospective study. Thyroid function and TRAB assessment were performed before 3 and 1 months and 1 and 3 months after the first dose of vaccination and were then compared by repeated measures ANOVA to explore their dynamic changes. RESULTS: A retrospective study preliminarily observed that the trend of TRAB post-vaccination was opposite of that pre-vaccination (p=0.000), serum TRAB levels decreased before vaccination and increased after vaccination. In this prospective study, repeated measures ANOVA indicated significant differences in serum FT3 (p=0.000), FT4 (p=0.000), TSH (p=0.000), and TRAB (p=0.000) levels at different time points before and after vaccination. Serum TRAB levels showed dynamic changes that decreased significantly at 1 month before vaccination (p=0.000), no significant differences at 1 month after vaccination (p=0.583), and reflected an upward trend at 3 months after vaccination (p=0.034). Serum FT3 and FT4 levels showed similar trends to serum TRAB levels before and after vaccination. Instead, the serum TSH levels showed a continuous upward trend over time. CONCLUSION: Based on the results obtained in both retrospective and prospective studies, we concluded that serum TRAB levels decreased less after inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and showed an upward trend, which may be related to humoral immunity induced by vaccination.","output":"The Effect of Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines on TRAB in Graves Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>In this contribution, the purpose of this study is to extend the established social cost concept of humanitarian logistics into a preference-based bi-objective approach.

Hb levels in g/dl were divided to low (<11.0), normal (11-12.49), and high (12.5). The associations between high hemoglobin levels and pregnancy complications in pregnant women were assessed by calculating the odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using logistic regression. P-values of <0.05 were considered significant. Results: The final number of eligible records was 2565. Pregnant women with high Hb levels in the first trimester were at higher risk of high FBS (126 mg/dl; OR=2.99, 95%CI, [1.675-5.368]) and high systolic blood pressure (140 mmHg; OR=3.048, 95%CI, [1.252-7.421]) at 24 GW. Gravidity was significantly associated with decreased risk of high FBS (OR=0.838, 95%CI [0.704-0.991]). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Hb level at registration could be utilized in predicting the risk of GDM and HP among Palestinian women who never had a previous history of these conditions. The results of this study could have important clinical implications for early screening, which could improve preventive and curative health services to promote the health of pregnant women and children.","output":"The Association Between High Hemoglobin Levels and Pregnancy Complications, Gestational Diabetes and Hypertension, Among Palestinian Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present work we propose a dynamical mathematical model of the lung cells inflammation process in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this scenario the main protease Nsp5 enhances the inflammatory process, increasing the levels of NF kB, IL-6, Cox2, and PGE2 with respect to a reference state without the virus. In presence of the virus the translation rates of NF kB and IkB arise to a high constant value, and when the translation rate of IL-6 also increases above the threshold value of 7 pg mL-1 s-1 the model predicts a persistent over stimulated immune state with high levels of the cytokine IL-6. Our model shows how such over stimulated immune state becomes autonomous of the signals from other immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes, and does not shut down by itself. We also show that in the context of the dynamical model presented here, Dexamethasone or Nimesulide have little effect on such inflammation state of the infected lung cell, and the only form to suppress it is with the inhibition of the activity of the viral protein Nsp5.To that end, our model suggest that drugs like Saquinavir may be useful. In this form, our model suggests that Nsp5 is effectively a central node underlying the severe acute lung inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The persistent production of IL-6 by lung cells can be one of the causes of the cytokine storm observed in critical patients with COVID19. Nsp5 seems to be the switch to start inflammation, the consequent overproduction of the ACE2 receptor, and an important underlying cause of the most severe cases of COVID19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 Protein Causes Acute Lung Inflammation: A Dynamical Mathematical Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aged males disproportionately succumb to increased COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and mortality compared to females.

However, effectiveness against the highly transmissible Delta variant and duration of natural immunity remain unknown. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 325,157 patients tested for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 09 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 (Delta variant analysis) and 152,656 patients tested from 09 March 2020 to 30 August 2020 (long-term effectiveness analysis) with subsequent testing through 09 September 2021. The primary outcome was reinfection, defined as a positive PCR test >90 days after initial positive test. RESULTS: Among 325,157 patients tested before 31 December 2020, 50,327 (15.5%) tested positive. After 01 July 2021 (Delta dominant period), 40 (0.08%) of the initially positive and 1,494 (0.5%) of the initially negative patients tested positive. Protection of prior infection against reinfection with Delta was 85.4% (95% CI, 80.0-89.3). For the long-term effectiveness analysis, among 152,656 patients tested before 30 August 2020, 11,186 (7.3%) tested positive.

Understanding the effect of BTKi's on humoral immunity is timely because BTKi's are widely used and vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 is urgently needed. In 2 open-label, single-arm clinical trials, we measured the effect of BTKi's on de novo immune response against recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HepB-CpG) and recall response against recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in CLL patients who were TN or on BTKi. The primary end point was serologic response to HepB-CpG (anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies 10 mIU/mL) and RZV (fourfold increase in anti-glycoprotein E). The response rate to HepB-CpG was lower in patients on BTKi (3.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-18.9) than patients who were TN (28.1%; 95% CI, 15.6-45.4; P = .017).

In endemic regions, HEV-1 or HEV-2 genotypes are frequently associated with fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women, while with zoonotic HEV (HEV-3 and HEV-4), chronic cases of hepatitis and severe neurological disorders are reported. Hence, it is important to characterize the interactions between HEV and its host. Here, we investigated the ability of the nonstructural polyprotein encoded by the first open reading frame (ORF1) of HEV to modulate the host early antiviral response and, in particular, the type I interferon (IFN-I) system. We found that the amino-terminal region of HEV-3 ORF1 (MetYPCP), containing a putative methyltransferase (Met) and a papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) functional domain, inhibited IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activation and the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to IFN-I. We showed that the MetYPCP domain interfered with the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of the transcription protein (STAT) signalling pathway by inhibiting STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation after IFN-I treatment. In contrast, MetYPCP had no effect on STAT2 phosphorylation and a limited impact on the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway after IFN-II stimulation. This inhibitory function seemed to be genotype-dependent, as MetYPCP from HEV-1 had no significant effect on the JAK/STAT pathway. Overall, this study provides evidence that the predicted MetYPCP domain of HEV ORF1 antagonises STAT1 activation to modulate the IFN response.","output":"The Amino-Terminal Region of Hepatitis E Virus ORF1 Containing a Methyltransferase (Met) and a Papain-Like Cysteine Protease (PCP) Domain Counteracts Type I Interferon Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cochlear implant (CI) assessment pathway for children referred through the newborn hearing screening programme (NHSP) and identify potential reasons for delay in CI surgery at a large UK centre.

Selective purposive sampling was carried out, based on a prior definition of participant characteristics. These were sex, age, ethnicity, date of the last ALRTI, number of ALRTIs in the last year, and treatments received. Participants with a previous diagnosis of ALRTIs were recruited from three primary health care centres in Barcelona and one in Tarragona. Twenty-nine interviews were conducted between April and June 2019. A content thematic analysis was performed. Three themes were identified: 1) risk perceptions and help-seeking; 2) treatment preferences and antibiotic use; and 3) relationship dynamics and communication with healthcare professionals. Accounts of service users sense of autonomy towards their health and power dynamics within the healthcare system were apparent. Supporting service users to become reliable, subjective and agentic experts of their health and bodies could help them to voice their healthcare agendas. Power structures embedded within healthcare, political and economic institutions should be challenged so that healthcare services can be co-developed (with service users) and based on service users autonomy and horizontal relationships. Special consideration should be paid to the intersection of social vulnerabilities. A concordance approach to prescribing could be key to improve the responsible use of antibiotics and to contribute to the prevention of AMR in primary healthcare. The marketisation of health, and the increased demands of private healthcare in Spain due to the financial pressures on public healthcare as a consequence of the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic, are a risk for promoting adequate antibiotic prescribing and use.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HCP exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at our academic medical center from March 15, 2020 to May 16, 2020. Exposure during the study period was defined as having contact with patients or other HCP with COVID-19 within 6 feet of distance for at least 90 seconds when HCPs eyes, nose, or mouth were not covered. HCP with exposures were monitored for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 for 14 days from last exposure and those who developed symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. RESULTS: We identified 33 exposure events; 19 of which were patient-to-HCP exposures and 14 of which were HCP-to-HCP exposures. These 33 events resulted in 959 exposed HCP among whom 238 (25%) developed one or more symptoms of COVID-19 and required SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. Testing was performed at 7.1  5.0 (mean  SD) days from exposure. Of the 238 HCP who were tested, 82% were female and 49% were registered nurses (Table 1). Five HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, but one was presumed to have acquired the disease from a household member with confirmed COVID-19. Among the four HCP who were infected due to occupational exposure, three were nurses while one was an environmental service worker (Table 1). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Despite exposures among HCP, the risk of acquiring symptomatic COVID-19 in the healthcare setting was low with less than 1% of HCP with occupational exposure subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. With the definition of exposure now changed to at least 15 minutes of close contact without personal protective equipment, we anticipate fewer exposures at our healthcare facility and that much of COVID-19 transmission affecting HCP are due to community exposures.

METHODS: Two forms of a stand-alone SF-6Dv2 HUS were developed for evaluation. Form A had 6 questions with 5C6 response choices, while Form B used 6 headings and 5C6 statements describing the health levels within each domain. The two forms were evaluated by 40 participants, recruited from the general population. Participants were randomized to debrief one form of the stand-alone SF-6Dv2 HUS during a 75-min interview, using think-aloud techniques followed by an interviewer-led detailed review. Participants then reviewed the other form of SF-6Dv2 and determined which they preferred. Any issues or confusion with items was recorded, as was as overall preference. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and NVivo Software (v12). RESULTS: Participants were able to easily complete both forms. Participant feedback supported the comprehensibility of the SF-6Dv2 HUS.

The objective of the review reported in this paper was to synthesise material from case studies relating to the organisation, provision and receipt of care for people with SMI who have an end-of-life (EoL) diagnosis. DESIGN Systematic review and thematic synthesis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, HMIC, AMED, CINAHL, CENTRAL, ASSIA, DARE and Web of Science from inception to December 2019. Supplementary searching for additional material including grey literature along with 62 organisational websites. RESULTS Of the 11 904 citations retrieved, 42 papers reporting 51 case studies were identified and are reported here. Twenty-five of the forty-two case study papers met seven, or more quality criteria, with eight meeting half or less. Attributes of case study subjects included that just over half were men, had a mean age of 55 years, psychotic illnesses dominated and the EoL condition was in most cases a cancer. Analysis generated themes as follows diagnostic delay and overshadowing, decision capacity and dilemmas, medical futility, individuals and their networks, care provision. CONCLUSIONS In the absence of high-quality intervention studies, this evidence synthesis indicates that cross disciplinary care is supported within the context of established therapeutic relationships. Attention to potential delay and diagnostic overshadowing is required in care provision.

The 17 selected indicators fell under five domains, namely push factors, pull factors, institutional leadership, international strategies, and satisfaction. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to verify the assumptions of the model. Based on 1005 degree-seeking international students views, this study found that push and pull factors may coincidentally exist, and their functions can be modified by institutional situations. The findings suggested pull factors will, through institutional leadership, impact students satisfaction, while push factors will not. Moreover, the detection of institutional mediation can provide useful information for specific institutes to develop their future recruiting or retaining strategies. These findings enriched our knowledge of the field for higher education sustainable development.

In the case of viruses, the search for antiviral agents involves additional difficulties, particularly due to the nature of the infectious viral agents. Thus, many compounds that may cause the death of viruses are also very likely to injure the host cell that harbours them. Natural products are increasingly appreciated as leads for drug discovery and development. Screening studies have been carried out in order to find antiviral agents from natural sources, and the occurrence of antiviral activity in extracts of plants, marine organisms and fungi is frequent. The evidence indicates that there may be numerous potentially useful antiviral phytochemicals in nature, waiting to be evaluated and exploited. In addition, other plants, not previously utilized medicinally, may also reveal antivirals. Among natural antiviral agents, recent investigations have reconsidered the interest of phyto-polysaccharides, which act as potent inhibitors of different viruses.

The contribution of Ang (1-7) (angiotensin [1-7]) and its receptor (MasR) to the favorable effect of angiotensin receptor blockers on remodeling and function of resistance arteries remains unclear. We sought to determine whether MasR contributes to the improvement of vascular structure and function during chronic AT1R blockade. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with Ang (1-7) or olmesartan  MasR antagonist A-779, or vehicle, for 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by tail cuff methodology. Mesenteric arteries were dissected and mounted on a pressurized micromyograph to evaluate media-to-lumen ratio (M/L) and endothelial function. Expression of MasR and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) was evaluated by immunoblotting, plasma nitrate by colorimetric assay, and reactive oxygen species production by dihydroethidium staining. Independently of blood pressure, olmesartan significantly reduced M/L and improved NO bioavailability, A-779 prevented these effects. Likewise, Ang (1-7) significantly reduced M/L and NO bioavailability. MasR expression was significantly increased by Ang (1-7) as well as by olmesartan, and it was blunted in the presence of A-779. Both Ang (1-7) and olmesartan increased eNOS expression and plasma nitrite which were reduced by A-779. Superoxide generation was attenuated by olmesartan and Ang (1-7) and was blunted in the presence of A-779. These MasR-mediated actions were independent of AT2R activation since olmesartan and Ang (1-7) increased MasR expression and reduced M/L in Ang II (angiotensin II)-infused AT2R knockout mice, independently of blood pressure control. A-779 prevented these effects. Hence, MasR activation may contribute to the favorable effects of AT1R antagonism on NO bioavailability and microvascular remodeling, independently of AT2R activation and blood pressure control.","output":"Mas Receptor Activation Contributes to the Improvement of Nitric Oxide Bioavailability and Vascular Remodeling During Chronic AT1R (Angiotensin Type-1 Receptor) Blockade in Experimental Hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health concern worldwide.

The scoping review based on this protocol aims to investigate current technologies for vision screening, what vision tests can be complemented by technologies, and how these can support vision screening by providing measurements. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The planned review will utilise the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) tool. Electronic search will be performed in databases, including Web of Science, MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, Engineering Village, Cochrane and Embase. We will perform a systematic search in selected reference databases without the limitation on publications dates, or country of studies. Reference management software, like EndNote and DistillerSR, will be used to remove duplicate entries. Two authors will independently analyse the studies for inclusion eligibility. Conflicts will be resolved by discussion. We will extract the types of technologies, types of vision tests they complement and the measurements for the included studies. Overall findings will be synthesised by thematic analysis and mapping to the logic model.

Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer leads to mucositis in almost all patients and severe radiation-mucositis affects their quality of life (QOL). However, little is known about the NLR for severe mucositis. Therefore, this study aimed to show the association between the NLR and severe radiation-induced mucositis in hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we determined the incidence of grade 3 mucositis in 99 patients who were receiving definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to investigate the characteristics of grade 3 mucositis. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to evaluate the occurrence of grade 3 mucositis between two groups with high (NLR > 5) or low (NLR < 5) systemic inflammation. RESULTS: The incidence of grade 3 mucositis was 39%. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR (Odd ratio [OR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.16; p = 0.016) and smoking (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00-1.03; p = 0.048) were significantly associated with grade 3 mucositis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR was independently associated with grade 3 mucositis (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01-1.17; p = 0.021). Kaplan-Meier curves also showed that patients with higher NLR (NLR > 5) prior to radiotherapy developed grade 3 mucositis more frequently than those with lower NLR during radiotherapy (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a higher NLR is a risk factor and predictor of severe radiation-induced mucositis in hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer patients.","output":"Association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with severe radiation-induced mucositis in pharyngeal or laryngeal cancer patients: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regional promotion and centralized correction in Tokyo have long been the goals of the Government of Japan.

Therefore, in this paper, we will consider this problem by performing correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis with the inflow rate and the excess inflow rate of the population as the dependent variables, using recent government statistics for each prefecture. As a result of the analysis, in addition to economic factor variables, variables of climatic, amenity, and human factors correlated with the inflow rate, and it was shown that the model has the greatest explanatory power when multiple factors were used in addition to specific factors.

On the other hand, it has been well known that COVID-19 infection is largely associated with several neurological disorders. Taken together these findings and given the high levels of expression of CTSB/L in the brain, we here proposed a reasonable hypothesis about the involvement of CTSB/L in the neurological manifestations linked to COVID-19. Pharmacological inhibitions of the CTSB/L could be a potential therapeutic target to block the virus entry as well as to mitigate the brain disorders. To this end, we utilized the network-based drug repurposing analyses to identify the possible drugs that can target CTSB/L. This study identifies the molecules like cyclosporine, phenytoin, and paclitaxel as potential drugs with binding ability to the CTSB/L.

A well-known result is that banning imports may be optimal in monopolistic sectors, such as the digital sector. The novel result of this paper is that banning exports can also be optimal, and in some cases superior, as it prevents technological diffusion to a challenger that may eventually become the global supplier, capturing monopoly rents and posing cybersecurity risks.

WhatsApp is being used as an important source of COVID-19-related information during the current pandemic. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, limited studies have investigated the role of WhatsApp as a source of communication, information, or misinformation during crisis situations. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the vulnerability of demographic cohorts in a developing country toward COVID-19-related misinformation shared via WhatsApp. We also aimed to identify characteristics of WhatsApp messages associated with increased credibility of misinformation. METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey and designed a scoring system based on theories supported by the existing literature. Vulnerability (K) was measured as a ratio of the respondent's score to the maximum score. Respondents were stratified according to age and occupation, and Kmean was calculated and compared among each subgroup using single-factor analysis of variance and Hochberg GT2 tests. The questionnaire evaluated the respondents' opinion of the veracity of coronavirus-related WhatsApp messages. The responses to the false-proven messages were compared using z test between the 2 groups: coronavirus-related WhatsApp messages with an attached link and/or source and those without. RESULTS: We analyzed 1137 responses from WhatsApp users in India. Users aged over 65 years had the highest vulnerability (Kmean=0.38, 95% CI 0.341-0.419) to misinformation. Respondents in the age group 19-25 years had significantly lower vulnerability (Kmean=0.31, 95% CI 0.301-0.319) than those aged over 25 years (P<.05). The vulnerability of users employed in elementary occupations was the highest (Kmean=0.38, 95% CI 0.356-0.404), and it was significantly higher than that of professionals and students (P<.05). Interestingly, the vulnerability of healthcare workers was not significantly different from that of other occupation groups (P>.05). We found that false CRWMs with an attached link and/or source were marked true 6 times more often than false CRWMs without an attached link or source (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that in a developing country, WhatsApp users aged over 65 years and those involved in elementary occupations were found to be the most vulnerable to false information disseminated via WhatsApp. Health care workers, who are otherwise considered as experts with regard to this global health care crisis, also shared this vulnerability to misinformation with other occupation groups. Our findings also indicated that the presence of an attached link and/or source falsely validating an incorrect message adds significant false credibility, making it appear true. These results indicate an emergent need to address and rectify the current usage patterns of WhatsApp users.

Hospital data were compared across quarters (Q) in 2020, with day 1 of Q2 representing the start of the pandemic in Sierra Leone. Admissions are reported in total and disaggregated by sex, service (surgical, medical, maternity and paediatric) and hospital type (government or private non-profit). Referrals in 2020 were compared with 2019 to assess whether any changes were the result of seasonality. Comparisons were performed using Students t-test. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: From Q1 to Q2, weekly mean hospital admissions decreased by 14.7% (p=0.005). Larger decreases were seen in male 18.8% than female 12.5% admissions. The largest decreases were in surgical admissions, a 49.8% decrease (p<0.001) and medical admissions, a 28.7% decrease (p=0.002). Paediatric and maternity admissions did not significantly change. Total operations decreased by 13.9% (p<0.001), while caesarean sections and facility-based deliveries showed significant increases: 12.7% (p=0.014) and 7.5% (p=0.03), respectively. In Q3, total admissions remained 13.2% lower (p<0.001) than Q1. Mean weekly referrals were lower in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 compared with 2019, suggesting findings were unlikely to be seasonal. Qualitative analysis identified both supply-side factors, prioritisation of essential services, introduction of COVID-19 services and pausing elective care, and demand-side factors, fear of nosocomial infection and financial hardship. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated a decrease in hospital utilisation during COVID-19, the decrease is less than reported in other countries during COVID-19 and less than reported during the Ebola epidemic.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital utilisation in Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The question of an optimal strategy and outcomes in COVID-19 tracheostomy has not been answered yet. The critical focus in our case study is to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy on intubated COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A multicentric prospective observational study of 1890 COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy across 120 hospitals was conducted over 7 weeks in Spain (March 28 to May 15, 2020). Data were collected with an innovative approach: instant messaging via WhatsApp. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: complications, achieved weaning and decannulation and survival. RESULTS: We performed 1,461 surgical (81.3%) and 429 percutaneous tracheostomies. Median timing of tracheostomy was 12 days (4-42 days) since orotracheal intubation. A close follow-up of 1616/1890 (85.5%) patients at the cut-off time of 1-month follow-up showed that in 842 (52.1%) patients, weaning was achieved, while 391 (24.2%) were still under mechanical ventilation and 383 (23.7%) patients had died from COVID-19. Decannulation among those in whom weaning was successful (n = 842) was achieved in 683 (81%) patients. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy. The critical focus is the unprecedented amount of tracheostomies: 1890 in 7 weeks. Weaning could be achieved in over half of the patients with follow-up.

Data was collected using a standardized protocol PedsQL, Sickle Cell Disease Module version 3, designed for youth within the ages of 13 to 18 years and 19 to 35 years and their parents and guardian if underage. The survey captured data on patients pain impact, hurts, management, treatments, communication with their caregivers and their guardians perception. The survey was performed online, or face to face and telephone interview if online was not possible. Contacts of patients and parents were obtained from the database of Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria. A total of 105 (80 patients and 25 parents) participants responded to the survey. The age distribution of respondents was highest at 56 percent in the age bracket of 13 to 18 years old. Pain crisis were very common amongst patients. The survey revealed that the type of treatment or care received at these times determined whether or not the patients visited the hospital when they had pain crises. In addition, as patients reports an increase in ill treatment they experienced in the hands of health care givers, so did the fear of accessing treatment during the COVID pandemic. It was observed that the frequency of pain crises experienced by SCD patients was proportional to the patients quality of life (the higher the frequency of pains, the worse the QoL). As a follow-up, a more detailed study would be required, as this study was limited in the capturing of the demographics, sex and number of participants; Considering the number of persons living with SCD that visit the Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria, (approx. 3,000 patients), the number of responses in this study was low (105). It is believed that a higher number of responses would have given more information about the Sickle Cell burden and the QoL of persons living with SCD in Lagos during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recently, researchers have identified that metformin not only has an efficient capacity to lower glucose but also exerts anti-aging effects by regulating intracellular signaling molecules. With the accelerating aging process and mankinds desire for a long and healthy life, studies on aging have witnessed an unprecedented boom. Osteoporosis, sarcopenia, degenerative osteoarthropathy, and frailty are age-related diseases of the musculoskeletal system. The decline in motor function is a problem that many elderly people have to face, and in serious cases, they may even fail to self-care, and their quality of life will be seriously reduced. Therefore, exploring potential treatments to effectively prevent or delay the progression of aging-related diseases is essential to promote healthy aging. In this review, we first briefly describe the origin of metformin and the aging of the movement system, and next review the evidence associated with its ability to extend lifespan. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms related to the modulation of aging in the musculoskeletal system by metformin, mainly its contribution to bone homeostasis, muscle aging, and joint degeneration.

In the Cumbaya Valley of Quito, Ecuador, community health clinics sponsor social clubs for specific populations to address this important aspect of health. Men, who tend to be less socially integrated than women, are largely absent from these programs. OBJECTIVE: This paper investigates the quality and extent of mens social integration in the Cumbaya Valley of Quito to understand why men are less likely to attend the community health center clubs and to develop ideas for increasing male participation, which may differ from current methods. METHODS: A composite survey was used to interview 100 men over the age of 40 to collect data on their social health and information regarding their interaction with community health center clubs and other local social groups. FINDINGS: Social integration scores were varied, with some men having high social scores and others having low scores. Men generally had greater access to affectionate and tangible support but lower access to emotional support and positive social interaction. Men spend far more social time with their families and much less with friends and neighbors. Regression analysis revealed that social scores have a relationship with age and education. Qualitative results suggest gendered expectations of men in the community have negatively impacted their willingness to engage in community health groups. Participants also provided suggestions, including specific sports, gardening, and meal distribution, to promote male participation. CONCLUSION: There is a strong need to increase services, strategies, and programs that address the lack of social integration experienced by men. This paper presents the particular role community clinics can play in increasing the social well-being of its male patients.","output":"Social Integration and Community Health Participation of Elderly Men in Peri-Urban Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the transformational learning theory and action research method, this study captured the experiences of students from health-related disciplines in the cultural immersion program From the World to Western.

Treating trichotillomania with pharmacotherapy is complicated since there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. AREAS COVERED The databases PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Evidence-based Medicine Reviews, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched, yielding a total of 10 open trials and 10 controlled trials selected. This review aims to examine pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of trichotillomania in adults and makes recommendations for the assessment and management of the disorder. EXPERT OPINION There is preliminary evidence that clomipramine, olanzapine, and N-acetylcysteine may be effective in cases of trichotillomania, however, given the paucity of controlled studies with large sample sizes, decisions regarding the use of drugs should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the severity of trichotillomania and the nature of psychiatric comorbidity.","output":"Pharmacotherapy for trichotillomania in adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Olive stone biochars (OSBC), both pristine and following magnetization (MAGCOSBC), were utilized as eco-friendly and cost-effective sorbents for the antituberculosis, clofazimine (CLOF).

SEM analysis showed meso- and macroporous surfaces. BET data showed that the MAGCOSBC possesses a larger surface area (33.82 m2/g) and pore volume. Batch adsorption studies were conducted following the experimental scenario of BoxCBehnken (BB) design. The adsorption efficiency of both adsorbents was evaluated in terms of the % removal (%R) and the sorption capacity (qe, mg/g). Dependent variables (%R and qe) were maximized as a function of four factors: pH, sorbent dose (AD), the concentration of CLOF ([CLOF]), and contact time (CT). A %R of 98.10% and 98.61% could be obtained using OSBC and MAGCOSBC, respectively. Equilibrium studies indicated that both Langmuir and Freundlich models were perfectly fit for adsorption of CLOF. Maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of 174.03 mg/g was obtained using MAGCOSBC. Adsorption kinetics could be best illustrated using the pseudo-second-order (PSO) model.

Empiric antibacterials are often employed though frequency of bacterial coinfection superinfection is debated and concerns raised about selection of bacterial antimicrobial resistance. We evaluated sputum bacterial and fungal growth from 165 intubated COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Objectives were to determine frequency of culture positivity, risk factors for and outcomes of positive cultures, and timing of antimicrobial resistance development. METHODS: Retrospective reviews were conducted of COVID-19 pneumonia patients requiring intubation admitted to a 1058-bed four community hospital system on the east coast United States, March 1 to May 1, 2020. Length of stay (LOS) was expressed as mean (standard deviation); 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was computed for overall mortality rate using the exact binomial method, and overall mortality was compared across each level of a potential risk factor using a Chi-Square Test of Independence. All tests were two-sided, and significance level was set to 0.05. RESULTS: Average patient age was 68.7 years and LOS 19.9 days. Eighty-three patients (50.3% of total) originated from home, 10 from group homes (6.1% of total), and 72 from nursing facilities (43.6% of total). Mortality was 62.4%, highest for nursing home residents (80.6%). Findings from 253 sputum cultures overall did not suggest acute bacterial or fungal infection in 73 (45%) of 165 individuals sampled within 24 h of intubation. Cultures  1 week following intubation did grow potential pathogens in 72 (64.9%) of 111 cases with 70.8% consistent with late pneumonia and 29.2% suggesting colonization. Twelve (10.8% of total) of these late post-intubation cultures revealed worsened antimicrobial resistance predominantly in Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, or Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: In severe COVID-19 pneumonia, a radiographic ground glass interstitial pattern and lack of purulent sputum prior to/around the time of intubation correlated with no culture growth or recovery of normal oral flora  yeast. Discontinuation of empiric antibacterials should be considered in these patients aided by other clinical findings, history of prior antimicrobials, laboratory testing, and overall clinical course. Continuing longterm hospitalisation and antibiotics are associated with sputum cultures reflective of hospital-acquired microbes and increasing antimicrobial resistance.

Moreover, the factors that are associated with beneficial response from tocilizumab are unknown in COVID-19. We aimed to study the clinical outcomes especially mortality vis--vis clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients administered tocilizumab and identify predictors of mortality benefits amongst deceased vs recovered COVID-19 patients. Methods The present study is a retrospective observation of the demographic, clinical, and biological data of all the consecutive patients treated with tocilizumab for COVID-19 pneumonia at the COVID tertiary care centre from July 2020 to October 2020 at Ahmedabad, India. We compared the deceased group with those who recovered/discharged and evaluated patient-level demographics, clinical attributes, and laboratory investigations available to identify subgroups in whom tocilizumab reduced mortality. Results Of the 112 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 56.84  13.56 years and 80 (71.4%) were male. There were 97 (86.6%) patients in the survivors and 15 (13.39%) in the deceased group. Deceased were older than the recovered group (mean: 66.14, SD: 14.41 vs mean: 55.36, SD: 12.98; p=0.04). Hypertension (33.03%) was the commonest comorbidity observed. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with cancer and type-2 diabetes (p=0.05 and p=0.01, respectively). Level of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) showed trends towards significance as a predictor of mortality (p=0.07 and p=0.08, respectively) not reaching significance. D\\\\dimer level > 5,000 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL) was the significant predictor of subsequent deaths (p<0.0001). Fourteen patients reported adverse events of tocilizumab. Patients who developed in-hospital complications (such as septic or vasodilatory shock and/or sepsis, acute kidney injury, multiorgan dysfunction) had significantly higher mortality (p<0.0001, p=0.009, and p=0.03, respectively). Conclusion Tocilizumab might be more beneficial in younger patients without sepsis/ septic shock, acute kidney injury, multiorgan dysfunction, and who were non-ventilated.

Studies on social epidemiology have found a clear positive association between precarious employment and health, but the pathways and mechanisms to explain such a relationship are not well-understood. This project aims to fill this gap from an interdisciplinary perspective, integrating the social and biomedical standpoints to comprehensively address the complex web of consequences of precarious employment and its effects on workers' stress, health and well-being, including health inequalities. The project objectives are: (1) to analyze the association between multidimensional precarious employment and chronic stress among salaried workers in Barcelona, measured both subjectively and using biological indicators; (2) to improve our understanding of the pathways and mechanisms linking precarious employment with stress, health and well-being; and (3) to analyze health inequalities by gender, social class and place of origin for the first two objectives. The study follows a sequential mixed design. First, secondary data from the 2017 Survey on Workers and the Unemployed of Barcelona is analyzed (N = 1,264), yielding a social map of precarious employment in Barcelona that allows the contextualization of the scope and characteristics of this phenomenon. Drawing on these results, a second survey on a smaller sample (N = 255) on precarious employment, social precariousness and stress is envisaged. This study population is also asked to provide a hair sample to have their levels of cortisol and its related components, biomarkers of chronic stress, analyzed.

Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is a selective 2-agonist that is frequently applied during perioperative periods for its analgesia effect; however, its ability to provide protection against intestinal I/R injury and underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS To fill this gap, the protection of Dex against I/R injury was examined in a rat model of intestinal I/R injury and in an inflammation cell model, which was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) plus interferon-gamma (IFN-) stimulation. RESULTS Our data demonstrated that Dex had protective effects against intestinal I/R injury in rats. Dex was also found to promote mitophagy and inhibit apoptosis of enteric glial cells (EGCs) in the inflammation cell model. PINK1 downregulated p53 expression by promoting the phosphorylation of HDAC3. Further studies revealed that Dex provided protection against experimentally induced intestinal I/R injury in rats, while enhancing mitophagy, and suppressing apoptosis of EGCs through SIRT3-mediated PINK1/HDAC3/p53 pathway in the inflammation cell model. CONCLUSION Hence, these findings provide evidence supporting the protective effect of Dex against intestinal I/R injury and its underlying mechanism involving the SIRT3/PINK1/HDAC3/p53 axis.","output":"Dexmedetomidine inhibits mitochondria damage and apoptosis of enteric glial cells in experimental intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury via SIRT3-dependent PINK1/HDAC3/p53 pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to lay the basis for risk stratification based on demographic data and health records. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The design was a matched case-control study. Severe COVID-19 was defined as either a positive nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the national database followed by entry to a critical care unit or death within 28 days or a death certificate with COVID-19 as underlying cause. Up to 10 controls per case matched for sex, age, and primary care practice were selected from the national population register. For this analysis-based on ascertainment of positive test results up to 6 June 2020, entry to critical care up to 14 June 2020, and deaths registered up to 14 June 2020-there were 36,948 controls and 4,272 cases, of which 1,894 (44%) were care home residents. All diagnostic codes from the past 5 years of hospitalisation records and all drug codes from prescriptions dispensed during the past 240 days were extracted. Rate ratios for severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. In a logistic regression using the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios for severe disease were 2.87 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.63 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio 21.4 (95% CI 19.1-23.9, p = 8  10-644). Univariate rate ratios for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 2.75 (95% CI 1.96-3.88, p = 6  10-9) for type 1 diabetes, 1.60 (95% CI 1.48-1.74, p = 8  10-30) for type 2 diabetes, 1.49 (95% CI 1.37-1.61, p = 3  10-21) for ischemic heart disease, 2.23 (95% CI 2.08-2.39, p = 4  10-109) for other heart disease, 1.96 (95% CI 1.83-2.10, p = 2  10-78) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 4.06 (95% CI 3.15-5.23, p = 3  10-27) for chronic kidney disease, 5.4 (95% CI 4.9-5.8, p = 1  10-354) for neurological disease, 3.61 (95% CI 2.60-5.00, p = 2  10-14) for chronic liver disease, and 2.66 (95% CI 1.86-3.79, p = 7  10-8) for immune deficiency or suppression. Seventy-eight percent of cases and 52% of controls had at least one listed condition (51% of cases and 11% of controls under age 40). Severe disease was associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past 9 months and with at least one hospital admission in the past 5 years (rate ratios 3.10 [95% CI 2.59-3.71] and 2.75 [95% CI 2.53-2.99], respectively) even after adjusting for the listed conditions. In those without listed conditions, significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. Age and sex provided 2.58 bits of information for discrimination. A model based on demographic variables, listed conditions, hospital diagnoses, and prescriptions provided an additional 1.07 bits (C-statistic 0.804). A limitation of this study is that records from primary care were not available. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that, along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with past medical history across all age groups. Many comorbidities beyond the risk conditions designated by public health agencies contribute to this. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in health records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the epidemic is over.","output":"Rapid Epidemiological Analysis of Comorbidities and Treatments as risk factors for COVID-19 in Scotland (REACT-SCOT): A population-based case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the July 2020 first wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Zambia, PCR-measured prevalence was 13.4% among outpatients at health facilities, an absolute difference of 5.7% compared with prevalence among community members.

Here we investigated the impact of the NHS COVID-19 app for England and Wales, from its launch on 24 September 2020 through to the end of December 2020. It was used regularly by approximately 16.5 million users (28% of the total population), and sent approximately 1.7 million exposure notifications: 4.4 per index case consenting to contact tracing. We estimated that the fraction of app-notified individuals subsequently showing symptoms and testing positive (the secondary attack rate, SAR) was 6.0%, comparable to the SAR for manually traced close contacts. We estimated the number of cases averted by the app using two complementary approaches. Modelling based on the notifications and SAR gave 284,000 (108,000-450,000), and statistical comparison of matched neighbouring local authorities gave 594,000 (317,000-914,000). Roughly one case was averted for each case consenting to notification of their contacts. We estimated that for every percentage point increase in app users, the number of cases can be reduced by 0.8% (modelling) or 2.3% (statistical analysis).

Major advancements in the hyperacute diagnosis and treatment of stroke have justified our call-to-action slogan of Time is Brainfaster therapy leads to superior outcomes. However, this mantra has been recently usurped by the catchphrase Stay at Home during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Fewer patients are presenting to hospitals with acute stroke; our census is down. Presumably the etiology of this phenomenon is either strict social distancing that some people may misperceive to exclude even emergent situations, or fears of contracting the virus while hospitalized. In this Short Report, we describe the year-over-year drop in stroke volume (ischemic and hemorrhagic both) coinciding with a paradoxical rise in acute reperfusion therapies at our university hospital. These data imply that stroke patients with mild/moderate symptoms are most likely staying home, and not receiving urgent therapies, and correspondingly, only the most severely disabled stroke patients are ultimately seeking and receiving help. We must remind our patients and the general public that our services are essential and available, as stroke still remains a medical emergency, and carries a likely higher overall mortality risk than COVID-19.

State managers produced powerful images of the government, in Confucian fashion, protecting the public from a dangerous threat. I will connect these performances of power with an examination of how authorities harnessed its pandemic response to private capital. South Korea's reaction to COVID-19 does represent a positive alternative to the dominant form of oligarchic rule that prevails in Euro-American societies. The governing elite deployed state power in ways that used this conjuncture to continue previous patterns of domination that have continuously expanded surveillance, extending techniques for the extraction of vital data for commercial and political purposes.

However, they require good laboratory infrastructure thereby restricting their use to reference laboratories and research studies. Therefore, adopting molecular tools for routine use in malaria endemic countries will require simpler molecular platforms. The recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in endemic countries. In this study, we attempted to improve this method for malaria diagnosis by using a simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in one platform. We refer to this as the RealAmp method. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Published genus-specific primers were used to test the utility of this method. DNA derived from different species of malaria parasites was used for the initial characterization. Clinical samples of P. falciparum were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this system compared to microscopy and a nested PCR method. Additionally, directly boiled parasite preparations were compared with a conventional DNA isolation method. The RealAmp method was found to be simple and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification. The time to amplification varied but was generally less than 60 minutes. All human-infecting Plasmodium species were detected. The sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in detecting P. falciparum was 96.7% and 91.7% respectively, compared to microscopy and 98.9% and 100% respectively, compared to a standard nested PCR method. In addition, this method consistently detected P. falciparum from directly boiled blood samples. CONCLUSION: This RealAmp method has great potential as a field usable molecular tool for diagnosis of malaria. This tool can provide an alternative to conventional PCR based diagnostic methods for field use in clinical and operational programs.","output":"Real-Time Fluorescence Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification for the Diagnosis of Malaria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To use IFN injection as inhalant for there is no proper dosage form for aerosol inhalation and evaluate the feasibility of IFN- off-label use.

RESULTS: IFN- seems to be effective in relieving early symptoms but likely invalid in reducing mortality of severe patients, however, the exact therapeutic effect calls for further clinical tests. Proper atomization of IFN- injection won't reduce biological activity of the protein, but absorption and utilization of IFN- in lung may be unsatisfactory for the lack of sorbefacient.

Risk management is permanent element of management abilities and one of the most important factor impacting on supply chain resilience. Today managers have access to many tools, i.e. digital technologies, supporting the development of contingency plans (Plan B) for risk mitigation. The aim of the paper is to identify supply chain resilience in terms of risk management during the beginning of the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spread in 2020. The most important factors impacting on supply chain flows stability are pointed here together with the assessment of their preparation for these flows disruption. Methods: The theoretical background is based on the literature review on disruption of supply chain management in general. The In-depth individual interview (IDI) method supported with questionnaire was used to conduct research among managers responsible for supply chain operations within the enterprises from the production, trade and services sectors in Poland. Opinions and a number of views on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business operations and supply chain management were obtained and analyzed. The survey was conducted in March 2020. Results: The results obtained show that the first phase of pandemic spread unexpectedly strongly and impacted on disruption in the supply chains. Closed borders, sanitary and administrative restrictions have leaded to transport delays, additionally the lower number of orders was noted causing many disruptions in the further flow of the goods. Surprisingly the disruption happened even when managers synergistically cooperate and share information among partners. Conclusions: Results of the research pointed out the critical problem with the lack of Plan B helping supply chains quickly react on disruptions occurring in the flows. Also managing risk based on the current way of sharing information is insufficient. Features of digital technologies and digitalization are currently one of the most important solution that might help to build smart Plan B for risk mitigation and supply chain competitiveness improvement.Alternate abstract: Streszczenie: Wst?p: Konkurencyjne zarz?dzanie ?acuchem dostaw to zdolno nie tylko do podj?cia dzia?a naprawczych w stosunku do ryzyka, ale przede wszystkim do zapobiegania takiej sytuacji na co dzie.

We surveyed 536 anaesthetic junior doctors who applied for ST3 posts during this application round with the aim of investigating their experience of the recruitment process this year (response rate 536/1,056 = 51%). Approximately 61% were not offered ST3 posts (n = 326), a similar proportion to that previously reported. We asked all respondents what their potential career plans were for the next 12 to 24 months. The majority expressed intentions to take up either CT3 top-up posts or non-training fellow posts from August 2021 (79%). Other options considered by respondents included: pursuing work abroad (17%), embarking on a career break (16%), taking up an ST3 post in intensive care medicine instead of anaesthetics (15%) and permanently leaving the medical profession (9%). A number of respondents expressed a desire to pursue training in a different medical specialty (9%). Some respondents expressed an intention to pursue further education or research (10%). A large proportion of respondents (42%) expressed a lack of confidence in being able to achieve the necessary training requirements to later apply for ST4 in August 2023. The majority of respondents reported not feeling confident in achieving GMC Specialty Registration in Anaesthesia in the future without a training number (75%), and that their wider life plans have been disrupted due to the impending time out of training (78%). We received a total of 384 free-text responses to a question asking about general concerns regarding the ST3 applications process. Sentiment analysis of these free-text responses indicated that respondents felt generally negatively about the ST3 recruitment process. Some themes that were elicited from the responses included: respondents feeling the recruitment process lacked fairness, respondents suffering burnout and negative impacts on their wellbeing, difficulties in making plans for their personal lives, and feeling undervalued and abandoned despite having made personal sacrifices to support the health service during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest that junior anaesthetic doctors in the UK currently have a negative perception towards postgraduate training structures, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to the postgraduate training curriculum and difficulties in securing higher training posts.","output":"Anaesthetic Higher Specialty Training Recruitment in the United Kingdom During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During theunprecedented times of the COVID 19 pandemic,the livesof people with diabetes have been severely impacted.

The United States (U.S.) has adopted a four-phase approach to decreasing and then resuming non-essential work. Through strong restrictive measures, Phase I slowed the spread of disease, allowing states to safely diagnose, isolate, and treat patients with COVID-19. In support of social distancing measures, non-urgent studies were postponed, and this created a backlog. Now, as states transition to Phase II, restrictions on non-essential activities will ease, and radiology departments must re-establish care while continuing to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission all while accommodating this backlog. In this article, we propose a roadmap that incorporates the current practice guidelines and subject matter consensus statements for the phased reopening of non-urgent and elective radiology services.

Urgent surgical decompression aims to prevent progressive neurological deficit. Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES), such as back pain, sciatica and bladder dysfunction are common in the population, but the majority of those investigated do not have radiological cauda equina compression. However, a missed diagnosis can have significant medical, social and legal consequences. We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation and management of suspected CES. METHODS This retrospective cohort study analysed referral, investigation and treatment of CES in a regional neurosurgical centre during the initial COVID-19 surge between March and May 2020 compared with March to May 2019. RESULTS Referrals for suspected CES were similar during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 275) compared with 2019 (n = 261, p = 0.596) despite a significant (19%) decrease in total emergency neurosurgical referrals (1248 in 2020 vs 1544 in 2019, p < 0.001). Nineteen (7%) of the suspected CES referrals underwent decompression in 2020, similar to 16 (6%) in 2019 (p = 0.867). There were no differences in outcomes or complications and no evidence of delays in presentation or treatment. CONCLUSIONS Unlike other emergency neurosurgical conditions, the number of referrals for suspected CES and the percentage of referrals with radiological cauda equina compression were unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of CES referrals when many people stayed away from hospital highlights the distress and worry caused by suspected CES and its symptoms to both patients and healthcare providers.","output":"Suspected cauda equina syndrome: no reduction in investigation, referral and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is a lifestyle disease and it has become an epidemic worldwide in recent decades.

Bacterial exposure is a known trigger for the secretion of zonulin, but it remains unclear whether distinct bacteria differ in their capability to stimulate zonulin secretion. We hypothesized that ZFPs are similar to zonulin regarding response to bacterial exposure and aimed to compare the effects of non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli RY13 and E. coli K12 DH5) and probiotic, Gram-positive bacteria (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium bifidum) on ZFP secretion in an in vitro model. Additionally, utilizing samples from human clinical trials, we correlated circulating levels of ZFPs to the gut bacteria and determined the presence of ZFPs in various human tissues. Unexpectedly, we found that the ZFPs quantified by the widely used IDK?

A single-blinded, six-week, randomized controlled pilot trial involving 70 sedentary young Chinese females, aged 18C30 years, was conducted. An intervention group (IG) (n = 33) underwent a HIIT intervention and health education, while a waitlist group (WG) (n = 37) only received health education. In pre-, mid-, and post-tests, both groups filled out questionnaires about physical activity, sedentary behavior, and mental health. Cognitive functions were assessed at the pre- and post-tests by computer-administered cognitive tests. A mixed-effect model with repeated measures was used to analyze outcomes of interest. The retention rate of the IG and WG was 100% and 78.38%, respectively. The IG were found to have significantly increased rates of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (M(diff) = 940.61, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 576.67, 1304.55) from pre-test to post-test, while the WG demonstrated a more marked reduction in sedentary time (M(diff) = ?73.02, p = 0.038, 95% CI: ?141.90, ?4.14) compared with the IG in the post-test. Moreover, anxiety and stress levels were shown to significantly reduce in the IG over the six-week period (M(diff) = ?4.73, p = 0.002, 95% CI: ?7.30, ?2.15 and M(diff) = ?5.09, p = 0.001, 95% CI: ?8.29, ?1.89, respectively).

The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99% (95% confidence interval (CI) 94.4C100%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.3C100%). The negative predictive value of sVNT from the samples collected before and after 7 days of symptom onset was 99.5% (95% CI 97.4C100%) and 100% (95% CI 93.8C100%), respectively. The level of inhibition at days 8C14 were significantly higher than days 0C7 (p<0.001). The median %inhibition values by severity of COVID-19 symptoms were 79.9% (interquartile range (IQR) 49.7C91.8%); 89.0% (IQR 71.2C92.4%); and 86.6% (IQR 69.5C92.8%), for mild, moderate and severe/critical symptoms respectively. The median level of sVNT %inhibition of severe was significantly higher than the mild group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The sVNT is a practical and robust serological test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and does not require specialized biosafety containment. It can be used clinically to aid diagnosis in both early and late infection especially in cases when the real-time RT-PCR results in weakly negative or weakly positive, and to determine the protective immune response from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients.","output":"Early detection of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European Union Brexit referendum has divided the British electorate, with high levels of animosity between those who affiliate with the Remain side (Remainers) and the Leave side (Leavers) of the debate. Previous research has shown that a brief befriending meditation reduces affective polarization among Democrats and Republicans in the United States, but the results have not been replicated in a non-US sample and the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects have yet to be examined. The present study therefore used a post-test only randomized controlled design to investigate the effects of a brief befriending meditation on affective polarization among Remainers and Leavers (n = 922). Results showed that participants in the befriending condition scored modestly lower on affective polarization than participants in the attentional control condition (t(921) = 2.17, p = .030, d = 0.14) and that perceived commonality with the political outgroup mediated the effects.

MMD-associated SNPs primarily localize to the C-terminal region of RNF213, and some affect conserved residues in the RING domain. Although the autosomal dominant inheritance of MMD could most easily explained by RNF213 gain-of-function, the type of ubiquitylation catalyzed by RNF213 and the effects of MMD-associated SNPs on its E3 ligase activity have remained unclear. We found that RNF213 uses the E2-conjugating enzymes UBE2D2 and UBE2L3 to catalyze distinct ubiquitylation events. RNF213-UBED2 catalyzes K6 and, to a lesser extent, K48-dependent poly-ubiquitylation in vitro, whereas RNF213-UBE2L3 catalyzes K6-, K11-, and K48-dependent poly-ubiquitylation events. MMD-associated SNPs encode proteins with decreased E3 activity, and the most frequent MMD allele, RNF213 R4810K , is a dominant-negative mutant that decreases ubiquitylation globally.

RESULTS: The focus group nominated poor identification of Aboriginality in general practice. Of 273 survey respondents, a substantial minority (30%) were unaware of their eligibility for free influenza vaccination. More than half (52%) believed the vaccine could cause influenza, 40% reported there were better ways than vaccination for avoiding infection and 30% said they would not have the vaccine if it was offered to them. Regarding health service access, few reported experiencing difficulty (17%), feeling uncomfortable (15%) or being discriminated against (8%), but 53% reported not receiving a reminder from a health professional. CONCLUSIONS: Misconceptions about influenza disease and vaccine among Aboriginal people and inadequate identification of Aboriginality in general practice appear to be the greatest barriers to vaccination, rather than health service access in general.

Therefore, two common in vitro models employed for sunlight irradiation studies, namely human keratinocyte HaCat culture and reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), were compared with the medaka fish embryo model, traditionally used in other scientific disciplines. Using suberythemal doses of UVA and HEV to determine the level of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation and thymine dimers formed by UVB, we show that medaka embryo responds with a lower damage level, more comparable to human skin, than the other two models, probably due to the protective mechanisms that work in a complete organism. In the same way, the protective effects of antioxidant compounds have the greatest effect on medaka embryos.

This has led to increased stress and anxiety among employees, which explicably affects their satisfaction with life. Thus, the present study analyses the effect of COVID-19 induced stressors (role overload, lifestyle choices, family distraction, and occupational discomfort) on employees' distress levels and job performance. Subsequently, the impact of such distress and job performance on the employees' life satisfaction is analyzed during the lockdown period. Methodology: Data was collected from 433 working professionals of private and public organizations in the Delhi and NCR region of India during India's third and fourth phase of lockdown via a survey, which was distributed online. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was applied first to establish the validity of this study's model (measurement model validity) and subsequently test the hypothesized relationships in the model (structural model). Results: The COVID-19 induced stressors, i.e., role overload, lifestyle choices, and occupational discomfort, were significant predictors of distress during the lockdown. It has been found that role overload and change in lifestyle choice did not significantly affect job performance. Family distraction, occupational discomfort, and distress were significant in impacting job performance, with distress being the most significant one.

Design Epidemiological observational study. Setting Two large hospitals and 40 territorial healthcare units, with a total of 5700 workers. Participants 143 HCWs with a SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal (NF) swab in a population made of 5,700 HCWs. Main outcome measures Clinical data on the history of exposure, contacts inside and outside of the hospital, NF swab dates and results. A daily online self-reported case report form consisting of the morning and evening body temperature and 11 other symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, discomfort, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, anosmia, dysgeusia, conjunctival hyperaemia). Results Most workers were tested and found positive due to a close contact with a positive colleague (49%), followed by worker-initiated testing due to symptoms (and unknown contact, 28%), and a SARS-CoV-2 positive member of the family (9.8%). 10% of NF swabs performed in the framework of contact tracing resulted positive, compared to only 2.6% through random testing. The first (index) case caused a cluster of 7 positive HCWs discovered through contact tracing and testing of 250 asymptomatic HCWs. HCWs rarely reported symptoms of a respiratory infection, and up to 90% were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms in the days surrounding the positive NF swab. During the 15-day follow-up period, up to 40% of HCWs reported anosmia and dysgeusia/ageusia as moderate or heavy, more frequently than any other symptom. The time necessary for 95% of HCWs to be considered cured (between the positive and two negative NF swabs) was 30 days. Conclusion HCWs represent the main source of infection in healthcare institutions, 90% are asymptomatic or with symptoms not common in a respiratory infection.

It is hypothesised that the intervention will: 1) reduce insomnia severity in poor sleepers, compared to wait-list control poor sleepers, and good sleepers; 2) reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety and depression in all groups, and 3) prevent the transition to acute insomnia in good sleepers. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Both healthy good sleepers, who do not report having any current sleep problems, and individuals who report having sleep problems, will be recruited for the present study. This is a single-site study (Northumbria University). This study will be delivered using the internet and there are no geographic restrictions. Individuals who self-report as poor sleepers will meet DSM-5 criteria for acute insomnia, which is where individuals: 1) have difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early for at least three nights per week, for a time period of between two weeks and three months; and 2) report experiencing distress or impairment caused by sleep loss. Both 1) and 2) must have occurred despite the individual having had an adequate opportunity for sleep during this time period. Good sleepers will be individuals who do not have current sleep problems. All participants must have a sufficient level of English comprehension to understand and complete study measures. Individuals cannot participate if they report having chronic sleep problems (where they have existed for more than three months immediately prior to providing consent), nor will individuals who are actively seeking treatment for their sleep problems irrespective of how long they have had the sleep problem. Individuals also cannot participate if they have a self-reported history of head injuries, or if they have a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia, epilepsy or personality disorder, as the distraction techniques involved in the insomnia intervention may increase rumination in individuals with these conditions, and influence the effectiveness of the intervention. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants who receive the intervention will be provided with an online version of a self-help leaflet. A printed version of this leaflet has been successfully used in previous treatment studies, which have been conducted by our research group. Participants will be encouraged to download, save or print out this leaflet, which will be provided in PDF format. There will be no restrictions on use and participants will be encouraged to refer to this leaflet as often as they wish to. Briefly, this self-help leaflet aims to improve sleep by identifying and addressing sleep-related dysfunctional thinking by providing education about sleep, providing techniques to distract from intrusive worrisome thoughts at night, and providing guidelines for sleep-related stimulus control. The comparator is a wait-list control (i.e. where they will receive the intervention after a one month delay) group. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure will be insomnia severity, as measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, Vallires, & Morin, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention and at one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include subjective mood, measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006)) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention, and one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Additionally, subjective sleep continuity, derived from sleep diaries (Carney et al., 2012), will be compared pre and post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: This study will operate as a cluster randomised controlled trial. Good sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or a no-intervention group, with a 1:1 allocation. Poor sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or wait-list control group, with a 1:1 allocation. Randomisation will be conducted automatically using Qualtrics study software, where block sizes will be equal and randomisation will be computer-generated. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment. The outcomes will be assessed by a blinded investigator. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The minimum sample size is 60. A total of 30 poor sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or wait-list control group. A total of 30 good sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or no intervention group. TRIAL STATUS: Recruitment for this study has yet to start.

School closures and enforced social distancing, as well as health and financial uncertainties, during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to adversely affect mental health in youth, particularly adolescents who are already at risk for experiencing emotional difficulties. The executive control network (ECN) supports cognitive processes required to successfully navigate novel challenges and regulate emotions in stressful contexts. Methods: We examined whether functional coherence of the ECN, measured using resting-state fMRI five years before the pandemic (at T1), is a neurobiological marker of resilience to increases in the severity of internalizing symptoms during COVID-19 in adolescents who were in more advanced stages of puberty at T1 relative to their same-age peers (N=85; 49 F). RESULTS: On average, participants reported an increase in symptoms from the three months prior to pandemic to the two most recent weeks during the pandemic. We found that early-maturing youth exhibited greater increases in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic if their ECN coherence was low; in contrast, relative pubertal stage was not associated with changes in internalizing symptoms in adolescents with higher ECN coherence at T1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the role of the functional architecture of the brain that supports executive functioning in protecting against risk factors that may exacerbate symptoms of internalizing psychopathology during periods of stress and uncertainty.","output":"Higher executive control network coherence buffers against puberty-related increases in internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine is now an established mode of clinical care for most medical specialties, and clinical teachers must teach and precept learners in this modality.

Despite the abundance of new studies, privacy laws prevent their dissemination for medical investigations: through clinical de-identification, the Protected Health Information (PHI) contained therein can be anonymized so that medical records can be shared and published. The automation of clinical de-identification through deep learning techniques has proven to be less effective for languages other than English due to the scarcity of data sets. Hence a new Italian de-identification data set has been created from the COVID-19 clinical records made available by the Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM). Therefore, two multi-lingual deep learning systems have been developed for this low-resource language scenario: the objective is to investigate their ability to transfer knowledge between different languages while maintaining the necessary features to correctly perform the Named Entity Recognition task for de-identification. The systems were trained using four different strategies, using both the English Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) 2014 and the new Italian SIRM COVID-19 data sets, then evaluated on the latter. These approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer learning to de-identify medical records written in a low resource language such as Italian, using one with high resources such as English.","output":"Crosslingual named entity recognition for clinical de-identification applied to a COVID-19 Italian data set"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the 2020 Lunar New Year, the Chinese government implemented a strict nationwide lockdown to inhibit the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Despite the abrupt decreases in gaseous emissions caused by record-low anthropogenic activities, severe haze pollution occurred in northern China during the COVID lockdown This paradox has attracted the attention of both the public and the scientific community By analyzing comprehensive measurements of air pollutants, planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, and surface meteorology, we show that the severe air pollution episode over northern China coincided with the abnormally low PBL height, which had reduced by 45%, triggering strong aerosol-PBL interactions After dynamical processes initiated the temperature inversion, the Beijing metropolitan area experienced a period with continuously shallow PBLs during the lockdown This unprecedented event provided an experiment showcasing the role of meteorology, in particular aerosol-PBL interactions in affecting air quality","output":"Abnormally shallow boundary layer associated with severe air pollution during the COVID-19 lockdown in China.

Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the annual trends, according to age and sex, for the calendar years 2010-19. RESULTS Over the 10 years, screening rates for T2D had doubled while glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) tests for management remained constant. At the end of 2014, the MBS introduced HbA1c screening tests. By 2019, the HbA1c screening rates were three times higher than glucose tolerance tests, which had halved. DISCUSSION A strong adoption of the national screening guidelines introduced in 2015-16 was identified.

We performed a meta-analysis to characterize the dynamics and influencing factors of HBsAg. METHODS: Literature search was conducted through PubMed from January 1995 to May 2015 for papers reporting HBsAg in patients receiving various anti-viral treatments. We conducted weighted linear regression to select for potential influencing factors on maximum HBsAg loss percentage, and subgroup analysis to calculate the pooled estimates of maximum HBsAg loss and seroconversion percentage following treatment of interferon (IFN), nucleoside analogue (NUC), or combination therapies (NUC+IFN), respectively. Study heterogeneity was assessed through sensitivity test and I-square statistics. RESULTS: We collected data from 24 papers involving 6674 adult CHB patients. In most studies, average HBsAg level decreased during treatment but relapsed after treatment cessation, while HBsAg loss or seroconversion percentage continued to increase or remain stable after treatment cessation. No strong relationship was observed between maximum HBsAg change and its baseline level. The pooled estimates of maximum HBsAg loss percentage for IFN (5.3%, 2.7%-7.9%) and NUC+IFN (5.2%, 3.1%-7.4%) were significantly higher than that of NUC (0.93%, 0.29%-1.6%). Higher maximum HBsAg loss percentage is associated with longer peak time. Pooled maximum HBsAg seroconversion percentage estimates were 1.6%, 0.56% and 6.2% for IFN, NUC and NUC+IFN.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to identify factors that predict the overall survival rate for COVID-19 cases and develop a COVID-19 prognosis score (COPS) system based on these factors. In addition, disease severity and the length of hospital stay for patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a nationwide cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases between January and April 2020 in Korea. The cohort was split randomly into a development cohort and a validation cohort with a 2:1 ratio. In the development cohort (n=3729), we tried to identify factors associated with overall survival and develop a scoring system to predict the overall survival rate by using parameters identified by the Cox proportional hazard regression model with bootstrapping methods. In the validation cohort (n=1865), we evaluated the prediction accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The score of each variable in the COPS system was rounded off following the log-scaled conversion of the adjusted hazard ratio. RESULTS: Among the 5594 patients included in this analysis, 234 (4.2%) died after receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis. In the development cohort, six parameters were significantly related to poor overall survival: older age, dementia, chronic renal failure, dyspnea, mental disturbance, and absolute lymphocyte count <1000/mm3. The following risk groups were formed: low-risk (score 0-2), intermediate-risk (score 3), high-risk (score 4), and very high-risk (score 5-7) groups. The COPS system yielded an area under the curve value of 0.918 for predicting the 14-day survival rate and 0.896 for predicting the 28-day survival rate in the validation cohort. Using the COPS system, 28-day survival rates were discriminatively estimated at 99.8%, 95.4%, 82.3%, and 55.1% in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk groups, respectively, of the total cohort (P<.001). The length of hospital stay and disease severity were directly associated with overall survival (P<.001), and the hospital stay duration was significantly longer among survivors (mean 26.1, SD 10.7 days) than among nonsurvivors (mean 15.6, SD 13.3 days).

We aimed to analyse the safety of the hospital staff and the feasibility and outcomes of NRS applied to patients outside the ICU. METHODS: In this observational study, data from 670 consecutive patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 referred to pulmonology units in nine hospitals between March 1 and May 10, 2020 were analysed. Data collected included medication, mode and usage of NRS (i.e. high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV)), length of stay in hospital, endotracheal intubation (ETI) and deaths. RESULTS: 42 (11.1%) healthcare workers tested positive for infection, but only three of them required hospitalisation. Data are reported for all patients (69.3% male), whose meansd age was 6813a? years. The arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction ratio at baseline was 15279, and the majority (49.3%) of patients were treated with CPAP. The overall unadjusted 30-day mortality rate was 26.9%, with 16%, 30% and 30% for HFNC, CPAP and NIV, respectively, while the total ETI rate was 27%, with 29%, 25% and 28%, respectively; the relative probability of death was not related to the NRS used after adjustment for confounders.

When IAV NS1 protein is disabled, RNase L restricts virus replication; however, the RNAs targeted for cleavage by RNase L under these conditions have not been defined. In this study, we used deep-sequencing methods to identify RNase L cleavage sites within host and viral RNAs from IAV PR8NS1-infected A549 cells. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of RNase L allowed us to distinguish between RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites. RNase L-dependent cleavage sites were evident at discrete locations in IAV RNA segments (both positive and negative strands). Cleavage in PB2, PB1, and PA genomic RNAs suggests that viral RNPs are susceptible to cleavage by RNase L. Prominent amounts of cleavage mapped to specific regions within IAV RNAs, including some areas of increased synonymous-site conservation. Among cellular RNAs, RNase L-dependent cleavage was most frequent at precise locations in rRNAs. Our data show that RNase L targets specific sites in both host and viral RNAs to restrict influenza virus replication when NS1 protein is disabled. IMPORTANCE RNase L is a critical component of interferon-regulated and double-stranded-RNA-activated antiviral host responses. We sought to determine how RNase L exerts its antiviral activity during influenza virus infection. We enhanced the antiviral activity of RNase L by disabling a viral protein, NS1, that inhibits the activation of RNase L. Then, using deep-sequencing methods, we identified the host and viral RNAs targeted by RNase L. We found that RNase L cleaved viral RNAs and rRNAs at very precise locations.

Countries one after the other are witnessing peak effects of the disease, and they need to learn from the experience of others already affected or peaked countries. Thus, this paper aims to analyse the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on different countries through COVID-19 cases, resulting in deaths and recoveries. Methods: This study analyses quantitatively the lethal effects of the pandemic through the study of infections, deaths, and recoveries on the 13 most-affected COVID-19 countries as of 1 s t June. The daily change in cases, deaths, and recoveries for all the 13 countries were considered. Combined analysis for comparison and separate analysis for the detailed study were both taken for every country. All the graphs were made in RStudio using the R programming language, as it is best for statistical analysis. Results: The casual and ignorant behaviour of people is a major reason for such a large scale spread of the coronavirus. The government of every country should be strict as well as considerate to all sections of people while making policies. There is no room for mistakes, as one wrong decision or one delayed decision can worsen the situation. However, some countries which were once the epicentre of this pandemic are now corona-free, proving that this global threat can be tackled and we should all keep our morale high.

Prospective applicants rely on websites and social media (SOME) to guide their decisions of applying or ranking a FP. We aim to evaluate HO FP's digital footprint in order to identify informational gaps. Methods: The AMA Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) was queried for all HO programs. We searched Google, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube for HO FP pages. Content was evaluated using published criteria. Qualitative content analysis of SOME posts is planned. Results: Our analysis includes 176 FP that actively recruited during the 2020 match season. Over half (57%, n = 100) were universitybased and the median number of fellow positions per year was 4 per FP (range 0-16). Most FP had websites (95%, n = 167) with varying information (Table) for prospective applicants. Twenty percent (n = 33) included a diversity statement. While 63% (n = 106) of FP provided application information, only 51% discussed visa requirements. Few FP websites included key information such as why fellows chose a particular FP (7%, n = 12), accolades of fellows (3%, n = 5), or employment location of alumni (25%, n = 44). Only 42% (n = 69) provided city, and 5% (n = 8) showed fellows socializing. Thirty-four FP (19%) have informational videos (range 1-10) in YouTube (length range: 1:37-18:15min). Most (82%;n = 28) were published since May 2020 in alignment with the FP recruitment season. Twitter was the second most common SOME platform, used by 19% (n = 32) of FP. 56% (n = 18) joined Twitter since May 2020 correlating with the current recruitment season. The number of Twitter followers (median 119, range: 0-1408) and posts (median 47, range: 0- 687) varied across FP. Only 4% used Facebook and 6% Instagram. Conclusions: Our analysis of FP's digital footprint revealed that applicants participating in the 1st virtual HO recruitment season were provided limited online information. Programs can use online content to provide information on resources, research opportunities, and achievements of faculty and fellows that can guide applicant decision making. In the era of COVID-19, highlighting the diversity and breath of each FP, hospital, and city are vital to attract a diverse and talented pool of trainees.","output":"Digital footprint of hematologyoncology fellowship programs: Identifying gaps after the first virtual recruitment season"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Using an online panel, we surveyed a representative sample of 500 each in Australia and New Zealand during July 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic We find trust in government has increased dramatically, with around 80% of respondents agreeing government was generally trustworthy Around three quarters agreed management of the pandemic had increased their trust in government Over 85% of respondents have confidence that public health scientists work in the public interest Testing four hypotheses, we find that income and education predict trust in government and confidence in public health scientists, as does voting for the political party in government Trust in government and confidence in public health scientists strongly predict Covid-19 phone application use, largely through convincing people the App is beneficial Trust in government then is both an outcome and antecedent of government effectiveness Building trust is important for governments implementing difficult policy responses during a crisis","output":"Trust in government increased during the Covid-19 pandemic in Australia and New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is having adverse effects on mental health. It is vital to understand what is causing this: worries over potential adversities due to the pandemic, or the toll of experiencing adverse events. METHODS: We used panel data from 41 909 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 1 April 2020 to 12 May 2020 to study the association between adversities and anxiety and depressive symptoms. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. We used fixed-effect regression models to account for time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. A number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. There were clear associations between specific worries and poorer mental health. There was weak evidence that individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by the adverse experiences. CONCLUSION: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given that we see clear associations with mental health and cumulative worries. Interventions are required that seek to prevent adverse events (eg, redundancies) and reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","output":"Does thinking make it so?

Design/methodology/approach: The success factors impacting CSR activities are identified based on inputs from 14 experts in the CSR domain. Thereafter, authors use a statistical approach to identify CSFs with inputs from useable respondents. Finally, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was applied to understand the causal relationship between different CSFs. Findings: Using the DEMATEL method, the authors developed an analytical model showing causeCeffect aspects of the CSFs and identified seven factors which firms need to emphasize more to execute better CSR activities in the post-COVID-19 period. Research limitations/implications: The authors asked 14 experts for their inputs, but more experts could have made identifying success factors more comprehensive. In this study, the DEMATEL method found seven CSFs that improve CSR activities in the post-COVID-19 period. Another identification process could have enriched the study. The findings of this study cannot be generalized since this study is based on the inputs of employees from India only. Practical implications: This proposed analytical model is effective in determining the complex interactions among all impacting CSFs. Firms' CSR managers and policy makers can use the proposed model, especially in the post-COVID-19 period. Originality/value: The proposed model provides a precise and most accurate analysis for CSFs impacting CSR activities in the post-COVID-19 period. It also provides a unique opportunity for the competent authorities at firms to understand the interaction of different impacting CSFs and takes necessary actions.

The objective of this study was to determine the mortality and recovery rates at 30 days from the first unlock phase after five phases of lockdown. The the number of infected people has continually increased, and currently, this pandemic continues to present challenges to public health. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Statistical analysis was used to calculate the mortality rate, ratio between active and death cases, active cases and recovered cases, recovered and death cases in India during the first 30 days of the unlock phase. RESULTS: The relationship between the new cases, deaths and recovered cases, shows that the new and recovered cases increased progressively. From the scatter plot of daily deaths and new cases, the R(2) value is 0.0047. That means the death ratio is low against the new cases. Also, if we look at another scatter plot, the ratio between new cases and recovery rate shows the R(2) value is 0.8015. That means the recovery rate was very high during the study period in India. The R(2) value of daily recovery and death is 0.0072. India faced a huge number of new coronavirus cases and increased death rate every day during the first unlock phase.

Lack of specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is a major concern and the development of vaccines is another important aspect in managing the infection effectively. The first step in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is the viral entry and it is mediated by its densely glycosylated spike protein (S-protein). Similar to the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell entry receptor. In addition to ACE2, several recent studies have implicated the crucial role of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as a necessary assisting cofactor for ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was also identified to use both endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for the pivotal role of S-protein priming mediating viral entry. As the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mandatory for viral infection, it becomes an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. In this regard, this review will focus on the therapeutic targeting of the crucial steps of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry like S-protein/ACE2 interaction and S-protein priming by host cell proteases.

In this paper, we developed a hierarchical, latent class multivariate probit model for the simultaneous meta-analysis of ordinal and dichotomous tests without assuming a gold standard. The model can accommodate a hierarchical partial pooling model on the conditional within-study correlations, enabling one to obtain summary estimates of joint test accuracy.

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of iRoot SP on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in human stem cells from the apical papilla (hSCAPs). METHODS: hSCAPs were isolated and characterized in vitro, then cultured with various concentrations of iRoot SP extract. Cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay, and scratch-wound-healing assays were performed to evaluate cell-migration capacity. hSCAPs were then cultured in osteogenic medium supplemented with iRoot SP extracts. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay was used to evaluate ALP enzyme levels. Alizarin red staining and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) assays were performed to assess calcified-nodule formation and matrix-calcium accumulation of hSCAPs. The mRNA and protein expression levels of the osteogenic markers OCN, OSX, Runx2, and DSPP were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and LSD-t tests. RESULTS: iRoot SP at low concentrations (2, 0.2, and 0.02 mg/mL) is nontoxic to hSCAPs. iRoot SP at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/mL significantly increases cell-migration capacity. In terms of osteogenic differentiation, 0.2 mg/mL iRoot SP promotes intracellular ALP activity and the formation of mineralized nodules.

At admission, 7th and 14th day of hospitalisation, plasma and urine samples were collected. The levels of cytokines (IFN-, IL-6 and TNF-) and the biomarker intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) were measured. Results COVID-19 patients displayed 48-, 74- and 125-fold increased urinary I-FABP levels at admission (n=283; p<0.001), 7th (n=142; p<0.01) and 14th day (n=75; p<0.01) of hospitalisation, respectively. Critically ill patients and nonsurvivors showed higher I-FABP concentrations compared to those in the infirmary and survivors, respectively, within the same hospital stay periods. At admission, infected patients demonstrated enhanced production of plasma IFN- and IL-6.

In this article, we review the early literature on the coronavirus pandemic and political and social trust, summarise their findings and highlight key challenges for future research. We show how the studies shed light on trusts association with implementation of government measures, public compliance with them, mortality rates and the effect of government action on levels of trust. We also urge caution given the varying ways of measuring trust and operationalising the impact of the pandemic, the existence of common issues with quantitative studies and the relatively limited geographical scope of studies to date. We argue that it is going to be important to have a holistic understanding of these dynamics, using mixed-methods research as well as the quantitative studies we review here.","output":"Trust and the Coronavirus Pandemic: What are the Consequences of and for Trust?

METHODS A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 50 patients (37 men; mean age 71 years) who underwent retrograde recanalization via a distal SFA access after failed antegrade recanalization of SFA CTOs that were not beyond the adductor canal. Antegrade recanalization failed due to flush SFA occlusion, occluded stents, wire perforation, and re-entry failure. Retrograde SFA access required introduction of a 7- to 15-cm, 21-G needle distal to the occlusion. A 0.018-inch guidewire was inserted through the needle followed by a 4- or 6-F, 10-cm sheath or dedicated support catheter only. All retrograde SFA punctures were performed with the patient in the supine position. Once retrograde passage of the occlusion was successful, oftentimes requiring a \\"double-balloon\\" technique to disrupt the dissection membrane with abutting balloons delivered from both access sites, balloon angioplasty and/or stenting could be performed from either direction. RESULTS Retrograde puncture of the distal SFA was successful in all cases. Retrograde recanalization involved insertion of a 6-F sheath in 3 (6%) cases, a 4-F sheath in 32 (64%), and a sheathless approach in 15 (30%). The \\"double-balloon\\" technique was necessary to achieve guidewire passage in 12 cases. Recanalization was successful in 48 (96%) cases. Hemostasis time at the distal puncture site was 9.2 minutes (range 3-30). Perioperative complications included 4 pseudoaneurysms (2 groins, 2 distal), 1 peripheral embolization, and 1 small arteriovenous fistula at the distal puncture site. CONCLUSION For failure of antegrade recanalization of SFA occlusions, the retrograde SFA puncture distal to the adductor canal with the patient remaining supine is a safe and successful technique that represents a convenient alternative to the conventional transpopliteal approach.","output":"Retrograde recanalization technique for use after failed antegrade angioplasty in chronic femoral artery occlusions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Please cite this paper as: Blyth et al.

Background Many questions remain concerning the burden, risk factors and impact of bacterial and viral co\\\\infection in patients with pandemic influenza admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Objectives To examine the burden, risk factors and impact of bacterial and viral co\\\\infection in Australian patients with severe influenza. Patients/Methods A cohort study conducted in 14 ICUs was performed. Patients with proven influenza A during the 2009 influenza season were eligible for inclusion. Demographics, risk factors, clinical data, microbiological data, complications and outcomes were collected. Polymerase chain reaction for additional bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens was performed on stored respiratory samples. Results Co\\\\infection was identified in 233C269% of patients with severe influenza A infection: viral co\\\\infection, 32C34% and bacterial co\\\\infection, 205C247%. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent bacterial co\\\\infection followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Patients with co\\\\infection were younger [mean difference in age = 846 years (95% CI: 018C1674 years)], less likely to have significant co\\\\morbidities (320% versus 662%, P = 0004) and less frequently obese [mean difference in body mass index = 686 (95% CI: 177C1196)] compared to those without co\\\\infection. Conclusions Bacterial or viral co\\\\infection complicated one in four patients admitted to ICU with severe influenza A infection. Despite the co\\\\infected patients being younger and with fewer co\\\\morbidities, no significant difference in outcomes was observed. It is likely that co\\\\infection contributed to a need for ICU admission in those without other risk factors for severe influenza disease.

A novel electrochemical detection (IED) method was established to quantify MI in human serum using a disposable unmodified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) for the first time. MI was detected indirectly by the reaction product of myoinositol dehydrogenase (IDH) and cofactor ?-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Good linear calibration curves were obtained at the concentration range from 5.0 M to 500.0 M (R 2 = 0.9981) with the lower limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 1.0 M and 2.5 M, respectively. Recoveries were calculated at three spiked concentrations, and the values were between 90.3 and 106%, with relative standard deviation values of 3.2-6.2% for intraday precision and 7.1-9.0% for interday precision.

A cohort analysis was used to assess the mean number of patients in a yearly quarter filling one or more buprenorphine prescriptions during preexpansion (2012-2013) and postexpansion (2014-2018) periods in expansion and nonexpansion states. Interrupted time-series analysis estimated associations of Medicaid expansion period with change in Medicaid-financed treatment. Separate analyses evaluated changes in duration and dose of new treatment episodes focused on mean quarterly number of patients treated with buprenorphine and proportions of new treatment episodes &#8805;180 days long and with &#8805;16 mg/day. RESULTS: Between preexpansion and postexpansion, the mean quarterly number of patients taking buprenorphine increased by 93,300 in expansion states and by 84,960 in nonexpansion states. Corresponding changes for Medicaid-financed patients were 28,760 and 4,050, respectively. The fastest growth in Medicaid-financed treatment occurred among patients ages 25-44. Among new Medicaid-financed treatment episodes, little change was found in the proportion reaching the 180-day threshold, and declines were observed in the proportion receiving &#8805;16 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with previous research indicating that Medicaid expansion has increased Medicaid-financed buprenorphine treatment.

METHODS An online survey was sent via email by the Scientific Committee of YPUC in April 2020. The impact of Covid-19 was invested, by analyzing the results of answers received. The difference between young consultants and trainees (C and T) were examined to assess the effect of pandemic in 2 different categories. RESULTS A total of 88 participants filled out the questionnaire. Guidelines around surgeries were well arranged: clear for 98% concerning triage with no difference between T and C; clear for 84% concerning pre-operative screening and for 81% concerning surgical dressing with a significance difference between T and C in understanding (p=0.07 and p=0.06). Forty-two respondents (48%) tested all surgical patients and the 20% operated patients positive for COVID-19. Thirteen (15%) were relocated to work in other divisions on different tasks, 12 were C. 86% of T did not participate in surgeries as much as before. CONCLUSIONS The impact of the pandemic has been very significant for pediatric urologists and the difference between C and T confirm that the training could be impacted.

In clinical practice, the striking similarities observed at computed tomography (CT) between the diseases make it difficult to distinguish a COVID-19 superinfection from a progression of SSc-ILD. Objectives: The aim of our study was to identify the main CT features that may help distinguishing SSc-ILD from COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: 22 international readers were included and divided in the radiologist group (RAD) and non-radiologist group (nRAD). The RAD group included nonchest RAD and chest-RAD. A total of 99 patients, 52 with COVID-19 and 47 with SSc-ILD, were included in the study. Results: Fibrosis inside focal ground glass opacities (GGO) in the upper lobes;fibrosis in the lower lobe GGO;reticulations in lower lobes (especially if bilateral and symmetrical or associated with signs of fibrosis) were the CT parameters most frequently associated with SSc-ILD. The CT parameters most frequently associated with COVID-19 pneumonia were: consolidation (CONS) in the lower lobes, CONS with peripheral (both central/peripheral or patchy distributions), anterior and posterior CONS and rounded-shaped GGOs in the lower lobes. After multivariate analysis, the presence of CONS in the lower lobes (p <0.0001) and signs of fibrosis in GGO in the lower lobes (p <0.0001) remained independently associated with COVID-19 pneumonia or SSc-ILD, respectively. These two variables were combined in a predictive score which resulted positively associated with the COVID-19 diagnosis, with 96.1% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity: 3 different risk class for COVID-19 pneumonia may be identified: high risk for COVID-19 pneumonia (5-9 points);probable overlap COVID-19 pneumonia in SSc-ILD (4 points);low risk for COVID-19 pneumonia (0-3 points). Conclusion: The CT differential diagnosis between COVID-19 Pneumonia and SSc-ILD is possible and may be fostered in practice by the use of a radiological score. In the case where an overlap of both diseases is suspected, the presence of consolidation in the lower lobes may suggest a COVID-19 pneumonia while the presence of fibrosis inside GGO may indicate a SSc-ILD.","output":"The role of chest ct in understanding interstitial lung disease (ILD): Systemic sclerosis (SSC). versus COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The original version of this consensus statement on mechanical thrombectomy was approved at the European Stroke Organisation (ESO)-Karolinska Stroke Update conference in Stockholm, 16-18 November 2014.

Urban gardens and farms have also responded to sudden political, economic, ecological, and social crises: wartime food shortages;urban disinvestment and property abandonment;earthquakes and floods;climate-change induced weather events;and global economic disruptions. This paper examines the effects on, and responses by, urban farms and gardens to the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper is based on data collected in the summer of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic when cities were struggling with appropriate responses to curb its spread. It builds on an international research project (FEW-meter) that developed a methodology to measure material and social benefits of urban agriculture (UA) in five countries (France, Germany, Poland, UK and USA) over two growing seasons, from a Food-Energy-Water nexus perspective. We surveyed project partners to ascertain the effects of COVID-19 on those gardens and farms and we interviewed policy stakeholders in each country to investigate the wider impacts of the pandemic on UA. We report the results with respect to five key areas: (1) garden accessibility and service provision during the pandemic;(2) adjustments to operational arrangements;(3) effects on production;(4) support for urban farms and gardens through the pandemic;and (5) thoughts about the future of urban agriculture in the recovery period and beyond. The paper shows that the pandemic resulted in multiple challenges to gardens and farms including the loss of ability to provide support services, lost income, and reductions in output because of reduced labor supply. But COVID-19 also created several opportunities: new markets to sell food locally;more time available to gardeners to work in their allotments;and increased community cohesion as neighboring gardeners looked out for one another. By illustrating the range of challenges faced by the pandemic, and strategies to address challenges used by different farms and gardens, the paper illustrates how gardens in this pandemic have adapted to become more resilient and suggests lessons for pandemic recovery and longer-term planning to enable UA to respond to future public health and other crises. ?

The scale and nature of the current pandemic, limitations on key resources, risks of transmission, and the impact on trainee wellbeing pose additional challenges to AMCs. We propose a framework for AMCs to utilize in facilitating health system, organization and program-level adjustments to meet the needs of medical trainees during the pandemic. APPROACH: In February 2020, we developed a three-level approach to the pandemic response of training programs at our AMC. The first level involved AMC alignment and engagement with regulatory stakeholders. The second level utilized the graduate medical education committee and leveraged organizational functions such as human resources, finance, and clinical departments. The third level of intervention focused on common approaches used by programs to ensure continuity of learning in the context of dynamic changes in workflows and service operations. EVALUATION: Outcomes at each level are reported. These include the co-development of a national framework on medical trainee responses to COVID-19, the composition of an operational guidance document, organizational protocols to accommodate novel challenges posed by the pandemic, and multiple program-level interventions. REFLECTION: This methodical approach, employed during a global crisis, was critical in facilitating interventions required to fulfill the mission of AMCs. Future steps include assessing the impact of these changes on trainee performance and the applicability of the approach in diverse settings.

HPN is associated with a worsening of patients' quality of life and has a dramatic impact on personal and familial daily life. Little is known about the informal caregiver burden of patients receiving HPN. AIM: To assess informal caregiver burden and the factors associated with moderate-to-severe caregiver burden in patients treated with HPN. METHODS: Informal caregivers of consecutive patients treated with HPN in a French nutritional referral center were invited to participate in a survey between January and June 2021. They had to fill out an anonymous standardized self-questionnaire evaluating burden by the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), and depression and anxiety symptoms by HADS score since HPN introduction. RESULTS: Among the 87 HPN patients having informal caregivers, 53 (61%) completed the questionnaire. Thirty (57%) informal caregivers were women. The caregiver's median age was 62 (IQR, 21.0) years. Twelve (22%) expressed moderate-to-severe burden (ZBI score 41-88). In multivariate analysis, the caregiver's male gender (OR: 16.45, CI95%, [2.30 - 238.75]; p value=0.014) and the number of simultaneous infusions per day > 1 (OR: 9.92 [1.35 - 121.60]; p value = 0.0038) were associated with a moderate-to-severe burden. Twenty caregivers reported anxious and depressive symptoms with an elevated HADS. CONCLUSION: In this prospective survey, a minority of informal caregivers of CIF patients treated with HPN expressed moderate-to-severe burden.

Although the responsible Minister stated that he expected the Bill would be the first legislation to be enacted in 2020, Indonesian experts soon expect delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so it has eventuated, with parliamentary consideration continuing a year later.This article analyses the Bill in the context of other Asian data privacy laws and the EUs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The most striking aspect of the Bill is that it fails to include what is generally considered to be the essential element of a data privacy law: a separate, specialised (and usually independent) data protection authority (DPA). Instead, all enforcement powers are in the hands of the Minister of Communication and Information. There have been quite a few earlier versions of a data privacy Bill drafted by the Indonesian government, but all have involved a specialised DPA. In a recent version, the Public Information Commission was going to act as the DPA, a combination of data privacy responsibilities with Freedom of Information/Right to Information (FOI/RTI) responsibilities.Otherwise, there are many aspects of the Bill with similarities to the GDPR. Its obligations apply comprehensively, to individuals, corporations, public agencies and other institutions, and it has extra-territorial scope. Processing of personal data may only occur if it has a legitimate basis. Indonesia has adopted the term personal data owner, and gives such owners eight types of rights with GDPR influences. Seventeen GDPR-influenced types of obligations apply to data controllers. The Bill allows exports of personal data from Indonesia in four situations, one of which involves a white list of countries with a level of data protection to or higher than Indonesias law.The Bill makes a wide range of enforcement measures possible, including administrative fines and compensation, but the are all largely at the discretion of actions by the Minister, with the risk that inadequate enforcement will mean that the Bill will be ignored by both data controllers and data owners. The article concludes that Indonesia is trading influence for irrelevance, by abandoning the inclusion of a separate DPA. It could have had one of the strongest and most influential laws in Asia, but the absence of a data protection authority will mean that it does not.","output":"Indonesias DP Bill Lacks a DPA, Despite GDPR Similarities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With emergence of pandemic COVID-19, rapid and accurate diagnostic testing is essential.

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and associations of these coping strategies with depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. METHODS: 8320 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were pregnant between June 22, 2020 and May 10, 2021 completed an online survey including questions about coping strategies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and current depression and anxiety symptoms. We used weighted regression to estimate prevalence ratios for moderate/severe depression and anxiety symptom severity associated with coping strategies. RESULTS: The most common coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress were talking with friends and family (77%), outdoor physical activity (54%), and increasing screen time activities (52%). Exercising using online programs or videos, outdoor physical activity, talking with friends and family, and engaging in more family activities were associated with 29% to 38% lower prevalence of moderate/severe depression symptom severity and 16% to 34% lower prevalence of moderate/severe anxiety symptom severity. LIMITATION: We are unable to rule out reverse temporality as an explanation for the observed results because of the cross-sectional design; depression or anxiety symptom severity may influence use of specific coping strategies. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that physical activity and connecting with others are coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress that may be associated with better mental health in pregnant individuals.","output":"Coping strategies for COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and mental health during pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Hospital admitted patients are at increased risk of nosocomial infections (NIs) with multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens which are prevalent in the hospital environment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) are common causes of NIs worldwide. The objective of this study is to determine antimicrobial resistance profiles and associated factors of Acinetobacter spp and P. aeruginosa NIs among hospitalized patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Dessie comprehensive specialized hospital, North-East Ethiopia, from February 1 to April 30, 2020. A total of 254 patients who were suspected of the bloodstream, urinary tract, or surgical site nosocomial infections were enrolled consecutively. Socio-demographic and other variables of interest were collected using a structured questionnaire. Specimens were collected and processed following standard microbiological procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 23 and p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, 13% of patients had nosocomial Acinetobacter spp and/or P. aeruginosa infections. The culture positivity rate was 16(6.3%) for Acinetobacter spp and 18(7.1%) for P. aeruginosa. Patients admitted in the surgical ward (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR):10.66;95% confidence interval (CI):1.22C93.23), pediatric ward (AOR:14.37;95%CI:1.4C148.5), intensive care unit (AOR:41.93;95%CI:4.7C374.7) and orthopedics (AOR:52.21;95%CI:7.5C365) were significantly at risk to develop NIs compared to patients admitted in the medical ward. Patients who took more than two antimicrobial types at admission were 94% (AOR:0.06; 95% CI:0.004C0.84) times more protected from NIs compared to those who did not take any antimicrobial. About 81% of Acinetobacter spp and 83% of P. aeruginosa isolates were MDR. Amikacin and meropenem showed promising activity against Acinetobacter spp and P. aeruginosa isolates. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of MDR Acinetobacter spp and P. aeruginosa nosocomial isolates enforce treating of patients with NIs based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing results.","output":"Antimicrobial resistance profiles and associated factors of Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial infection among patients admitted at Dessie comprehensive specialized Hospital, North-East Ethiopia.

However, there has been limited research with inconsistent findings on symptoms of COVID-19 and disease severity. We aimed to evaluate the association between symptoms and severity of disease in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 by performing a meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted this study by searching four online databases (Medline, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane library) of published studies that included symptoms of COVID-19 cases and severity of the disease between January 1, 2020, and October 31, 2021. PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines were followed, and only articles published in English were selected. We performed meta-analysis using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model. Note that we included peer-reviewed studies conducted in Wuhan and published in the English language that reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, particularly the symptoms of novel coronavirus patients with their prevalence and distribution of patients based on the severity of the disease. RESULTS: Out of 255 articles identified, a total of twenty articles, including 5390 participants, met the inclusion criteria and were included. Among the participants, 2997 (55.60%) were males, and 974 (18.07%) reported severe conditions. Fever was the most commonly reported symptom in the reported COVID-19 confirmed cases (88.47%, 95% CI: 80.74C93.35%), which was followed by cough, fatigue, and less proportionally dyspnea and myalgia.

The current exploratory study investigated the effect of the first weeks of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on Dutch adolescents (N = 53 with attrition, N = 36 without attrition) mood, empathy, and prosocial behavior. Longitudinal analyses comparing pre-pandemic measures to a three-week peri-pandemic daily diary study showed (i) decreases in empathic concern, opportunities for prosocial actions, and tension, (ii) stable levels of social value orientation, altruism, and dire prosociality, and (iii) increased levels of perspective-taking and vigor during the first weeks of lockdown. Second, this study investigated peri-pandemic effects of familiarity, need, and deservedness on giving behavior. To this end, we utilized novel hypothetical Dictator Games with ecologically valid targets associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents showed higher levels of giving to a friend (a familiar other, about 51% of the total share), a doctor in a hospital (deserving target, 78%), and individuals with COVID-19 or a poor immune system (targets in need, 69 and 63%, respectively) compared to an unfamiliar peer (39%) This suggests that during the pandemic need and deservedness had a greater influence on adolescent giving than familiarity. Overall, this study demonstrates detrimental effects of the first weeks of lockdown on adolescents empathic concern and opportunities for prosocial actions, which are important predictors of healthy socio-emotional development. However, adolescents also showed marked resilience and a willingness to benefit others as a result of the lockdown, as evidenced by improved perspective-taking and mood, and high sensitivity to need and deservedness in giving to others.","output":"A daily diary study on adolescents mood, empathy, and prosocial behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to review the prevalence, the risk factors and the outcomes of venous thrombosis (VT) in patients hospitalized for COronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). METHODS: Electronic bibliographic databases were searched using the words \\"COVID venous thrombosis\\". The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement standards. RESULTS: The search of the Literature retrieved 877 results. After assessment of full texts, 69 papers were included in the qualitative analysis and 23 of them in the quantitative evaluation. The analyzed studies included a total of 106838 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from 01/2020 to 12/2020. The pooled reported prevalence rate of VT was in median 16.7% (IQR 5.8%-30%), being higher in ICU patients (60.8%-85.4%). VT events were reported in about 75% of cases in the popliteal and calf veins. Signs and symptoms were present in 6.1% of cases. At quantitative evaluation, older age, D-dimer and obesity increased the odds to experience a VT (OR 3.54, 95%CI 0.65-6.43, P=0.01; OR=956.86, 95%CI 225.67-1668.05, P=0.01; OR 1.42, 95%CI 1.01-1.99, P=0.03 respectively).

In an increasingly connected world, training in GH and STEGH can provide essential knowledge and practical skills to trainees, particularly at the graduate medical education level. The current core programmatic components and the essential competencies and curricula that support ethical and effective STEGH, however, still vary widely. The authors conducted a survey of the 228 EM residency programs in the United States to describe the current state of GH training and STEGH. Methods: An online survey was developed in REDCap by a team of GH faculty. In July 2018, programs were invited to participate via individual invitation of program directors from a directory. The programs received two reminders to participate until January 2019. Results: Of the 84 programs that responded, 75% offer STEGH and 39% have longitudinal GH curricula. Within these programs, only 55% have dedicated GH faculty and only 70% have dedicated sites. Both faculty and residents encounter funding and insurance barriers; most notably, only 20% of programs that offer STEGH provide evacuation insurance for their residents. Most residents (95%) engage in clinical work along with teaching and other activities, but 24% of programs do not allow these activities to fulfill any residency requirements. Finally, only 80 and 85% of programs offer preparatory and debriefing activities for residents, respectively.

In this process protoporphyrin (PpIX) is released. METHODS: The decrease in the hemoglobin levels observed in patients with Covid-19 is frequently accompanied by an increase in PpIX levels. This evidence was confirmed by the quantification of PpIX by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). PpIX emission is observed in its two characteristic bands at approximately 635 nm and 705 nm. RESULTS: This paper searches to understand the role of heme and PpIX inside the cells. Perspectives on the use of PpIX fluorescence as a sensor to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue, blood, urine, or feces to map the evolution and severity of the disease or to monitor the response of the Covid-19 treatment modalities were described. CONCLUSION: Fluorescence spectroscopy could be adopted as an excellent diagnostic technique for Covid-19, of low cost and high sensitivity. This method can potentially be used as a marker to monitor the response to the treatments.

While the performance and physics of different filter materials have been the topic of intensive study, less well understood are the effects of mask sealing. To address this, we introduce an approach to calculate the influence of face-seal leakage on filtration ratio and fit factor based on an analytical model and a finite element method (FEM) model, both of which take into account time-dependent human respiration velocities. Using these, we calculate the filtration ratio and fit factor for a range of ventilation resistance values relevant to filter materials, 500C2500 Pa?s?m(?1), where the filtration ratio and fit factor are calculated as a function of the mask gap dimensions, with good agreement between analytical and numerical models. The results show that the filtration ratio and fit factor are decrease markedly with even small increases in gap area. We also calculate particle filtration rates for N95 FFRs with various ventilation resistances and two commercial FFRs exemplars. Taken together, this work underscores the critical importance of forming a tight seal around the face as a factor in mask performance, where our straightforward analytical model can be readily applied to obtain estimates of mask performance.","output":"The critical importance of mask seals on respirator performance: An analytical and simulation approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunological detection of viruses and their components by monoclonal antibodies is a powerful method for studying the structure and function of viral molecules.

The hybridomas produce monoclonal antibodies that recognize viral component molecules, including the spike protein (S) and the nucleocapsid protein (N), enabling the immunological detection of SARS-CoV by immunofluorescence staining, immunoblot, or an antigen-capture ELISA system. In addition, several S protein-specific antibodies are shown to have in vitro neutralization activity.

These variants contain mutations at the spike (S) protein receptor binding site (RBD), which affect antibody binding. Current commercially available antibody assays were developed before the VOCs emerged. It is unclear whether the levels of these commercially available antibody assays can predict the neutralizing antibody titers against the VOCs. In this study, we sought to determine the correlation between the binding antibody concentration and microneutralization antibody titer against the beta variant. Methods: This study included 58 COVID-19 patients. The concentrations of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD and nucleocapsid (N) protein were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay and the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, respectively. The neutralization antibody titer against the wild type lineage A SARS-CoV-2 and against the beta variant (B.1.351) was determined using a conventional live virus neutralization test. Results: The geometric mean MN titer (GMT) against the beta variant was significantly lower than that against the wild type lineage A virus (5.6 vs. 47.3, p < 0.0001). The anti-RBD IgG had a better correlation with the neutralizing antibody titer than that of the anti-N IgG assay against the wild type lineage A virus (Spearman rho, 0.5901 vs. 0.3827). However, the correlation between the anti-RBD or the anti-N IgG and the MN titer against the beta variant was poor.

Murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related glycoproteins (MHVR and mmCGM2) are expressed in many murine tissues and serve as receptors for respiratory MHV strains. To assess the role of receptors in the limited tissue tropism of enterotropic MHV strains, the permissiveness of MHVR- and mmCGM2-expressing cell lines and peritoneal exudate cells from BALB/c and SJL mice for MHV-RI and MHV-Y replication was determined. MHVR transfected BHK cells were susceptible to infection with both MHV-RI and MHV-Y. Additionally, the anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody CC1 blocked MHV-RI and MHV-Y infection. mmCGM2-transfected BHK cells were susceptible to infection with MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI. Peritoneal exudate cells from BALB/c mice were susceptible to infection with MHV-Y and MHVRI, whereas peritoneal exudate cells from SJL- mice were susceptible to infection with MHV-Y but not MHV-RI.

STUDY DESIGN: For 34 European countries, publicly available data were collected on daily numbers of COVID-19 deaths, population size, healthcare capacity, government restrictions and their timing, tourism and change in mobility during the pandemic. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate generalised linear models using different selection algorithms (forward, backward, stepwise and genetic algorithm) were analysed with height of COVID-19 daily deaths' peak and time to the peak as dependent variables. RESULTS: The proportion of the population living in urban areas, mobility at the day of first reported death and number of infections when borders were closed were assessed as significant predictors of the height of COVID-19 daily deaths' peak. Testing the model with a variety of selection algorithms provided consistent results. Total hospital bed capacity, population size, the number of foreign travellers and the day of border closure were found to be significant predictors of time to COVID-19 daily deaths' peak. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that countries with higher proportions of the population living in urban areas, countries with lower reduction in mobility at the beginning of the pandemic and countries having more infected people when closing borders experienced a higher peak of COVID-19 deaths. Greater bed capacity, bigger population size and later border closure could result in delaying time to reach the deaths' peak, whereas a high number of foreign travellers could accelerate it.","output":"Factors influencing the COVID-19 daily deaths' peak across European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to trace the evolution of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), S1 and ORF3 genes of viruses identified in 41 pig farms from seven regions (North, Northeast, Northwest, Central, East, South West, and South, respectively) of China in 2015 were sequenced and analyzed. Sequence analysis revealed that the 41 ORF3 genes and 29 S1 genes identified in our study exhibited nucleotide homologies of 98.2%C100% and 96.6%C100%, respectively; these two genes exhibited low nucleotide sequence similarities with classical CV777 strain and early Chinese strain LZC.

METHODS: Patients who had stable pain and functional outcome scores over the preceding 2 years were enrolled in a local prospectively collected adult spinal deformity (ASD) database. A reanalysis of their SRS22, ODI and SF-36 data 14 days into confinement were compared to their last pre-confinement scores. RESULTS: 89 patients were included in this study (average age 60.7 years, 91% female) with an average time from last FU until confinement of 9.6 months. The ODI total score worsened by 5 points post-confinement with no difference seen in personal care, walking and social life. In contrast, the SRS-22 score showed small improvements in function/activity and satisfaction, but no significant differences for the other domains. Similarly, the SF-36 showed small improvements in physical function, physical and emotional role, vitality and PCS. CONCLUSION: The global COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing confinement had variable overall effects on ASD patients, without the expected marked worsening.

We investigate whether synchronizing with a regular auditory cue is affected by each persons spontaneous production rate (SPR) and by hearing a partners synchronization in a social context. Musically trained and untrained participants synchronized their tapping with an auditory cue presented at different rates (their own SPR or their partners SPR) and in a Solo or Joint (turn-taking) condition. Linear and nonlinear oscillator models were fit to participants mean asynchronies (signed timing differences between the cued onsets and taps). In Joint turn-taking, participants synchrony was increased when the auditory signal was cued at the participants own SPR, compared with their partners SPR; in contrast, synchronization did not differ across rates in the Solo condition. Asynchronies in the Joint task became larger as the difference between partners spontaneous rates increased; the increased asynchronies were driven by the faster partner who did not slow down to match the rate of their slower partner. Nonlinear delay-coupled models (with time delay, coupling strength, and intrinsic frequency) outperformed linear models (intrinsic frequency only) in accounting for tappers synchronization adjustments. The nonlinear models coupling value increased for musically trained participants, relative to untrained participants. Overall, these findings suggest that both intrinsic differences in partners spontaneous rates and the social turn-taking context contribute to the range of synchrony in the general population.

Age, gender, comorbidities, and housing context have been reported to be among the risk factors for mortality. Exposure to antipsychotics have been discussed to potentially impact the immune response and may pose additional risks. Furthermore, neuropsychiatric presentations are common among older patients and it is unclear how geriatric patients with preexisting psychiatric and neuropsychiatric problems recover from COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective observational study, we describe demographic characteristics of patients at a large geriatric psychiatric outpatient clinic in the New York metropolitan area, who had COVID-19. Our aim is to identify factors that may be associated with increased mortality and to evaluate whether those who survived returned to pre-COVID baseline function. We combined information provided by the treating psychiatrists with data that could be extracted from the electronic health records. Results Between February and September 2020, we identified 56 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (mean age 76 years old). Thirteen patients (23.2%) died and we found that antipsychotics use at the time of COVID-19 infection is associated with increased risk of death (Fisher's exact test P= 0.009, odds ratio = 11.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.4 C 96.0). The result remains significant after adjusting for age, gender, housing context and presence of neurocognitive disorder (Logistic regression P=0.037, Beta=2.4). Furthermore, we found that most patients who survived COVID-19 recovered to baseline (88.4%) as indicated by the ratio of pre- and post-COVID Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale (mean ratio= 0.98, median=1.0, One-sample t-test P=0.48) in 33 patients. Conclusions In conclusion, antipsychotics appear to be associated with higher mortality in our geriatric psychiatry outpatient cohort. However, it is encouraging to find that the majority of elderly patients who survived COVID-19 seems to recover to their baseline neuropsychiatric function. Future larger studies are needed to put these observations into a broader context as well as to explore underlying mechanisms of risk factors.

Understanding how COVID-19 has affected mental health care delivery within primary care settings will be critical to inform future policy and practice decisions during the later phases of the pandemic and beyond. The objective of our study was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care teams delivery of mental health care. METHODS: A qualitative study using focus groups conducted with primary care teams in Ontario, Canada. Focus group data was analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: We conducted 11 focus groups with 10 primary care teams and a total of 48 participants. With respect to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care in primary care teams, we identified three key themes: i) the high demand for mental health care, ii) the rapid transformation to virtual care, and iii) the impact on providers. CONCLUSIONS: From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care quickly responded to the rising mental health care demands of their patients. Despite the numerous challenges they faced with the rapid transition to virtual care, primary care teams have persevered. It is essential that policy and decision-makers take note of the toll that these demands have placed on providers.

Despite this, some patients develop refractory hypoxemia and hypercapnia requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support and are usually cared for in supine position. The physiologic and outcome benefits of routine PP of patients during VV ECMO remains unclear. Hence, we conducted the systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcome benefits of PP for patients with ARDS being treated with VV ECMO. METHODS: After registration with PROSPERO (CRD42020199723), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant studies that reported PP in more than 10 adult patients supported with VV ECMO from origin to 1 March 2021. Studies were reviewed for quality using appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) was used. The primary outcome of interest was cumulative survival. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS) and ECMO duration. Changes in arterial blood gas (ABG) values, ventilator mechanics and complication rates were also studied. RESULTS: Of 812 potentially relevant publications, 12 studies (640 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Due to overlapping study populations, 11 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Cumulative survival in patients that underwent PP was 57% (95% CI 41.9C71.4, high certainty). Patients that underwent PP had longer ICU LOS (+ 14.5 days, 95% CI 3.4C25.7, p = 0.01) and ECMO duration (+ 9.6 days, 95% CI 5.5C13.7, p < 0.0001). After PP, patients had significantly higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, lower PaCO(2) and reduced ventilator driving pressure, and no major complications were reported. CONCLUSIONS: PP during VV ECMO appears safe with a cumulative survival of 57% and may result in longer ECMO runs and ICU LOS. However, evidence from appropriately designed randomized trials is needed prior to widespread adoption of PP on VV ECMO.

Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database of five centers situated in different parts of India. Variables such as demographics, intraoperative, and postoperative complications were compared between COVID-19 (group A-March 23, 2020-May 22, 2020) and pre-COVID time period (group B-January 1 to January 31, 2020). Results One-hundred sixty-eight cancer surgeries were performed in group B as compared with 148 patients who underwent oncosurgeries in group A. Sixty-two percent lesser cancer surgeries were performed in the COVID-19 period as compared with the specific pre-COVID-19 period. There was no significant difference in age group, gender, comorbidities, and type of cancer surgeries. Except for the duration of surgery, all other intraoperative parameters like blood loss and intraoperative parameters were similar in both the groups. Minimally invasive procedures were significantly lesser in group A. Postoperative parameters including period of intensive care unit stay, rate of infection, need for the change of antibiotics, and culture growth were similar for both the groups. While minor complication like Clavien-Dindo classification type 2 was significantly higher for group A, all other complication rates were similar in the groups. Also, postoperatively no COVID-19-related symptoms were encountered in the study group. A subset analysis was done among the study groups between those tested preoperatively for COVID-19 versus those untested showed no difference in intraoperative and postoperative parameters.

GCs play a key role in the regulation of numerous physiological processes, including inflammation, glucose, lipid, protein metabolism and stress response. This is achieved through binding to their cognate receptor, GR, which functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor. Due to their potent anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressive action, synthetic GCs are broadly used for treating pathological disorders that are very often linked to hypoxia (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory, allergic, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, among others) as well as to prevent graft rejections and against immune system malignancies. However, due to the presence of adverse effects and GC resistance their therapeutic benefits are limited in patients chronically treated with steroids. For this reason, understanding how to fine-tune GR activity is crucial in the search for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing GC-related side effects and effectively restoring homeostasis. Recent research has uncovered novel mechanisms that inhibit GR function, thereby causing glucocorticoid resistance, and has produced some surprising new findings. In this review we analyse these mechanisms and focus on the crosstalk between GR and HIF signalling. Indeed, its comprehension may provide new routes to develop novel therapeutic targets for effectively treating immune and inflammatory response and to simultaneously facilitate the development of innovative GCs with a better benefits-risk ratio.","output":"Homeostatic Regulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor Activity by Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1: From Physiology to Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The step test has been used to assess exercise capacity in patients with chronic respiratory disease; however, its use has not been described with regard to patients with bronchiectasis (BCT).

METHOD On separate days, 17 patients randomly underwent two CSTs, two MISTs, and two 6-MWTs. Number of steps (NOSs), HR, and perceived exertion were recorded immediately before and after these tests. RESULTS NOSs were similar across CSTs (12465 and 12567) and MISTs (15883 and 15676).

BACKGROUND Transfemoral access (TFA) has been associated with the risk of bleeding and increased mortality that is elevated compared to transradial access (TRA) in acute coronary syndromes, although less consistently in NSTE acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) than in STE-ACS. METHODS The ACCOAST study evaluated a prasugrel loading dose of 60 mg given at the start of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus a split loading dose of 30 mg given at the time of diagnosis of NSTE-ACS (prior to coronary angiography), followed by 30 mg given at the start of PCI. In the study, choice of access site was at the investigator's discretion. We compared ischemic and bleeding outcomes with TFA versus those with TRA, using propensity score correction. RESULTS Of 4,033 patients, 1,711 (42%) underwent TRA. Use of TRA varied widely by country. TFA was not associated with significant increases in noncoronary bypass graft (CABG)-related thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) (hazard ratio [HR] for TFA = 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59 to 3.62; p = 0.42), nor in GUSTO (Global Utilization Of Streptokinase and Tpa for Occluded arteries) or STEEPLE (Safety and Efficacy of Enoxaparin in PCI) major bleeding after propensity score correction. TFA, however, increased combined non-CABG TIMI major or minor bleeding (HR for TFA = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.69; p = 0.017). Primary ischemic outcomes did not differ by access site, albeit individual endpoint analysis suggested an association between TFA with an increase in urgent revascularizations and reduced risk of procedure-related stroke.

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are the only RCTs routinely conducted during the pandemic. Information about efficacy and safety of different vaccines represents a fertile ground for nocebo phenomena. Individual and contextual factors will be emphasized in order to understand the presence of a refusal of immunization associated with a specific vaccine considered less effective and safe. Critical aspects and some guidelines will be presented in order to counteract the nocebo effects and to improve adherence to drug treatments and the vaccination campaign.Expert opinion: The nocebo effect could explain the presence of strong resistance in European countries to immunization with a vaccine perceived as less effective, compared to others. Increased awareness of the nocebo effect would be relevant as it could lead to a greater participation in the vaccination campaign and in protecting individuals against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"How do nocebo effects in placebo groups of randomized controlled trials provide a possible explicative framework for the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model structure and its variants are a fundamental modeling tool in epidemiology. As typically used, however, this tool may introduce an inconsistency by assuming that the rate of depletion of a compartment is proportional to the content of that compartment. As mentioned in the seminal SIR work of Kermack and McKendrick, this is an assumption of mathematical convenience rather than realism. As such, it leads to underprediction of the infectious compartment peaks by a factor of about two, a problem of particular importance when dealing with availability of resources during an epidemic. To remedy this problem, we develop the dSIR model structure, comprising a single delay differential equation and associated delay algebraic equations. We show that SIR and dSIR fully agree in assessing stability and long-term values of a population through an epidemic, but differ considerably in the exponential rates of ascent and descent as well as peak values during the epidemic. The novel Pade-SIR structure is also introduced as a approximation of dSIR by ordinary differential equations. We rigorously analyze the properties of these models and present a number of illustrative simulations, particularly in view of the recent coronavirus epidemic. Suggestions for further study are made.","output":"A Fundamental Inconsistency in the SIR Model Structure and Proposed Remedies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"English abstract: In discussing the first Draft State Budget to address the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor begins with an analysis of the economys recent behaviour and how it may evolve in the coming quarters, drawing on the Banco de Espa?as projections.

It has evolved a multi-faceted, physical and immune defense system to ensure that in the majority of instances, potentially injurious invaders are repelled. Inflammation, predominantly mediated by effector cells of the granulocyte lineage including neutrophils and eosinophils, is a form of immune defense. Where inflammation proves unable to remove an inciting stimulus, chronic inflammatory disease may supervene because of the potential for tissue damage conferred by the presence of large numbers of frustrated, activated granulocytes. Successful recovery from inflammatory disease and resolution of inflammation rely on the clearance of these cells. Ideally, they should undergo apoptosis prior to phagocytosis by macrophage, dendritic, or epithelial cells. The outcome of inflammation can have serious sequelae for the integrity of the respiratory mucosa leading to disease. Therapeutic strategies to drive resolution of inflammation may be directed at the induction of granulocyte apoptosis and the enhancement of granulocyte clearance.

The health crisis has not only had an impact on people's own health and on health systems, but has also affected other areas. In the educational context, the lockdown measures implemented by different governments have challenged the learning ecosystem. In the case of higher education in Spain, with a strong attendance factor in most public universities, face-to-face classes were interrupted after a month in the second term, ending the academic year in the online mode. This change has meant a great effort on the teachers' side to transform the face-to-face teaching into the online approach, which in many cases has meant quite a comprehensive new design of the subject, changing the evaluation process and the methodologies used. This work presents a success case of online assessment developed in the Software Engineering I subject of the Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Salamanca. The objective is to show how the previous use of active methodologies and the integration of educational technologies in classroom-based teaching facilitates the transformation of assessment to an online or blended approach while maintaining a high degree of student involvement and satisfaction. After presenting a comparison between the face-to-face approach and the adaptation to the online approach, an analysis is made of the learning results and student satisfaction concerning previous academic years. The results show that the change of approach has not reduced the satisfaction results obtained in previous courses.

Fifteen percent of the Covid-19 patients will require hospital stay, and 10% of them will need urgent respiratory and hemodynamic support in the intensive care unit (ICU). Covid-19 is an infectious disease characterized by inflammatory syndrome, itself leading to reduced food intake and increased muscle catabolism. Therefore Covid-19 patients are at high risk of being malnourished, making the prevention of malnutrition and the nutritional management key aspects of care. Urgent, brutal and massive arrivals of patients needing urgent respiratory care and artificial ventilation lead to the necessity to reorganize hospital care, wards and staff. In that context, nutritional screening and care may not be considered a priority. Moreover, at the start of the epidemic, due to mask and other protecting material shortage, the risk of healthcare givers contamination have led to not using enteral nutrition, although indicated, because nasogastric tube insertion is an aerosol-generating procedure. Clinical nutrition practice based on the international guidelines should therefore adapt and the use of degraded procedures could unfortunately be the only way.

To meet the increased demand for hand sanitizer during the pandemic, the US FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization allowing new manufacturers and importers to enter the market. Some of the newly introduced hand sanitizer products contained methanol in lieu of ethanol or isopropanol. We describe five patients with fatal methanol poisoning resulting from hand sanitizers improperly containing methanol. CASE SUMMARY Comparing a 5-month period from 2019 to the same time frame in 2020, the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center has seen an increase of 124% in exposures to hand sanitizer. Of these cases, 28% involved methanol-contaminated hand sanitizer. Five of these patients died from methanol poisoning. All five cases had similar clinical features with severe high anion gap metabolic acidosis and, in four patients, elevated osmolal gap. Methanol concentrations were consistently very elevated, but these results were not available before the patients succumbed. Four of the patients received fomepizole and adjunctive care. Two patients received emergency extracorporeal therapy. All five died despite maximal treatment efforts. CONCLUSION During the pandemic in 2020, there was a proliferation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers which contained methanol. Exposure to these products, which failed to meet regulatory standards, led to increased harm and death. Challenges to treatment of methanol poisoning, especially in rural areas, include lack of access to timely laboratory measurement of methanol concentrations and lack of available emergency hemodialysis without transfer of the patient.","output":"Death by hand sanitizer: syndemic methanol poisoning in the age of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Thrombolysis with intravenous alteplase is both effective and safe when administered to particular types of patient within 45 hours of having an ischemic stroke. However, the extent to which effects might vary in different types of patient is uncertain. AIMS AND DESIGN We describe the protocol for an updated individual patient data meta-analysis of trials of intravenous alteplase, including results from the recently reported third International Stroke Trial, in which a wide range of patients enrolled up to six-hours after stroke onset were randomized to alteplase vs. control. STUDY OUTCOMES This protocol will specify the primary outcome for efficacy, specified prior to knowledge of the results from the third International Stroke Trial, as the proportion of patients having a 'favorable' stroke outcome, defined by modified Rankin Score 0-1 at final follow-up at three- to six-months. The primary analysis will be to estimate the extent to which the known benefit of alteplase on modified Rankin Score 0-1 diminishes with treatment delay, and the extent to which it is independently modified by age and stroke severity. Key secondary outcomes include effect of alteplase on death within 90 days; analyses of modified Rankin Score using ordinal, rather than dichotomous, methods; and effects of alteplase on symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, fatal intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic ischemic brain edema and early edema, effacement and/or midline shift.

We contend that these claims are unprofessional and demonstrate a disturbing lack of insight into the doctrine of informed consent. As such it is timely to review how informed consent has evolved and continues to do so and also to discuss the attendant implications for contemporary health practitioner practice. We review the origins of informed consent and trace the duty of disclosure and materiality through landmark medical consent cases in four common law (case law) jurisdictions. The duty of disclosure has evolved from a patriarchal exercise to one in which patient autonomy in clinical decision making is paramount. Passing time has seen the duty of disclosure evolve to include non-medical aspects that may influence the delivery of care. We argue that a patient cannot provide valid informed consent for the removal of vertebral subluxation. Further, vertebral subluxation care cannot meet code of conduct standards because it lacks an evidence base and is practitioner-centered. The uptake of the expanded duty of disclosure has been slow and incomplete by practitioners and regulators. The expanded duty of disclosure has implications, both educative and punitive for regulators, chiropractic educators and professional associations. We discuss how practitioners and regulators can be informed by other sources such as consumer law. For regulators, reviewing and updating informed consent requirements is required. For practitioners it may necessitate disclosure of health status, conflict of interest when recommending inhouse products, recency of training after attending continuing professional development, practice patterns, personal interests and disciplinary findings. CONCLUSION: Ultimately such matters are informed by the deliberations of the courts. It is our opinion that the duty of a mature profession to critically self-evaluate and respond in the best interests of the patient before these matters arrive in court.","output":"Informed consent, duty of disclosure and chiropractic: where are we?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The world is facing a pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 that disrupted our healthcare system and the way we deliver healthcare. For people with HIV (PWH), the ability to be retained in care plays a critical role in improving health outcomes and in preventing HIV transmission. Several definitions exist for retention in care, but they are centered around outpatient clinic visits. It is now more important than ever to understand PWHs attitudes about using telemedicine for HIV care instead of face-to face clinic visits. METHODS: We administered a one-time survey to PWH presenting to an outpatient HIV center in Houston, Texas, from FebruaryCJune 2018. The survey items were used to assess PWHs attitudes towards and concerns for telehealth and explanatory variables. RESULTS: 371 participants completed the survey; median age was 51, 36% were female, and 63% African-American. Overall, 57% of respondents were more likely to use telehealth for their HIV care if available, as compared to one-on-one in-person care, and 37% would use telehealth frequently or always as an alternative to clinic visits. Participants reported many benefits including ability to fit better their schedule, decreasing travel time, and privacy but expressed concerns about the ability to effective communication and examination and the safety of personal information. Factors associated with likelihood of using telehealth include personal factors (US-born, men who have sex with men, higher educational attainment, higher HIV-related stigma perception), HIV-related factors (long standing HIV), and structural factors (having difficulty attending clinic visits, not knowing about or not having the necessary technology). There was no association between participants with uncontrolled HIV, medication adherence, and likelihood of using telehealth. Survey items and response distribution [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Telehealth programs for PWH can improve retention in care. A modification of the definition for retention in care, incorporating telehealth, should be considered. Availability and confidence using various telehealth technologies need to be addressed to increase acceptability and usage of telehealth among PWH.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine strongly urges sleep clinicians to continue postponing non-urgent care until a later date, if such a recommendation is made by state officials due to local conditions. At the same time, one cannot ignore the fact that sleep is important for people's health and wellbeing. Therefore, to protect the health of the population, it is essential to find ways and means to continue the practice of sleep medicine even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Social environment and work ethics in sleep clinics and sleep laboratories in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are different from those in the US. Under these circumstances, the Indian Society for Sleep Research (ISSR) created a task force to develop guidelines for the practice of sleep medicine, not only for the Indian environment but also for other countries that are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force examined documents regarding practice of sleep medicine and associated specialities during COVID-19 by various professional organizations and governmental authorities. The recommendations were examined for their applicability. Wherever gaps were identified, consensus was reached keeping in view the available evidences. Outcome and Recommendations: The emphasis of the guidelines is on avoiding doctor to patient contact during the pandemic. Teleconsultation and other modes of audio-visuals can be used as modes for medical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in addition to the patient, the presence of a family member, or a reliable informant is recommended. Patients of most sleep disorders can be provided tele-aftercare service. ISSR guidelines also give a list of medications allowed to be prescribed during the first and the follow-up teleconsultation. Hospitals and clinics are slowly opening in India and many other countries. As sleep services resume operations, there is a need to find innovative ways to reduce contact with COVID-19 patients, follow personal protection guidelines, as well as social distancing. This article does discuss strategies for the safe conduct of Level 1 sleep studies. Home sleep testing, which had greater acceptance during the last few years, should be given more attention during the COVID-19 period. Once the decision to reopen the sleep laboratory and resume operations is made, the safety of the patients and office staff should become the major priority. The ISSR recommendation is to postpone and reschedule in-laboratory positive pressure therapy, but it mentions the considerations to be followed in emergency situations. At the same time, high clinical risk patients may be diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, and without performing polysomnography or home sleep testing. However, at some point, there is a need to reinitiate the in-lab testing. In addition, daily assessment of the COVID-19 situation in the community, along with a review of the situation with local public health and the state health department is advised.","output":"Guidelines of the Indian Society for Sleep Research (ISSR) for Practice of Sleep Medicine during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: A considerable proportion of patients affected by coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) develop cardiac injury.

However, some studies indicate that supplement users consume healthier diets than non-users, although such data are lacking in Japanese children. The aim of the present study was to investigate the food and nutrient intake of dietary supplement users among school-aged children in Japan. A nationwide school dietary survey was conducted at fourteen elementary schools and thirteen junior high schools in twelve prefectures in Japan. Three-day non-consecutive semi-weighed dietary records were obtained on two weekdays and one weekend day. Analysis of covariance was performed to investigate differences in food and nutrient intake from meals consumed at school and outside of school between dietary supplement users and non-users, adjusted for socio-demographic and health-related characteristics. Of the 910 children included in this analysis, 80 (8a? 8 %) reported supplement use. Based on 3-d dietary records, dietary supplement users consumed higher mean amounts of oils and lower amounts of fruits and vegetables than non-users. In school lunches, users consumed significantly higher amounts of oils and lower amounts of protein than non-users. In meals consumed outside of school, dietary supplement users consumed significantly higher amounts of confectioneries and lower amounts of fruits and vegetables, folate, vitamin C and dietary fibre than non-users.

Although national deficits have been quantified, a structured response to identifying and addressing local deficits has not been widely available. The objectives of this report are to share preliminary data on monthly screening deficits in breast, colorectal, lung, and cervical cancers across diverse settings and to provide online materials from a national quality improvement (QI) study to help other institutions to address local screening deficits. METHODS This prospective, national QI study on Return-to-Screening enrolled 748 accredited cancer programs in the United States from April through June 2021. Local prepandemic and pandemic monthly screening test volumes (MTVs) were used to calculate the relative percent change in MTV to describe the monthly screening gap. RESULTS The majority of facilities reported monthly screening deficits (colorectal cancer, 80.6% [n = 104/129]; cervical cancer, 69.0% [n = 20/29]; breast cancer, 55.3% [n = 241/436]; lung cancer, 44.6% [n = 98/220]). Overall, the median relative percent change in MTV ranged from -17.7% for colorectal cancer (interquartile range [IQR], -33.6% to -2.8%), -6.8% for cervical cancer (IQR, -29.4% to 1.7%), -1.6% for breast cancer (IQR, -9.6% to 7.0%), and 1.2% for lung cancer (IQR, -16.9% to 19.0%). Geographic differences were not observed. There were statistically significant differences in the percent change in MTV between institution types for colorectal cancer screening (P = .02). CONCLUSION Cancer screening is still in need of urgent attention, and the screening resources made available online may help facilities to close critical gaps and address screenings missed in 2020. LAY SUMMARY Question: How can the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on cancer screening be mitigated? FINDINGS When national resources were provided, including methods to calculate local screening deficits, 748 cancer programs promptly enrolled in a national Return-to-Screening study, and the majority identified local screening deficits, most notably in colorectal cancer. Using these results, 814 quality improvement projects were initiated with the potential to add 70,000 screening tests in 2021. Meaning: Cancer screening is still in need of urgent attention, and the online resources that we provide may help to close critical screening deficits.","output":"A national quality improvement study identifying and addressing cancer screening deficits due to the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treatment of an enterocutaneous fistula is complex and may require multidisciplinary management, especially when associated with a neoplastic process.

The specificity and kinetics of the neutralizing antibody response induced by the circulating Makona EBOV has not been thoroughly studied. METHODS We have used a lentiviral EBOV-glycoprotein (GP)-pseudotyped infection assay to measure Makona-GP and Mayinga-GP specific neutralizing activity of plasma from three convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients from the current EBOV outbreak at 2, 3, 4 and 9 months post-infection. Total anti-EBOV GP IgG was measured by a commercial ELISA assay. FINDINGS In convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients, Makona-GP-specific neutralizing titers increased from 2 months (mean IC50 1/59), 3 months (IC50 1/212), 4 months (IC50 1/239) and up to 9 months (IC50 1/268) post-infection. Neutralizing activity of plasma from the three convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients was more vigorous against the current Makona-GP pseudotyped EBOV variant than against Mayinga-GP pseudotyped EBOV and this difference was observed at each time point tested: Mayinga vs Makona mean IC50 fold=4.92 at 2 months post-infection, 2.89 fold at 3 months post-infection, 2.23 at 4 months post-infection and 2.98 at 9 months post-infection (all differences p<0.01). Total level of IgG against EBOV-GP did not evolve significantly during the follow up. DISCUSSION In convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients, EBOV-GP specific neutralizing activity increases over time, at least up to 9 months post-infection, which suggests that active affinity maturation of antibodies takes place long after clinical recovery. EBOV-GP specific neutralizing response is significantly higher against Makona EBOV circulating in West Africa than against the variants included in the currently approved vaccines. Correlates of protection for EBOV vaccines have not been completely established and the relevance of a lower neutralizing activity in convalescent plasma from the current outbreak against one of the EBOV-GPs contained in the vaccines in terms of its potential efficacy does not necessarily preclude its efficacy. However, this observation highlights the concern regarding the natural diversity of EBOV and its subsequent challenge for diagnosis, therapy and vaccine design. EBOV-GP neutralizing activity varies considerably over time in convalescent Ebola Virus Disease patients.

Many studies have introduced prediction approaches to facilitate the early prediction and estimate the future occurrence based on mammography periodic tests. In the current research, we introduce a novel machine learning tool for the early prediction of breast cancer. METHODS: Three basic resources are used to identify the most essential risk factors; including the BCSC (Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium) dataset, a medical questionnaire, and multiple international breast cancer reports. The BCSC dataset has been normalized and balanced; consequently, the questionnaire and the medical reports are analyzed in order to define the degree of importance and a potential weight factor of each risk factor. These weights are used to scale risk factors and then the optimizable tree-based ML model is trained using the balanced weighted risk factors datasets. RESULTS: Three balanced versions of the BCSC dataset are used; oversampled, down-sampled and mixed datasets. Each risk factor has a weight (1, 2 or 4) assigned based on a mathematical modelling of the questionnaire and the international breast cancer reports. The experiments are applied on the weighted and non-weighted versions of the database, and they indicate that the performance increases significantly by using the weighted version of the risk factors. The tests prove that the down-weighting of the non-essential risk factor increases the accuracy and reduces errors. The overall accuracy of the weighted balanced datasets reaches 100%, 95.8% and 95.9% for down-sampled, oversampled and mixed datasets respectively. CONCLUSION: Weighting the risk factors of the BCSC dataset improves the performance by increasing the accuracy and reducing the false rejection and false discovery rates for all versions of balanced datasets. The weighting approach can also be used to improve the estimation score of breast cancer by scaling the individual scores of risk factors.","output":"Study the Effect of the Risk Factors in the Estimation of the Breast Cancer Risk Score Using Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic, there was a progressive increase in diagnostic demands that developed within a relatively short period of time On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services issued the Emergency Use Authorization for in vitro diagnostics assays for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 virus Subsequently, multiple assays were approved under the Emergency Use Authorization, including the Cepheid Xpert SARS-CoV-2 assay Presented here is a description of the nationally coordinated verification study of the Cepheid assay that was performed within the Veteran's Affairs Health System This coordinated study helped to expedite the verification process for a majority of the Veteran's Affairs system labs, preserved precious system resources, and highlighted the power of a national medical system in response to an emergency","output":"VA-Wide, Multicenter Verification Study of the Cepheid Xpert SARS-CoV-2 Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The success of large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaigns is contingent upon people being willing to receive the vaccine. Our study explored COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its correlates in eight different countries around the globe. We analyzed convenience sample data collected between March 2020 and January 2021 as part of the iCARE cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to explore the correlates of vaccine hesitancy. We included 32,028 participants from eight countries, and observed that 27% of the participants exhibited vaccine hesitancy, with increases over time. France reported the highest level of hesitancy (47.3%) and Brazil reported the lowest (9.6%). Women, younger individuals (29 years), people living in rural areas, and those with a lower perceived income were more likely to be hesitant. People who previously received an influenza vaccine were 70% less likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We observed that people reporting greater COVID-19 health concerns were less likely to be hesitant, whereas people with higher personal financial concerns were more likely to be hesitant. Our findings indicate that there is substantial vaccine hesitancy in several countries, with cross-national differences in the magnitude and direction of the trend. Vaccination communication initiatives should target hesitant individuals (women, younger adults, people with lower incomes and those living in rural areas), and should highlight the immediate health, social and economic benefits of vaccination across these settings.

We reported the epidemiological and clinical features of 478 confirmed cases from a multicentre study outside of Wuhan, China. Methods : We collected patients who were transferred by Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals in four major cities including Beijing, Chongqing, Jinan and Nanning in China. We compared the characteristics between imported and indigenous cases, and calculated the fatality, and the rate of severe cases, mild and asymptomatic cases to generate the pyramid of COVID-19 infection. Results : The mean age of patients was 46.9 years old and 49.8% were male. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (69.7% ), cough (47.5%), fatigue (24.5%), dyspnea (8.4%) and headache (7.9%). In the study, most cases (313, 65.5%) were indigenous, while 165 (34.5%) were imported. During the early stage, the imported cases were dominant, which declined from Feb 1, when the indigenous cases rise sharply. Compared with the indigenous cases, the imported cases were significantly distinct concerning gender composition (P=0.002), classification of severity (P=0.006).

Despite this, they had still to go to hospital to receive chemotherapy during lockdown. In this context, we have evaluated the psychological status of onco-hematological outpatients receiving infusion and not deferrable anti-neoplastic treatment for lymphoproliferative neoplasms, with the aim of both measuring the levels of post-traumatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic and also of investigating the perception of risk of potential nosocomial infection. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered to all patients. Moreover, patients were investigated about their worries regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their lives as onco-hematologic patients. Since the 2nd to the 29th April 2020 (during the first phase of the lockdown period in Italy), 77 outpatients were prospectively evaluated. They were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/Small lymphocytic lymphoma. The mean age was 56.6 (range 22C85). We found that 36% of patients had anxiety (HADS-A), 31% depression (HADS-D), and 43% were above the cut-off for the HADS-General Scale; 36% fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The fuzzy spatial clustering approach had been implemented to analyze the social vulnerability to natural hazards in Indonesia. Moreover, this study proposes the Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) to optimize the Fuzzy Geographically Weighted Clustering (FGWC) in order to cluster the business vulnerability in Indonesia. We performed the data analysis with the dataset from Indonesia's national socioeconomic and labor force survey (SUSENAS and SAKERNAS). We first compared the performance of FPA with traditional FGWC, as well as several known optimization algorithms in FGWC such as Artificial Bee Colony, Intelligent Firefly Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Gravitational Search Algorithm. Our results showed that FPAFGWC has the best performance in optimizing the FGWC clustering result in the business vulnerability context. We found that almost all of the regions in Indonesia outside Java Island have vulnerable businesses. Meanwhile, in most of Java Island, particularly the JABODETABEK area that is the national economic backbone, businesses are not vulnerable.

Here we present a panel of anti-CyRPA monoclonal antibodies that strongly inhibit parasite growth in in vitro assays. Structural studies show that growth-inhibitory antibodies bind epitopes on a single face of CyRPA. We also show that pairs of non-competing inhibitory antibodies have strongly synergistic growth-inhibitory activity. These antibodies bind to neighbouring epitopes on CyRPA and form lateral, heterotypic interactions which slow antibody dissociation. We predict that such heterotypic interactions will be a feature of many immune responses.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of MI among HCWs, to identify the relationship among factors that predict MI, and to determine whether MR can act as buffer against it. DESIGN: Web-based exploratory survey. SETTING/SUBJECTS: HCWs from a research network in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region. MEASUREMENTS: Survey items included: our outcome, Moral Injury Symptoms ScaleCHealth Professional (MISS-HP), and predictors including demographics, items derived from the Rushton Moral Resilience Scale (RMRS), and ethical concerns index (ECI). RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of 595 respondents provided COVID-19 care. The overall prevalence of clinically significant MI in HCWs was 32.4%; nurses reporting the highest occurrence. Higher scores on each of the ECI items were significantly positively associated with higher MI symptoms (p < 0.05). MI among HCWs was significantly related to the following: MR score, ECI score, religious affiliation, and having 20 years in their profession. MR was a moderator of the effect of years of experience on MI. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs are experiencing MI during the pandemic. MR offers a promising individual resource to buffer the detrimental impact of MI.

As the worlds older population keeps skyrocketing, the traditional incompetent, time-consuming, and laborious interventions are becoming increasingly insufficient to address dementia patients health care needs. This is particularly true amid COVID-19. Instead, efficient, cost-effective, and technology-based strategies, such as sixth-generation communication solutions (6G) and artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered health solutions, might be the key to successfully managing the dementia epidemic until a cure becomes available. However, while 6G and AI technologies hold great promise, no research has examined how 6G and AI applications can effectively and efficiently address dementia patients health care needs and improve their quality of life. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate ways in which 6G and AI technologies could elevate dementia care to address this study gap. METHODS: A literature review was conducted in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO. The search focused on three themes: dementia, 6G, and AI technologies. The initial search was conducted on April 25, 2021, complemented by relevant articles identified via a follow-up search on November 11, 2021, and Google Scholar alerts. RESULTS: The findings of the study were analyzed in terms of the interplay between people with dementias unique health challenges and the promising capabilities of health technologies, with in-depth and comprehensive analyses of advanced technology-based solutions that could address key dementia care needs, ranging from impairments in memory (eg, Egocentric Live 4D Perception), speech (eg, Project Relate), motor (eg, Avatar Robot Caf), cognitive (eg, Affectiva), to social interactions (eg, social robots).

I explore how public health data and knowledge are repackaged into visualisations and presented in four contemporary genres: the animation, the TED Talk, the documentary and the satire programme. I focus on how different actors describe a world in which there are no or few antibiotics that are effective against bacterial infections. I examine the form, content and style of the visual cultural of AMR, examining how these genres tell a story of impending apocalypse while also trying to advert it. This is a form of story-telling based around the if/then structure: we are told that if we do not take certain actions today, then we will face a postantibiotic future with certain, often catastrophic, consequences. Within this if/then structure, there are various aims and objectives: the goal may be preventing further spread of AMR, building awareness or pushing for certain policy or funding decisions. These stories also serve to place or deflect blame, on animals, occupations, patients, industries and others and to highlight risks and consequences. These examples share similarities in the forms of story-telling and narrative, and in the use of specific data sources and other images.

The data were analyzed by estimation of simple correlation coefficients and a Preacher and Hayes's mediation procedure. RESULTS: Participants reported elevated levels of stress (7-8 sten on the sten scale developed for the PSS-10 questionnaire). Statistically significant differences in the stress levels between nurses, paramedics and physicians could not determined. In contrast, significant association between mental health outcomes and occupational category could not be found. Coping mediated the relationship between coping strategies and mental health outcomes. A positive and significant relationship was observed between stress, dysfunctional coping strategies and mental health.

Although the mechanisms modulating JEV virulence and neuroinvasiveness are poorly understood, several acquired mutations in the live attenuated vaccine strain (SA14-14-2) point towards translation regulation as a key strategy. Using ribosome profiling, we identify multiple mechanisms including frameshifting, tRNA dysregulation and alternate translation initiation sites that regulate viral protein synthesis. A significant fraction (~ 40%) of ribosomes undergo frameshifting on NS1 coding sequence leading to early termination, translation of NS1 protein and modulation of viral protein stoichiometry. Separately, a tRNA subset (glutamate, serine, leucine and histidine) was found to be associated in high levels with the ribosomes upon JEV infection. We also report a previously uncharacterised translational initiation event from an upstream UUG initiation codon in JEV 5 UTR. A silent mutation at this start site in the vaccine strain has been shown to abrogate neuroinvasiveness suggesting the potential role of translation from this region. Together, our study sheds light on distinct mechanisms that modulate JEV translation with likely consequences for viral pathogenesis.","output":"Translation regulation of Japanese encephalitis virus revealed by ribosome profiling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we examined the synthesized N-alkynyl-17-aminosteroids and N-alkynyl-20-aminosteroids (based on dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone, respectively) for their effect on C6 rat glioma cell functions.

Previously, it was demonstrated that NGB overexpression protects cells from hypoxia-induced death. To investigate processes promoted by NGB overexpression, we used a cellular model of neuroblastoma stably overexpressing an NGB-FLAG construct. We used a proteomic approach to identify the specific profile following NGB overexpression. To evaluate the role of NGB overexpression in increasing energetic metabolism, we measured oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate through Seahorse XF technology. The effect on autophagy induction was evaluated by analyzing SQSTM1/p62 and LC3-II expression. Proteomic analysis revealed several differentially regulated proteins, involved in oxidative phosphorylation and integral mitochondrial proteins linked to energy metabolism. The analysis of mitochondrial metabolism demonstrated that NGB overexpression increases mitochondrial ATP production. Indeed, NGB overexpression enhances bioenergetic metabolism, increasing OCR and oxygen consumption. Analysis of autophagy induction revealed an increase of LC3-II together with a significant decrease of SQSTM1/p62, and NGB-LC3-II association during autophagosome formation. These results highlight the active participation of NGB in several cellular processes that can be upregulated in response to NGB overexpression, playing a role in the adaptive response to stress in neuroblastoma cells.","output":"Overexpression of Neuroglobin Promotes Energy Metabolism and Autophagy Induction in Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic continues to spread, it remains unclear how vulnerable populations with preexisting health conditions like cancer have been affected.

The survey measured the psychosocial well\\\\being of participants before and during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and examined whether they experienced any type of financial challenges or treatment disruption. RESULTS: The results indicated that feelings of isolation increased significantly during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the overall median isolation/stress score was 1.2 on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always), which was not significantly different between White patients and Black patients. One\\\\third of patients experienced some type of financial challenge during this time. Medicaid recipients, of whom almost 80% were Black, were more likely to experience financial challenges.

We find simultaneous subnational erosion in administrative capacity and growth in technical capacity following centralization, both of which appear concentrated in low-poverty areas despite centralization's explicit antipoverty purposes.

METHODS: We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations. The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We searched three databases and the COVID-19 resource centres of eleven major journals and publishers. English abstracts of Chinese language papers were included. Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted. RESULTS: 24 studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review. Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies. Limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection. Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, though radiological abnormalities are noted. Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are little data relating to transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have similar rates to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS AND RESULTS: All consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a university hospital in Amiens (France) were included in this study. The primary composite endpoint was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death before ICU admission. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the composite endpoint. Between 28 February 2020 and 30 March 2020, a total of 499 local patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 231 were not hospitalized {males 33%; median [interquartile range (IQR)] age: 44 (32C54)}, and 268 were hospitalized [males 58%; median (IQR) age: 73 (61C84)]. A total of 116 patients met the primary endpoint: 47 died before ICU admission, and 69 were admitted to the ICU. Patients meeting the primary endpoint were more likely than patients not meeting the primary endpoint to have coronary heart disease and to have been taking RASIs; however, the two subsets of patients did not differ with regard to median age. After adjustment for other associated variables, the risk of meeting the composite endpoint was 1.73 times higher (odds ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.02C2.93) in patients treated at baseline with a RASI than in patients not treated with this drug class. This association was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to patients treated with antihypertensive agents. CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted a potential safety signal for RASIs, the long-term use of which was independently associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and a poor outcome.

STUDY DESIGN Controlled animal study. METHODS Fifty BALB/cJ mice were randomly assigned to one of five groups: A control group with no smoke exposure, two groups exposed to tobacco smoke, and two groups exposed to e-cigarette vapor. Within the exposed groups after 4 weeks of exposure, one ear was infiltrated with a saline hydrogel and the other ear with hydrogel of either Anti-IL-13 or AG1478. After four more weeks of exposure, the animals were euthanized and the ETs were evaluated for mucosal changes.

Nevertheless, their widespread use (and misuse) has led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which poses a potentially catastrophic threat to public health and animal husbandry. There are several routes, both intrinsic and acquired, by which AMR can develop. One major route is through non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in coding regions. Large scale genomic studies using high-throughput sequencing data have provided powerful new ways to rapidly detect and respond to such genetic mutations linked to AMR. However, these studies are limited in their mechanistic insight. Computational tools can rapidly and inexpensively evaluate the effect of mutations on protein function and evolution. Subsequent insights can then inform experimental studies, and direct existing or new computational methods. Here we review a range of sequence and structure-based computational tools, focussing on tools successfully used to investigate mutational effect on drug targets in clinically important pathogens, particularly Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Collected data comprised the Global Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 Bronchoscopy Database (GPS-BD). All bronchoscopists and patients were anonymous with no direct investigator-to-respondent contact. RESULTS Bronchoscopy procedures involving 289 patients from 26 countries were analyzed. One-half of patients had known COVID-19. Most (82%) had at least 1 pre-existing comorbidity, 80% had at least 1 organ failure, 51% were critically ill, and 37% were intubated at the time of the procedure. Bronchoscopy was performed with diagnostic intent in 166 (57%) patients, yielding a diagnosis in 86 (52%). and management changes in 80 (48%).

Besides bacterial infections, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are prominent among other viruses due to their high prevalence and association with severe clinical episodes. We aimed to describe and compare RSV- and hMPV-associated cases of WHO-defined severe pneumonia in a paediatric population admitted to Morocco's reference hospital. Children aged 2-59 months admitted to the H?pital d'Enfants de Rabat, Morocco meeting WHO-defined severe pneumonia criteria were recruited during 14 months and thoroughly investigated to ascertain a definitive diagnosis. Viral prevalence of RSV, hMPV and other viruses causing respiratory symptoms was investigated in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples through the use of molecular methods. Of the 683 children recruited and included in the final analysis, 61/683 (89%) and 124/683 (182%) were infected with hMPV and RSV, respectively. Besides a borderline significant tendency for higher age in hMPV cases, patients infected with either of the viruses behaved similarly in terms of demographics, patient history, past morbidity and comorbidity, vaccination history, socioeconomic background and family environment. Clinical presentation on arrival was also similar for both viruses, but hMPV cases were associated with more severity than RSV cases, had a higher risk of intensive care need, and received antibiotic treatment more frequently. RSV and hMPV are common and potentially life-threatening causes of WHO-defined pneumonia in Moroccan children. Both viruses show indistinctive clinical symptomatology, but in Moroccan children, hMPV was associated with a more severe evolution.","output":"A comparison of human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus WHO-defined severe pneumonia in Moroccan children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Widespread viral and serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 may present a unique opportunity to also test for HIV infection. We estimated the potential impact of adding linked, opt-out HIV testing alongside SARS-CoV-2 testing on HIV incidence and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in six US cities. METHODS: Using a previously-calibrated dynamic HIV transmission model, we constructed three sets of scenarios for each city: (1) sustained current levels of HIV-related treatment and prevention services (status quo); (2) temporary disruptions in health services and changes in sexual and injection risk behaviours at discrete levels between 0%-50%; and (3) linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing offered to 10%-90% of the adult population in addition to scenario (2). We estimated cumulative HIV infections between 2020-2025 and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of linked HIV testing over 20 years. RESULTS: In the absence of linked, opt-out HIV testing, we estimated a total of 16.5% decrease in HIV infections between 2020-2025 in the best-case scenario (50% reduction in risk behaviours and no service disruptions), and 9.0% increase in the worst-case scenario (no behavioural change and 50% reduction in service access). We estimated that HIV testing (offered at 10%-90% levels) could avert a total of 576-7,225 (1.6%-17.2%) new infections. The intervention would require an initial investment of $20.6M-$220.7M across cities; however, the intervention would ultimately result in savings in health care costs in each city. CONCLUSIONS: A campaign in which HIV testing is linked with SARS-CoV-2 testing could substantially reduce HIV incidence and reduce direct and indirect health care costs attributable to HIV.","output":"The potential epidemiological impact of COVID-19 on the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the cost-effectiveness of linked, opt-out HIV testing: A modeling study in six US cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The aim of this study was to evaluate radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) as a viable salvage option for patients with locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after radiotherapy.

Medical records and follow-up imaging with computed tomography (CT) and PET-CT were analysed to determine time to local progression (TTLP) and overall survival (OS). TTLP was determined according to the modified RECIST criteria. RESULTS Twelve patients, mean age 71  7 years, received 17 thermal ablation sessions, with RFA performed for four lesions and MWA for 13. Nine tumours were squamous cell cancers (SCC) and eight were adenocarcinomas. Eleven tumours had recurred post-external beam radiation and one post-stereotactic body radiation therapy. Mean tumour size was 34.2  12.8 mm, tumour stages prior to radiotherapy were Ia (2), Ib (3), IIa (4), IIb (1) and III (2). Follow-up period was 19  11 months. Overall median TTLP was 14 months (95% CI: 8, 19), and median OS was 35 months (95% CI: 12, 58). Mean TTLP for tumours <30 mm was 23 months and for tumours >30 mm 14 months (p = 0.20). Recurrence rates reduced from 50% after initial ablation to 20% with a second ablation. Complication rate for pneumothorax requiring intervention was 17%.

However, PrEP continuation and high adherence remain challenges to its impact. Existing PrEP adherence interventions can be time- and cost-intensive. Widescale PrEP delivery will require the identification of layered PrEP support strategies for AGYW with diverse prevention needs. We describe the design of a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) to evaluate a PrEP adherence support model using scalable, stepped interventions in AGYW in South Africa. METHODS: PrEP SMART is a randomized trial in Johannesburg, South Africa, enrolling AGYW who are between 18 and 25 years of age, sexually active, newly initiating PrEP, and have regular access to a mobile phone. Participants are randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care PrEP counseling with either two-way SMS or WhatsApp group adherence support. Adherence is assessed at three months using tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels from dried blood spots collected at month 2 to categorize participants as responders (TFV-DP 500 fmol/punch) or non-responders (TFV-DP <500 fmol/punch). AGYW defined as non-responders undergo a secondary 1:1 randomization to either quarterly drug-level feedback counseling or monthly issue-focused counseling, in addition to their first-level intervention. The primary outcome is PrEP adherence at nine months (TFV-DP 700 fmol/punch). We will assess the effect of our two initial interventions on TFV-DP levels among responders, assess the effect of our intensified interventions on TFV-DP levels among non-responders, and identify the optimal sequence of adherence interventions through nine months.

Trusted or trustworthy institutions are vital in addressing institutional capacity strengthening, but there is limited research on institutional trust and how to build it. A preliminary approach entitled, Trusted Institutions (TI), identifies six essential elements of trust including: team culture, autonomy, scale and longevity, commitment to quality and ethics, sustainability, and good fit with local context and culture. We aimed to explore capacity building initiatives and the notion of trust within non-government health institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and validate these essential elements of trust through a systematic review. Methods: We searched the published literature in PubMed and EMBASE in March 2020 and employed a three-concept search that included health-related institutions;capacity building;and LMICs. The study team used PRISMA reporting guidelines to conduct title and full-text reviews and conduct data extraction and analysis. Results: The search yielded 342 unique articles. Seventy-seven references met initial inclusion criteria and underwent full-text extraction;31 studies were included in the final analysis. Capacity building activities ranged from individual-level skills to institutional systems and structures. All articles addressed at least one element of trust with over half of articles describing sustainability (n = 18;58%) and good fit with local context and culture (n = 18;58%). Only 14 (45%) of articles explicitly mentioned the concept of trust either within an institution (intra-institutional) or between two or more institutions (interinstitutional). Four additional themes emerged as relevant to institutional trust including collaboration, communication, extent of institutional networks, and intersectionality. Conclusions: This review validates essential elements of trust in the TI approach and documents the importance of building trust both within and between institutions. The TI approach can be used by public health institutions in LMICs to enhance their abilities to achieve institutional missions and meet global targets.","output":"Exploring the role and nature of trust in institutional capacity building in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By using paired molecular and antibody testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, we determined point prevalence and seroprevalence in Louisiana, USA, during the second phase of reopening.

The article also brings to the fore the growth-enhancing measures adopted by the industry in anticipation of a \\"new normal\\" in the post-Covid world. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on primary data collected via a survey, followed by a series of interviews with a select group of senior finance managers from a wide spectrum of hotels based in India. Findings: Our findings suggest that Indian hotels have adopted several measures to enhance cash flows/revenues, reduce operating costs and cash outflows and conserve resources in order to tide themselves over during the crisis. Prominent cash flow-enhancing measures include price drops on special offers and reductions on list prices. Cost-cutting measures include economizing on energy consumption, reductions in labour costs and the postponement of maintenance expenses and discretionary spending. Resource conservation measures that have been adopted focus on postponement of capital expenditure and an increasing shift to localizing supply chains. Growth-enhancing measures adopted by the industry in anticipation of the long-term \\"new normal\\" include restructuring of the workforce and measures aimed at attracting domestic tourists and increasing product diversity.

Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. METHODS: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID-19 daily data of the mainland of China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases between 20 January and 3 March 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number (Rc), as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio- Re(t), of the disease transmission in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province. RESULTS: The estimation outcomes indicate that Rc is 3.36 (95% CI: 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since 31 January 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in the mainland of China are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to a prolonged disease transmission period and more people would be infected, and may even cause a second wave of epidemic or outbreaks. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure the pandemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April.

Furthermore, existing research addressing rural mobility solutions typically focuses on a specific user group, such as local residents, second-home owners, or tourists. In this paper, we study the social inclusivity, economic viability, and environmental impacts of novel mobility solutions in rural contexts based on published scholarly literature. When doing so, we bring both permanent and temporary residents of rural areas under one research framework. METHODS: We used grey literature to identify and categorise novel mobility solutions, which have been applied in European rural areas and are suitable for travelling longer distances. By using six service flexibility variables, we reached four categories of novel mobility solutions: semi-flexible demand-responsive transport, flexible door-to-door demand-responsive transport, car-sharing, and ride-sharing. We analysed the social inclusivity, economic viability, and environmental impacts of those categories based on criteria and evidence identified from scholarly literature by including the perspectives of both permanent and temporary residents of rural areas. Conclusion: Integration of the needs of various user groups is essential when aiming to achieve the provision of environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable mobility solutions in rural areas. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that while single novel mobility solutions are seldom applicable for all rural travellers, strong spatial and temporal synergies exist when combining different solutions. The need for a connected and flexible set of mobility solutions sensitive to the temporal and spatial patterns of mobility needs is inevitable. Accessible and easily understandable information on routing, booking, and ticketing systems, as well as cooperation, shared values, and trust between various parties, are key success factors for sustainable rural mobility.

Among these, a particular influence appears associated with the different airflows typical of male and female subjects. Focusing on a typical cough event, we investigate this aspect by means of highly-resolved direct numerical simulations of the turbulent airflow in combination with a comprehensive Lagrangian particle tracking model for the droplet motion and evaporation. We observe and quantify major differences between the case of male and female subjects, both in terms of the droplet final reach and evaporation time. Our results can be associated with the different characteristics in the released airflow and thus confirm the influence of the subject gender (or other physical properties providing different exhalation profiles) on both short-range and long-range airborne transmission","output":"Transport and evaporation of virus-containing droplets exhaled by men and women in typical cough events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Global research is running towards to find a vaccine to stop the threat of the COVID-19. The Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine that prevents severe forms of tuberculosis is getting more attention in this scenario. The objective of our study was to determine the association between BCG vaccine coverage and incidence of COVID-19 at a national-level across the Globe. Methods: The data of 160 countries were included in the study. Meta-regression was done to estimate the difference in the incidence of COVID-19 cases between countries with BCG vaccination coverage. BCG coverage was categorized as &#8804;70%, >70% and no vaccination. The analyses were carried out by adjusting for factors such as population density, income group, latitude, and percentage of the total population under age groups 15-64 and above 65 years of each country. Results: The countries that had &#8804;70% coverage of BCG vaccine reported 6.5 (95% CI: -8.4 to -4.5) less COVID-19 infections per 10,000 population as compared to countries that reported no coverage. Those that had >70% coverage reported 10.1 (95% CI: -11.4 to -8.7) less infections per 10,000 population compared to those with no BCG countries. Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that BCG is associated with reduced COVID-19 infections if the BCG vaccine coverage is over 70%. The region-wise analyses also suggested similar findings, except the Middle East and North African region.","output":"Is BCG associated with reduced incidence of COVID-19?

Obesity is an independent risk factor for the most severe cases of COVID -19. The impact in Argentina differs from others since it was able to anticipate public health interventions in order to flatten the contagion curve. Early quarantine achieved better control of the pandemic and, following the recommendations of scientific societies in countries with higher affectation, elective bariatric surgeries (BS) and in-person consults were suspended. Objective: Bariatric surgeons were surveyed to assess the impact of the pandemic and the measures undertaken on the practice of BS in Argentina. Method: Between April 17 and 21, 2020, an online survey in Google forms was disseminated to bariatric surgeons residing in Argentina. It consists of 40 specific and non-specific questions regarding BS practice and COVID pandemic. Consent to participate was obtained from surgeons by completing the survey. Results: : 83 surgeons averaging 47.17 years of age responded the survey. Together they performed 10515 BS in 2019. More than 65% stated that more than 50% of their income derives from this activity, and more than 40% depend on more than 75% of it. The average hospital stay was 1.6 days and 85% reported using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in less than 1% of their patients. According to the scores of hospital affectation issued by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), 54% reported being in Phase I and 34% had not yet been affected by the pandemic. All, except one, suspended the elective BS 7.7 days on average before the appearance of the first local case. 95.7% offer virtual consults, but 48% obtain no retribution for them. 26% would consider performing BS without a previous endoscopic evaluation.90% of the surgeons surveyed (75) continue performing other types of surgeries via laparoscopy. In case of operating a patient without suspected SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, 80% would use N95 masks and 56.6% would use face protection shields;two thirds would use smoke filters for the pneumoperitoneum and only 10.8% would continue with the usual protection measures. To restart the elective activity, 56.6% proposed that the hospital should be in phase 0 or I, that the patient should meet certain characteristics for their selection and that the scientific society must recommend the way to restart of the activity.Patient selection criteria with greater consensus were testing to rule out asymptomatic COVID-positive patients, epidemiology, absence of chronic lung disease, age under 60, and immunological integrity. 19.2% regard sleeve gastrectomy as the ideal BS during the pandemic, and 88% of the surgeons would not change their chosen BS technique based on infection risk. Conclusion: Elective BS is currently suspended in Argentina, although epidemiologically the conditions in the country are not unfavorable. Economic impact for those involved is significant. Short-term vision is pessimistic, but recommendations originating from the scientific societies that nucleate them are expected in order to guide health authorities towards appropriate regulations suitable for the local practice.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and bariatric surgery in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last decade social networks have become important channels for the media to publish information and communicate with their younger audiences, with Instagram recently becoming the most popular platform for this purpose This article is an investigation into news production on this social network in the context of the international crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, by means of a content analysis of 552 posts published by the two most widely read Spanish newspapers The results suggest that despite there being a large quantity of soft content and human-interest stories, as found in previous research, Instagram is also used as a platform to distribute information of public interest about the management of the crisis (such as political decisions and health content)","output":"The Health Crisis on Instagram: How the Media Are Building Their Agenda on the Visual Social Network During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-the cause of COVID-19 disease However, the effect of RAS-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported Design and method: We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic cophenotypes and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and/or a controlled experimental model Results: Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis Conclusions: Our results indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are likely to alter the expression of the key entry receptor for SARSCoV-2 in the human kidney Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARSCoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection","output":"Hypertension and renin-angiotensin system blockers are not associated with expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the kidney"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genetic variation in equine arteritis virus (EAV) protein-encoding open reading frames (ORFs) 3 and 4 genes was investigated.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine during the early phase of the COVID-19 crisis. Failure of the telemedicine encounter was assessed in this study by 2 separate criteria: (1) an unplanned visit to the emergency department (ED) within 6 weeks of the telemedicine encounter and (2) a planned subsequent in-person encounter for inability to formulate a complete diagnosis virtually. The authors retrospectively identified all new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine in the orthopedic surgery department of an academic tertiary care center during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 response, from March 16, 2020, to April 26, 2020. The study cohort included 298 new patients treated by 41 providers. The mean age of the 298 patients was 48 years, and 59% were women. Two hundred encounters were performed with video, and 98 were performed with telephone only. Three (1%) patients presented to the ED within 6 weeks of their new patient telemedicine encounter, and 8 (3%) patients presented for a planned in-person encounter.

The handling of biological samples may strongly influence global gene expression, a fact that has not been addressed in many studies. We sought to investigate the changes in gene expression that may occur as a result of sample processing time and conditions. Using Illumina Human WG-6 arrays, we quantified gene expression in lung carcinoma samples from six patients obtained at chest opening before and immediately after lung resection with storage in RNAlater [T1a((CO)) and T1b((LR))], after receipt of the sample for histopathology, placed in RNAlater [T2a((HP))]; snap frozen [T2b((HP.SF))]; or snap frozen and stored for 1 week [T2c((HP.SFA))], as well as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block samples. Sampling immediately after resection closely represented the tissue obtained in situ, with only 1% of genes differing more than twofold [T1a((CO)) versus T1b((LR))]. Delaying tissue harvest for an average of 30 minutes from the operating theater had a significant impact on gene expression, with approximately 25% of genes differing between T1a((CO)) and T2a((HP)). Many genes previously identified as lung cancer biomarkers were altered during this period. Examination of FFPE specimens showed minimal correlation with fresh samples.

METHODS For each environmental condition, 12 recreationally active females were tested during the early follicular (day 3-6) and midluteal (day 19-25) phases, verified by measurement of estradiol and progesterone. For all four tests, thermoregulatory, cardiorespiratory, and perceptual responses were measured during 60 min of exercise at 60% of maximal oxygen consumption followed by an incremental test to exhaustion. RESULTS No differences in exercise performance between menstrual cycle phases were found during temperate conditions (n = 8) despite a higher resting and submaximal exercise core temperature (Tc) in the luteal phase. In hot, humid conditions (n = 8), however, prolonged exercise performance, as exercise time to fatigue, was significantly reduced during the luteal phase. This finding was not only accompanied by higher resting and submaximal exercise Tc but also a higher rate of increase in Tc during the luteal phase. Furthermore, submaximal exercise HR, minute ventilation, and RPE measures were higher during the luteal phase in hot, humid conditions. No significant differences were found over the menstrual cycle in heat loss responses (partitional calorimetry, sweat rate, upper arm sweat composition) and Tc at exhaustion. CONCLUSION In temperate conditions, no changes in prolonged exercise performance were found over the menstrual cycle, whereas in hot, humid conditions, performance was decreased during the luteal phase. The combination of both exercise and heat stress with the elevated luteal phase Tc at the onset of exercise resulted in physiological and perceptual changes and a greater thermosensitivity, which may explain the decrease in performance.","output":"Exercise performance over the menstrual cycle in temperate and hot, humid conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A rigorous faculty appointment and promotion (FAP) system is vital for the success of any academic institution. However, studies examining the FAP system in Asian universities are lacking. We surveyed the FAP policies of Taiwans medical schools and identified an overreliance on the CJA score (manuscript Category, Journal quality, and Author order). The potential shortcomings of this metric and recommendations for refinement were discussed. METHODS: We obtained the FAP documents from all 12 medical schools in Taiwan, and analyzed their use of traditional versus non-traditional criteria for FAP according to a published methodology. The influence of the journal impact factor (JIF) on the FAP process was quantified by comparing its relative weight between papers with two extreme JIFs. To better understand the research impact and international standing of each school, we utilized the public bibliographic database to rank universities by the number of papers, and the proportions of papers within the top 10% or 50% citation. RESULTS: Compared with other countries, Taiwans medical schools focus more on the quantifiable quality of the research, mostly using a CJA score that integrates the category, JIF or ranking, and authorship of a paper, with the JIF being the most influential factor. The CJA score for an article with a JIF of 20 can be up to three times the threshold for promotion to Assistant Professor. The emphasis on JIF is based on a presumed correlation between JIF and citation counts. However, our analysis shows that Taiwans medical schools have lower-than-average citation counts despite a competitive rank in the number of publications. CONCLUSIONS: The JIF plays an unrivaled role in determining the outcome of FAP in Taiwans medical schools, mostly via the CJA system. The questionable effectiveness of the current system in elevating the international standing of Taiwans higher-education institutions calls for a re-examination of the FAP system. We recommend a reduction in the relative importance of CJA score in the FAP system, adopting more rigorous metrics such as the h-index for evaluating research quality, and supporting more research aimed at improving the FAP system.

To date, it is highly controversial whether such capability can be adapted in mammalian species as another site for gas exchange. Here, we report the advent of the intestinal breathing phenomenon in mammalians by exploiting EVA (enteral ventilation via anus). Methods Two different modes of EVA were investigated in an experimental model of respiratory failure: intra-rectal oxygen O2 gas ventilation (g-EVA) or liquid ventilation (l-EVA) with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. After induction of type 1 respiratory failure, we analyzed the effectiveness of g-EVA and I-EVA in mouse and pig, followed by preclinical safety analysis in rat. Findings Both intra-rectal O2 gas and oxygenated liquid delivery were shown to provide vital rescue of experimental models of respiratory failure, improving survival, behavior, and systemic O2 level. A rodent and porcine model study confirmed the tolerable and repeatable features of an enema-like l-EVA procedure with no major signs of complications. Conclusions EVA has proven effective in mammalians such that it oxygenated systemic circulation and ameliorated respiratory failure. Due to the proven safety of perfluorochemicals in clinics, EVA potentially provides an adjunctive means of oxygenation for patients under respiratory distress conditions.

The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 contains structural elements important for viral replication and/or pathogenesis making them potential therapeutic targets. Here we report on the stem-loop II motif, a highly conserved noncoding RNA element. Based on our homology model we determined that the G to U transversion in the SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif (S2MG35U) forms a CCU base-pair isosteric to the C-G base-pair in the early 2000's SARS-CoV (S2M). In addition, chemo-enzymatic probing and molecular dynamics simulations indicate the S2MG35U conformational profile is altered compared to S2M in the apical loop region. We explored S2MG35U as a potential drug target by docking a library of FDA approved drugs. Enzymatic probing of the best docking ligands (aminoglycosides and polymyxins) indicated that polymyxin binding alters the conformational profile and/or secondary structure of the RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif conformational differences due to nucleotide transversion and ligand binding are highly significant and provide insight for future drug discovery efforts since the conformation of noncoding RNA elements affects their function.","output":"RNA sequence and ligand binding alter conformational profile of SARS-CoV-2 stem loop II motif"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the number of inpatients with advanced age and chronic conditions rises, so too does the need for inpatient palliative care (PC).

To prevent (re)ulcerations, custom-made orthopedic shoes are considered essential. However, adherence to wearing the orthopedic shoes is low, and improving adherence was not successful in the past. We propose a novel care approach that combines motivational interviewing (MI) with a digital shoe-fitting procedure to improve adherence to orthopedic shoes. The aim of this trial is to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of this novel care approach compared to usual care (no MI and casting-based shoe-fitting) in promoting footwear adherence and ulcer prevention. METHODS: The trial will include people with diabetes, with IWGDF Risk categories 1C3, who have been prescribed orthopedic shoes. Participants will be randomized at the level of the podiatrist to the novel care approach or usual care. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who adhere to the use of their orthopedic shoes, that is, who take at least 80% of their total daily steps with orthopedic shoes. A temperature microsensor will be built into the participants orthopedic shoes to measure wearing time continuously over 12 months. In addition, daily activity will be measured periodically using log data with an activity monitor. Data from the temperature microsensor and activity monitor will be combined to calculate adherence. (Re-)experienced complications after receiving orthopedic shoes will be registered. Questionnaires and interviews will measure the experiences of participants regarding orthopedic shoes, experiences of podiatrists regarding motivational interviewing, care consumption, and quality of life. Differences in costs and quality of life will be determined in a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Gene reassortment is a process through which new strains are emerging in pigs, as it has specific receptors for both human influenza and avian influenza viruses. H1N1 binds specifically with an -2,6 glycosidic bond, which is present in human respiratory tract cells as well as in pigs. Considering the fact of fast multiplication of viruses inside the living cells, rapid detection methods need an hour. Currently, WHO recommended methods for the detection of swine flu include real-time PCR in specific testing centres that take 3C4 h.

In our study, we investigated the MEK inhibitor selumetinib and PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235 alone and in combination in BRAF-only mutant and BRAF + PI3K/PTEN double mutant cancer cells using short- and long-term 2D viability assays, spheroid assays, and immunoblots. In the 2D assays, selumetinib was more effective on BRAF-only mutant lines when compared to BRAF + PI3K/PTEN double mutants. Furthermore, combination therapy had an additive effect in most of the lines while synergism was observed in two of the double mutants. Importantly, in the SW1417 BRAF + PI3K double mutant cells, synergism was also confirmed in the spheroid and in the in vivo model. Mechanistically, p-Akt level decreased only in the SW1417 cell line after combination treatment. In conclusion, the presence of concurrent mutations alone did not predict a stronger response to combination treatment.

Thus, this study examined the associations of participation in an exercise class before the COVID-19 pandemic and the exercise habits and disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the COVID-19 state of emergency with perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness among community-dwelling old-old adults. METHODS: In July 2020, we carried out a mail survey of community-dwelling old-old adults aged between 77 and 99 years in Bibai, Hokkaido, Japan, to determine their perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness during the COVID-19 state of emergency. RESULTS: Of the 774 responders, 339 (43.8%) participants reported a decline in physical fitness, whereas 259 (33.5%) perceived declining cognitive fitness during the COVID-19 state of emergency. In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, exercise habits during the COVID-19 state of emergency were significantly associated with a lower perception of declining physical fitness.

While this proportion varies across news outlets and time intervals, the general pattern is consistent. We believe that, in a world with about 50% women, this should not be the case. Although journalists naturally need to quote newsmakers who are men, they also have a certain amount of control over who they approach as sources.

In the general population, COVID-19 has most notably affected those who are female, in younger age groups, black Asian and ethnic minority groups (BAME). A significant proportion of rheumatology patients are clinically extremely vulnerable, classed as high-risk of COVID under current national guidance. While it is recognised that extra precautionary measures in this group, such as stringent social distancing (shielding), adversely impacts these patients mental health, other risk factors, for patients with rheumatic disease whose health related quality of life (HRQoL) scores are most impacted, have not being explored. In our large cohort of rheumatology patients under secondary care follow up at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust we assessed HRQoL scores at the 4-week point following the introduction of lockdown measures. Methods We distributed a web-based survey via a linked mobile-phone SMS message, to all rheumatology patients, with a validated mobile number, under follow-up at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust. We assessed patients HRQoL by Short Form-12 version 2 (SF12); data were analysed using SPSS version 26. Results There were 7,911 active follow up patients with linked mobile numbers. Survey responses were received from 1,828/7,911 (23%) and of these 1,727 completed all aspects of the SF12. Responders were mostly white British 1,711/1828 (94%) and female 1,276 (70%); inflammatory arthritis was the predominant diagnosis (1,275, 70%). 858 (47%) were at high-risk of COVID (advised to follow shielding guidance) and 72 (4%) reported having suffered COVID-19 infection. Mental SF-12 (MCS) component scores were significantly lower in: COVID vs non-COVID patients (mean differences: -3.8, P < 0.001); BAME vs Caucasian patients (-1.5, P = 0.04); Females vs Males (-1.3, P = 0.001). Importantly, there were no differences in physical component scores (PCS) in these groups. Patients considered at high risk of COVID had lower MCS (-2.1) and PCS (-3.1) (both P < 0.001). Older patients had lower PCS (-2.7, P < 0.001) but not MCS. Conclusion We found significantly worse mental health scores in female patients, BAME patients and those patients that had suffered the COVID infection. Clinically extremely vulnerable patients had worse mental and physical health scores. There was no significant difference in mental health scores between patients in different ages groups, while, as might be expected, physical health scores were significantly worse in the older age groups. These data indicate a focus on adverse psychological consequences in specific patient groups may be required for future increases in COVID infection rates.

The aim of the World Health Organization (WHO) first International Standard (IS) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin is to harmonize humoral immune response assessment after natural infection or vaccination, and recommend reporting the results for binding activity in Binding Antibody Units (BAU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzed six commercial quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-protein assays in a head-to-head comparison, using the manufacturers' conversion factors for the WHO IS to obtain BAU/mL values. RESULTS: Our data showed good alignment up to 1000 BAU/mL, then began to disperse, exhibiting some discrepancies. Moreover, correlations among methods varied with Cohens Kappa ranging from 0.580 to 1.00, with the lowest agreement values for kits using different target antigens or different antibody isotypes, making it clear that the laboratory report should include this information.

Conversely, government interventions to reduce the spread of the disease and the number of fatalities may induce a bifurcation that stabilizes a desirable state with low numbers of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The key characteristic feature of an infection dynamical system in this context is the eigenvalue that determines the stability of the states under consideration and is known in synergetics as the order parameter eigenvalue. Using a SEIR-like infection disease model, the relevant order parameter and its eigenvalue are determined. A three stage methodology is proposed to track and estimate the eigenvalue through time. The method is applied to COVID-19 infection data reported from 20 European countries during the period of January 1, 2020 to June 15. It is shown that in 15 out of the 20 countries the eigenvalue switched its sign suggesting that during the reporting period an intervention bifurcation took place that stabilized the desirable low death state. It is shown that the eigenvalue analysis also allows for a ranking of countries by the degree of the stability of the infection-free state. For the investigated countries, Ireland was found to exhibit the most stable infection-free state. Finally, a six point classification scheme is suggested with groups 5 and 6 including countries that failed to stabilize the desirable infection-free low death state. In doing so, tools for assessing the effectiveness of government interventions are provided that are at the heart of bifurcation theory, in general, and synergetics, in particular.","output":"COVID-19 interventions in some European countries induced bifurcations stabilizing low death states against high death states: an eigenvalue analysis based on the order parameter concept of synergetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: COVID\\\\19 is a novel infectious disease with a broad spectrum of clinical severity.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes were described. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between potential risk factors and severe COVID\\\\19 outcome, defined as a requirement for advanced oxygen therapy, invasive ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Sixty\\\\five cases of patients with systemic vasculitis who developed COVID\\\\19 were reported (median age 70 years, 49% female) of whom 25 (38%) experienced a severe outcome.

RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock. A nonstructural RVFV NSs protein inhibits the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon- mRNA, and is a major virulence factor. The present study explored a novel function of the RVFV NSs protein by testing the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) or -amanitin, both of which served as a surrogate of the host mRNA synthesis suppression function of the NSs. In the presence of the host-transcriptional inhibitors, the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs protein, but not that carrying NSs, induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)Cmediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2 phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation. RVFV NSs promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of PKR early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eIF2 accumulation. These data suggested that a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcriptional suppression induces PKR-mediated eIF2 phosphorylation, while the NSs facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating PKR and inhibiting PKR-mediated eIF2 phosphorylation. Thus, the two distinct functions of the NSs, i.e., the suppression of host transcription, including that of type I interferon mRNAs, and the downregulation of PKR, work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions, allowing efficient replication and survival of RVFV in infected mammalian hosts.","output":"Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Protein Promotes Post-Transcriptional Downregulation of Protein Kinase PKR and Inhibits eIF2 Phosphorylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 has swept across the world, governments have been prompted to order social distancing measures, from the closure of schools, restaurants and public facilities to quarantines and lockdowns.

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a critical role in lung innate immunity, but contradictory results have been reported regarding their functionality following HIV infection. Here, using the SIV rhesus macaque model, we document the effect of SIV infection on the phenotypic and functional properties of AMs. Following infection with SIV(mac251), AMs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampled over 2- to 20-weeks post-infection (wpi) were compared to those in BAL samples from na?ve macaques. AM expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, and chemokine RANTES drastically increased 2-wpi compared to AMs of na?ve macaques (p < 0.0001 for all), but dropped significantly with progression to chronic infection. Phagocytic activity of AMs 2-and 4-wpi was elevated compared to AMs of naive animals (p = 0.0005, p = 0.0004, respectively) but significantly decreased by 12-wpi (p = 0.0022, p = 0.0019, respectively). By 20-wpi the ability of AMs from chronically infected animals to perform SIV-specific antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) was also diminished (p = 0.028). Acute SIV infection was associated with increased FcRIII expression which subsequently declined with disease progression. Frequency of FcRIII(+) AMs showed a strong trend toward correlation with SIV-specific ADP, and at 2-wpi FcRIII expression negatively correlated with viral load (r = ?0.6819; p = 0.0013), suggesting a contribution to viremia control. Importantly, PD-1 was found to be expressed on AMs and showed a strong trend toward correlation with plasma viral load (r = 0.8266; p = 0.058), indicating that similar to over-expression on T-cells, PD-1 expression on AMs may also be associated with disease progression. Further, AMs predominantly expressed PD-L2, which remained consistent over the course of infection. PD-1 blockade enhanced SIV-specific ADP by AMs from chronic infection indicating that the PD-1/PD-L2 pathway may modulate functional activity of AMs at that stage. These findings provide new insight into the dynamics of SIV infection leading to AM dysfunction and alteration of pulmonary innate immunity.

Myeloid skewing of hematopoietic cells is a prominent promoter of metastasis. However, the reservoir of these cells in the bone marrow (BM) compartment and their differentiation pattern from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have not been explored. METHODS We used a unique model system consisting of tumor cell clones with low metastatic potential or high metastatic potential (met-low and met-high, respectively) to investigate the fate of HSPC differentiation using murine melanoma and breast carcinoma. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was performed on HSPC obtained from the BM of met-low and met-high tumors. A proteomic screen of tumor-conditioned medium integrated with the scRNA-seq data analysis was performed to analyze the potential cross talk between cancer cells and HSPCs. Adoptive transfer of tumor-educated HSPC subsets obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ tagged mice was then carried out to identify the contribution of committed HSPCs to tumor spread. Peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from patients with breast and lung cancer were analyzed for HSPC subsets. RESULTS Mice bearing met-high tumors exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of HSPCs in the BM in comparison with tumor-free mice or mice bearing met-low tumors. ScRNA-seq analysis of these HSPCs revealed that met-high tumors enriched the monocyte-dendritic progenitors (MDPs) but not granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). A proteomic screen of tumor- conditioned medium integrated with the scRNA-seq data analysis revealed that the interleukin 6 (IL-6)-IL-6 receptor axis is highly active in HSPC-derived MDP cells. Consequently, loss of function and gain of function of IL-6 in tumor cells resulted in decreased and increased metastasis and corresponding MDP levels, respectively. Importantly, IL-6-educated MDPs induce metastasis within mice bearing met-low tumors-through further differentiation into immunosuppressive macrophages and not dendritic cells. Consistently, MDP but not GMP levels in peripheral blood of breast and lung cancer patients are correlated with tumor aggressiveness.

To estimate the number of infected persons in our community, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the presence of immunoglobulin G, antibody for SARS-CoV-2 during the time period of July 15, 2020, to July 27, 2020.

Patients were divided into two groups according to overall satisfaction, in order to identify predictive factors. The significance threshold was set at p<0.005. The main endpoint was patient satisfaction after an ENT telemedicine consultation during global lockdown. The secondary endpoint comprised predictive factors for overall satisfaction. Results: One hundred of the 125 patients with telemedicine consultation over a 7-day inclusion period completed the questionnaire. Overall satisfaction was 87%. There were no clinically relevant predictive factors significantly associated with satisfaction.

This system is used at multiple schools and universities in Iceland and Kenya, mostly for mathematics and statistics. Students earn SmileyCoin, a cryptocurrency, while studying. In Iceland the system has typically been used by students who use their own devices to solve homework assignments during the semester, accessing the Internet-based tutor-web at http://tutor-web.net. These students typically take final exams on paper at the end of the semester. In Kenya the system is a part of a plan to enhance mathematics education using educational technology, organised by the Smiley Charity with the African Maths Initiative. This has been done by donating servers running the tutor-web to schools and tablets to students. Typically these schools do not have Internet access so the cryptocurrency can not be used. Innovative redesign was needed during COVID-19 in spring, 2020, since universities in Iceland were not able to host in-house finals and schools in Kenya were closed so tablets could not be donated directly to students. Remote finals were held in Iceland but the implementation was largely in the hands of the instructors. In Kenya, community libraries remained open and became a place for students to come in to study. Innovations included using the tutor-web as a remote drilling system in place of final exams in a large undergraduate course in statistics and donating tablets to libraries in Kenya.

Proteomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has detected a number of proteins that were elevated in MScl patients. Here we specifically aimed to differentiate between the PP and RR subtypes of MScl by comparing CSF proteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CSF samples (n = 31) were handled according to the same protocol for quantitative mass spectrometry measurements we reported previously. In the comparison of PP MScl versus RR MScl we observed a number of differentially abundant proteins, such as protein jagged-1 and vitamin D-binding protein. Protein jagged-1 was over three times less abundant in PP MScl compared to RR MScl. Vitamin D-binding protein was only detected in the RR MScl samples. These two proteins were validated by independent techniques (western blot and ELISA) as differentially abundant in the comparison between both MScl types. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The main finding of this comparative study is the observation that the proteome profiles of CSF in PP and RR MScl patients overlap to a large extent. Still, a number of differences could be observed. Protein jagged-1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors and involved in the mediation of Notch signaling. It is suggested in literature that the Notch pathway is involved in the remyelination of MScl lesions. Aberration of normal homeostasis of Vitamin D, of which approximately 90% is bound to vitamin D-binding protein, has been widely implicated in MScl for some years now. Vitamin D directly and indirectly regulates the differentiation, activation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and can prevent the development of autoimmune processes, and so it may be involved in neuroprotective elements in MScl.","output":"Proteomics Comparison of Cerebrospinal Fluid of Relapsing Remitting and Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Intraperitoneal mesh fixation for hernia repair is associated with adhesion formation. In this experimental study, adhesions against absorbable and non-absorbable fixation methods were compared. METHODS Six commercially available fixation methods were placed intraperitoneally in rats with a small pore polypropylene mesh coated on one side with ePTFE (Intramesh T1(?)). Two non-absorbable fixation methods: Prolene(?) (polypropylene) sutures and Protack(?) (titanium) tackers. Four absorbable methods: Vicryl(?) sutures (polyglactin), Absorbatack(?) and Permasorb(?) tackers (both mixes of lactic and glycolic acids) and Tisseel Duo(?) (fibrin glue). Adhesions and histology were studied at 7 and 90 days follow-up. In addition, fixation methods were placed without mesh, in order to study the reaction to the fixation method per se. RESULTS No adhesion formation, but also inadequate mesh fixation was found with Tisseel Duo(?), which had been completely resorbed at 7 days follow-up. Vicryl(?) sutures could no longer be detected at 90 days follow-up and were associated with a favorable adhesion profile. All other fixation methods were still intact 90 days after implantation. When placed without mesh, adhesion formation was significantly less than placed with a mesh (18 vs. 93 %, P < 0.001). Without mesh, adhesions were worst with Permasorb(?) tackers. CONCLUSIONS Absorbable fixation methods such as polyglactin sutures and fibrin glue show a favorable adhesion profile compared to longer-term absorbable or non-absorbable fixation methods.

Postnatal infection in term infants is usually asymptomatic; however, infection in preterm infants can be associated with clinical manifestations during the neonatal period. Nevertheless, few studies to assess the frequency of cytomegalovirus infection in preterm infants have been performed outside of high-income countries. We analyzed the incidence of congenital and postnatal cytomegalovirus infection in a cohort of preterm infants. Cytomegalovirus infection was detected during the neonatal period in four of 178 infants; in three of them the virus was detected during the first three weeks of life and, therefore, congenital infection was confirmed (1.7% incidence). Postnatal infection was detected in 44 (36.4%) of 121 infants who were assessed after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit. Cytomegalovirus infection was significantly associated to duration of breast feeding. In addition, we characterized cytomegalovirus strains detected in infants together with sequences available at GenBank, based on sequences of the UL18 gene. Cytomegalovirus UL18-sequences clustered in five distinct clades (A-E), and sequences obtained from infants in our study were distributed in four of the five clades; 44.4% of these sequences were included in clade E. Breastfeeding duration was shorter in average (5.6 months) in infants with sequences in clade E compared to infants with sequences in the other three clades (8.2 months; P=0.07).

Universal testing on labor and delivery units has been implemented by many hospitals to ensure patient and staff safety. Asymptomatic carrier rates are expected to vary based on geographic differences in disease prevalence, although differences within the same city have not been reported previously. In addition, clinical follow-up of women who had a negative result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during obstetrical hospitalization has not been included in any previous reports. Objective: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test results among asymptomatic pregnant women at 2 Philadelphia obstetrical hospitals, characterize the clinical course of those who had a positive result, and report symptom development among all women tested in the 2 weeks after hospitalization. Study Design: This is an observational study of asymptomatic pregnant women who underwent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing at 2 academic health centers (Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Hospital) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between April 13, 2020, and April 26, 2020. All women tested were contacted via telephone for symptom follow-up at 1 and 2 weeks after discharge. Asymptomatic positive test rates are reported for the overall population and by hospital. The hospital and 2-week posthospital course are described for women who had a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Posthospital symptom development among women who had a negative result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is also described. Results: A total of 318 asymptomatic women underwent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing during this 2-week period; 8 women had a positive result. The overall asymptomatic test positive rate was 2.5%. The rate at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was 3.8% compared with 1.3% at Pennsylvania Hospital (P=.283). Of note, 3 women (37.5%) who were initially asymptomatic developed mild symptoms in the 2 weeks after a positive test result. Repeat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing was performed in 14 of the 310 women (4.5%) who initially had a negative result; 2 women (0.6%) had a positive result on repeat testing. Moreover, 242 (78.1%) and 213 (68.7%) of the 310 women who had a negative result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at the time of the initial hospitalization were followed up via telephone at 1 and 2 weeks after admission, respectively. Viral symptoms, including fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or cough, were self-reported in 4.5% and 4.2% of these women at 1 and 2 weeks after discharge, respectively. Conclusion: The asymptomatic positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test rate among an obstetrical population in Philadelphia differed between 2 hospitals and was lower than that described in other geographic regions. This supports the importance of institution-specific testing protocols. The development of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection after hospitalization among women with initial negative test results is uncommon.","output":"Universal testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 2 Philadelphia hospitals: carrier prevalence and symptom development over 2 weeks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Neuron Q&A, Alejandro Schinder highlights the value of basic science in paving the way for the rapid development of vaccines and diagnostic tools.

Additionally, high levels of some clinical markers in both COVID-19 and AOSD make them difficult to differentiate. While the efficacy of ciclesonide had been expected for mild pneumonia with COVID-19, the efficacy of tocilizumab, which is a known treatment for AOSD, was not established. Here, we report the first known occurrence of COVID-19, diagnosed in March 2020, preceded by the diagnosis of AOSD, in April 2019, in a 65-year-old, otherwise healthy man. Following the diagnosis of the latter, the patient was first given prednisolone and then tocilizumab, which led to remission. With the recurrence of joint pain and rash in March 2020, accompanied by low oxygen saturation levels (90%), and ground-glass appearance on chest CT, PCR test revealed COVID-19 infection. Ciclesonide was started on day 7 of the disease onset, which led to improved inflammatory markers by day 21.

Methods. Healthy adults (aged 19C40 years) were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive TIV or saline followed 4 months later by 2 doses, 3 weeks apart, of adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine and followed up to study end (day 507).

Ninety-nine of the 133 participants enrolled completed the study. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. In TIV-primed participants, A(H1N1)pdm09-specific antibody and CD4(+) T-cell and memory B-cell responses to the pandemic vaccine tended to be diminished. Vaccine adjuvantation led to increased responses of vaccine-homologous and -heterologous HI and neutralizing antibodies and CD4(+) T cells, homologous memory B cells, and plasmablasts. Conclusions.

The authentication and secure exchange of electronic health records (EHRs), comprising of patient data collected using wearable sensors and laboratory investigations, is of paramount importance. In this article, we present a novel high payload and reversible EHR embedding framework to secure the patient information successfully and authenticate the received content. The proposed approach is based on novel left data mapping (LDM), pixel repetition method (PRM), RC4 encryption, and checksum computation. The input image of size [Formula: see text] is upscaled by using PRM that guarantees reversibility with lesser computational complexity. The binary secret data are encrypted using the RC4 encryption algorithm and then the encrypted data are grouped into 3-bit chunks and converted into decimal equivalents. Before embedding, these decimal digits are encoded by LDM. To embed the shifted data, the cover image is divided into [Formula: see text] blocks and then in each block, two digits are embedded into the counter diagonal pixels. For tamper detection and localization, a checksum digit computed from the block is embedded into one of the main diagonal pixels. A fragile logo is embedded into the cover images in addition to EHR to facilitate early tamper detection. The average peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the stego-images obtained is 41.95 dB for a very high embedding capacity of 2.25 bits per pixel. Furthermore, the embedding time is less than 0.2 s. Experimental results reveal that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art techniques in terms of payload, imperceptibility, computational complexity, and capability to detect and localize tamper.

We searched for clinical characteristics predicting exceptional long-term survival in HCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS: We compared clinical characteristics of 59 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with immunotherapy with and without locoregional therapy between 2013C2019. We compared patients who lived less than 12 months with patients who lived more than 3 years. Traits of short-term (31 patients) and long-term (5 patients) survivors were compared. Patients who died between 12 months and 3 years of starting treatment on protocol were not included in the analysis. RESULTS: Two out of five patients (40%) in the long-term survival group had a partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) per the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), while, of the 31 patients in the short-term survival group, only 2 (6.5%) had a CR or PR. Two of the 5 patients with a long-term survival had immune-related adverse events grade 3 or 4 (IrAEs-3/4). None of the patients in the short-term survival group had IrAEs-3/4. The patients, who presented with IrAEs-3/4, which included colitis and adrenal insufficiency, continued to have a response off treatment.

Presence of some genera, such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Cutibacterium (formerly known as Propionibacterium), Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Bifidobacterium, has been detected by both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. DNA from some gut-associated strict anaerobes has also been repeatedly found and some studies have revealed the presence of cells and/or nucleic acids from viruses, archaea, fungi and protozoa in human milk. Colostrum and milk microbes are transmitted to the infant and, therefore, they are among the first colonizers of the human gut. Still, the significance of human milk microbes in infant gut colonization remains an open question. Clinical studies trying to elucidate the question are confounded by the profound impact of non-microbial human milk components to intestinal microecology. Modifications in the microbiota of human milk may have biological consequences for infant colonization, metabolism, immune and neuroendocrine development, and for mammary health. However, the factors driving differences in the composition of the human milk microbiome remain poorly known. In addition to colostrum and milk, breast tissue in lactating and non-lactating women may also contain a microbiota, with implications in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and in some of the adverse outcomes associated with breast implants. This and other open issues, such as the origin of the human milk microbiome, and the current limitations and future prospects are addressed in this review.","output":"The Microbiota of the Human Mammary Ecosystem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the development of innovative applications in various domains such as healthcare, transportation, and Industry 4.0. Publish-subscribe systems enable IoT devices to communicate with the cloud platform. However, IoT applications need context-aware messages to translate the data into contextual information, allowing the applications to act cognitively. Besides, end-to-end security of publish-subscribe messages on both ends (devices and cloud) is essential. However, achieving security on constrained IoT devices with memory, payload, and energy restrictions is a challenge. CONTRIBUTION: Messages in IoT need to achieve both energy efficiency and secure delivery. Thus, the main contribution of this paper refers to a performance evaluation of a message structure that standardizes the publish-subscribe topic and payload used by the cloud platform and the IoT devices. We also propose a standardization for the topic and payload for publish-subscribe systems. CONCLUSION: The messages promote energy efficiency, enabling ultra-low-power and high-capacity devices and reducing the bytes transmitted in the IoT domain. The performance evaluation demonstrates that publish-subscribe systems (namely, AMQP, DDS, and MQTT) can use our proposed energy-efficient message structure on IoT. Additionally, the message system provides end-to-end confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity between IoT devices and the cloud platform.","output":"Performance evaluation of publish-subscribe systems in IoT using energy-efficient and context-aware secure messages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in Syrian hamsters.

Imbalance in the abundance, diversity, and function of the gut microbiota (known as dysbiosis) have been shown to increase host susceptibility to infections in the lungs, suggesting crosstalk between these organs. This crosstalk is now referred to as the gut-lung axis. Hence, the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for modulation of gut microbiota has been studied based on their effectiveness in reducing the duration and severity of respiratory tract infections, mainly owing to their effects on preventing pathogen colonization and modulating the immune system.

We studied post-lockdown scenarios and evaluated health-care constraints. Our aim was to identify the scenarios in which health-care availability would not be overwhelmed. Methods: A modified compartmental SEIR stochastic model was used to calculate peak cases at various levels of effectiveness of prevention of transmission. Health-care constraints were evaluated using a Delphi study. We developed \\"q-metric\\" to evaluate the epidemic. Key constraints were matched against scenarios generated, and a monitoring mechanism was devised. Results: Continuing lockdown (\\"q-metric\\" of >50) until mid-August was theoretically the most effective solution to end the epidemic. Lockdown might however be lifted earlier owing to various compulsions. The key constraints were identified as trained manpower and ventilators. It was estimated that shortfall of specialists to operate ventilators for COVID-19 intensive care units was approximately 40,000. This requires re-purposing of other specialists and short-term training to meet the surge. The shortage of ventilators is around 40,000-50,000. Procuring beyond those numbers would be infructuous owing to limits of training manpower. After lifting lockdown, the aim should be to contain the epidemic within the availability of key constraints. Our model suggests that this can be achieved by community containment and other non-pharmacological interventions at a \\"q-metric\\" of 19. An algorithm using \\"q-metric\\" was developed to monitor the epidemic. Conclusion: Various post-lockdown scenarios were simulated. Trained manpower and ventilators were identified as key health-care constraints.

However, it is important to consider the entire discharge process when addressing this problem (2). In our large tertiary referral hospital, clinical pharmacy services were moved from wards to the dispensary following a staffing crisis during 2018. Ward-based services were reintroduced in 2020, but doubts remained over the practicality and benefits of doing this. Aim: To compare the efficiency of ward and dispensary based clinical pharmacy services in our hospital in terms of interventions made and time taken. Methods: We completed an observational service evaluation. Data on the time taken to process discharge medication requests with the dispensary-based service were collected retrospectively from the hospital electronic discharge system for 12 months (2018) for five medical wards. Equivalent data for the ward-based service were collected prospectively over three days (2020) by pharmacists delivering the service to seven medical wards, as this was considered more accurate, and several process steps did not exist in the ward-based model. For example, prescriber sending request to pharmacy and pharmacy acknowledging receipt of a request. The prospective data collection period was curtailed by Covid-19. Descriptive statistics were produced using Excel. Results: Using the dispensary-based service (2018), 4459 medicine requests were processed from 5 medical wards, during a 12-month period. The mean time between prescribing and reaching the screening pharmacist was 175 minutes [95%CI  25.4]. It took an estimated time of 62 minutes [95%CI  2.99] to screen and resolve an intervention, with a mean of 3 interventions/ward/day. In 2020, using the ward-based approach to clinical pharmacy which screened medicine requests on the ward, 142 requests were screened over three days from seven wards, with no delay between prescribing and clinical screening. It took a mean of 17 minutes [95%CI  10.63] to screen and resolve an intervention, with a mean of 15 interventions/ward/day. Conclusion: Ward based pharmacy yielded five times more interventions, took an average of 45 minutes less to screen and resolve issues per request and removed 175 minutes of process time. The additional time required to resolve issues identified in the dispensary-based screening process was thought to be the delay in contacting either the appropriate member of the ward staff referencing a particular patient for information or identifying and contacting the prescriber, or a combination of both. This study is limited by the long delay between data collection periods and the small sample size in 2020, but the differences between the two systems were large and there had been few other changes to hospital systems. Other limitations include changes related to Covid-19 and the lack of a control group, so it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between the type of pharmacy service and study outcomes.","output":"Service Evaluation of the Efficiency of Moving Discharge Medicine Request Screening from the Dispensary to Hospital Wards over a Two-year Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Upgrading the nutritive value of rice straw (RS) is necessary to increase its contribution to enhancing meat and milk production.

This study used 6 multiparous crossbreds between Holstein Frisian  Zebu dairy cows in their mid-lactation period. Dairy cows were randomly allocated to three ensiled RS with various yeast stains including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P. kudriavzevii KKU20, and C. tropicalis KKU20 according to a 3  3 replicated Latin square design. Crabtree-negative yeast (P. kudriavzevii and C. tropicalis) increased the apparent digestibility of dry matter by about 6.9% when compared with Crabtree-positive yeast (S. cerevisiae). Bacterial populations were highest with ensiled RS by C. tropicalis KKU20. Ensiled RS with Crabtree-negative yeasts were significantly increased with total volatile fatty acids, but they did not affect volatile fatty acid profiles. Milk protein precentage was highest at 35.6 g/kg when C. tropicalis was fed, and lowest when applied with S. cerevisiae and P. kudriavzevii KKU20 in ensiled RS at 34.5 and 34.1 g/kg, respectively. Thus, feeding ensiled RS with novel Crabtree negative yeast could improve RS digestion, rumen fermentation, and milk protein content in dairy cows.","output":"Novel Crabtree negative yeast from rumen fluids can improve rumen fermentation and milk quality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 which is accepted as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation, has created a global panic effect all over the world. To stop this epidemic, in which more than 4 million people died as of July 2021, researches are being carried out on all kinds of issues related to the disease. In this study, a spatial econometric analysis of the determinants of the total number of Covid-19 cases in the provinces in Turkey between February 8, 2021, and May 7, 2021, was conducted. The existence of spatial autocorrelation was investigated through the Moran I test, and as a result, the Spatial Lagged Model (SAR) was found to be the most appropriate model. According to the results of the spatial analysis, it has been determined that the change in the total number of cases in a province will be in the same direction in the neighboring provinces of that province. A spatial interaction finding was obtained between the provinces and a significant and positive relationship was found between the total number of Covid-19 cases and the population density and the number of people over the age of sixty. Similarly, a significant and negative relationship was found with the average temperature and the total number of healthcare workers, and no significant relationship was found with the literacy rate. ? 2022 Sinergia Press.

An incomplete understanding of immune correlates of protection represents a major barrier to the design of vaccines and therapeutic approaches to prevent infection or limit disease. This deficit is largely due to the lack of prospectively collected, pre-infection samples from indiviuals that go on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we utilized data from a screen of genetically diverse mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) infected with SARS-CoV to determine whether circulating baseline T cell signatures are associated with a lack of viral control and severe disease upon infection. SARS-CoV infection of CC mice results in a variety of viral load trajectories and disease outcomes. Further, early control of virus in the lung correlates with an increased abundance of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells and regulatory T cells prior to infections across strains. A basal propensity of T cells to express IFNg and IL17 over TNFa also correlated with early viral control. Overall, a dysregulated, pro-inflammatory signature of circulating T cells at baseline was associated with severe disease upon infection. While future studies of human samples prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 are required, our studies in mice with SARS-CoV serve as proof of concept that circulating T cell signatures at baseline can predict clinical and virologic outcomes upon SARS-CoV infection. Identification of basal immune predictors in humans could allow for identification of individuals at highest risk of severe clinical and virologic outcomes upon infection, who may thus most benefit from available clinical interventions to restrict infection and disease.","output":"Baseline T cell immune phenotypes predict virologic and disease control upon SARS-CoV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renata Batas, PR and Publications, European Council of Enterostomal Therapy (ECET), provides an update on the ECET's activities through the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","output":"Be apart and stay together"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Migrant farmworkers have been identified as a vulnerable population for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Novel Coronavirus-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2). The objectives of this study were to detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COV19) status among 262 migrant farmworkers in North Florida. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of the information gathered from migrant workers referred by the Florida Dept. of Health for evaluation. Due to the urgency of returning to Mexico, subjects with which COV19 was detected were reevaluated for detailed medical history. Therefore, subjects that tested negative were later released following CDC guidelines. COV19 status was determined using an RNA qualitative nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from nasopharyngeal swabs collected over a three-day period. Variables collected include demography, symptoms, temperature, comorbidities, medication use, and vaccine status. Statistical significance for categorical variables was assessed using  (2) test or Fishers exact test where appropriate. Remaining variables were assessed using basic descriptive analysis. RESULTS: From the 262 subjects tested, 6 missed the follow up visit and data was unavailable. All were Mexican males, age 18-67 years, with positivity rate of 35.1%.

Few studies have evaluated the impact of e-cigarette or hookah use on home air quality, despite evidence finding toxic chemicals in secondhand e-cigarette aerosols and hookah smoke. We assessed the effect of e-cigarette and hookah use on home air quality and compared it with air quality in homes where cigarettes were smoked and where no smoking or e-cigarette use occurred. METHODS Non-smoking homes and homes where e-cigarettes, hookah or cigarettes were used were recruited in the New York City area (n=57) from 2015 to 2019. Particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 m (PM2.5), black carbon and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured during a smoking or vaping session, both in a 'primary' smoking room and in an adjacent 'secondary' room where no smoking or vaping occurred. Log transformed data were compared with postanalysis of variance Tukey simultaneous tests. RESULTS Use of hookah significantly increased PM2.5 levels compared with non-smoking homes, in both the primary and secondary rooms, while use of e-cigarettes increased PM2.5 levels only in primary rooms. Additionally, in-home use of hookah resulted in greater CO concentrations than the use of cigarettes in primary rooms. CONCLUSIONS Use of e-cigarettes or hookah increases air pollution in homes.

in Italy, with 87,000 patients and 15,876 deaths up to May 26, 2020. Since February 22, 2020, well before the Government declared a state of emergency, there was a huge reduction in the number of emergency surgeries performed at hospitals in Lombardy. A general decrease in attendance at emergency departments (EDs) was also observed. The aim of our study is to report the experience of the ED of a third-level hospital in downtown Milan, Lombardy, and provide possible explanations for the observed phenomena. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study assessed the volume of emergency surgeries and attendance at an ED during the course of the pandemic, i.e. immediately before, during and after a progressive community lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data were compared with data from the same time periods in 2019. The results are presented as means, standard error (SE), and 95% studentized confidence intervals (CI). The Wilcoxon rank signed test at a 0.05 significance level was used to assess differences in per-day ED access distributions. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, a significant overall drop in emergency surgeries (60%, p < 0.002) and in ED admittance (66%, p a? 0) was observed in 2020. In particular, there were significant decreases in medical (40%), surgical (74%), specialist (ophthalmology, otolaryngology, traumatology, and urology) (92%), and psychiatric (60%) cases. ED admittance due to domestic violence (59%) and individuals who left the ED without being seen (76%) also decreased. Conversely, the number of deaths increased by 196%. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak the volume of urgent surgeries and patients accessing our ED dropped. Currently, it is not known if mortality of people who did not seek care increased during the pandemic. Further studies are needed to understand if such reductions during the COVID-19 pandemic will result in a rebound of patients left untreated or in unwanted consequences for population health.","output":"Variations in volume of emergency surgeries and emergency department access at a third level hospital in Milan, Lombardy, during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the burden, epidemiology and outcomes of co-infections and superinfections occurring in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We describe demographic, epidemiologic, laboratory and microbiologic results, as well as outcome data retrieved from electronic health records. RESULTS: Of a total of 989 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 72 (7.2%) had 88 other microbiologically confirmed infections: 74 were bacterial, seven fungal and seven viral.

Here, we show, in a series of six experiments, that this transition towards top-down control is not determined by the time it takes to integrate value information into the saccade plan, but by the time it takes to inhibit suddenly appearing salient stimuli. Participants made consecutive saccades to three fixation crosses and a vertical bar consisting of a high-salient and a rewarded low-salient region. Endpoints on the bar were biased towards salience whenever it appeared or reappeared shortly before the last saccade was initiated. This was also true when the eye movement was already planned. When the location of the suddenly appearing salient region was predictable, saccades were aimed in the opposite direction to nullify this sudden onset effect.

The study was approved by the Hamad Medical Corporation Institutional Review Board (IRB) (MRC-05C072). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.ResultThe majority (n = 92) of 100 included patients were male and median age was 43 years. Patients were of diverse background with majority of South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, Nepalese, and Afghan) (n = 60), followed by Qatari (n = 18) background. Mean length of hospital stay was 26.51 days.35 patients had severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia, and 67 had at least one underlying physical comorbidity. Significant psychosocial stressors other than positive SARS-Cov-2 status, including lockdown, quarantine, finances and relationships issues were identified in 48 patients.A total of 35 patients had a positive past psychiatric history, out of which 17 were on maintenance psychotropic medications. Insomnia was the commonest psychiatric symptom (n = 65), followed by anxiety (n = 52), agitation (n = 42), depression (n = 39), changes in appetite (n = 32) and irritability (n = 30). The principal psychiatric diagnoses made were delirium (n = 29), acute stress reaction or adjustment disorder (n = 25), depression (n = 16), mania (n = 15), anxiety (n = 14), non-affective psychosis (n = 13), and dementia (n = 6). Approximately half of the patients with mania or non-affective psychosis had it as their first-onset disorder.ConclusionSARS-CoV-2, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, is associated with a wide range of psychiatric morbidity which emphasizes clinicians vigilance for psychiatric symptoms. Insomnia was the commonest neuropsychiatric symptom which may have clinical practice and potential preventive strategies implications.Delirium, the commonest diagnosis in the study carries high morbidity and mortality and may reflect SARS-Cov-2 propensity to affect the brain directly and indirectly through a cytokine storm, organ failure, and prothrombotic state. Patients can also present with new-onset mania or non-affective psychosis. It is noteworthy that about two-thirds of the patients had no past psychiatric history.This study, along with expanding body of evidence may assist with resource allocation and liaison psychiatry services planning.

We observed that virtual FLS clinics are effective in delivering fracture risk assessment, health promotion, and clinical management and are well received by patients with positive patient experience. INTRODUCTION: We examined the impact of virtual FLS telephone clinics, as an alternative to face-to-face clinics during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Patients presenting with low trauma fracture were recruited according to standard criteria. A structured telephone clinic appointment was offered, which included fracture risk and health promotion assessment and a treatment plan. Risk factors, demographics, fracture type, FRAX scores, and outcomes were analysed. We assessed patient experience with an anonymised patient survey. RESULTS: Clinical outcomes from virtual clinics were assessed (77F/33M; mean age 65.7 years). The mean 10-year observed fracture risk for major osteoporotic fracture was 18.2% and 7.0% for hip fracture. We observed high attendance rates at 79%; however, a significant number were still not available for telephone review (11%) or cancelled their appointment (10%). A recommendation for bisphosphonate treatment was made in 54% of the cohort based on National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group (NOGG) criteria. Follow-up DXA assessment is planned for 64%, according to fracture risk and NOGG guidance. We received 60 responses from the initial patient survey. Ninety percent rated their overall experience of service at 4 or 5 (very good to excellent). Ninety-eight indicated they would recommend the service to others. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual clinics are effective in delivery of fracture risk assessment and clinical management with positive patient experience. While a significant proportion will require DXA follow-up to complete the clinical assessment, virtual clinics have mitigated delays in fracture prevention interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Virtual fracture liaison clinics in the COVID era: an initiative to maintain fracture prevention services during the pandemic associated with positive patient experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Moorfields Eye Hospital sits as a major tertiary centre for ophthalmic care in the United Kingdom and became a central hub to provide safe and effective ophthalmic care across London and surrounding regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the impact on both the acute and elective corneal services during the first wave of this pandemic. Methods: A retrospective review of the proportion of corneal transplants and anterior segment trauma repairs was performed during the period of March 23rd to July 1st 2020 compared with an identical period in 2019. Data were acquired from our in-house electronic patient records. Results: A 92% reduction in corneal elective work was observed during the lockdown period compared with an identical period in 2019, with only 10 elective cases in total being performed. In addition, 91 corneal cross-linking and 76 therapeutic lasers were cancelled. There were 15 cases of primary repair for anterior segment trauma compared with 6 cases pre-COVID-19. A similar scenario occurs with removal of foreign body (4 cases during COVID-19 period versus no cases during pre-COVID-19 era) and with traumatic lens aspirations (6 cases during COVID-19 compared with 2 pre-COVID-19). Interestingly, a statistical difference (p=0.03) was found in the time interval from presentation of symptoms to emergency corneal surgery. During the COVID-19 period, a delay of 1.5 days +/- 2.29 (range 0-10 days) occurred compared with 0.8 days +/- 1.54 (range 0-6 days) pre-COVID-19. Conclusion: Stringent risk stratification reduced elective corneal surgery capacity during the lockdown thereby preserving social distancing requirements. However, an apparent increase in emergency corneal surgery seen is likely attributed to centralisation of ophthalmic services during the pandemic crisis, alongside increased domestic injuries. Despite the challenges posed, successful delivery of corneal surgery occurred whilst helping to identify lessons in preparations for future pandemics and current inefficiencies in healthcare delivery.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Acute and Elective Corneal Surgery at Moorfields Eye Hospital London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the earliest cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection were reported, our care delivery systems have been reorganized and challenged in unprecedent ways, specifically the cardiovascular community COVID-19 poses a challenge for heart transplantation, affecting donor selection, immunosuppression, and posttransplant management Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy is currently a viable option for patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation or destination therapy Here, we present a therapeutic strategy for the management of acute HF with Intermacs profiles from 1 to 4, with or without Covid-19 infection, exemplified by serie of patients presenting with severe HF and successfully treated by LVAD therapy during the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the French national lockdown This experience has shown that we still have the capacity to provide the right therapy for the right disease to the right patient LVAD implantation seems to be the treatment of choice for advanced HF due to the lack of healthy donor hearts for cardiac transplantation Covid or non-Covid context, we have to take care of our patients with end-stage HF the best we can ? 2020 Oxford University Press All rights reserved","output":"End-stage heart failure patients should be treated instantly despite a pandemic with all-time available technology to ensure best outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the field of economics, hysteresis refers to an event in the economy that persists into the future, even after the factors that led to that event have been removed.

We then separately considered non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 cases and compared their characteristics. RESULTS: In the non-COVID-19 group, there were 38 cases for an incidence of 1.1% and rate of 11/1000 admissions.

We investigated the fit tests to determine whether healthcare workers had adequate protection with N95 respirators and KF94 masks. METHODS: In this prospective single-center simulation study, five N95 respirators (two made in the USA by 3M and three made in Korea) and six KF94 masks, the Korean standard medical masks, were tested. The fit factor (FF) and leakage rate were evaluated using a two-fit test device. Adequate protection (defined as FF  100 or leakage rate  5) rates were compared between N95 respirators and KF94 masks, and between made in Korea and the 3M N95 respirators. For KF94 masks, adequate protection rates were compared before and after ear strap fixation. RESULTS: Overall, 30 participants were enrolled, and 330 fit tests were performed for FF and leakage rate. Adequate protection rates of all tested N95 respirators and KF94 masks were 22.7% (n = 75) by FF and 20.6% (n = 68) by leakage rate. N95 respirators showed a significantly higher adequate protection rate than KF94 masks for FF (48.7% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) and leakage rate (42.0% vs. 2.8%, P < 0.001). Adequate protection rate of 3M-made N95 respirators was significantly higher than that of those made in Korea (83.3% vs. 25.6% in FF, P < 0.001; 73.3% vs. 21.1% in leakage rate, P < 0.001).

CONCLUSION: Although adequate protection rate of N95 respirators was higher than that of KF94 masks, N95 respirator protection rate was not optimum. Thus, it is necessary to minimize exposure to risk by selecting an appropriate mask or respirator that adequately fits each person, and by wearing respirators or masks appropriately, before contacting the patients.

To promote healthier lifestyles in lower SES populations, we hosted a digital health promotion program among male vocational students at a school in The Netherlands. In a pilot study, we evaluated whether this target audience could be engaged with an mHealth app using lottery-based incentives that trigger feelings of anticipated regret. Especially, we studied the social and interpersonal aspects of regret lotteries in a within-subject experimental design. In this design, subjects either participated in a social variant (i.e., with students competing against their peers for a chance at a regret lottery), or an individual variant (i.e., with subjects solely individually engaged in a lottery). Additionally, we studied the impact of different payout schedules in a between-subject experimental design. In this design, participants were assigned to either a short-term, low-value payout schedule, or a long-term, high-value payout schedule. From a population of 72 male students, only half voluntarily participated in our 10-week program. From interviews, we learned that the main reason for neglecting the program was not related to the lottery-based incentives, nor to the prizes that were awarded. Instead, non-enrolled subjects did not join the program, because their peers were not joining. Paradoxically, it was suggested that students withheld their active participation until a larger portion of the sample was actively participating. From the subjects that enrolled in the program (N = 36, males, between 15 and 25 years of age), we found that a large proportion stopped interacting with the program over time (e.g., after roughly 4 weeks).

However, multicentric studies providing a population-based perspective are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicentric study at five hospitals in Northern Portugal, representing 45.1% of all hospitalised patients in this region, between 1 March and 30 June 2020. RESULTS: Among 1261 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 457 (36.2%) presented neurological manifestations, corresponding to a rate of 357 per 1000 in the North Region. Patients with neurologic manifestations were younger (68.0 vs. 71.2 years, p = 0.002), and the most frequent neurological symptoms were headache (13.4%), delirium (10.1%), and impairment of consciousness (9.7%). Acute well-defined central nervous system (CNS) involvement was found in 19.1% of patients, corresponding to a rate of 217 per 1000 hospitalised patients in the whole region. Assuming that all patients with severe neurological events were hospitalised, we extrapolated our results to all COVID-19 patients in the region, estimating that 116 will have a severe neurological event, corresponding to a rate of nine per 1000 (95% CI = 7-11). Overall case fatality in patients presenting neurological manifestations was 19.8%, increasing to 32.6% among those with acute well-defined CNS involvement. CONCLUSIONS: We characterised the population of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Northern Portugal and found that neurological symptoms are common and associated with a high degree of disability at discharge. CNS involvement with criteria for in-hospital admission was observed in a significant proportion of patients. This knowledge provides the tools for adequate health planning and for improving COVID-19 multidisciplinary patient care.","output":"Neuro-COVID frequency and short-term outcome in the Northern Portuguese population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standards of proof for attributing real world events/damage to global warming should be the same as in clinical or environmental lawsuits, argue Lloyd et al. The central question that we raise is effective communication. How can climate scientists best and effectively communicate their findings to crucial non-expert audiences, including public policy makers and civil society? To address this question, we look at the mismatch between what courts require and what climate scientists are setting as a bar of proof. Our first point is that scientists typically demand too much of themselves in terms of evidence, in comparison with the level of evidence required in a legal, regulatory, or public policy context. Our second point is to recommend that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommend more prominently the use of the category more likely than not as a level of proof in their reports, as this corresponds to the standard of proof most frequently required in civil court rooms. This has also implications for public policy and the public communication of climate evidence.

This study aimed at evaluating if different sources used to gather information on COVID-19 could affect the willingness to undergo dental appointments. An anonymous survey was posted on social media. The 1003 respondents used several channels of communication, clearly distinguishing reliable from unreliable ones. Multiple logistic regression estimated the effect of different information channels on the probability of being strongly influenced by COVID-19 in accessing upcoming dental appointments. Newspapers were the most-used channel of information (61.2%), blogs and forums the least used (11.2%). Overall, the more an individual was informed, the higher was the risk of missing upcoming dental care appointments (OR 2.05, CI 1.45C2.90, p < 0.001). The two most reliable channels of communication were identified in journals/websites of medicine and healthcare professionals. Women proved to be more active in gathering information and relying on less secure but more personal channels, such as social media and friends and family, thus having an increased risk of being influenced by COVID-19 information regarding upcoming dental care appointments (OR 3.62, CI 0.85C15.52, p < 0.1 and OR 1.60, CI 1.00C2.58, p < 0.1, respectively).

The impacts of this demographic transition are multifaceted and far-reaching and include declining tax revenues, leading to fiscal imbalances, and possible increases in government expenditures for coping with care expenses and pension schemes. We provide insights into ways to balance fiscal revenue against costly pension and social security systems and increasing healthcare expenditures.Using panel data for 178 countries across 18 years to capture the state of fiscal balance and data on demographic transition, we estimate three models to analyze the relationships between (i) demographic transition and government balance, (ii) demographic transition and government health expenditure, and (iii) demographic transition and government debt. The results first establish that health expenditure is negatively associated with the government balance. Then, for the relationship between demographic transition and health expenditure, old-age dependency and the share of the population aged over 64 shows a significant positive relationship with health expenditure. We find that demographic transition does not have a direct effect on the government balance, but instead has an indirect effect through higher government expenditure. This can be explained by the high costs of treating health conditions related to old age, including chronic illnesses.Our findings provide important implications for fiscal sustainability and necessitate comprehensive reviews of public health spending;healthcare reforms that prioritize accessibility for all and efficiency in healthcare services;and cost-sharing measures to mitigate the age-related fiscal burden.

Vascularization has always been regarded as one of the biggest challenges in tissue engineering. In the current study, a novel device was proposed to reconstruct blood supply of necrotic femoral head. METHODS: Cryo-insult with liquid nitrogen method was adopted to establish the ONFH model. In experimental group, a novel scaffold carrying vascular bundle was implanted into the necrotic femoral head after decompression and the transplanted vascular bundles were anastomosed with the existing blood vessels around the hip. In control group, a traditional porous scaffold was inserted alone without vessels. Feasibility of this strategy was verified by animal experiments. Micro-CT analysis and histological evaluation were performed to investigate its preliminary efficacy. RESULTS: Feasibility of this innovative treatment strategy had been successfully verified in animal experiments. In the area of necrosis repair, more bone tissue grew into the scaffold in experimental group than the control group evaluated by Micro-CT (three months: 29.66% VS 20.35%, P0.05; six months: 30.47% VS 25.10%, P0.05) and histological analysis (24.71% VS 16.45%, P0.05 ?at three months; 31.01% VS 20.60%, P0.05 ?at six months). Implanted vascular bundles had the potential to branch out many branches in the osteonecrosis repair area to facilitate blood supply reconstruction and bone repair. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposed a novel device with clinical application prospects in the treatment of ONFH. It has the potential to provide new possibilities for rebuilding the blood supply of femoral head and repairing osteonecrosis.

While many have focused on clinical outcomes, less attention has been paid to vulnerability and risk of infection. In this study, we developed a planning tool that examines factors that affect vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical services, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The developed tool was validated by comparing the estimated overall vulnerability with the real-time reported normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19. ANALYSIS: A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. In order to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses. RESULTS: All of the 5 vulnerability categories, as well as the overall vulnerability, showed significant (P-values <<0.05) and relatively strong correlations (0.203<<0.57) with the normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the census tract level.

Migrants are an ethnoracial subset that may have worse COVID-19 outcomes due to additional barriers accessing care, but there are limited data on in-hospital outcomes. We aimed to disaggregate and compare COVID-19 associated hospital outcomes by ethnicity, immigrant status and region of birth. Methods: Adults with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalized March 1CJune 30, 2020, at four hospitals in Montral, Quebec, Canada, were included. Age, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, migration status, region of birth, self-identified ethnicity [White, Black, Asian, Latino, Middle East/North African], intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality were collected. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for ICU admission and mortality by immigrant status, ethnicity and region of birth adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status and comorbidities were estimated using Fine and Grey competing risk models. Results: Of 1104 patients (median [IQR] age, 63.0 [51.0C76.0] years; 56% males), 57% were immigrants and 54% were White. Immigrants were slightly younger (62 vs 65 years; p = 0.050), had fewer comorbidities (1.0 vs 1.2; p < 0.001), similar crude ICU admissions rates (33.0% vs 28.2%) and lower mortality (13.3% vs 17.6%; p < 0.001) than Canadian-born.

Older adults (over age 65) are perceived as most physiologically vulnerable to COVID-19 and at risk of secondary mental health challenges related to social isolation imposed by virus containment strategies. To mitigate concerns regarding sampling bias we used a random sampling of older adults to understand uptake and acceptance of technologies to support socialization during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based assessment of the barriers and facilitators to engaging in technology use for virtual socialization amongst older adults in the Canadian province of British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based regionally representative survey using random-digit dialing to participants over age 65 living in British Columbia. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with open-text responses analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents included 400 older adults with an average age of 72 years old and 63.7% female. Most respondents (89.5%) were aware of how to use technology to connect with others and slightly more than half (56%) reported using technology differently to connect with others during the pandemic. 55.9% of respondents reported adopting new technology since the beginning of the pandemic. Older adults reported key barriers to using technology including: (1) lack of access (including finance, knowledge, and age); (2) lack of interest (including a preference for telephone, and a general lack of interest in computers); and (3) physical barriers (resultant of cognitive impairments, stroke, and arthritis). Older adults reported numerous facilitators, including: (1) knowledge of technologies (whether self-taught or via external courses); (2) reliance on others (family, friends, and general internet searching); (3) technology accessibility (including environments, user-friendly technology, and receiving clear instructions); and (4) social motivation (because everyone else is doing it). CONCLUSIONS: Much data on older adults use of technology is limited by sampling biases, but the current study that used random sampling demonstrated that older adults used technology to mitigate social isolation during the pandemic. Virtual socialization is most promising to mitigate potential mental health effects related to virus containment strategies. Addressing barriers by mobilizing telephone training and task lists, and mobilizing facilitators described by participants such as facilitated socialization activities are important strategies that can be implemented within and beyond the pandemic to bolster the mental health needs of older adults.","output":"Older adults' experiences of technology use for socialization during the COVID-19 pandemic: A regionally representative cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spurred critical and much-needed at- tention to re-thinking policy approaches to child care and long-term elder care, little focus has been given to its implications for parental leave policies and parental benefi ts for the care of infants and young chil- dren This article is about reconceptualizing and reconfi guring employment-based parental leave poli- cies in Canada both during and after COVID-19 Informed by theoretical insights from the fi elds of care economies, feminist political economy, and care and social reproduction and by national and international parental leave research, we argue that it is time to reconceptualize parental leave benefi ts not only as em- ployment policy but also as a care and social protection policy To make this shift, we explore three topic areas: a mixed system of parental benefi ts that combine employment-based and citizenship-based entitle- ments, connections between policy design and gender equality, and the need for robust intersectional data to track which Canadian families are receiving parental benefi ts ? 2020 University of Toronto Press Inc All rights reserved","output":"Reconceptualizing parental leave benefi ts in COVID-19 Canada: From employment policy to care and social protection policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases arising from pathogen spillover from mammals to humans comprise a substantial health threat.

We revealed strong evidence that DNA viruses were phylogenetically more host specific than RNA viruses, while the frequencies of sharing viruses among hosts and the proportion of zoonotic viruses in hosts were larger for RNA than DNA viruses. Among entire host-virus networks, Carnivora and Chiroptera hold central positions for mainly sharing RNA viruses with other host species, while network centrality of Primates scored relatively high for sharing DNA viruses.

High levels of PD-1-positive CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and macrophages were observed in liver, spleen, lymph node and thymus tissues following MHV-3 infection. PD-1-deficient mice exhibited significantly higher expression of the effector molecule which initiates fibrinogen deposition, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), than did their wild-type (WT) littermates. As a result, more severe tissue damage was produced and mortality rates were higher. Fluorescence double-staining revealed that FGL2 and PD-1 were not co-expressed on the same cells, while quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that higher levels of IFN- and TNF- mRNA transcription occurred in PD-1-deficient mice in response to MHV-3 infection. Conversely, in vivo blockade of IFN- and TNF- led to efficient inhibition of FGL2 expression, greatly attenuated the development of tissue lesions, and ultimately reduced mortality. Thus, the up-regulation of FGL2 in PD-1-deficient mice was determined to be mediated by IFN- and TNF-. Taken together, our results suggest that PD-1 signaling plays an essential role in decreasing the immunopathological damage induced by MHV-3 and that manipulation of this signal might be a useful strategy for FH immunotherapy.","output":"Programmed Death (PD)-1-Deficient Mice Are Extremely Sensitive to Murine Hepatitis Virus Strain-3 (MHV-3) Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic crisis of COVID-19 led to higher levels of uncertainty for individuals.

Sedentarism induces worse, continuous, and progressive consequences to health. On the other hand, physical activity provides benefits to health and improves low-grade systemic inflammation. The aim of this review is to elucidate the effects of physical activity in physical fitness, immune defense, and its contribution to mitigate the severe inflammatory response mediated by SARS-CoV-2. Physical exercise is an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this sense, studies have shown that acute physical exercise induces the production of myokines that are secreted in tissues and into the bloodstream, supporting its systemic modulatory effect. Therefore, maintaining physical activity influence balance the immune system and increases immune vigilance, and also might promote potent effects against the consequences of infectious diseases and chronic diseases associated with the development of severe forms of COVID-19. Protocols to maintain exercise practice are suggested and have been strongly established, such as home-based exercise (HBE) and outdoor-based exercise (OBE). In this regard, HBE might help to reduce levels of physical inactivity, bed rest, and sitting time, impacting on adherence to physical activity, promoting all the benefits related to exercise, and attracting patients in different stages of treatment for COVID-19.

Climate change and animal production have always had a negative impact on each other, with animal production accounting for about 15-18% global anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission in form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) which are emitted when animals respire. On the other hand, the effect of climate change and global warming on animal production is on the increase and will continue to increase with the high rate of man's industrial activity if not checked. In Nigeria, there is an increasing demand for animal protein and the unemployment rate is increasing yearly because of high increase in population. In order to meet up with this increase in demand for food and reduce youth unemployment in an environment with less climate change challenge, more youth involvement in Agriculture is needed. But, this agricultural revolution will have great challenge on the environment because of the high rate of climate change that goes with industrialization and agriculture. Because poultry have low global warming potential, it has an edge over other animals or livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goat. This is because poultry has low GHGs emission as a result of its low enteric methane production rates compared to ruminant animal species. Apart from poultry being cheap, it is nutritious and readily marketable. In addition, it can be a nice source of investment and income generation for Nigerian youths, if harnessed properly. It is therefore, concluded and recommended that to meet up with the ever-increasing demand for jobs in an environment having less climate change challenges, various government agencies, banks, private sectors, civil society, rural co-operative societies, youth agencies in Nigeria with the assistance of various international donor agencies can collaborate and play a more facilitating role through giving of loans, grants and adequate extension services to ensure that food security and youth empowerment is achieved within an eco-friendly environment through profitable poultry production.","output":"Climate change and youth unemployment challenges in Nigeria: the poultry production option.

The SARS-CoV-2 negative dataset (n = 308) includes CXRs from 2019, therefore prior to the pandemic. For each image, the CNN computes COVID-19 risk indicators, identifying COVID-19 cases and prioritizing the urgent ones. After installing the software into the hospital RIS, a preliminary comparison between local daily COVID-19 cases and predicted risk indicators for 2918 CXRs in the same period was performed. Significant improvements were obtained for both prioritization and identification using the proposed method. Mean Average Precision (MAP) increased (p < 1.21  10(?21) from 43.79% with random sorting to 71.75% with our method. CNN sensitivity was 78.23%, higher than radiologists 61.1%; specificity was 64.20%. In the real-life setting, this method had a correlation of 0.873. The proposed CNN-based system effectively prioritizes CXRs according to COVID-19 risk in an experimental setting; preliminary real-life results revealed high concordance with local pandemic incidence.","output":"Convolutional Neural Network-Based Automatic Analysis of Chest Radiographs for the Detection of COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Prioritizing Tool in the Emergency Department, Phase I Study and Preliminary Real Life Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While this respiratory virus only causes mild symptoms in younger healthy individuals, elderly people and those with cardiovascular diseases such as systemic hypertension are susceptible to developing severe conditions that can be fatal. SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, and thromboembolism. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of this virus on the cardiovascular system should thus help develop therapeutic strategies to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since this virus causes severe and fatal conditions in older individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities, effective therapies targeting specific populations will likely contribute to ending this pandemic. In this review article, the effects of various viruses-including other coronaviruses, influenza, dengue, and human immunodeficiency virus-on the cardiovascular system are described to help provide molecular mechanisms of pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. The goal is to provide mechanistic information from the biology of other viral infections in relation to cardiovascular pathologies for the purpose of developing improved vaccines and therapeutic agents effective in preventing and/or treating the acute and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.","output":"Viral Infection and Cardiovascular Disease: Implications for the Molecular Basis of COVID-19 Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of common mental disorders in adolescents and young adults, and their association with poor health and socio-economic outcomes throughout the lifespan, many young people do not seek or receive help for such disorders. There is growing interest in the community sector in supporting mental health in young people; however, there is little by way of experimental research in this area. During the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we designed an online cultural experience to reduce anxiety and depression and support mental health in people aged 16C24. METHODS/DESIGN: The O-ACE POP (Online Active Community Engagement Proof of Principle) study is a UK-based online randomised controlled trial of an online cultural experience named Ways of Being, involving human centred narratives and viewpoints, compared with a typical museum website (the Ashmolean Museum). We aim to compare efficacy on affect, symptoms of epression and anxiety, flourishing and loneliness as well as investigating potential mechanisms of action. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to design an innovative approach to supporting mental health in young adults. Findings derived from this study will allow us to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention and will inform the design of studies to further refine the resource and test it further.

The city of Melbourne was hardest hit during the pandemic and experienced the strictest and longest lockdown worldwide. Religious and spiritual groups were especially affected, given the prohibition of gatherings of people for religious services and yoga classes with a spiritual orientation, for example. Fault lines in socio-economic differences were also pronounced, with low-wage and casual workers often from cultural and religious minorities being particularly vulnerable to the virus in their often precarious workplaces. In addition, some religious and spiritual individuals and groups did not comply and actively resisted restrictions at times. By contrast, the pandemic also resulted in a positive re-engagement with religion and spirituality, as lockdown measures served to accelerate a digital push with activities shifting to online platforms. Religious and spiritual efforts were initiated online and offline to promote wellbeing and to serve those most in need. This article presents an analysis of media representations of religious, spiritual and non-religious responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia, from January to August 2020, including two periods of lockdown. It applies a mixed-method quantitative and qualitative thematic approach, using targeted keywords identified in previous international and Australian media research. In so doing, it provides insights into Melbournes worldview complexity, and also of the changing place of religion, spirituality and non-religion in the Australian public sphere in COVID times.","output":"Worldviews Complexity in COVID-19 Times: Australian Media Representations of Religion, Spirituality and Non-Religion in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND For OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination) scoring, medical schools must bring together many clinical experts at the same place, which is very risky in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. However, if the FLEX model with the properties of self-directed learning and offline feedback is applied to OSCE, it is possible to provide a safe and effective evaluation environment for both universities and students through experts' evaluation of self-video clips of medical students. The present study investigated validity of the FLEX model to evaluate OSCE in a small group of medical students. METHODS Sixteen 3rd grade medical students who failed on OSCE were required to take a make-up examination by videotaping the failed items and submitting them online. The scores between original examination and make-up examination were compared using Paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, and a post-hoc questionnaire was conducted. RESULTS The score for make-up examination was significantly higher than those for original examination. The significance was maintained even when the score was compared by individual domains of skills and proficiency. In terms of preference, students were largely in favor of self-videotaped examination primarily due to the availability of self-practice.

A quality-quantity tradeoff was recently discovered in spore forming bacteria, but whether it impacts fitness is unclear. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that the nutrient supply during spore revival determines the fitness advantage associated with different sporulation behaviors in Bacillus subtilis. By tuning sporulation rates we generate spore-yield and spore-quality strategists that compete with each other in a microscopic life-cycle assay. The quality (yield) strategist is favored when spore revival is triggered by poor (rich) nutrients. We also show that natural isolates from the gut and soil employ different life-cycle strategies that result from genomic variations in the number of rap-phr signaling systems. Taken together, our results suggest that a spore quality-quantity tradeoff contributes to the evolutionary adaptation of sporulating bacteria.","output":"A spore quality-quantity tradeoff favors diverse sporulation strategies in Bacillus subtilis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: People with schizophrenia die about 15C20 years earlier than the general population.

In less than a year and a half, more than 200 million people have been infected and more than four million have died. Despite some improvement in the treatment strategies, no definitive treatment protocol has been developed. The pathogenesis of the disease has not been clearly elucidated yet. A clear understanding of its pathogenesis will help develop effective vaccines and drugs. The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is characteristic with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan involvement with impaired Type I interferon response and hyperinflammation. The destructive systemic effects of COVID-19 cannot be explained simply by the viral tropism through the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors. In addition, the recently identified mutations cannot fully explain the defect in all cases of Type I interferon synthesis. We hypothesize that retinol depletion and resulting impaired retinoid signaling play a central role in the COVID-19 pathogenesis that is characteristic for dysregulated immune system, defect in Type I interferon synthesis, severe inflammatory process, and destructive systemic multiorgan involvement. Viral RNA recognition mechanism through RIG-I receptors can quickly consume a large amount of the body's retinoid reserve, which causes the retinol levels to fall below the normal serum levels. This causes retinoid insufficiency and impaired retinoid signaling, which leads to interruption in Type I interferon synthesis and an excessive inflammation. Therefore, reconstitution of the retinoid signaling may prove to be a valid strategy for management of COVID-19 as well for some other chronic, degenerative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.","output":"A novel hypothesis for COVID-19 pathogenesis: Retinol depletion and retinoid signaling disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: TNF and IFN- may synergize to induce cytokine-driven lethal hyperinflammation and immune exhaustion in COVID-19 illness. METHODS: To assess TNF-antagonist therapy, 18 hospitalized adults with hypoxic respiratory failure and COVID-19 pneumonia received single-dose infliximab-abda therapy 5mg/kg intravenously between April and December 2020. The primary endpoint was time to increase in oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2) by  50 compared to baseline and sustained for 48 hours. Secondary endpoints included 28-day mortality, dynamic cytokine profiles (Human Cytokine 48-Plex Discovery Assay), secondary infections, duration of supplemental oxygen support and hospitalization. Consort diagram [Image: see text] Hospitalized patients with SARS-COV2 infection and pneumonia that were referred to the infliximab-abda study team for evaluation. RESULTS: Patients were predominantly in critical respiratory failure (15/18, 83%), male (14/18, 78%), above 60 years (median 63 yrs, range 31-80), race-ethnic minorities (13/18, 72%), lymphopenic (13/18, 72%), steroid-treated (17/18, 94%), with a median ferritin of 1953ng/ml. Sixteen patients (89%) met the primary endpoint within a median of 4 days, 15/18 (83%) recovered from respiratory failure, and 14/18 (78%) were discharged in a median of 8 days and were alive at 28-day follow-up. Deaths among three patients  65 years age with pre-existing lung disease or multiple comorbidities were attributed to secondary lung infections. Mean plasma IP-10 levels declined sharply from 9183 pg/ml to 483 pg/ml at Day 3 and 146 pg/ml at Day 14/discharge. Significant declines in IFN-, TNF, IL-27, IL-6 (baseline above 10pg/ml), CRP and ferritin were specifically observed at Day 3 whereas other cytokines were unaffected. Among 13 lymphopenic patients, six (46%) had resolution of lymphopenia by day 3, and 11 by day 14. CXCR3-ligand (IP-10 and CXCL-9) declines were strongly correlated among patients with lymphopenia reversal (Day 3, Pearson r: 0.98, p-value: 0.0006).

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to understand how the VI model compares with the traditional IPI approach. METHODS: Online surveys were distributed to both groups, collecting feedback on their interview experience. Responses were evaluated using a two-sample t test assuming equal variances. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 26 (88%) applicants completed the survey. Most applicants reported that the interview gave them a satisfactory understanding of the CGSO fellowship (100% IPI, 92% VI) and the majority in both groups felt that the interview experience allowed them to accurately represent themselves (92% and 82%, respectively). All participants in the IPI group felt they were able to get an adequate understanding of the culture of the program, while only 64% in the VI group agreed with that statement (p = 0.02).

Simultaneously, an increased incidence of cholangiopathies in mechanically ventilated patients receiving prolonged infusion of high-dose ketamine has been noted. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate a potential doseCresponse relationship between ketamine and bilirubin levels. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of a prospective observational cohort of patients suffering from COVID-19-associated ARDS between March 2020 and August 2021. A time-varying, multivariable adjusted, cumulative weighted exposure mixed-effects model was employed to analyse the exposureCeffect relationship between ketamine infusion and total bilirubin levels. RESULTS: Two-hundred forty-three critically ill patients were included into the analysis. Ketamine was infused to 170 (70%) patients at a rate of 1.4 [0.9C2.0] mg/kg/h for 9 [4C18] days. The mixed-effects model revealed a positively correlated infusion durationCeffect as well as doseCeffect relationship between ketamine infusion and rising bilirubin levels (p < 0.0001). In comparison, long-term infusion of propofol and sufentanil, even at high doses, was not associated with increasing bilirubin levels (p = 0.421, p = 0.258). Patients having received ketamine infusion had a multivariable adjusted competing risk hazard of developing a cholestatic liver injury during their ICU stay of 3.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.3C7.8] (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A causally plausible, doseCeffect relationship between long-term infusion of ketamine and rising total bilirubin levels, as well as an augmented, ketamine-associated, hazard of cholestatic liver injury in critically ill COVID-19 patients could be shown.

A 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was subsequently intubated and treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir with improvement. On hospital day 32, the patient was extubated. Three days later, he developed acute, symmetric limb quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure requiring reintubation. Analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid showed a cytoalbuminologic dissociation, and electromyography/nerve conduction study showed slowed nerve conduction velocity. These findings are consistent with GBS. Blood cultures, serum polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical symptoms were not suggestive of other common pathogens causing his GBS. The patients acute GBS in the setting of recent severe COVID-19 infection strongly suggests association between the two entities, as supported by a growing body of case literature. The patient was subjected to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and was discharged with greatly improved strength in the upper and lower extremities. Our goal in describing this case is to highlight the need for providers to consider, accurately diagnose, and treat GBS as a consequence of severe COVID-19 infection.","output":"GuillainCBarre Syndrome Associated With COVID-19 PneumoniaThe First Documented Case in a U.S. Military Intensive Care Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is associated with a high rate of thrombosis, the pathophysiology of which is not well defined. Viscoelastic testing may identify and characterise hypercoagulable states which are not apparent using conventional coagulation assays. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to undertake viscoelastic evaluation of the coagulation state in critically ill adults with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure METHODS: This was a single-centre observational point prevalence cohort study of adults with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure requiring respiratory support in the intensive care unit. Coagulation status was evaluated using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM?) in conjunction with laboratory markers of coagulation. RESULTS: Six patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Each patient had one ROTEM? performed. All patients had supranormal clot amplitude at 10 min (A10) and supranormal clot firmness (maximal clot firmness) measured in at least one ROTEM? pathway, and five were supranormal on all pathways. Minimal clot lysis was present on all analyses. Fibrinogen and D-dimer were elevated and routine markers of coagulation within normal ranges in all patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit exhibit a hypercoagulable state which is not appreciable on conventional tests of coagulation. Supranormal clot firmness, minimal fibrinolysis, and hyperfibrinogenaemia are key findings. Further research is required into the pathophysiology of this hypercoagulable state, as well as the harms and benefits of different anticoagulation strategies.","output":"Evaluation of coagulation status using viscoelastic testing in intensive care patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): An observational point prevalence cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a systematic literature review on the ethical considerations of the use of contact tracing app technology, which was extensively implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid and extensive use of this technology during the COVID-19 pandemic, while benefiting the public well-being by providing information about people's mobility and movements to control the spread of the virus, raised several ethical concerns for the post-COVID-19 era. To investigate these concerns for the post-pandemic situation and provide direction for future events, we analyzed the current ethical frameworks, research, and case studies about the ethical usage of tracing app technology. The results suggest there are seven essential ethical considerations, namely privacy, security, acceptability, government surveillance, transparency, justice, and voluntariness in the ethical use of contact tracing technology. In this paper, we explain and discuss these considerations and how they are needed for the ethical usage of this technology.

The diffusion of Sars-CoV-2 and the introduction of confinement measures increased the complexity of the dynamic relationship between migration and health, creating extra challenges for the well-being of migrants, including those living in reception centres. This study analyzes the measures implemented in reception facilities in Bologna, one of the cities with the highest number of migrants in Italy, during the first COVID-19 wave, and evaluates the impact of the syndemic on the health of refugees and asylum seekers, with the aim of supporting evidence-based policy-making to meet the health needs of both migrant and host populations. Methods: This qualitative study was based on semi-structured interviews with social workers, volunteers and medical professionals involved in providing assistance to refugees and asylum seekers living in reception centres. Between April and September 2020, after a period of observation, key-informants were selected through a snowball sampling process for a total of 25 interviews. The interviewees covered different services that were critical in the management of the COVID-19 epidemic in Bologna. The interview guide explored: 1) the consequences of COVID-19 on the health needs of refugees and asylum seekers living in reception centres;2) the measures implemented to contrast the diffusion of the epidemic;3) the challenges that interviewees had in handling the emergency;and 4) the role of health education as a tool for health promotion, in general and during the epidemic. After transcription, the interviews were analyzed using deductive and inductive approaches. Results: All 25 selected key-informants agreed to participate in the study. When the epidemic began in Italy, reception centres introduced confinement measures, which were followed by the supply of personal protective equipment, the implementation of specific governance tools and the production of risk communication programmes. However, these actions often failed in considering the social and psychological impact of the emergency. This, together with the dramatic consequences of the syndemic, affected all the determinants that shape the health profile of residents of reception centres, exacerbating their condition of disadvantage. Conclusions: This analysis revealed a number of specific structural issues that characterize the healthcare services for refugees and asylum seekers, which are often entrenched in a biomedical approach to health. It also highlighted the prevailing view that most local, regional and national institutions have towards migration, not yet considered as a structural component of our society and therefore addressed through short-term emergency interventions. Nevertheless, the analysis gave useful insights for the planning of future risk communication campaigns and system adaptations. In order to guarantee the right to health and to promote the well-being of the entire community, it is necessary to introduce changes in the social, health and legal system that shapes migrants' experience in Italy. These changes should follow principles of equity and inclusivity, with the purpose of guaranteeing a better management of future pandemics and the conditions for the empowerment of refugees and asylum seekers.","output":"Health equity during COVID-19: a qualitative study on the consequences of the syndemic on refugees and asylum seekers health in reception centres in Bologna (Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decline in immune function with age has been attributed to defects or alterations in both the innate and the adaptive immune system.

We report on the relevant cardiopulmonary findings in, to our knowledge, the first autopsy series of ten African American decedents, with the cause of death attributed to COVID-19. METHODS: Autopsies were performed on ten African American decedents aged 44-78 years with cause of death attributed to COVID-19, reflective of the dominant demographic of deaths following COVID-19 diagnosis in New Orleans. Autopsies were done with consent of the decedents' next of kin. Pulmonary and cardiac features were examined, with relevant immunostains to characterise the inflammatory response, and RNA labelling and electron microscopy on representative sections. FINDINGS: Important findings include the presence of thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries of the lungs, with associated haemorrhage, that significantly contributed to death. Features of diffuse alveolar damage, including hyaline membranes, were present, even in patients who had not been ventilated. Cardiac findings included individual cell necrosis without lymphocytic myocarditis. There was no evidence of secondary pulmonary infection by microorganisms. INTERPRETATION: We identify key pathological states, including thrombotic and microangiopathic pathology in the lungs, that contributed to death in patients with severe COVID-19 and decompensation in this demographic.

CRISPR/Cas9-based lateral flow assays are emerging as a powerful alternative for COVID-19 diagnostics. Here, we developed Bio-SCAN (biotin-coupled specific CRISPR-based assay for nucleic acid detection) as an accurate pathogen detection platform that requires no sophisticated equipment or technical expertise. Bio-SCAN detects the SARS-CoV-2 genome in less than 1 h from sample collection to result. In the first step, the target nucleic acid sequence is isothermally amplified in 15 min via recombinase polymerase amplification before being precisely detected by biotin-labeled nuclease-dead SpCas9 (dCas9) on commercially available lateral flow strips. The resulting readout is visible to the naked eye. Compared to other CRISPR-Cas-based pathogen detection assays, Bio-SCAN requires no additional reporters, probes, enhancers, reagents, or sophisticated devices to interpret the results. Bio-SCAN is highly sensitive and successfully detected a clinically relevant level (4 copies/L) of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. Similarly, Bio-SCAN showed 100% negative and 96% positive predictive agreement with RT-qPCR results when using clinical samples (86 nasopharyngeal swab samples). Furthermore, incorporating variant-specific sgRNAs in the detection reaction allowed Bio-SCAN to efficiently distinguish between the , , and  SARS-CoV-2 variants. Also, our results confirmed that the Bio-SCAN reagents have a long shelf life and can be assembled locally in nonlaboratory and limited-resource settings. Furthermore, the Bio-SCAN platform is compatible with the nucleic acid quick extraction protocol.

Prior literature has not focused on expert cricothyrotomy performance. While published checklists teach a specific procedural method, ideal for novice learners, this may hinder expert learners. Objectives We endeavored to create a succinct error-avoidance checklist for cricothyrotomy. We hypothesized that such a checklist would prove feasible and acceptable to attending physicians. Methods This is a multicenter prospective checklist creation, evaluation, and feasibility study. Multiple experts pursued an iterative process to reach consensus on a 7-item error-avoidance checklist. The checklist was trialed for feasibility in pilot sessions at two sites by 45 attending emergency physicians who used the checklist for peer performance assessment and provided feedback. Results During the pilot implementation, 94% of respondents completed the procedure within the allotted 120 s. Greater than 85% of respondents agreed that four of the five procedural errors on the checklist were very or somewhat critical to avoid, including cutting >2 cm from midline, creating a false passage, failing to continuously maintain an object in the trachea, and injuring oneself during the procedure. Only 66% of participants felt severing the cricoid cartilage was critical. Successful breath administration and time under 120 s were critical for 100% and 95% of participants, respectively.

These features constitute major determinants of virion stability in the environment and virion resistance against physical and chemical agents. Reovirus (ReoV) is the general term most commonly used for all virus strains that infect humans and nonhuman animals. Several studies have demonstrated the frequent occurrence of ReoV in wastewaters and natural waters, including surface and ground waters from different geographical areas. Most of these studies have reported higher concentrations of ReoV than any other enteric virus analyzed. They are more commonly isolated in chlorine-disinfected wastewaters than other enteric viruses, and appear to survive longer in water. The ability of ReoV to form large aggregates, even with different types of enteric viruses (e.g., poliovirus) and their ability to undergo mechanisms of gene segment reassortment among different serotypes may also explain their greater stability. Different approaches have been applied for concentration of ReoV from water; however, the recovery efficiency of the filtration methods has not been fully evaluated. Recently, molecular methods for identification of ReoV strains and quantification of virus genome have been developed. Studies have shown that the overall detection sensitivity of ReoV RNA is enhanced through initial replication of infectious virions in cell culture.

Training/testing cohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and 559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of airspace opacities. Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83, sensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and 0.83 for the DL-based classifier.

Bovine coronary artery endothelial cells (BCAEC) were treated with Norv (10 M), Epi (1 M) or the combination (Epi + Norv) for 48 h. Ar activity increased in aged BCAEC, with decreased NO generation. Treatment decreased Ar activity to levels seen in young cells. Epi and Epi + Norv decreased nitrosylated Ar levels by 25% in aged cells with lower oxidative stress (25%) (dihydroethidium) levels. In aged cells, Epi and Epi + Norv restored the eNOS monomer/dimer ratio, protein expression levels and NO production to those of young cells. Furthermore, using 18 month old rats 15 days of treatment with either Epi (1 mg/kg), Norv (10 mg/kg) or combo, decreased hypertension and improved aorta vasorelaxation to acetylcholine, blood NO levels and tetra/dihydribiopterin ratios in cultured rat aortic endothelial cells. In conclusion, results provide evidence that inhibiting Ar with Epi reverses aged-related loss of eNOS function and improves vascular function through the modulation of Ar and eNOS protein levels and activity.","output":"Arginase inhibition by (?)-Epicatechin reverses endothelial cell aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The purpose of testing for any communicable disease is to support clinicians in the diagnosis and management of individual patients and to describe transmission dynamics. The novel coronavirus is formally named SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease state resulting from an infection is known as COVID-19.

For 7 days, morning and evening surveys were collected online from two separate samples: community-based adults (N = 911) and university students (N = 322). Regression analyses revealed that across both samples, people with more variable sleep quality exhibited greater fluctuations in PA throughout the week and, surprisingly, higher levels of PA on average. In the community sample only, individuals with more variable sleep duration had lower and more variable PA. Findings suggest that fluctuations in sleep quality and duration are linked with daily PA outcomes, which is important to consider as technological advances and modern demands make inadequate and irregular sleep increasingly common.

However, higher expression level of JCHAIN, KLRB1, and TNFRSF14 was correlated to longer OS time in BRCA. The further analysis demonstrated MRPL13 was overexpressed in BRCA. Subtype analysis showed that MRPL13 was overexpressed in luminal, HER2-positive BRCA, and TNBC samples and was highest in TNBC samples. Moreover, we revealed higher expression of MRPL13 was significantly correlated to shorter OS time and higher TMB levels in BRCA. Pan-cancer analysis further revealed the prognostic value of MRPL13 in human cancers. MRPL13 expression was significantly increased in multiple human cancers, such as bladder cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, and prostate cancer.

We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables and isolate the UVI effect from potential confounding factors. After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01] and a 1.0 percentage points decline in the CFR daily growth rate [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (- 12%) and CFR (- 38%).

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous imaging-guided spine cryoablation for pain palliation and local tumor control for vertebral metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Imaging-guided spine cryoablation was performed in 14 patients (31 tumors) with vertebral metastases refractory to conventional chemoradiation therapy or analgesics, to achieve pain palliation and local tumor control in this retrospective study. Spinal nerve and soft-tissue thermal protection techniques were implemented in all ablations. Patient response was evaluated by a pain numeric rating scale administered before the procedure and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the procedure. Pre- and postprocedural analgesic requirements (expressed as morphine-equivalent dosages) were also analyzed at the same time points. Pre- and postprocedural cross-sectional imaging was evaluated in all patients to assess local control (no radiographic evidence of disease at the treated sites). Complications were monitored. Analysis of the primary end points was undertaken via paired-comparison procedures by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS Thirty-one tumors were ablated in 14 patients (9 women and 5 men; 20-73 years of age; mean age, 53 years). The most common tumor location was in the lumbar spine (n = 14, 45%), followed by the thoracic spine (n = 8, 26%), sacrum (n = 6, 19%), coccyx (n = 2, 6%), and cervical spine (n = 1, 3%). There were statistically significant decreases in the median numeric rating scale score and analgesic usage at 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month time points (P < .001 for all). Local tumor control was achieved in 96.7% (30/31) of tumors (median follow-up, 10 months). Two patients had transient postprocedural unilateral lower extremity radiculopathy and weakness.

AIM: This article describes and interprets the lived experiences of black isiXhosa-speaking individuals having a sibling with a mental illness, to shed light on how mental health professionals might support and sustain the involvement of individuals in the treatment and care of their sibling. SETTING: The study was conducted in a semi-rural town in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative research design using interpretative phenomenological analysis as the research method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed. RESULTS: The findings present interview extracts which give voice to participants experiences of financial burden, social burden and stigma, and of engaging with psychiatric treatment while providing care for their mentally ill sibling. Findings also highlight the positive aspects of caring for a sibling with a mental illness. CONCLUSION: This study specifically highlights the gendered nature of care work and siblings increased understanding of mental illness by virtue of their relationship with their brother or sister, thereby possibly pointing to sibling relationships as valuable relational resources for challenging stigma. The study findings suggest that calls for greater cooperation between healing belief systems should include dialogue with western religious belief systems alongside traditional healing belief systems.","output":"My siblings mental illness: An interpretative phenomenological analysis of experiences of having an adult sibling with a mental illness in semi-rural South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is lack of information on the impact of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic on routine cancer care delivery.

Material and Methods: Demographic data, diagnosis, type and frequency of chemotherapy delivered in Day Care between 1st February 2020 to 31st July 2020 were retrieved. Out Patient Department daily patient numbers were collected during above period. Descriptive statistics, Odds ratio, Chi-square and Student T test were used to measure change in pattern of DDC and OPD patient numbers before and after 24th March 2020 (day of Lockdown). Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength of correlation between rise in COVID-19 cases and patient numbers. Results: 3192 DCC and 8209 OPD visits were recorded in 126 working days. Median age was 47 years( SD + 19.06). Breast (17%) and Gall bladder( 15%) were the most common cancers receiving chemotherapy.

METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, 276 community-dwelling older adults with a habitual protein intake < 1.0 g/kg adjusted body weight (aBW)/d were randomly assigned to either Intervention 1; advice to increase protein intake to  1.2 g/kg aBW/d (PROT, n = 96), Intervention 2; similar advice and in addition advice to consume protein (en)rich(ed) foods within half an hour after usual physical activity (PROT + TIMING, n = 89), or continue the habitual diet with no advice (CON, n = 91). Primary outcome was 6-month change in 400-m walk time. Secondary outcomes were 6-month change in physical performance, leg extension strength, grip strength, body composition, self-reported mobility limitations and quality of life. We evaluated cost effectiveness from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Compared to CON, a positive effect on walk time was observed for PROT; C 12.4 s (95%CI, C 21.8 to C 2.9), and for PROT + TIMING; C 4.9 s (95%CI, C 14.5 to 4.7). Leg extension strength significantly increased in PROT (+ 32.6 N (95%CI, 10.6C54.5)) and PROT + TIMING (+ 24.3 N (95%CI, 0.2C48.5)) compared to CON. No significant intervention effects were observed for the other secondary outcomes. From a societal perspective, PROT was cost effective compared to CON. CONCLUSION: Dietary advice to increase protein intake to  1.2 g/kg aBW/d improved 400-m walk time and leg strength among older adults with a lower habitual protein intake.

Products claiming to contain synergistic formulations are common, although there is often little supporting evidence. The antimicrobial interactions of all pairwise combinations of common disinfectants (benzalkonium chloride, didecyldimethylammonium chloride, polyhexamethylene biguanide, chlorocresol and bronopol) were classified via checkerboard and validated by time-kill analyses. Combinations were tested against Acinetobacter baumannii NCTC 12156, Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 13379, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCTC 13443 and Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 13143. Synergistic interactions were only identified between cholorocresol with benzalkonium chloride, and chlorocresol with polyhexamethylene biguanide. Synergism was not ubiquitously demonstrated against all species tested and was on the borderline of the synergism threshold. These data demonstrate that synergism between disinfectants is uncommon and circumstantial. Most of the antimicrobial interactions tested were characterised as additive. We suggest that this is due to the broad, non-specific mechanisms associated with disinfectants not providing opportunity for the combined activities of these compounds to exceed the sum of their parts. IMPORTANCE The scarcity of observed synergistic interactions suggests that many disinfectant-based products may be misinterpreting combined mechanisms of interaction. We emphasise the need to correctly differentiate between additivity and synergism in antimicrobial formulations, as inappropriate classification may lead to unnecessary issues in the event of regulatory changes. Furthermore, we question the need to focus on synergism and disregard additivity when considering combinations of disinfectants, as the benefits that synergistic interactions provide are not necessarily relevant to the application of the final product.","output":"Synergism vs Additivity - Defining the Interactions between Common Disinfectants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary and specialty care clinicians strive to base diagnoses and treatment on specific, measurable abnormalities.

Type I interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes by activating phosphorylation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which form heterotrimers (interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 [ISGF3]) with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and translocate to the nucleus. PRRSV Nsp1 blocks the nuclear translocation of the ISGF3 complex by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we discovered that Nsp1 induced the degradation of karyopherin-1 (KPNA1, also called importin-5), which is known to mediate the nuclear import of ISGF3. Overexpression of Nsp1 resulted in a reduction of KPNA1 levels in a dose-dependent manner, and treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored KPNA1 levels. Furthermore, the presence of Nsp1 induced an elevation of KPNA1 ubiquitination and a shortening of its half-life. Our analysis of Nsp1 deletion constructs showed that the N-terminal domain of Nsp1 was involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA1. A nucleotide substitution resulting in an amino acid change from valine to isoleucine at residue 19 of Nsp1 diminished its ability to induce KPNA1 degradation and to inhibit IFN-mediated signaling. Interestingly, infection of MARC-145 cells by PRRSV strains VR-2332 and VR-2385 also resulted in KPNA1 reduction, whereas infection by an avirulent strain, Ingelvac PRRS modified live virus (MLV), did not. MLV Nsp1 had no effect on KPNA1; however, a mutant with an amino acid change at residue 19 from isoleucine to valine induced KPNA1 degradation. These results indicate that Nsp1 blocks ISGF3 nuclear translocation by inducing KPNA1 degradation and that valine-19 in Nsp1 correlates with the inhibition.","output":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus Nsp1 inhibits interferon-activated JAK/STAT signal transduction by inducing karyopherin-1 degradation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States, Asians are commonly assumed to excel across all educational stages.

Whereas most educational and governmental statistics lump all Asians together, we distinguish culturally between East Asians (e.g., ethnic Chinese) and South Asians (e.g., ethnic Indians), the two largest Asian groups in the United States. We propose that East Asiansbut not South Asiansunderperform academically because their low verbal assertiveness is culturally incongruent with the assertive class participation prized by US law schools and business schools. Across six large studies (n = 19,194), East Asians had lower grades than South Asians and Whites despite performing well on admission tests (e.g., Law School Admission Test, Graduate Management Admissions Test). East Asians underperformance was not explained by academic motivation but by lower assertiveness (whether assessed by self-ratings, peer ratings, or class participation scores)after controlling for factors such as birth country and English proficiency. Consistent with the assertiveness mechanism, East Asians underperformance was more pronounced in social courses emphasizing class participation (e.g., leadership, strategy) than in quantitative courses (e.g., accounting, finance). Notably, we found that East Asians underperformance was mitigated in online classes conducted via Zoom, a communication medium characterized by lower social presence than in-person classes.

Coroners' Prevention of Future Death reports (PFDs) provide valuable insights that may enable safer and more effective use of these agents. Objective: To identify CVD-related PFD reports highlighting the use or lack of anticoagulants as having caused or contributed to deaths. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of coronial case reports in England and Wales between 2013 and 2019. We screened 3037 PFDs for inclusion and used content analysis to assess concerns raised by coroners and who responded to them. Results: We identified 113 CVD-related PFDs (113 deaths) involving anticoagulants. Warfarin (36%), enoxaparin (11%), and rivaroxaban (11%) were the most common anticoagulants reported. In 14 cases, the coroner mentioned that the administration of an anticoagulant may have prevented the death. Concerns most frequently raised by coroners included poor systems (31%), poor communication (25%), and failures to keep accurate medical records (25%). These concerns were most often directed to NHS trusts (29%), hospitals (10%), and general practices (8%), but had national importance. Nearly two-thirds (60%) of PFDs had not received responses from such organisations, which are mandatory under regulation 28 of the Coroners' (Investigations) Regulations 2013. Conclusions: We created a tool (https://preventabledeathstracker.net/) that bring together coroner reports to identify important lessons related to preventable deaths. Here we examined instances of premature deaths from CVD involving anticoagulants. National organisations, healthcare professionals, and prescribers should take actions to address these concerns, to improve the use of anticoagulants in patients with CVD.","output":"Deaths from cardiovascular disease involving anticoagulants: a systematic synthesis of coroners' case reports to prevent future deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Many adaptations to medical education have been made in response to the new emergent COVID-19 pandemic and its enormous global effects including the teaching and learning strategies to assure the educational process's safety and advancement.

The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on normal pituitary glands function or pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) have not yet been elucidated. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the impairment of pituitary glands and the development of PitNETs. METHODS: PitNETs tissues were obtained from 114 patients, and normal pituitary gland tissues were obtained from the autopsy. The mRNA levels of ACE2 and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for ACE2 in 69 PitNETs and 3 normal pituitary glands. The primary tumor cells and pituitary cell lines (MMQ, GH3 and AtT-20/D16v-F2) were treated with diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 agonist, with various dose regimens. The pituitary hormones between 43 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with 45 healthy controls. RESULTS: Pituitary glands and the majority of PitNET tissues showed low/negative ACE2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, while AGTR1 showed high expression in normal pituitary and corticotroph adenomas. ACE2 agonist increased the secretion of ACTH in AtT-20/D16v-F2 cells through downregulating AGTR1. The level of serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to normal controls (p < 0.001), but was dramatically decreased in critical cases compared to non-critical patients (p = 0.003).

Tanreqing Capsule (TRQC) was used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of TRQC in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 82 patients who had laboratory-confirmed mild and moderate COVID-19; patients were treated with TRQC in one designated hospital. The treatment and control groups consisted of 25 and 57 cases, respectively. The treatment group was given TRQC orally three times a day, three pills each time, in addition to conventional Western medicine treatments which were also administered to the control group. The clinical efficacy indicators, such as the negative conversion time of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid, the negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid, the duration of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid, and the improvement in the level of immune indicators such as T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD45) were monitored. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients in the treatment group, compared to the control group, had a shorter negative conversion time of fecal nucleic acid (4 vs. 9 days, P = 0.047) and a shorter interval of negative conversion of pharyngeal-fecal nucleic acid (0 vs. 2 days, P = 0.042). The level of CD3+ T cells increased in the treatment group compared to the control group ([317.09  274.39] vs. [175.02  239.95] counts/L, P = 0.030).

Vaccination promises to rapidly bring the pandemic under control, return normalcy to the world and pave the way of economic recovery.Methods: This was a cross-sectional, country-wide, self-administered anonymous online survey, carried out on the WhatsApp platform and among the Nigerian Medical Doctors. The study was conducted between 13th to 31st January, 2021 using the health belief model (HBM) as a hypothetical framework for understanding the acceptance of the prospective COVID-19 vaccination.Findings: A total of 830 Medical Doctors from 34 states of the Nigerian federation capital responded to the online survey. Of these, 38.8% were willing to take the vaccine, 36.0% were unsure, while the remaining 26.5% would not. The positive predictors for vaccine acceptance were age, male gender, perceived contagiousness of the virus, and perceived threat to life. The believe that ivermectin is an excellent alternative to the vaccine was the only negative predictor. Safety concerns were the major deterrents to accepting the COVID-19 vaccines. Hypothetically addressing the fears on vaccine safety will result in additional 287 (34.6%) Doctors who will be willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine by (p<0.0001).

OBJECTIVE: This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine. CONCLUSION: This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","output":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A primer for emergency physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease transmitted by the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which exhibit several clinical manifestations including gastrointestinal symptoms. SCOPE AND APPROACH: This review aimed to provide insights and perspectives for the use of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics as adjuvants for prevention/treatment and/or modulation of the microbiota in COVID-19 patients. Eighty-four studies published in the Scopus database from the onset of the pandemic until December 2021 were assessed and submitted to a bibliometric analysis adapted from VOSviewer software. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Through bibliometric analysis, it might be suggested that the modulation of the gut/lung microbiome is promising as an adjuvant for the prevention/treatment of COVID-19 patients, due to immunomodulation properties related to probiotics and prebiotics. So far, few clinical studies involving the application of probiotics in COVID-19 patients have been completed, but reduction in the duration of the disease and the severity of symptoms as fatigue, olfactory dysfunction and breathlessness, nausea and vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms were some of the main findings. However, probiotics are not recommended to immunocompromised patients in corticosteroid therapy. The future perspectives point to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota by probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics represent a promising adjuvant approach for improving the health of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Evidences and perspectives of the use of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics as adjuvants for prevention and treatment of COVID-19: A bibliometric analysis and systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the reliability and validity of the 5-scale grading system to interpret the point-of-care immunoassay for tear matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9.

Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. The interobserver agreements were analyzed according to the severity of tear MMP-9 expression. To validate the system, a concentration calibration curve was made using MMP-9 solutions with reference concentrations, then the distribution of MMP-9 concentrations was analyzed according to the 5-scale grading system. Both intraobserver and interobserver reliability was excellent. The readout grades were significantly correlated with the quantified colorimetric densities. The interobserver variance of readout grades had no correlation with the severity of the measured densities. The band density continued to increase up to a maximal concentration (i.e. 5000 ng/mL) according to the calibration curve. The difference of grades reflected the change of MMP-9 concentrations sensitively, especially between grade 2 and 4.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics formally recognized the occupation of community health worker (CHW) in 2009. Since then, various national and state efforts to professionalize the occupation have been undertaken. The Community Health Workers Core Consensus (C3) project released a set of CHW roles and competency recommendations meant to provide evidence-based standards for CHW roles across work settings. Some states have adopted the recommendations; however, there are a variety of approaches regarding the regulation of the occupation. As of 2020, 19 U.S. states have implemented voluntary statewide CHW certification programs. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between state regulation of CHWs and adoption of standard roles, skills, and qualities by employers in select states. METHODS: This mixed methods study used purposive sampling of job ads for CHWs posted by employers from 2017 to 2020 in select states. Natural language processing was used to extract content from job ads and preprocess the data for statistical analysis. ANOVA, chi-square analysis, and MANOVA was used to test hypotheses related to the relationship between state regulation of CHWs and differences in skills, roles, and qualities employers seek based on seniority of state regulatory processes and employer types. RESULTS: The mean job ads with nationally identified roles, skills, and qualities varies significantly by state policy type (F(2, 4801) = 26.21) and by employer type (F(4, 4799) = 69.08, p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Employment of CHWs is increasing to provide culturally competent care, address the social determinants of health, and improve access to health and social services for members of traditionally underserved communities. Employers in states with CHW certification programs were associated with greater adoption of occupational standards set by state and professional organizations. Wide adoption of such standards may improve recognition of the CHW workforce as a valuable resource in addressing the needs of high-need and marginalized groups.","output":"Evaluating the association of state regulation of community health workers on adoption of standard roles, skills, and qualities by employers in select states: a mixed methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Applying the multivariate cointegration tests with daily prices during the period August 15, 2019, to August 11, 2020 (250 data), this paper examines whether prices in the rice deficit market (Jakarta) are co-integrated with prices in surplus markets (Semarang and Surabaya) Research data is the average daily price in traditional markets in Jakarta, Semarang, and Surabaya The main focus is on the effect of implementing various programs and policies relating to controlling the spread of COVID-19 to the integration of the rice market in Java On March 02, 2020, the first two COVID-19 cases in Indonesia were confirmed as a dummy variable that we use regarding controlling borders between regions and restricting the movement of goods The cointegration tests find that the domestic rice prices of Jakarta - Semarang and Jakarta - Surabaya are integrated both in short-run and long-run periods In the short term, programs and policies relating to controlling the spread of COVID-19 do not affect the integration of Java's rice market One reason is that during the pandemic, the rice supply chain's performance was still protected by the government to maintain the stability of rice supply for the citizens ? 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing All rights reserved","output":"The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on rice market performance in Java, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dexamethasone, a widely used corticosteroid, has recently been reported as the first drug to increase the survival chances of patients with severe COVID-19.

Martial arts are not outside the application of these techniques. From the point of view of the modeling of human movement in relation to the learning of complex motor skills, martial arts are of interest because they are articulated around a system of movements that are predefined, or at least, bounded, and governed by the laws of Physics. Their execution must be learned after continuous practice over time. Literature suggests that artificial intelligence algorithms, such as those used for computer vision, can model the movements performed. Thus, they can be compared with a good execution as well as analyze their temporal evolution during learning. We are exploring the application of this approach to model psychomotor performance in Karate combats (called kumites), which are characterized by the explosiveness of their movements. In addition, modeling psychomotor performance in a kumite requires the modeling of the joint interaction of two participants, while most current research efforts in human movement computing focus on the modeling of movements performed individually. Thus, in this work, we explore how to apply a pose estimation algorithm to extract the features of some predefined movements of Ippon Kihon kumite (a one-step conventional assault) and compare classification metrics with four data mining algorithms, obtaining high values with them.","output":"Toward Modeling Psychomotor Performance in Karate Combats Using Computer Vision Pose Estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Close contact is unavoidable in the care of patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD).

However, the reasons remained to be addressed. METHODS: To find the factors that potentially protect females from COVID-19, we recruited all confirmed patients hospitalized at 3 branches of Tongji Hospital (N = 1902), and analyzed the correlation between menstrual status (n = 509, including 68 from Mobile Cabin Hospital), female hormones (n = 78), and cytokines related to immunity and inflammation (n = 263), and the severity/clinical outcomes in female patients <60 years of age. RESULTS: Nonmenopausal female patients had milder severity and better outcome compared with age-matched men (P < .01 for both). Menopausal patients had longer hospitalization times than nonmenopausal patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.06C3.46]; P = .033). Both anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) and estradiol (E2) showed a negative correlation with severity of infection (adjusted HR, 0.146 [95% CI, .026C.824], P = .029 and 0.304 [95% CI, .092C1.001], P = .05, respectively).

It is based on the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) model, but its equations are modifiable according to the transmission parameters of novel variants. Since more transmissible strains will drive a further increase in the number of cases, they will also lead to further novel mutations. As one cannot predict whether there is a viral mutational evolutionary limit, we model a cascade that could lead to hyper-exponential growth involving the emergence of even more transmissible mutants that could overwhelm systemic response. Our results are consistent with the timing, since the beginning of the pandemic, of the concurrent and independent emergence of the VOCs.

Here we show that infection with Delta, but not Omicron, induces broad immunity in mice. While sera from Omicron-infected mice only neutralize Omicron, sera from Delta-infected mice are broadly effective against Delta and other VOCs, including Omicron. This is not observed with the WA1 ancestral strain, although both WA1 and Delta elicited a highly pro-inflammatory cytokine response and replicated to similar titers in the respiratory tracts and lungs of infected mice as well as in human airway organoids. Pulmonary viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and overall disease progression are markedly reduced with Omicron infection.

Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set).

This study presents the experiences of partially embolized cerebral AVMs followed by Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) and assesses predictive factors for AVM obliteration and hemorrhage. METHODS The interventional neuroradiology database that was reviewed included 404 patients who underwent AVM embolization. Using this database, the authors retrospectively analyzed all partially embolized AVM cases followed by GKS for a residual nidus. Except for cases of complete AVM obliteration, the authors excluded all patients with radiological follow-up of less than 2 years. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the predictive factors related to AVM obliteration and hemorrhage following GKS. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the obliteration with a cutoff AVM nidus volume of 3 cm(3) and 10 cm(3). RESULTS One hundred sixty-two patients qualified for the study. The median patient age was 26 years and 48.8% were female. Hemorrhage presented as the most common symptom (48.1%). The median preembolization volume of an AVM was 14.3 cm(3). The median volume and margin dose for GKS were 10.92 cm(3) and 16.0 Gy, respectively. The median radiological and clinical follow-up intervals were 47 and 79 months, respectively. The annual hemorrhage rate was 1.71% and total obliteration rate was 56.8%. Noneloquent area (p = 0.004), superficial location (p < 0.001), decreased volume (p < 0.001), lower Spetzler-Martin grade (p < 0.001), lower Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (RAS; p < 0.001), lower Pollock-Flickinger score (p < 0.001), lower modified Pollock-Flickinger score (p < 0.001), increased maximum dose (p < 0.001), and increased margin dose (p < 0.001) were found to be statistically significant in predicting the probability of AVM obliteration in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, only volume (p = 0.016) was found to be an independent prognostic factor for AVM obliteration. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test of the Kaplan-Meier analysis (chi-square = 54.402, p < 0.001) showed a significantly decreased obliteration rate of different cutoff AVM volume groups of less than 3 cm(3), 3-10 cm(3), and more than 10 cm(3). No independent prognostic factor was found for AVM hemorrhage in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Partially embolized AVMs are amenable to successful treatment with GKS. The volume of the nidus significantly influences the outcome of radiosurgical treatment.

Subjects (healthy or those with controlled chronic diseases) aged between 19 and 80 years, who gave written informed consent were eligible. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1:1, in blocks) to three groups: placebo, 25 g and 50 g RBD vaccine (Abdala). The product was administered intramuscularly, 05 mL in the deltoid region. During the first phase, two immunization schedules were studied: 0-14-28 days (short) and 0-28-56 days (long). In phase 2, only the short schedule was evaluated. The organoleptic characteristics and presentations of vaccine and placebo were identical. All participants (subjects, clinical researchers, statisticians, laboratory technicians, and monitors) remained masked during the study period.

During phase 1, the incidence of adverse events in the 25 g, 50 g, and placebo arms for the short schedule were 6/22 (273%), 6/22 (273%), 3/22 (136%), respectively, and for the long schedule were 8/22 (364%), 9/22 (409%), 4/22 (182%), respectively. In phase 2, adverse reactions were reported by 53/242 (219%), 75/242 (310%) and 41/242 (169%) participants in the 25 g, 50 g, and placebo group, respectively. Adverse reactions were minimal, mostly mild, and from the injection site, which resolved in the first 24-48 hours. In phase 1, seroconversion at day 56 was seen in 952% of the participants (20/21) in the 50 g group, 81% (17/21) in the 25 g group, and none in the placebo group (0/22). For the long schedule, seroconversion at day 70 was seen in 100% of the participants (21/21) in the 50 g group, 947% (18/19) in the 25 g group, and none in the placebo group (0/22). In phase 2, seroconversion of anti-RBD IgG antibodies at day 56 was seen in 892% of the participants in the 50 g group (214/240; 95% CI 845-9282), 777% in the 25 g group (185/238; 720-829) and 46% in the placebo group (11/239; 23-81). Compared with the placebo arm, the differences in the proportion of participants with seroconversion were 731% (95% CI 668-795) and 846% (794-897) in the 25 g and 50 g groups, respectively. The seroconversion rate in the 50 g group was significantly higher than in the 25 g group (p=00012). INTERPRETATION: The Abdala vaccine was safe, well tolerated, and induced humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. These results, in the context of the emergency COVID-19 pandemic, support the 50 g dose, applied in a 0-14-28 days schedule, for further clinical trials to confirm vaccine efficacy.

This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the prevalence of zinc deficiency and COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population in the Asian and European countries. The COVID-19 data from two different time points, that is, May 30 and June 30, 2020 for the Asian population and May 15 and June 15, 2020 for the European population, were analyzed to determine the correlation with the estimated zinc deficiency for these two continents. The prevalence of zinc deficiency was about two times higher in the Asian population (mean 17.5%) than in the European population (mean 8.9%). A significant positive correlation (p < .05) was observed between the prevalence of zinc deficiency and COVID-19 cases at both time periods for the Asian population. However, the correlation between zinc deficiency prevalence and COVID-19 deaths was not significant in the Asian population. In contrast, a significant but negative correlation (p < .05 for all cases) was observed for zinc deficiency with both COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population at both time periods in the European countries. Considering the direct antiviral properties of zinc, it can be suggested that zinc supplementation may be beneficial for most of the population, especially older people and those who are at risk of COVID-19 infections. In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between individual zinc status and COVID-19 infections and mortality. Therefore, cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are required to test this hypothesis.","output":"Assessment of the role of zinc in the prevention of COVID-19 infections and mortality: A retrospective study in the Asian and European population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus in China in December 2019 has turned into a global pandemic through continued spread beyond borders.

Cleaning (e.g., cleaning surfaces, washing and sanitizing hands) and containing (e.g., covering coughs, keeping distance from others, especially sick people) behaviors are recommended. PURPOSE: To develop the Clean and Contain Measure, a brief measure of compliance with CDC recommendations for prevention of infectious disease, and validate the measure in individuals experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and social media. RESULTS: In Study 1 (N = 97), exploratory factor analysis revealed two scales: (a) five items assessing cleaning behaviors and (b) four items assessing containing behaviors. Simple structure was obtained and alpha coefficients for both scales were >.83. In Studies 2 (N = 204) and 3 (N = 527), confirmatory factor analysis verified the identical factor structure found in Study 1. All loadings were statistically significant at p < .001. Alpha coefficients for both scales were >.84 for Studies 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: Our measure is a reliable and valid indicator of compliance with cleaning and containing health behaviors that help to prevent the spread of diseases like COVID-19. Future research should replicate construct validity in more diverse samples and continue to refine items, examine construct validity, including predictive and discriminant validity, and improve the measure for future use.

Hence, this case study aims at assessing the changes in both parents and teacher's involvement and practices, respectively as perceived by students. Ten parents, their respective children from an intact class of Grade 8 students in a public high school were randomly selected as respondents of the study. Five teachers from the same grade levels were also interviewed. A validated interview questionnaire was used as guide to illicit responses from the respondents through Google Meet and personal messaging. Answers were transcribed and thematically analyzed though qualitative software Quirkos. Quirk size per themes were basis for tabulation and referred for further grouping per category. Results showed that material and emotional support of the parents were recognized as the primary parental involvement in the schooling of the child at home. Parents value to continue education and recognize the need to adapt in the new normal of schooling. Monitoring offline and online activities at home, teaching the concept, and building communication with the child are strategies employed to help understand science concept. Parents perceived communication with school through teachers for updates as the most important factor for them to execute their roles. Teachers are easy to deal with and can easily resolved problems regarding academic issues of the child however they are challenged with teacher's availability, attitudes, time constraints and internet connections. Teachers involved stakeholders, initiate, and reciprocate the communication stablished by parents through messaging and portal through social media platform but are confronted with parents and students who seldom goes online. The use of various learning materials and assessment delivered in various modalities are teachers' mechanism to strengthen science concept the way parents recognize teachers' pedagogic capabilities. Students highly appreciate actions taken both by parents and teachers and acknowledge the need for parental program to be beneficial. Internet connectivity, knowledge on the use of technology for distance learning and capacity on digital literacy are factors that limits the three group of respondents. Developing differentiated and inclusive communication strategies for parents, giving focus on designing resilient, flexible and self-directed asynchronous learning with parental involvement experiences and standardizing minimum requirement for a learning space at home are recommended for implementation in the next phase of this research. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Teachers Initiatives and Perceived Parental Involvement Practices among Filipino Junior High School Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused clinicians at the frontlines to confront difficult decisions regarding resource allocation, treatment options, and ultimately the life-saving measures that must be taken at the point of care.

In times of emergencies and crises such as this pandemic, the enactment of CSC enables concrete decisions to be made by governments relating to supply chains, resource allocation, and provision of care to maximize societal benefit. This shift from an individual to a population-based societal focus has profound consequences on how clinical decisions are made at the point of care. Failing to enact CSC may have psychological impacts for healthcare providers particularly related to moral distress, through an inability to fully enact individual beliefs (individually-focused clinical decisions) which form their moral compass.","output":"Crisis Standards of Care in a Pandemic: Navigating the Ethical, Clinical, Psychological, and Policy-making Maelstrom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate nurses' perceptions of oral health care provision to inpatients in Japanese hospitals and the infection control measures taken by them after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown to promote collaborative oral health care. METHOD: The participants were 1037 nurses working in inpatient wards at 4 hospitals in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey approximately 6 months after the first COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: More than 90% of the 734 nurses participating in this study positively perceived the preventive effect of oral health care on aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and viral infection. However, approximately half of them had negative perceptions about their knowledge and confidence regarding the control of COVID-19 with oral health care provision, and 84.7% expected to be provided with the necessary information by oral health professionals. Further, 537 nurses (73.2%) provided oral health care to their patients; 9 nurses (1.7%) responded that those patients who received oral health care decreased after the lockdown; and 12 (2.4%) responded that they could no longer collaborate with oral health professionals because of the lockdown. Additionally, 41.7% of them used neither protective glasses nor face shields even after the lockdown began. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that almost all the nurses perceived the benefcial effect of oral health care for the prevention of viral infection and pneumonia. However, some nurses perceived that their oral health care provision and collaborative oral health care were negatively affected. It also showed that most nurses' knowledge, confidence, and use of infection control measures were insufficient.

The scaffold aids cell organization in the damaged tissue. It serves and allows bio mimicking the mechanical and biological properties of the target tissue and facilitates cell proliferation and differentiation at the regeneration site. In this study, the developed and assayed bio-composite made of unique collagen fibers and alginate hydrogel supports the function of cells around the implanted material. We used an in vivo rat model to study the scaffold effects when transplanted subcutaneously and as an augment for tendon repair. Animals' well-being was measured by their weight and daily activity post scaffold transplantation during their recovery. At the end of the experiment, the bio-composite was histologically examined, and the surrounding tissues around the implant were evaluated for inflammation reaction and scarring tissue. In the histology, the formation of granulation tissue and fibroblasts that were part of the inclusion process of the implanted material were noted. At the transplanted sites, inflammatory cells, such as plasma cells, macrophages, and giant cells, were also observed as expected at this time point post transplantation. This study demonstrated not only the collagen-alginate device biocompatibility, with no cytotoxic effects on the analyzed rats, but also that the 3D structure enables cell migration and new blood vessel formation needed for tissue repair. Overall, the results of the current study proved for the first time that the implantable scaffold for long-term confirms the well-being of these rats and is correspondence to biocompatibility ISO standards and can be further developed for medical devices application.","output":"Biocompatibility of a Marine Collagen-Based Scaffold In Vitro and In Vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores nonwoven and woven fabrics to improve upon the performance of the widespread all-cotton mask, and examines the effect of layering, machine washing and drying on their filtration and breathability for submicron and supermicron particles.

Nonwoven polyester and nonwoven polypropylene (craft fabrics, medical masks, and medical wraps) showed higher quality factors than woven materials (flannel cotton, Kona cotton, sateen cotton). Materials with meltblown nonwoven polypropylene filtered best, especially against submicron particles. Subsequently, we combined high performing fabrics into multi-layer sets, evaluating the sets quality factors before and after our washing protocol, which included machine washing, machine drying, and isopropanol soak. Sets incorporating meltblown nonwoven polypropylene designed for filtration (Filti and surgical mask) degraded significantly post-wash in the submicron range where they excelled prior to washing (Q = 57 and 79 at 1 micron, respectively, degraded to Q = 10 and 15 post-wash). Washing caused lesser quality degradation in sets incorporating spunbond non-woven polypropylene or medical wraps (Q = 12 to 24 pre-wash, Q = 8 to 10 post-wash).

This article shows how health care workers are coping with this pandemic, and the challenges of maintaining the therapeutic alliance. It presents a synthesis of works on confinement, covid19 and mental disorders. Clinical observations reveal that the covid-19 epidemic has strengthened the dysfunctions observed in care. In rural areas, there is a suppression of follow-up at home. In general, this health crisis had an impact on the purchasing power of patients. What caused a difficulty of payment of the psychiatric consultations in liberal, a difficulty of access to the expensive psychotropic drugs thus favoring a nonobservance of the care, and a decompensation of the psychiatric picture. In urban areas there is a considerable decrease in outpatient consultations. There is still concern about the inter and post covid-19 psychiatric care. This pandemic calls on leaders leading to a reorganization of the psychiatric care system (decentralization of establishments throughout the country, training of qualified nursing staff, fall in the prices of expensive psychotropic drugs).

In this new context, individuals' health-promoting routines are under greater strain, contributing to poorer mental and physical health. Additionally, individuals are required to keep up to date with latest health guidelines about the virus, which may be confusing in an age of social-media disinformation and shifting guidelines. To tackle these factors, we developed Elena+, a smartphone-based and conversational agent (CA) delivered pandemic lifestyle care intervention. Methods: Elena+ utilizes varied intervention components to deliver a psychoeducation-focused coaching program on the topics of: COVID-19 information, physical activity, mental health (anxiety, loneliness, mental resources), sleep and diet and nutrition. Over 43 subtopics, a CA guides individuals through content and tracks progress over time, such as changes in health outcome assessments per topic, alongside user-set behavioral intentions and user-reported actual behaviors. Ratings of the usage experience, social demographics and the user profile are also captured. Elena+ is available for public download on iOS and Android devices in English, European Spanish and Latin American Spanish with future languages and launch countries planned, and no limits on planned recruitment. Panel data methods will be used to track user progress over time in subsequent analyses. The Elena+ intervention is open-source under the Apache 2 license (MobileCoach software) and the Creative Commons 4.0 license CC BY-NC-SA (intervention logic and content), allowing future collaborations; such as cultural adaptions, integration of new sensor-related features or the development of new topics.

We described a clinical pathway for patients who needed emergency brain surgery and determined whether differences in the surgery preparation process caused by COVID-19 screening affected clinical outcomes. METHODS: During the COVID-19 period, patients in need of emergency brain surgery in our institution were managed using a novel standardized pathway designed for COVID-19 screening. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who were hospitalized through the emergency room and underwent emergency brain surgery. A total of 32 patients who underwent emergency brain surgery from February 1 to June 30, 2020 were included in the COVID-19 group, and 65 patients who underwent surgery from February 1 to June 30, 2019 were included in the pre-COVID-19 group. The baseline characteristics, disease severity indicators, time intervals of emergency processes, and clinical outcomes of the two groups were compared. Subgroup analysis was performed between the immediate surgery group and the semi-elective surgery group during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and severity indicators between the pre-COVID-19 group and COVID-19 group. The time interval to skin incision was significantly increased in the COVID-19 group (P = 0.027). However, there were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the two groups. In subgroup comparison, the time interval to skin incision was shorter in the immediate surgery group during the COVID-19 period compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (P = 0.040). The screening process did not significantly increase the time interval to classification and admission for immediate surgery. The time interval to surgery initiation was longer in the COVID-19 period due to the increased time interval in the semi-elective surgery group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We proposed a clinical pathway for the preoperative screening of COVID-19 in patients requiring emergency brain surgery. No significant differences were observed in the clinical outcomes before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The protocol we described showed acceptable results during this pandemic.","output":"Clinical Pathway for Emergency Brain Surgery during COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact on Clinical Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To present the 1\\\\year results of the Variation of Orthokeratology Lens Treatment Zone (VOLTZ) Study, which aims to investigate the myopia control effect of orthokeratology (ortho\\\\k) lenses with different back optic zone diameters (BOZD).

The search followed World Health Organisation (WHO) Europe's health workforce guidance on Covid-19. Content analysis was performed, informed by the themes of WHO. RESULTS: The pandemic preparedness plans consisted of no or limited information on how to expand and prepare the health workforce during pandemics. The 16 states varied considerably regarding implementing strategies to expand health workforce capacities. Only one state adopted a policy on task-shifting despite a federal law on task-shifting during pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: Planning on the health workforce, its capacity and skill-mix during pandemics was limited in the pandemic response plans. Actions during the peak of the pandemic varied considerably across states, were implemented ad hoc and with limited planning.

Our objective was to determine if COVID-19 changed ED visit disease severity during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross sectional study conducted in Nanjing, China. We captured ED visit data from 28 hospitals. We then compared visit numbers from October 2019 to February 2020 for a month-to-month analysis and every February from 2017 to 2020 for a year-to-year analysis. Inter-group chi-square test and time series trend tests were performed to compare visit numbers. The primary outcome was the proportion of severe disease visits in the EDs. RESULTS: Through February 29 (th) 2020, there were 93 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Nanjing, of which 40 cases (43.01%) were first seen in the ED. The total number of ED visits in Nanjing in February 2020, were dramatically decreased (n = 99,949) in compared to January 2020 (n = 313,125) and February 2019 (n = 262,503). Except for poisoning, the severe diseases in EDs all decreased in absolute number, but increased in proportion both in year-to-year and month-to-month analyses. This increase in proportional ED disease severity was greater in higher-level referral hospitals when compared year by year.

METHODS: Facebook was used to run nine social media campaigns (15 weeks total, CA$675). Offline methods were used concurrently over 64 weeks (printing costs: CA$300). The cost, rate of recruitment and conversion rate in each group was calculated. Performance metrics of social media campaigns (reach, impressions, clicks, inquiries, enrolments) were recorded. Linear regression was used to explore the association between metrics and dollars spent per campaign. RESULTS: In total, n = 481 inquiries were received: n = 51 (11%) via offline methods and n = 430 (89%) via social media. Enrolees (n = 60 total) included n = 24 (40%) and n = 36 (60%) via offline and social media methods, respectively. Gestational weeks upon inquiry (n = 251; mean  SD) were not different among groups (offline: 13.3  4.7; social media: 13.2  5.6). Direct cost per enrolee was CA$13 and CA$19 via offline and social media methods, respectively (however, this does not include cost of labour). The rate of recruitment was approximately six times faster via social media. However, the conversion rate was higher via offline methods than social media (47% vs. 8%). The amount spent per campaign was significantly associated with improved clicks and inquiries, but not enrolments. CONCLUSIONS: Social media was more efficient and effective than offline methods. We gained numerous insights for optimization of social media campaigns (dollars spent, attribution setting, photo testing, automatic optimization) to increase clicks and inquiries, however, this does not necessarily increase enrolments, which was more dependent on study-specific factors (e.g. time of year, study design).","output":"Strategies for improving recruitment of pregnant women to clinical research: An evaluation of social media versus traditional offline methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for proven disease-specific treatments for the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 necessitates a worldwide search for therapeutic options. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares extensive homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, effective therapies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may also have therapeutic potential for the current COVID-19 outbreak. To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma and humanized monoclonal antibodies offer passive immunity and decreased recovery time.

Pairwise analyses indicated higher COVID-19 total and positive test rates per 1000 persons in majority Black and Hispanic vs. majority White ZCTAs (CI [0.117, 4.55]; CI [2.53, 5.14]). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that higher percentage of Black and Hispanic residents predicted more total COVID-19 tests per 1000 persons (p < 0.05). In contrast, majority Black and Hispanic ZCTAs had fewer licensed and ICU beds (CI [6.50, 124.25]; CI [0.69, 7.16]), with social disadvantage predicting lower licensed and ICU bed access per 1000 persons (p < 0.01). While anecdotal reports of inequitable access to COVID-19-related healthcare resources in ethnocultural minority communities have emerged, this is the first study to reveal that social disadvantage may be a major driver of hospital resource inequities in Black and Hispanic communities.

If monotonicity fails, then it is difficult to guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned classes of matrices. In such a case, $K$-monotonicity is sufficient for the convergence of $K$-regular and $K$-weak regular splittings, where $K$ is a proper cone in $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$. However, the convergence theory of a two-stage iteration scheme in general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature.

To this end, we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for $K$-weak regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a two-stage iterative scheme is a $K$-regular splitting and then establish some comparison theorems. We also study $K$-monotone convergence theory of the stationary two-stage iterative method in case of a $K$-weak regular splitting of type II. The most interesting and important part of this work is on $M$-matrices appearing in the Covid-19 pandemic model.

DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Data were collected between 17 and 20 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2237 participants living in the UK aged 16-75 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reporting having had arguments, felt angry or fallen out with others because of COVID-19. Reporting having confronted or reported someone to the authorities, or that you had been confronted or reported to the authorities, for not wearing a face covering; not keeping your distance from others or being in too large a group; or alternatively following recommended measures too carefully. We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with anger and confrontation. RESULTS: Most participants reported having had arguments, feeling angry or fallen out with others because of COVID-19 (56%, n = 1255). Twenty-two percent (n = 500) of participants reported that they had confronted or reported someone. Fourteen percent (n = 304) of participants reported that they had been confronted or reported by someone. Confronting someone, having been confronted and feeling angry or having had arguments were strongly associated with each other. Anger and confrontation were associated with younger age, greater likelihood of experiencing significant financial difficulties due to the pandemic, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 and getting information about COVID-19 from social media. CONCLUSIONS: Measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have caused considerable strain.

Such compact and simple classification systems where the computing cost is low and memory is managed efficiently may be more useful for real time application. System is evaluated on the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) and the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS).

The results obtained by attempting classification with Alexnet and Resnet50 are also reported. Observations proved that this introduction of autoencoders indeed can improve the classification accuracy of the emotion in the input audio files. It can be concluded that in emotion recognition from speech, the choice and application of dimensionality reduction of audio features impacts the results that are achieved and therefore, by working on this aspect of the general speech emotion recognition model, it may be possible to make great improvements in the future.","output":"Impact of autoencoder based compact representation on emotion detection from audio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The University College Dublin (UCD) Public and Patient Invovlement (PPI) ignite program is focused on embedding PPI in health and social care related research, education and training, professional practice and administration. During a PPI knowledge sharing event challenges were noted during the pre-commencement stage of research projects. This stage includes the time before a research projects/partnership starts or when funding is being applied for. As a response, we agreed there was a need to spend time developing a values-based approach to be used from the pre-commencement of PPI projects and partnerships. Values are deeply held ideals that people consider to be important. They are vital in shaping our attitudes and motivating our choices and behaviours. METHODS: Using independent facilitators, we invited a diverse group of participants to a full-day workshop in February. During the workshop, the concept of a values statement and values-based approaches was introduced. The group via a majority consensus, agreed on a core set of values and a shared understanding of them. After the workshop, a draft was shared with participants for further comment and final agreement. RESULTS: The workshop had 22 people representing experts by experience, PPI charity partners, funders, academics and national PPI Ignite partners. The group via consensus identified four values of respect, openness, reciprocity and flexibility for the pre-commencement stage. A frequently reported experience of PPI partners was that some felt that the pre-commencement activities appeared at times like a performance; an act that had to be completed in order to move to the next stage rather than a genuine interest in a mutually beneficial partnership. Being open and transparent with all invovled that the funding application may not be successful was stressed. Another important feature related to openness was the spaces and places in which meetings between partners could occur in an accessible and equitable way. The issue of space is particularly critical for the involvement of seldom heard groups. The benefits of the research are often clear for academics, but for PPI partners, these are often less certain. To achieve reciprocity, academic and PPI partners need to engage in a timely, repeated and transparent dialogue to achieve beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders. Being open to new inputs and differing modes of knowledge and ideas was also stressed. For some, this will require a change in attitudes and behaviours and should result in more collective decision making. Several areas were identified using the four values. CONCLUSIONS: This work via majority consensus identified four values of respect, openness, reciprocity, and flexibility for the pre-commencement stage. These values should be used to support inclusive, effective and collective PPI across all stages of involvement. We hope this work will stimulate further action in this area.

Positional change and neck movement typically displace an ETT and change the intracuff pressure. The aim of the current study was to compare the ETT cuff pressure in the TaperGuard ETT vs the conventional ETT after a change from the supine, neutral position to the extension of the neck and semi-Fowler position for thyroid surgery. METHODS This prospective, randomized clinical trial included 50 patients undergoing thyroidectomy. Patients were randomly allocated into one of the 2 groups: tracheal intubation with the TaperGuard ETT or with a conventional ETT. The ETT cuff was inflated with air and the ETT cuff pressure was set initially at 20 cmH2O using a calibrated cuff manometer. ETT cuff pressure and distance from carina to ETT tip were measured at supine and semi-Fowler positions with neck extension. RESULTS After the position change, the ETT tip migrated cephalad and cuff pressure increased in the majority of cases.

Given that the share of food consumption expenditure to total expenditure is higher in the lower income groups of Bangladesh, this shock is expected to directly affect affordability of consumption of basic food items of these households. Using nationally representative household survey data of Bangladesh, and while following the Feasible Generalized Least Square method, this paper attempts to examine food poverty, food consumption inequality along with vulnerability to food poverty of households and explores the importance of different socio-demographic and environmental factors in this connection. Our estimation reflects that, greater percentage of households with young children or with elderly people are found to suffer high food vulnerability. In addition, households in environmentally endangered regions e.g. drought prone areas or river erosion affected places are more food vulnerable than those in other parts of the country. Certain occupation groups e.g. day labourer and self-employed are found to be highly vulnerable to food poverty while according to our decomposition analysis of food consumption inequality, area of residence (urban vs. rural) is expected to cause sizable inequality in food consumption. This study can therefore, help in identifying food vulnerable households for governments social protection programs and COVID-19 incentive packages, and thereby can contribute towards designing effective poverty reduction strategies.","output":"Assessing Food Poverty, Vulnerability and Food Consumption Inequality in the Context of COVID-19: A Case of Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk perception and consequently engagement in behaviors to avoid illness often do not match actual risk of infection, morbidity, and mortality. Unrealistic optimism occurs when individuals falsely believe that their personal outcomes will be more favorable than others' in the same risk category. Natural selection could favor overconfidence if its benefits, such as psychological resilience, outweigh its costs. However, just because optimism biases may have offered fitness advantages in our evolutionary past does not mean that they are always optimal. The current project examined relationships among personal risk for severe COVID-19, risk perceptions, and preventative behaviors. We predicted that those with higher risk of severe COVID-19 would exhibit unrealistic optimism and behave in ways inconsistent with their elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical risk scores for severe COVID-19 were calculated and compared with COVID-19 threat appraisal, compliance with shelter-in-place orders (March 13CMay 22, 2020) and travel restrictions, compliance with public health recommendations, and potential covariates like self-rated knowledge about COVID-19 in a robust dataset including 492 participants from McLennan County, TX, USA. While those with high clinical risk acknowledged their greater likelihood of experiencing severe illness if infected, they actually reported lower perceived likelihood of becoming infected in the first place. While it is possible that those with higher clinical risk scores truly are less likely to become infected, the pattern and significance of these results held after controlling for possible occupational exposure, household size, and other factors related to infection probability. Higher clinical risk also predicted more recent travel within Texas and lower distress during the pandemic (i.e., feeling less stressed, depressed, and helpless). Additional behavioral data suggested that those with higher clinical risk scores did not generally behave differently than those with lower scores during the shelter-in-place order. While unrealistic optimism may provide some short-term psychological benefits, it could be dangerous due to improper assessment of hazardous situations; inferring that optimism bias has evolutionary origins does not mean that unrealistic optimism is optimal in every situation. This may be especially true when individuals face novel sources (or scales) of risk, such as a global pandemic.","output":"Unrealistic Optimism and Risk for COVID-19 Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical features and outcome of patients treated at a specialized hospital for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

At the same time, health professionals have been turning to this resource for access to data that is needed for the delivery of health care and for clinical research. There is little doubt that the EHR has made both of these functions easier than earlier days when we relied on paper-based clinical records. Coupled with modern database and data warehouse systems, high-speed networks, and the ability to share clinical data with others are large number of challenges that arguably limit the optimal use of the EHR OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to provide an exhaustive reference for those who use the EHR in clinical and research contexts, but also for health information systems professionals as they design, implement, and maintain EHR systems.

Next, a hybrid k-means based clustering method that reflects the integration of the cardinal distance and ordinal distance is presented to divide large-scale experts into several clusters. After measuring the consensus of clusters, including both the cardinal consensus and ordinal consensus, they are analyzed by a cardinal-ordinal consensus plot, and the clusters are classified into four categories based on the cardinal consensus threshold and ordinal consensus threshold. Then, by introducing the comprehensive consensus threshold, four consensus control rules are developed to control the consensus reaching process (CRP), and the clusters are subdivided into six categories. For clusters in different categories under different consensus control rules, a specific multi-stage hybrid feedback mechanism is proposed to improve the consensus. In addition, an objective method for the determination of the ordinal consensus threshold is presented.

In this report, we examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a social media-based DSME intervention in low-income older Chinese immigrants with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: This was a single-group study in 30 Chinese immigrants with T2D living in NYC. The intervention included 24 culturally and linguistically tailored DSME videos. Over 12 weeks, participants received 2 brief videos each week via WeChat, a free social media app popular among Chinese immigrants. Feasibility was defined as ability to achieve: 1) the recruitment goal (n=30);2) >80% retention;and 3) >80% watch rate. Acceptability was assessed via a satisfaction survey at 6 months. HbA1c was collected at baseline and 6 months Results: Recruitment was completed prior to the NYC COVID-19 lockdown. Despite COVID-19, the intervention continued without interruption. Participants were mostly female (70.0%), married (63.3%), with limited English proficiency (86.7%), and a mean age of 61.2 (SD=6.7) years old. Most reported an annual household income of < $25,000 (84.0%) and an education of high school or less (63.3%). Thirty participants were recruited within 2 months, 93.3% were retained at 6 months, and a video watch rate of 92.2% was achieved. The mean baseline HbA1c was 7.4% (SD=1.2) and declined by 0.6% (95% CI: 0.3%-0.9%, p=0.001) to 6.8% (SD=0.8) at 6 months. Participants expressed high satisfaction (96.4%), and all strongly agreed or agreed that they preferred this video-based DSME to face-to-face visits.

As the role of asymptomatic infection in respiratory virus transmission is still largely unknown and rates of asymptomatic shedding are not well constrained, it is important to obtain more-precise estimates through alternative sampling methods. We actively recruited participants from among visitors to a New York City tourist attraction. Nasopharyngeal swabs, demographics, and survey information on symptoms, medical history, and recent travel were obtained from 2,685 adults over two seasonal arms. We used multiplex PCR to test swab specimens for a selection of common respiratory viruses. A total of 6.2% of samples (168 individuals) tested positive for at least one virus, with 5.6% testing positive in the summer arm and 7.0% testing positive in the winter arm. Of these, 85 (50.6%) were positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 65 (38.7%) for coronavirus (CoV), and 18 (10.2%) for other viruses (including adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus). Depending on the definition of symptomatic infection, 65% to 97% of infections were classified as asymptomatic. The best-fit model for prediction of positivity across all viruses included a symptom severity score, Hispanic ethnicity data, and age category, though there were slight differences across the seasonal arms. Though having symptoms is predictive of virus positivity, there are high levels of asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding among the members of an ambulatory population in New York City. IMPORTANCE Respiratory viruses are common in human populations, causing significant levels of morbidity. Understanding the distribution of these viruses is critical for designing control methods. However, most data available are from medical records and thus predominantly represent symptomatic infections. Estimates for asymptomatic prevalence are sparse and span a broad range. In this study, we aimed to measure more precisely the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic in a general, ambulatory adult population. We recruited participants from a New York City tourist attraction and administered nasal swabs, testing them for adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. At recruitment, participants completed surveys on demographics and symptomology. Analysis of these data indicated that over 6% of participants tested positive for shedding of respiratory virus.

Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which was recently identified in piglets in southern China, is an alphacoronavirus that originates from the same genus of horseshoe bats as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and that was reported to be capable of infecting cells from a broad range of species, suggesting a considerable potential for interspecies transmission. Given the importance of the coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein in host range determination and viral entry, we report a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the SADS-CoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation at a 3.55-? resolution. Our structure reveals that the SADS-CoV S trimer assumes an intrasubunit quaternary packing mode in which the S1 subunit N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and the S1 subunit C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of the same protomer pack together by facing each other in the lying-down state. SADS-CoV S has several distinctive structural features that may facilitate immune escape, such as a relatively compact architecture of the S trimer and epitope masking by glycan shielding. Comparison of SADS-CoV S with the spike proteins of the other coronavirus genera suggested that the structural features of SADS-CoV S are evolutionarily related to those of the spike proteins of the other genera rather than to the spike protein of a typical alphacoronavirus. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationship between spike glycoproteins of SADS-CoV and those of other coronaviruses and extend our understanding of their structural and functional diversity.IMPORTANCE In this article, we report the atomic-resolution prefusion structure of the spike protein from swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). SADS-CoV is a pathogenic alphacoronavirus that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs and that was reported to be capable of interspecies transmission. We describe the overall structure of the SADS-CoV spike protein and conducted a detailed analysis of its main structural elements. Our results and analyses are consistent with those of previous phylogenetic studies and suggest that the SADS-CoV spike protein is evolutionarily related to the spike proteins of betacoronaviruses, with a strong similarity in S1-NTDs and a marked divergence in S1-CTDs. Moreover, we discuss the possible immune evasion strategies used by the SADS-CoV spike protein. Our study provides insights into the structure and immune evasion strategies of the SADS-CoV spike protein and broadens the understanding of the evolutionary relationships between coronavirus spike proteins of different genera.","output":"Cryo-electron Microscopy Structure of the Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein Provides Insights into Evolution of Unique Coronavirus Spike Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused rapid mass infection worldwide.

To mitigate this problem, we propose a boosted CNN architecture and a novel data augmentation method called Random Center Cropping (RCC). Different from traditional image cropping methods only suitable for resolution images in large scale, RCC not only enlarges the scale of datasets but also preserves the resolution and the center area of images. In addition, the downsampling scale of the network is diminished to be more suitable for small resolution images. Furthermore, we introduce attention and feature fusion mechanisms to enhance the semantic information of image features extracted by CNN. Experiments illustrate that our methods significantly boost performance of fundamental CNN architectures, where the best-performed method achieves an accuracy of 97.96%  0.03% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.68%  0.01% in Rectified Patch Camelyon (RPCam) datasets, respectively. ABSTRACT: (1) Purpose: To improve the capability of EfficientNet, including developing a cropping method called Random Center Cropping (RCC) to retain the original image resolution and significant features on the images center area, reducing the downsampling scale of EfficientNet to facilitate the small resolution images of RPCam datasets, and integrating attention and Feature Fusion (FF) mechanisms with EfficientNet to obtain features containing rich semantic information. (2) Methods: We adopt the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. (3) Results: Experiments illustrate that our methods significantly boost performance of basic CNN architectures, where the best-performed method achieves an accuracy of 97.96%  0.03% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.68%  0.01% on RPCam datasets, respectively. (4) Conclusions: (1) To our limited knowledge, we are the only study to explore the power of EfficientNet on Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) classification, and elaborate experiments are conducted to compare the performance of EfficientNet with other state-of-the-art CNN models. It might provide inspiration for researchers who are interested in image-based diagnosis using Deep Learning (DL). (2) We design a novel data augmentation method named RCC to promote the data enrichment of small resolution datasets. (3) All of our four technological improvements boost the performance of the original EfficientNet.","output":"Boosted EfficientNet: Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Breast Cancer Using Convolutional Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although 0.8 mg/kg is considered a lethal dose of colchicine, fatal cases of patients who followed a critical disease course after an intake below this lethal dose have been reported.

To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID 19 death surveillance. Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID 19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead. Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020. Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID 19 death counts and mortality surveillance.

METHODS Patients with complex cerebral arteriovenous malformations seen in our neurosurgery department from January 2016 to December 2017 were prospectively enrolled. The hybrid surgery protocol included \\"angiographic diagnosis, surgical resection, and intraoperative angiographic evaluation\\" and \\"angiographic diagnosis and embolization, surgical resection, and intraoperative angiographic evaluation\\". The patients were randomly stratified into intensive care group and routine care group. After surgery, intensive or routine care was provided, and the prognosis of patients was evaluated, with a subsequent comparative analysis. RESULTS A total of 109 cases were divided into the routine nursing group (n = 54 cases) and intensive nursing group (n = 55 cases). There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline data before surgery. Postoperative lung infection in the intensive nursing group was significantly less frequent than those in the routine nursing group (5.5% vs. 18.5%, P=0.039) with pulmonary infection and lower extremity venous thrombosis (5.5% vs. 24.1%, P=0.006). The average hospital stay in the intensive nursing group was 14.4  5.78 days, which was significantly lower than that in the routine nursing group (19.3  6.38 days, P=0.013). At 3 months' follow-up after surgery, the Generic Quality of Life Inventory-74 (GQOLI-74) dimension score and GQOLI-74 total score in the enhanced group were significantly better than those in the routine nursing group (P=0.017 and 0.023, respectively).

PCT use in pediatric hospitals is relatively unknown. We aimed to evaluate PCT and CRP use, describe PCT testing variability across children's hospitals, and compare temporal rates of PCT and CRP testing for patients admitted with pneumonia, sepsis, or fever in young infants. METHODS: In this multicenter cohort study, we identified children 18 years old hospitalized from 2014-2018 with pneumonia, sepsis, or fever in infants <2 months by using the Pediatric Health Information System. To determine use, we evaluated the proportion of encounters with PCT or CRP testing from 2017-2018. We generated heat maps to describe PCT use across hospitals. We also compared PCT and CRP rates over time from 2014 to 2018. RESULTS: From 2017-2018, PCT testing occurred in 3988 of 34c231 (12%) hospitalizations. Febrile infants had the highest PCT testing proportion (18%), followed by sepsis (15%) and pneumonia (9%). There was across-hospital variability in PCT testing, particularly for febrile infants. Over time, the odds of PCT testing increased at a significantly greater rate than that of CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited guideline recommendations for PCT testing during the study period, PCT use increased over time with across-hospital variability. For pneumonia and sepsis, given the importance of high-value care, we need to understand the impact of PCT on patient outcomes. With recent guidelines recommending PCT in the evaluation of febrile infants, we identified baseline testing behaviors for future studies on guideline impact.","output":"Procalcitonin Use: Variation Across Hospitals and Trends Over Time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper deals with the issue of increasing the efficiency of business management using modern management methods and tools in tourism enterprises.

One strategy to overcome these issues is utilizing telemedicine, which is recently made possible technologically by the advancement of internet speed, high speed zooming cameras, and the information storages. In Taiwan, the telemedicine is granted legally by the amendment for Taiwan's Physician Act in 2018. METHODS: Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Kaohsiung CGMH) is the first hospital in Taiwan to provide the telemedicine service connecting to Cheng Kung Branch of Taitung Hospital since Nov 2018. Consultation services from Dermatology, ENT, and Ophthalmology have been delivered in the live-interactive and face to face module every week. RESULTS: Dermatology consultation comprises the majorities. In the first year, there were totally 426 dermatology consultation services. Eczema, fungal infections, and scabies infestation were the three most common diseases in the beginning. The disease diagnosis became more diverse after several months, including some ready-to-treat diseases pending correct diagnosis, such as pediculosis, psoriasis, and urticaria. Coupled with dermoscopic images, diseases such as hair loss, pediculosis capitis, skin tumor, and scabies, were diagnosed promptly. The subjective patient improvement rate was more than 75% year-round and the case closure rate was more than 85% year-round.

KSDom designs a data collector to collect a large number of DNS traffic data and rich external DNS-related data, then employs K-means and SMOTE method to handle the imbalanced data. Finally, KSDom uses Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) algorithm to identify malicious domains.

Actor Partner Interdependence Models in Mplus with demographic covariates tested whether parent and adolescent perceived social isolation (2 items from the UCLA Loneliness Scale) were associated with each persons self-reported health. Most dyads included a mother (38% motherCdaughter, 36% motherCson). Most parents were non-Hispanic White (69%), married/partnered (77%), and reported household income below $100,000 (79%). Both social isolation and self-reported health were significantly correlated between parents and their adolescent children (Pearson correlation = .38 for isolation, .32 for health). There were negative associations between parent isolation and parent health, adolescent isolation and adolescent health, and parent isolation and adolescent health (all ps < .05), but no association between adolescent isolation and parent health. The finding that parents social isolation was linked to lower self-reported health not only for themselves but also for their adolescent children highlights the importance of addressing social isolation in clinical social work practice.

Nurses in intensive care units are among the medical staff who have a close interaction with dying patients. Studies have shown that psychological interventions are very helpful in improving thinking about death and its problems. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction on mortality awareness and interpersonal problems among intensive care unit nurses in southeastern Iran. Materials and methods: This was a Quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design in southeast of Iran in 2021. Nurses were selected using the convenience sampling method and divided into intervention (n = 32) and control (n = 35) groups using the block randomization method. The intervention group received a two-hour Inquiry- Based Stress Reduction counseling session every week for 6 weeks. Data were gathered using Multidimensional Mortality Awareness Measure and Inventory of Interpersonal Problems before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the intervention. IBM SPSS Statistics software version 25 was used for data analysis. Results: In the intervention group, the mean scores of Mortality Awareness before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the intervention were 130.41 +/- 5.91, 164.47 +/- 8.66, and 163.91 +/- 9.29, respectively. Therefore, in the intervention group, the increase of Mortality Awareness mean score was statistically significant (P < 0.001). In the control group, the mean scores of Mortality Awareness before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after intervention were 129.63 +/- 5.59, 135.26 +/- 11.14, and 132.66 +/- 5.62, respectively. Difference between the two groups was significant (P < 0.001). The results also showed that in the intervention group the mean scores of Interpersonal Problems immediately after and 6 weeks after the intervention were lower than before the intervention (P < 0.001). In the control group, Interpersonal Problems increased over time (P < 0.001). Accordingly, the difference between the two groups in terms of Interpersonal Problems during the study was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

In this study from Luxembourg, the genetic diversity and epidemiology of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses shed by the bat species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Myotis emarginatus were evaluated. Feces collection (n = 624) was performed longitudinally in a mixed-species colony in 2015 and 2016. In addition, feces (n = 254) were collected cross-sectionally from six Myotis emarginatus colonies in 2016. By use of degenerate primers in a nested format, overall prevalences of 1.1% (10/878) and 4.9% (43/878) were determined for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein genes of coronaviruses, as well as sequences of the partial L gene of paramyxoviruses, were obtained. Novel paramyxovirus and Alphacoronavirus strains were identified in different Myotis emarginatus colonies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related Betacoronavirus strains were shed by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum Logistic regression revealed that the level of Alphacoronavirus shedding was highest in July (odds ratio, 2.8; P < 0.01), probably due to periparturient stress. Phylogenetic analyses point to close virus-host coevolution, and the high genetic similarity of the study strains suggests that the Myotis emarginatus colonies in Luxembourg are socially connected. Most interestingly, we show that bats also host Betacoronavirus1 strains. The high similarity of the spike gene sequences of these viruses with mammalian Betacoronavirus 1 strains may be of concern. Both the SARS-related and Betacoronavirus 1 strains detected in bats in Luxembourg may cross the species barrier after a host adaptation process.IMPORTANCE Bats are a natural reservoir of a number of zoonotic pathogens. Several severe outbreaks in humans (e.g., a Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and the almost global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003) have been caused by bat-borne viruses that were transmitted to humans mostly after virus adaptation (e.g., in intermediate animal hosts). Despite the indigenousness of bat species that host viruses with suspected zoonotic potential and despite the zoonotic transmission of European bat 1 lyssavirus in Luxembourg, knowledge about the diversity and epidemiology of bat viruses remains limited in this country. Moreover, in contrast to other European countries, bat viruses are currently not included in the national surveillance activities of this land-locked country. We suggest that this gap in disease surveillance should be addressed, since we show here that synanthropic bats host viruses that may be able to cross the species barrier.","output":"Novel Alphacoronaviruses and Paramyxoviruses Cocirculate with Type 1 and Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS)-Related Betacoronaviruses in Synanthropic Bats of Luxembourg."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role and importance of solidarity for effective health provision is the subject of lengthy and heated debate which has been thrown into even sharper relief by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using VSV-based pseudovirus, we found that sera from individuals vaccinated by two doses of inactivated whole-virion vaccines (BBIBP-CorV) showed very weak to no neutralization activity, while a homologous inactivated vaccine booster or a heterologous booster with protein subunit vaccine (ZF2001) markedly improved the neutralization titers against all Omicron variants. The comparison between sub-lineages indicated that BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3 had comparable or even greater antibody resistance than BA.1. We further evaluated the neutralization profile of a panel of 20 mAbs, including 10 already authorized or approved, against these Omicron sub-lineages as well as viruses with different Omicron spike single or combined mutations. Most mAbs lost their neutralizing activity completely or substantially, while some demonstrated distinct neutralization patterns among Omicron sub-lineages, reflecting their antigenic difference.

We examined the mental health impact of reduced working in a nationally representative sample of employees. METHOD We used Wave one (April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) COVID-19 study, with linkage to baseline mental health data from the UKHLS annual survey (January 2017- December 2018). Analysis was based on adults aged 18-65 who were employees in January/February 2020 (n=8,708), with psychological distress assessed using the GHQ-12. Logistic regression examined the mental health impact of reduced working and reasons for the reduction. RESULTS Forty two percent of employees reported reduced working by April 2020, with 22% furloughed. There was no evidence of an association between reduced working per se and psychological distress in the fully adjusted model (OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.91-1.23). Those permanently laid-off (less than 1% of employees) were most vulnerable to adverse mental health effects in the early months of the pandemic (OR=3.60, 95%CI 1.55-8.37). We also found evidence of higher levels of psychological distress among those sick or self-isolating, and those with reduced working due to caring responsibilities. LIMITATIONS While the GHQ is a widely used and validated instrument in identifying potential psychiatric disorders, it is important to note that it does not represent a clinical assessment. CONCLUSIONS Longitudinal examination of employment transitions and mental ill-health related to pandemic outcomes is imperative and should help inform public health responses and ongoing government policy in supporting those adversely affected.","output":"The impact of reduced working on mental health in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the understanding society COVID-19 study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited empirical evidence exists about the extent to which the current HIV epidemic intersects with COVID-19 infections at the area/geographic level.

METHODS: We conducted our clinical study in a real-world practice setting with longitudinal follow-up of the study cohort. We included adult patients with symptomatic paroxysmal and persistent AF eligible for sotalol for rhythm control strategy and who had CIEDs in our study. Patients with a known contraindication to sotalol were excluded. After making a shared management decision with patients, sotalol was initiated as an outpatient, with regular clinical encounters with patients to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment, and monitoring cardiac rhythm and QTc intervals with CIEDs utilizing their remote monitoring platforms.

We collected and analyzed the putative effect of the 16 most common co-morbidities, previous treatment with 33 drug classes, symptoms, radiological, and laboratory findings at admission and drug therapy after admission. Predictors of long hospital stays were older age (P = 0.002), low oxygen saturation (P = 0.001) and bilateral radiological findings at admission (P = 0.023). Predictors of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission were the previous use of calcium-channel blockers (P = 0.005), proton pump inhibitors (P = 0.017), low oxygen saturation (P = 0.002), high leukocyte count (P = 0.011), and high D-dimer values (P = 0.005).

If we initially memorize a face only with a normalized size and viewed from directly head on, the direct comparison between the one-sized memory and a new incoming image would demand tremendous mental frame translations in 7D. How can we perform such a demanding task so promptly and reliably as we experience the objects in the world around us? Intriguingly, our primary visual cortex exhibits a 2D retinotopy with a log-polar coordinate system, where scaling up/down of shape is converted to linear frame translation. As a result, mental scaling can be performed by linearly translating the memory or the perceptual image until they overlap with each other. According to our new model of NHT (Neural Holography Tomography), alpha brainwaves traveling at a constant speed can conduct this linear translation. With this scheme, every scaling up/down by a factor of two should take the same amount of extra mental time to recognize a smaller/larger face. To test this hypothesis, we designed a reaction time (RT) experiment, where participants were first asked to memorize sets of unfamiliar faces with a given specific size (4 or 8). Following the memorization phase, similar stimuli with a wide range of sizes (from 1 to 32) were presented, and RTs were recorded. As predicted, the increase in RT was proportional to the scaling factor in the log scale. Furthermore, we observed that RTs were fastest for 8 faces even if the memorized face was 4. This supports our hypothesis that we always memorize faces at the exact size of ~8 . To our surprise, the increases in RT were also consistent with the mentally-estimated depth sensation, which indicates that the apparent size of the recognized face can create a proper depth sensation.","output":"Visual Perception of 3D Space and Shape in Time - Part III 2D Shape Recognition by Log-Scaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Incubation of primary culture of pulmonary fibroblasts with non-opiate analogue of leuenkephalin (NALE; Phe-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg, 0.1 M) reduced generation of superoxide anion-radical (by 20.7%) and decreased the number of p53(+) cells (by 40.2%) induced by exposure to H(2)O(2) (60 M).

We developed a deep learning-based segmentation model that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in order to accurately segment the lung and lesions. By considering the images from publicly available datasets, we also realized a training set composed of 32 CT scans and a validation set of 10 CT scans. The results obtained from the segmentation task are promising, allowing to reach a Dice coefficient higher than 97%, posing the basis for analysis concerning the assessment of PTE onset. We characterized the segmented region in order to individuate radiomic features that can be useful for the prognosis of PTE. Out of 919 extracted radiomic features, we found that 109 present different distributions according to the MannCWhitney U test with corrected p-values less than 0.01. Lastly, nine uncorrelated features were retained that can be exploited to realize a prognostic signature.","output":"Lung Segmentation and Characterization in COVID-19 Patients for Assessing Pulmonary Thromboembolism: An Approach Based on Deep Learning and Radiomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The agent that causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), produces a spectrum of symptoms that mainly affect the respiratory system, the central nervous system (CNS), the regulation of hemostasis and the immune system. Bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) is a condition of unknown incidence among infected patients, either because it is short-lived or because of the difficulty in establishing a direct cause to the virus. Viral infection has been described in the literature as a cause of BVFP and there is the suspicion that a proportion of the idiopathic cases are due to undiagnosed viral infections. Although the neurotropic mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear, there is strong evidence to ensure its neuroinvasive potential. The most frequent etiologies of BVFP are trauma, neoplasm, and neurological, but a viral origin should not be ruled out. Causality between COVID-19 and BVFP is plausible and will require further study in the short and long term. We present a case series that support and discuss the hypothesis under consideration.

BACKGROUND: Little research has been published about the experiences of nurse managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of front-line nurses have been well documented. This is the first phenomenological study to date in the United States on experiences of hospital nurse managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Phenomenological qualitative approach. METHODS: Thirteen managers, seven nurse managers and six assistant nurse managers were interviewed about their experiences using audio-video teleconferencing and a semi-structured interview guide. Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research criteria for reporting qualitative research were used. RESULTS: The four major themes that emerged were as follows: being there for everyone; leadership challenges; struggles, support and coping; and strengthening my role. There were 11 subthemes. CONCLUSIONS: A major focus of nurse managers during the pandemic was psychosocial support of front-line nurses while at the same time experiencing stress and exhaustion themselves. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: More attention on the psychosocial needs of nurse managers, interventions to allay their exhaustion and provisions for readily available support are warranted.","output":"A Phenomenological Study of Nurse Managers' and Assistant Nurse Managers' Experiences during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China, and was later reported to have spread throughout the world to create a global pandemic. As of August 18th, 2020, the coronavirus had spread to more than 216 countries with at least 21,756,357 confirmed cases, resulting in 771,635 deaths globally. Several countries declared this pandemic as a national emergency, forcing millions of people to go into lockdown. This unexpected imposed social isolation has caused enormous disruption of daily routines for the global community, especially children. Among the measures intended to reduce the spread of the virus, most schools closed, canceled classes, and moved it to home-based or online learning to encourage and adhere to social distancing guidelines. Education and learnings of 67.6% of students are impacted globally due to coronavirus in 143 countries. The transition away from physical classes has significantly disrupted the lives of students and their families, posing a potential risk to the mental well-being of children. An abrupt change in the learning environment and limited social interactions and activities posed an unusual situation for children's developing brains. It is essential and obligatory for the scientific community and healthcare workers to assess and analyze the psychological impact caused by the coronavirus pandemic on children and adolescents, as several mental health disorders begin during childhood. Countries across the globe, including the United States, are in the dilemma of determining appropriate strategies for children to minimize the psychological impact of coronavirus.

AKI is a strong predictor of mortality. Routine urinalysis gives an insight into the renal pathology of the patient. We studied the incidence of urinary abnormalities in hospitalised Covid-19 patients and analysed their impact on development of AKI and mortality. METHODS: Information on 110 hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19 was retrospectively collected and analysed. The demographic data such as age, gender, comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, the need for dialysis and laboratory data such as urine for albumin, glucose, RBC and WBC, and serum creatinine were collected. The diagnosis of AKI was based on the KDIGO criteria. The outcomes studied were development of AKI and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Urine abnormalities were seen in 71% of the patients. Proteinuria in 58.2%, haematuria in 17.3%, pyuria in 8.2% of patients and concurrent proteinuria and haematuria was seen in 13.6% of patients. AKI was seen in 28.2% of patients and hospital mortality was 24.5%. AKI was strongly associated with mortality. Proteinuria and haematuria were good predictors of development of AKI, more strongly when they occurred concurrently (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that urine analysis is a simple test, which can be used to predict development of AKI and mortality and may be used for risk stratification of Covid-19 patients, especially in low resource settings.","output":"Urine abnormalities predict acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients: An analysis of 110 cases in Chennai, South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forced vital capacity (FVC) is an essential respiratory measurement for assessment and monitoring of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

We aimed to compare the mortality rates in COVID-19 patients who received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) and those who did not. In this retrospective cohort study, mortality was considered as the main outcome measure. All underlying diseases were assessed by the chronic use of medications related to each condition. We defined two main groups based on the ACEIs/ARBs administration. A logistic regression model was designed to define independent predictors of mortality as well as a Cox regression analysis. In total, 2553 patients were included in this study. The mortality frequency was higher in patients with a history of underlying diseases (22.4% vs 12.7%, P value < 0.001). The mortality rate in patients who received ACEIs/ARBs were higher than non-receivers (29.3% vs. 19.5%, P value = 0.013, OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.7) in the univariate analysis. However, the use of ACEIs/ARBs was a protective factor against mortality in the model when adjusted for underlying conditions, length of stay, age, gender, and ICU admission (P value < 0.001, OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3, 0.7). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed an overall survival of approximately 85.7% after a 120-day follow-up.

Hypertension is one of the risk factors associated with increased mortality and morbidity with Covid-19 infection. Few studies have looked into the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals (HCPs). However not much is known about its impact on physical health and blood pressure of HCPs.Objective is to to Study the distribution of blood pressure and impact of Covid 19 on blood pressure of HCPs. Design and method: Prospective cross-sectional survey Methods: The study was conducted among Indian HCPs. A self administered survey asked about the socio demographic data, known risk factors, past history of hypertension, working conditions in lockdown (work from home or working at a healthcare establishment with potential to exposure to Covid-19), work hours and blood pressure measurement for three consecutive days during lockdown. Results: Six Hundred and eighty seven HCPs (52.8% doctors, 25.1% nurses & paramedics, 22.1 allied HCPs), 63.78% males and 36.22% females, mean age 34.8% (SD=11.5 years) participated in the study. 14.4% (98) had known hypertension while 28.8% (198) were found to be hypertensive for the first time (50% Doctors, 26.26% Nurses/Paramedics and 23.74% Allied Healthcare Professionals). 79.3% (n=198) of these had normal blood pressure when checked in the past 12 months. 76.26% (n=198) of these were directly at risk of exposure to Covid-19. The pandemic has seriously impacted the mental and psychological health of HCPs. Our study highlights that Covid 19 pandemic significantly impacts the blood pressure of HCPs with an alarming rise in risk for their health. Conclusions: Health care professionals developed hypertension in significantly higher numbers during COVID-19 pandemic. While working on the frontline with COVID-19, they are already on higher risk of getting infection. COVID-19 has been found to have serious complications with hypertension. Apart from this hypertension itself is known to lead adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Unfortunately, the majority of them are not aware of their elevated blood pressure.

We present our experience with H1N1-associated ARDS and successful bridging of lung function using superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) in combination with continuous positive airway pressure/assisted spontaneous breathing (CPAP/ASB). METHODS: We admitted five patients with H1N1 infection and ARDS to our intensive care unit. Although all patients required pure oxygen and controlled ventilation, oxygenation was insufficient. We applied SHFJV/CPAP/ASB to improve oxygenation. RESULTS: Initial PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio prior SHFJV was 58-79 mmHg. In all patients, successful oxygenation was achieved by SHFJV (PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio 105-306 mmHg within 24 h). Spontaneous breathing was set during first hours after admission. SHFJV could be stopped after 39, 40, 72, 100, or 240 h. Concomitant pulmonary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection was observed in all patients. Two patients were successfully discharged.

General Practitioners (GPs) played an important role in controlling the epidemic, and GP trainees also took an active part in this approach. This study was to explore Chinese GP trainees career perspectives after COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative research study which included 12 GP trainees from three teaching hospitals in China. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted. Grounded theory and thematic analysis were used to code the data and identify categories and factors. RESULTS: Eleven participants chose to continue a GP career after COVID-19, and nearly half of the participants strengthened their determination to dedicate themselves to this career. Only one participant decided to change the career choice because of interest in another specialty. Four main themes influencing GP trainees perceptions of career development after COVID-19 emerged from the interviews: changes of GPs work content in COVID-19, challenges of being a GP, psychological changes of the career, how to provide better primary care. Although some negative psychological changes existed, most of participants were inspired by role models and medical colleagues. They had more in-depth understanding of GPs role and responsibility during COVID-19, and exhibited intensions for self-improvement in career development, especially in public health education and self-protection in preventing infectious diseases. In addition, the wide use of telemedicine provided a new work way for GP trainees. However, challenges, such as increased workloads, low income, lack of resources in primary medical institutions, and distrust of GPs are faced by trainees during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no substantial changes were seen in the career choice of GP trainees after COVID-19 outbreak. However, they were inspired and had an in-depth understanding about the GPs work and responsibility during an epidemic. Owing to the challenges faced by the GPs, measures are needed to improve the GP education and work environment in the training phase.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. RESULTS: We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on the analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of \\"alerts\\" that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBank's submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Since March 2020, VADR has also been used to check SARS-CoV-2 sequence submissions. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally. CONCLUSION: VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allow researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.","output":"VADR: validation and annotation of virus sequence submissions to GenBank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is fuming at SARS-CoV-2 for being the culprit for causing the devastating COVID-19, claiming millions of lives across the globe in the form of respiratory disorders.

Design/methodology/approach The authors tested their hypotheses in a mediation model using a sample of nurses surveyed at three timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings As hypothesized, harmonious passion indirectly decreased disengagement and exhaustion by decreasing job stress. Contrary to authors' hypotheses, obsessive passion also indirectly decreased (rather than increased, as hypothesized) both disengagement and exhaustion by decreasing job stress. Harmonious, but not obsessive, passion, was significantly negatively directly related to disengagement and exhaustion. Research limitations/implications Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have impacted nurses' work environments and their willingness to respond. Originality/value This study extends conservation of resources theory to conceptualize harmonious and obsessive passion as resources with differing outcomes based on their contrasting identity internalization, per the Dualistic Model of Passion. This study also operationalizes burnout more comprehensively by including cognitive and physical exhaustion along with emotional exhaustion, as well as disengagement.

Following the development of immunity against HAd5, we immunized animals via the i.n. or i.m. route of inoculation with a HAd vector (HAd-HA-NP) expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus. The immunogenicity and protection results suggest that low levels of vector immunity (<520 virus-neutralization titer) induced by priming mice with up to 10(7) plaque forming units (p.f.u.) of HAd-WT did not adversely impact the protective efficacy of the vaccine. Furthermore, high levels of vector immunity (approximately 1500 virus-neutralization titer) induced by priming mice with 10(8) p.f.u. of HAd-WT were overcome by either increasing the vaccine dose or using alternate routes of vaccination. A further increase in the priming dose to 10(9) p.f.u. allowed only partial protection.

Inappropriate health-seeking behaviours contribute to adverse outcomes, and community engagement is key in driving behavioural change. WHO has highlighted East Africa as a geographical area of concern for snakebite envenoming. The overall aim of the project is to develop a community engagement toolkit for snakebite envenoming and other NTDs. The objective of this scoping review was to identify current practices in recent community engagement in rural East Africa; the applicability of these results to snakebite envenoming are discussed. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched from 1 January 2017 to 3 September 2020. Search terms were used to identify publications which related to rural communities and health or disease, for both humans and animals. After reviewing the full papers for all geographical areas, 112 publications were included, 30 of which were conducted in East Africa. Papers included nine different countries and covered a broad range of health topics; notably, water, sanitation and hygiene, nutrition, and maternal and child health. Only one publication considered animal health. The most common form of engagement was in the context of a group meeting, lecture, presentation, discussion or question and answer session (63.3%). A variety of locations within the community were used to engage with people, the most common being an individual's household (23.3%). Communication factors was the key influencer for engagement, both positively and negatively. Key barriers to engagement include local languages and health beliefs, literacy levels, mobile phone ownership and the level of mobile Internet coverage, burden of agricultural work and weather conditions. This study provides an extensive overview of recent public health community engagement in East Africa, which will serve as a useful resource for any group seeking to plan an intervention in remote and rural areas in East Africa.

However, the exact incidence of venous thromboembolic event is unknown in anticoagulated, severe COVID\\\\19 patients. OBJECTIVES: Systematic assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) using complete duplex ultrasound (CDU) in anticoagulated COVID\\\\19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study in 2 French intensive care units (ICU) where CDU is performed as a standard of care. A CDU from thigh to ankle at selected sites with Doppler waveforms and images was performed early during ICU stay in patients admitted with COVID\\\\19. Anticoagulation dose was left to the discretion of the treating physician based on the individual risk of thrombosis. Patients were classified as treated with prophylactic anticoagulation or therapeutic anticoagulation. Pulmonary embolism was systematically searched in patients with persistent hypoxemia or secondary deterioration. RESULTS: From March 19 to April 11, 2020, 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID\\\\19 were screened for VTE. Eight patients (31%) were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas 18 patients (69%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. The overall rate of VTE in patients was 69%. The proportion of VTE was significantly higher in patients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation when compared with the other group (100% vs 56%, respectively, P = .03). Surprisingly, we found a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID\\\\19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56% of VTE and 6 pulmonary embolisms.

We tested the same swabbing systems on metal (aluminum, brass, and stainless steel) and plastic substrates in a regularly touched environment to simulate the non-deliberate transfer of touch evidence likely seen in a casework scenario, to ascertain the performance of these swabs in an uncontrolled situation. Higher amounts of touch DNA were recovered with Isohelix? swabs (0.5 C 3.3 ng) compared to Rayon swabs (0.13 C 1.2 ng). The Isohelix? swabbing system was found to significantly recover more touch DNA (p = 0.04) from the metal substrates than the Rayon swabbing system, consistent with the findings of our previous work. The results contribute to our understanding of the impact of sample collection techniques on touch DNA recovery from problematic metal surfaces and suggest that supplemental cleaning of substrates as a precautionary step against the spread of infections may affect touch DNA persistence and the recovery efficiency of swabs.

On the contrary, immuno-compromised patients are prone to progress into severe or critical types underpinned by the entanglement of an overexuberant proinflammatory response and injured immune function. Therefore, well-coordinated innate and adaptive immune systems are pivotal to viral eradication and tissue repair. An in-depth understanding of the immunological processes underlying COVID-19 could facilitate rapidly identifying and choosing optimal immunotherapy for patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: A total of 2,455 post-PCI patients who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at the Peking University Third Hospital from January 2016 to September 2019 were retrospectively included in this study; 1,449 post-PCI patients from January 2018 to September 2019 were assigned as the development cohort; and 1,006 post-PCI patients from January 2016 to December 2017 were assigned as the validation cohort. Clinical data of patients before testing and various indicators in the exercise assessment were collected. CPET-related cardiovascular events were also collected, including new-onset angina pectoris, frequent premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, and bundle branch block during the examination. A nomogram model for predicting CPET-related cardiovascular events was further developed and validated. RESULTS: In the development cohort, the mean age of 1,449 post-PCI patients was 60.7  10.1 years. CPET-related cardiovascular events occurred in 43 cases (2.9%) without fatal events. CPET-related cardiovascular events were independently associated with age, glycosylated hemoglobin, systolic velocity of mitral annulus, VO(2)/WR slope inflection, and VE/VCO(2) slope > 30. The C-index of the nomogram model for predicting CPET-related cardiovascular events was 0.830, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.764C0.896). For the validation cohort of 1,006 patients, the area under the ROC curve was 0.807 (95% CI: 0.737C0.877). CONCLUSION: Post-PCI patients with older age, unsatisfactory blood glucose control, impaired left ventricular systolic function, oxygen uptake parameter trajectory inflection, and poor ventilation efficiency have a higher risk of cardiovascular events in exercise assessment.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this historical cohort study involving 9948 men, we investigated the influence of the presence of FLD and the grades of alcohol consumption on incident type 2 diabetes using Cox proportional hazards models. We categorized the participants into the following four groups: none or minimal alcohol consumption, <40 g/week; light, 40-140 g/week; moderate, 140-280 g/week; or heavy alcohol consumption, >280 g/week. FLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. RESULTS During the median 6.0-year follow-up, 568 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Heavy alcohol consumers with FLD showed a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes compared with the other groups. Moderate alcohol consumers without FLD had a significantly higher risk for developing incident type 2 diabetes, compared with none or minimal and light alcohol consumers without FLD. In contrast, there was no apparent difference in the risk for incident type 2 diabetes between none or minimal, light, and moderate alcohol consumers with FLD. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk for incident type 2 diabetes between a moderate and heavy alcohol consumer without FLD and a none or minimal, light, and moderate alcohol consumer with FLD.
