Numerous studies documented its benefits, whereas several more recent studies did not prove superiority of HFOV over protective conventional mechanical ventilation (CV). One of the accepted explanations is that CV and HFOV act differently, including gas exchange. METHODS: To investigate a different level of coupling or decoupling between oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination during CV and HFOV, we conducted a prospective crossover animal study in 11 healthy pigs. In each animal, we found a normocapnic tidal volume (V(T)) after the lung recruitment maneuver. Then, V(T) was repeatedly changed over a wide range while keeping constant the levels of PEEP during CV and mean airway pressure during HFOV. Arterial partial pressures of oxygen (P(a)O(2)) and carbon dioxide (P(a)CO(2)) were recorded. The same procedure was repeated for CV and HFOV in random order. RESULTS: Changes in P(a)CO(2) intentionally induced by adjustment of V(T) affected oxygenation more significantly during HFOV than during CV. Increasing V(T) above its normocapnic value during HFOV caused a significant improvement in oxygenation, whereas improvement in oxygenation during CV hyperventilation was limited. Any decrease in V(T) during HFOV caused a rapid worsening of oxygenation compared to CV. CONCLUSION: A change in P(a)CO(2) induced by the manipulation of tidal volume inevitably brings with it a change in oxygenation, while this effect on oxygenation is significantly greater in HFOV compared to CV.","output":"Tidal volume significantly affects oxygenation in healthy pigs during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation compared to conventional ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in precautionary measures by governments worldwide to contain the spread of the virus. However, the degree of compliance toward personal precautionary measures has varied, despite the urgent need to contain the pandemic. This study aimed to assess the level of compliance toward personal protective precautions during and after the lockdown among residents of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 1,108 residents using an online survey to collect sociodemographic data, compliance with personal protective measures, and other factors during and after the lockdown. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) was used for data analysis. Results: During the lockdown, 35.5% of respondents were very compliant, whereas 30.1% were less compliant. Additionally, compliance levels in those who depended on official sites as their primary source of information were significantly higher than those who depended on their family, friends, and social media. Approximately 39.76% of those who were very compliant intended on getting vaccinated against COVID-19, while 28% of those with high compliance did not intend on getting vaccinated. Further, compliance levels were high in participants who were not in direct contact with COVID-19 cases as well. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of maintaining the level of compliance toward personal precautionary measures against COVID-19 even after lockdown release to prevent further waves. This study showed that compliance toward personal protective measures was high for those who did not have direct contact with COVID-19 positive people after lockdown, those planning for inoculation, and those insuring applications of precautionary measures by their children. Additionally, higher compliance was noted in participants who sought information from official sites.","output":"Compliance Toward Protective Precautions During and After the Lockdown Among Citizens of Riyadh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) has become an established technique within the domain of acute care surgery. As minimally invasive management of SBO becomes more widely accepted, there is increased need for reporting of outcomes. OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes of laparoscopic versus open surgery for adhesive SBO. METHODS Patients undergoing surgery for adhesive SBO at our institution between 2005 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was overall complication rate, while secondary outcomes included operative time, gastrointestinal (GI) function, and postoperative length of stay (LOS). Univariable analysis compared laparoscopic (including conversions) and open groups with regard to patient baseline and perioperative characteristics as well as outcomes of interest. Multivariable analysis was performed comparing the endpoint of overall complications between groups. Sensitivity analysis excluding patients who underwent bowel resection was performed to assess effect on outcomes. Factors associated with laparoscopic success, as well as impact of conversion to open on postoperative outcomes, are reported. RESULTS A cohort of 269 patients with adhesive SBO was identified: 186 patients (69.1%) underwent open surgery, 83 (30.9%) were managed laparoscopically. Within the laparoscopy group, 32 (38.6%) underwent conversion to open. Operative time was similar between groups (P = 0.506), while laparoscopy was associated with quicker recovery of GI function indicated by removal of nasogastric tube (P = 0.031) and passage of flatus (P = 0.005). Postoperative LOS was shorter (5 vs. 7 days, P = 0.031) with laparoscopy. The overall complication rate was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (27.7 vs. 43.6%, P = 0.014), with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for overall complications of 0.37 (P = 0.002). Following exclusion of bowel resections, secondary outcomes continued to favor laparoscopy, while reduction in overall complications trended toward significance, OR 0.47 (P = 0.050).

In Liberia, where the health system is being rebuilt following protracted civil wars and an Ebola virus disease outbreak, the Resilient and Responsive Health System (RRHS) is assisting with quality HIV services delivery through support from PEPFAR and HRSA but gaps remain across the cascade of care from diagnosis to viral load suppression. OBJECTIVE: To highlight gaps in HIV service delivery in Liberia, identify opportunities and offer recommendations for improving the quality of service delivery. METHODS: A narrative review of relevant literature was conducted following a search of all local and online databases known to the authors. FINDINGS: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed the HIV response in Liberia by averting deaths, improving quality of life, and preventing new HIV infections but critical gaps remain. These include weak HIV prevention and testing strategies; suboptimal ART initiation and retention in care; low viral load testing volumes, commodity supply chain disruptions and a HIV workforce built on non-physician healthcare workers. In the context of the prevailing socioeconomic, heath system and programmatic challenges, these will impact achievement of the UNAIDS targets of 95-95-95 by 2030 and ending the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Combination prevention approaches are necessary to reach the most at risk populations, while a robust health workforce operating through facilities and communities will be needed to reach people with undiagnosed HIV earlier to provide efficient and effective services to ensure that people know their HIV status, receive and sustain ART to achieve viral suppression to maintain a long and healthy life within the framework of overall health system strengthening, achieving universal health coverage and the sustainable development goal.","output":"Gaps and Opportunities in HIV Service Delivery in High Volume HIV Care Centers in Liberia: Lessons From the Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in unprecedented job losses in the United States, disrupting health insurance coverage for millions of people.

Much remains unknown about detailed symptomatic features of COVID-19 onset and rehabilitation. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 932 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan were enrolled, including 52 severe cases and 880 non-severe cases. The symptomatic features were analyzed and compared between the severe and non-severe groups. All patients were followed up 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: Of the 932 patients, fever (60%), cough (50.8%), and fatigue (36.4%) were the most common symptoms, followed by anorexia (21.8%) and dyspnea (19.2%). The median duration of fever was 7 days, which was characterized by persistent low fever. The median duration of cough was 17 days, characterized by dry cough without sputum. Most dyspnea occurred on the fourth day after illness onset, with a median duration of 16 days. The incidences of taste loss and olfactory disturbance were only 6.2% and 3.1%, respectively. After adjusting age and gender, multivariate regression analysis showed that fever lasting for more than 5 days (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.00-3.62, P = 0.0498), anorexia at onset (2.61, 1.26-5.40, P = 0.0096), and modified Medical Research Council level above grade 2 when dyspnea occurred (14.19, 7.01-28.71, P < 0.0001) were symptomatic risk factors for severe COVID-19. Through follow-up, cough (6.2%), dyspnea (7.2%), fatigue (1.8%), olfactory and taste disorders (1.5%) were the significant remaining symptoms.

However, the spread of the Covid-19 virus pushed the widespread uptake of telemedicine across Australia, including in metropolitan regions. This qualitative study will explore the medical oncology (MO) patient and clinician experience of telemedicine in a metropolitan setting as a result of Covid-19. Method: Participants were selected and invited to participate by theoretical sampling from MO clinicians and patients attending MO clinics at Prince of Wales Hospital. Data was collected by in-depth semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was performed to analyse the interview data. Transcripts were coded using the grounded theory approach to identify overarching themes. Results: : Twelve participants were recruited to the study. Most participants viewed the adoption of telemedicine positively because it was considered as convenient, efficient and could be used in order to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Nonetheless, participants complained about the poor implementation of telemedicine, technical difficulties and lack of proper training. Finally, providers expressed mixed views over the lack of personal interaction and the lack of physical examination from telemedicine. However, both clinicians and patients viewed telemedicine as acceptable to be used in the context of routine follow-ups.

Methods A comprehensive literature search identified papers assessing the role of CE on the choice of the route selection for DBE. Data on CE, criteria for route selection, and DBE success parameters were retrieved and analyzed according to the PRISMA statement. Risk of bias was assessed through the STROBE assessment. The primary outcome evaluated was DBE success rate in reaching a SB lesion, measured as the ratio of positive initial DBE to the number of total DBE. Results Seven studies including 262 CEs requiring subsequent DBE were selected. Six studies used time-based indices and one used the PillCam Progress indicator. SB lesions were identified and insertion route was selected according to a specific cut-off, using fixed landmarks for defining SB transit except for one study in which the mouth-cecum transit was considered. DBE success rate was high in all studies, ranging from 78.3 % to 100 %. Six of seven studies were high quality. Conclusions The precise localization of SB lesions remains an open issue, and larger studies are required to determine the most accurate index for selecting the DBE insertion route.

Several recently published studies emphasize the potential efficacy of mRNA vaccines in treating different types of malignant and infectious diseases where conventional vaccine strategies and platforms fail to elicit protective immune responses. mRNA vaccines have lately raised high interest as potent vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Direct application of mRNA or its electroporation into dendritic cells was shown to induce polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ mediated antigen-specific T cell responses as well as the production of protective antibodies with the ability to eliminate transformed or infected cells. More importantly, the vaccine composition may include two or more mRNAs coding for different proteins or long peptides. This enables the induction of polyclonal immune responses against a broad variety of epitopes within the encoded antigens that are presented on various MHC complexes, thus avoiding the restriction to a certain HLA molecule or possible immune escape due to antigen-loss. The development and design of mRNA therapies was recently boosted by several critical innovations including the development of technologies for the production and delivery of high quality and stable mRNA. Several technical obstacles such as stability, delivery and immunogenicity were addressed in the past and gradually solved in the recent years.

With the progress of so-called a?servicificationa? in the Chinese economy, the influence of Chinese domestic growth on Korean economic growth has decreased to some extent, but the Chinese domestic market still remains important to Korea. On the other hand, as the conflict between the United States and China intensifies in various fields, it has become difficult for Korea to openly publicize strategic economic cooperation or cooperation projects with China as before, as it must balance its traditional focus on the US from a security standpoint and on China in economic aspects. In particular, the Biden administration will further systematize anti-China solidarity centered on allies, and in response to this, China's willingness to cooperate with neighboring countries is expected to grow. In the meantime, there is a concern that the scope of Korea's operations in the area of foreign cooperation will further narrow. In this situation, Korea needs to promote economic cooperation with China, centered on regional cooperation, that can minimize the impact of unstable global governance. This is because it will be possible to promote cooperation at each regional level even in the midst of the US-China conflict, and this form of cooperation is much more flexible and practically accessible than cooperation between countries. Companies and associations in the US and Japan are maintaining and expanding cooperation with local governments, including participation in Chinese local government projects, even in the face of poor relations between their countries and China. Deciding that the conflict with the US would be prolonged regardless of the results of the US presidential election, in October 2020 China proposed the strategy of a?Dual Circulationa? as a key economic policy direction up to 2035. This is a mid- to long-term strategy to increase economic independence by expanding the industrial and supply chains in the region and improving the efficiency of economic cycles in the face of increasing external uncertainty. As China is emphasizing the elimination of inefficiencies in domestic demand during the period of the 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP), when the Dual Circulation strategy will be implemented in earnest, China's regional economic and industrial cooperation is expected to become more active than before. Accordingly, participation in the domestic market through expanding economic cooperation with the Chinese region will become more important. As such, although the development of China's domestic market is expected to intensify and our demand for cooperation in the regional domestic market is expected to further expand, most of the existing studies on the Chinese domestic market mainly analyze the consumption and import markets. Recognizing this gap, this study expanded the scope of analysis of the domestic m rket in China to the entire domestic final demand, and analyzed inter-regional trade relations and other economic relations based on the Inter-Regional Input Output analysis. This study analyzed the domestic market in China from various angles. First, an in-depth analysis of China's long-term domestic demand expansion policy was conducted, and changes in the regional structure of the domestic market were analyzed through the Inter-Regional Input Output analysis, which has rarely been attempted in analyses of the Chinese domestic market. In addition, the changes in the regional structure of the Chinese import market and Korea's competitiveness were analyzed using Chinese trade statistics. In particular, by synthesizing the changes after the global financial crisis, a turning point in China's economic structure, we project future changes in the regional structure of China, which emphasizes independence in the domestic economy. In addition, in the era of US-China conflict, the study aimed to select regional markets meaningful to Korea, and to present strategic directions toward China focusing on regional cooperation and approaches into the domestic market. Chapter 2 analyzes the changes in China's economic structure after the global financial crisis in terms of industrial structure, trade structure, and competition structure in the Chinese import market. Chapter 3 analyzes changes in China's strategy to expand domestic demand by period and region, and reviews the directions of the 14th FYP and mid- to long-term strategies in the area of domestic market policy. China has maintained rapid growth by participating in global value chains based on its low factor costs and export-led strategy after reform and opening, as a result of which its trade dependence climbed to 60% in the mid-2000s. However, following the 2008 global financial crisis the Chinese economy reinforced strategies to expand domestic demand. Immediately after the global financial crisis, domestic demand was boosted mainly by infrastructure investment, but with the advent of the New Normal era accompanied by structural changes in the economy, consumption-oriented policies to expand domestic demand have gained strength. Since then, the domestic policy has shifted toward qualitative improvement while promoting restructuring to improve economic inefficiencies and imbalances caused by excessive investments. However, facing an unprecedented decline in the growth rate due to the COVID-19 shock, the strategy to expand domestic demand is gaining momentum again, and the 14th FYP looks to promote domestic demand expansion in a new direction that combines the quantitative expansion of domestic demand and qualitative enhancement strategies at the same time. By region, the eastern region has accounted for a vast majority of China's domestic demand over the past 20 years and maintains a significant position in the consumption sector. On the other hand, in the investment sector, the status of the western region has elevated mostly due to infrastructure investment and the central region based on manufacturing investment. These changes are closely related to China's regional balanced development policy. The central and western regions have been utilized as strategic areas for investment expansion, and the eastern regions as leading regions of qualitative growth such as high-tech industries and service industries. Even during the period of the 14th FYP, it is predicted that the strategy of having the eastern region lead the digitalization and a?smartizationa? of the economy will continue. In Chapter 4, based on China's inter-regional input output table, changes in the regional structure of the Chinese domestic market were analyzed through changes in domestic items and industry structure, changes in the share of imports inherent in domestic import demand, and changes in trade relations between regions. In particular, trade relations between regions were examined in terms of trade in products, movement of imported intermediate goods between regions, and trade based on value-added (TiVA). Following the global financial crisis (GFC), domestic demand in China expanded, centered on investment demand in the central and western regions. In addition, the proportion of imported goods in China's inherent in domestic demand decreased, mainly due to the decrease in the proportion of imported intermediate goods. Just as domestic demand expanded mainly for investment, imports for investment exceeded that for consumption, but imports of final goods for consumption showed the highest growth rate in the post-GFC period. The share of trade between regions in China decreased to about 29% compared to pre-GFC levels, signifying that the share of regions satisfying final demand with their own products has increased. After the GFC, the production inducement effect on each region's final demand increased for its own region and decreased for other regions. This means that just as the dependence on domestic demand of countries around the world increased compared to trade dependence after the GFC, the dependence on regional demand between Chinese regions also increased. In the process of decreasing the share of trade between regions after the GFC, the share of output from the midwest region in particular increased and the share of input from Huadong and Huanan areas decreased. This is mainly related to the increase in investment demand in the Chinese Midwest and the contraction of production activities in Huanan and Huadong, where GVC participation is high. Inter-regional trade moves the imported intermediate goods embedded in the trade products to other regions. When we identified the import base of intermediate goods based on the region from which intermediate goods were directly imported, the proportion of the eastern region exceeded 80%. Compared to the eastern region's proportion of imported intermediate goods embedded in domestic demand of about 70%, intermediate goods imported from the eastern region are be produced to the midwest region through regional production activities. This means that in Korea's export of intermediate goods to China, it is necessary to pay more attention to the changes in the base regions for importing intermediate goods than the changes in final demand in each region. Lastly, the characteristics of interregional value-added trade (TiVA) show that the Midwest has a large input of value-added, but the scale of output is even larger, resulting in a negative net input. This is mainly due to differences in trade items. Based on its production networks, the eastern region mainly accounted for production in the manufacturing industry and high-end service industry-related items sent to the midwest region, while the midwest region mainly produced subsistence resource-related items in the areas of mining, agriculture, forestry and fishery, food and beverage manufacturing.This resulted in an increase in added value-added net input in the eastern region. In other words, domestic demand expanded after the GFC, centered on the investment demand in the midwest region, but added value net input increased in the eastern region and decreased in the Midwest.

However, this approach has indirectly caused, only in Lima- Peru, more than 23 million Peruvians to lose their jobs. As a result, the risk of food insecurity may have increased in affected low-income families, especially those that depend on daily income. This study estimates the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity (MSFI) and identifies the associated factors that explain this outcome during the stay-at-home order. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey, with the non-probability sample, was conducted between May 18 and June 30, 2020, during the stay-at-home order in Peru. We used social media advertisements on Facebook to reach 18-59 year-olds living in Peru. MSFI was assessed using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Rasch model methodology requirements were considered, and factors associated with MSFI were selected using a stepwise forward selection. A Poisson generalized linear model (Poisson GLMs), with log link function, was employed to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR). FINDINGS: This analysis is based on 1846 replies. The prevalence of MSFI was 232%, and FIES proved to be an acceptable instrument with reliability 072 and infit 08-13. People more likely to experience MSFI were those with low income (less than 255 US$/month) in the pre-pandemic period (aPR 377; 95%CI, 198-716), those whose income was significantly reduced during the pandemic period (aPR 227; 95%CI, 155-331), and those whose savings ran out in less than 21 days (aPR 186; 95%CI, 143-242). Likewise, heads of households (aPR 120; 95%CI, 100-144) and those with relatives with probable SARS-CoV2 cases (aPR 129; 95%CI, 105-158) were at an increased risk of MSFI. Additionally, those who perceived losing weight during the pandemic (aPR 121; 95%CI, 101-145), and reported increases in processed foods prices (aPR 131; 95%CI, 108-159), and eating less minimally processed food (aPR 182; 95%CI, 148-224) were also more likely to experience MSFI. INTERPRETATION: People most at risk of MSFI were those in a critical economic situation before and during the pandemic period. It is necessary to reinforce social protection policies to prevent or mitigate these adverse effects.

An experimental study was designed, consisting of two random groups with a post-intervention measurement in which the experimental group (EG) received standardized instructions, and the control group (CG) received intuitive or non-standardized instructions, in a public area simulated scenario. Statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.0001) between the EG and the CG for variables: time needed to give orders, pauses between chest compressions and ventilations, depth, overall score, chest compression score, and chest recoil. The average depth of the EG was 51.1 mm (SD 7.94) and 42.2 mm (SD 12.04) for the CG. The chest recoil median was 86.32% (IQR 62.36, 98.87) for the EG, and 58.3% (IQR 27.46, 84.33) in the CG. The use of a sequence of simple, short and specific orders, together with observation-based learning makes possible the execution of chest compression maneuvers that are very similar to those performed by rescuers, and allows the teaching of the basic notions of ventilation. The structured order method was shown to be an on-site learning opportunity when faced with the need to maintain high-quality CPR in the presence of an expert resuscitator until the arrival of emergency services.","output":"Relief Alternatives during Resuscitation: Instructions to Teach Bystanders.

To further investigate the potential epigenetic inheritance of childhood asthma induced by perinatal nicotine exposure, we profiled both large and small RNAs in the sperm of F1 male rats. Our data revealed that perinatal exposure to nicotine leads to alterations in the profiles of sperm-borne RNAs, including mRNAs and small RNAs, and that rosiglitazone, a PPAR agonist, can attenuate the effect of nicotine and reverse the sperm-borne RNA profiles of F1 male rats to close to placebo control levels.","output":"Perinatal Exposure to Nicotine Alters Sperm RNA Profiles in Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic led authorities all over the world to imposing travel restrictions both on a national and on an international scale. Understanding the effect of such restrictions requires analysis of the role of commuting and calls for a metapopulation modeling that incorporates both local, intra-community infection and population exchange between different locations. Standard metapopulation models are formulated as markovian processes, and as such they do not label individuals according to their original location. However, commuting from home to work and backwards (reverse commuting) is the main pattern of transportation. Thus, it is important to be able to accurately model the effect of commuting on epidemic spreading. In this study we develop a methodology for modeling bidirectional commuting of individuals, without keeping track of each individual separately and with no need of proliferation of number of compartments beyond those defined by the epidemiologic model. We demonstrate the method using a city map of the state of Israel. The presented algorithm does not require any special computation resources and it may serve as a basis for intervention strategy examination in various levels of complication and resolution. We show how to incorporate an epidemiological model into a metapopulation commuting scheme while preserving the internal logic of the epidemiological modeling.

When people are physically isolated and distant from each other, technology may play a fundamental role by enabling social connection and reducing feelings of loneliness caused by this prolonged social isolation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health services worldwide have had to shift their routine face-to-face outpatient appointments to remote telepsychiatry encounters. The increased pressure on mental health services highlights the importance of community-led health-promotion interventions, which can contribute to preventing mental illness or their relapses, and to reduce the burden on health services. Patients with psychosis are particularly socially isolated, have sedentary lifestyles, and commonly face stigma and discrimination from the general population. At the same time, patients with psychosis value technology, are interested in, use and own smart-phones to digitally connect, and are satisfied with their use. Thus, among psychosocial interventions, a helpful resource may be Phone Pal, a complex intervention which facilitates remote communication between volunteers and socially isolated patients with psychosis through different smart-phone tools. While Phone Pal has been originally developed for people with psychosis, it may also be useful to the wider population, helping to overcome the social isolation caused by physical distancing, particularly in these times of widespread isolation. Phone Pal may be a potential public health resource for society, providing important support to those that may need it the most, and possibly benefit most from it.","output":"Can social isolation caused by physical distance in people with psychosis be overcome through a Phone Pal?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 requires unprecedented mobilization of the health systems to prevent the rapid spread of this unique virus, which spreads via respiratory droplet and causes respiratory disease There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify many infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of the patients This article aims as an outcome of review of the evidence on viral load and its virulence of SARS-CoV2,so that it will help in further understanding the fact useful for investigating and managing the COVID-19 cases A search of available evidence was conducted in pub-med COVID-19 viral load and virulence and its associated characters world-wide and Google Scholar to capture the most recently published articles The WHO and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database of publications on novel coronavirus were also screened for relevant publications Abstracts of 55 articles were screened by two authors and 15 were included in this study based on the inclusion criteria SARS-coV2, the causative agent of COVID-19 falls under the coronavirus family but it has higher infectivity compared to SARS and MERS with higher reproduction numbers(Ro) Virulence has been found to be different throughout the world,however lower compared to SARS and MERS,till date The most common clinical features have been found to be cough and fever RT C PCR remains the most sensitive and specific method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 although it is time consuming, costly and requires highly skilled human resources Hence, newer modalities like RT-LAMP can be alternative for point of care diagnosis as this is both cost effective and requires less skilled human resources Despite recent advances in disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes using latest technological advances in molecular biology, the global pandemic COVID-19 remains a major headache for governments across the world due to limited testing capacity and lack of appropriate treatment and vaccine","output":"Virology, clinical features and diagnosis of covid 19: Review analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health messaging about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) sometimes conveys the problem as an epidemic.

In this study, we have taken a docking-based virtual screening approach to select natural molecules (from plants) with possible therapeutic potential. For this purpose, AUTODOCK Vina-based determination of binding affinity values (blind and active-site oriented) was obtained to short-list molecules with possible inhibitory potential against the main Mpro in SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID 6Y2F -the monomeric form). The 4 molecules selected were Chebuloside (?8.2; ?8.2), Acetoside (?8.0; ?8.0), Corilagin (?8.1; ?7.7) and Arjunolic Acid (?8.0; ?7.6) (blind and active-site oriented docking scores (Kcal/mol) in parenthesis, respectively). Further, a comparative search, with FDA-approved drugs, has shown that Ouabain was comparable to Chebuloside with a similarity score of 0.227.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in which 34 international neurological associations were asked to distribute the survey to national associations. The responses represented the national situation, in November-December 2020, with regard to the main disrupted neurological services, reasons and the mitigation strategies implemented as well as the disruption on training of residents and on neurological research. A comparison with the situation in February-April 2020, first pandemic wave, was also requested. FINDINGS: 54 completed surveys came from 43 countries covering all the 6 WHO regions. Overall, neurological services disruption was reported as mild by 26%, moderate by 30%, complete by 13% of associations. The most affected services were cross-sectoral neurological services (57%) and neurorehabilitation (56%). The second wave of the pandemic, however, was associated with the improvement of service provision for diagnostics services (44%) and for neurorehabilitation (41%).

It is unclear whether e-cigarette users will switch to disposable vaping products with a variety of kids-appealing flavours available. METHODS We performed piece-wise regression and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithms to compare the relative search volume (RSV) of JUUL and Puff Bar (a disposable vaping product) using the 1-year Google Trends data from 24 February 2019 to 20 February 2020, separated by three events that may have spurred changes in RSV for each product. RESULTS The RSV for JUUL was relatively stable before Trump Administration announced plans to ban flavoured e-cigarettes. After that, the RSV for JUUL dropped sharply (rate of change=-8.8 per week) from 11 September 2019 to 17 October 2019 when JUUL Labs announced to halt online sales of some flavoured products, and the RSV resumed the decreasing trend after FDA announced enforcement policy of cartridge-based e-cigarettes on 2 January 2020. In comparison, the RSV for Puff Bar started to increase after 11 September 2019 with a low rate of change (0.6) until 17 October 2019. After that, the increase in RSV for Puff Bar accelerated. The RSV of puff bars surpassed that of JUUL during the week of 2 February 2020.

Evidence suggests that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities experience disparities in healthcare access and utilisation. This disparity was evident early in the pandemic when discussions arose regarding the potential exclusion of this population to critical care. Methods: An anonymous online survey will be conducted with caregivers, both family members and paid staff, to explore their perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 in terms of demographics, living arrangements, access to services, social distancing, and carer wellbeing. The survey will be developed by the research team, many of whom are experts in intellectual disability within their own jurisdictions. Using back-translation our team will translate the survey for distribution in 18 countries worldwide for international comparison. The survey team have extensive personal and professional networks and will promote the survey widely on social media with the support of local disability and advocacy agencies. Statistical descriptive and comparative analyses will be conducted. Ethical approval has been obtained for this study from University College Dublin's Human Research Ethics Committee (HS-20-28-Linehan).

The increasing number of critically ill patients and deaths have fueled a desperate search for treatments that can halt the course of the disease. Currently, there are several experimental therapies with demonstrated in vitro activity against COVID-19 used in clinical practice, including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, and convalescent plasma; however, to date no agent has proven efficacy against COVID-19. In the case of convalescent plasma, this therapy consists in obtaining neutralizing antibodies from previously infected individuals by plasmapheresis and administering them to patients with severe disease. Recently, the use of convalescent plasma has shown promising results in preliminary studies, with case series reporting a decrease in temperature, and viral load, as well as improvement in clinical parameters among patients receiving this treatment. However, there are still unmet needs regarding the safety profile, tolerability, dosage, and timing this therapy should be given. Based on this, the objective of our study was to develop and propose a practical approach for the compassionate use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, given the constrains and limitations of developing countries. We encourage health professionals in developing countries to use the current evidence and approaches to experimental treatments for patients with COVID-19, adapting them to their conditions, and always based on a thorough risk-benefit evaluation for each patient, and whenever possible to design and promote the much needed research in this field.","output":"A practical approach for the compassionate use of convalescent plasma in patients with severe COVID-19 in developing countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purulent pericardial effusions are rare and represent the most severe form of bacterial pericarditis.

METHODS: We conducted individual semi-structured interviews of child and adolescent psychiatrists (n = 24) practicing in the United States. Participants were selected as a diverse purposive sample of active members of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP). We analyzed anonymized transcripts through iterative coding using thematic analysis aided by NVivo software. RESULTS: We identified three main thematic domains within participants response to the pandemic, which have engendered a reevaluation of and a recommitment to the aims of each clinician and the field of CAP more broadly. These domains, paired with representative questions, include: (1) Unsettling, or who have we been? (identifying discontents such as daily inefficiencies and intraprofessional loss of trust); (2) Adaptation, or who are we now? (exploring affordances and limitations of virtual work, and the evolution of personal and professional identity); and (3) Reimagination, or who will we become? (renewing a commitment to psychiatry as advocacy). Even as we identified a collective agreement toward the need for implementing change, just what needs to change, and how that change will be realized, remain contested. CONCLUSION: These three thematic domains, augmented by a national confrontation with race and equity, have engendered a field-wide reckoning with known inequities. They have reinvigorated collective responses and calls to action. The divergent mindsets to change and leadership have provided an aperture for what values and practices the field might instill in its next generation of practitioners.

However, the virus' pathogenesis remains unclear, and there is no cure for the disease. We investigated the dynamic changes of blood immune response in patients with COVID-19 at different stages by using 5' gene expression, T cell receptor (TCR), and B cell receptors (BCR) V(D)J transcriptome analysis at a single-cell resolution. We obtained single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 341,420 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 185,430 clonotypic T cells and 28,802 clonotypic B cells from 25 samples of 16 patients with COVID-19 for dynamic studies. In addition, we used three control samples. We found expansion of dendritic cells (DCs), CD14+ monocytes, and megakaryocytes progenitor cells (MP)/platelets and a reduction of na?ve CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19, along with a significant decrease of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells (NKs) in patients in critical condition. The type I interferon (IFN-I), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and ferroptosis pathways were activated while the disease was active, and recovered gradually after patient conditions improved. Consistent with this finding, the mRNA level of IFN-I signal-induced gene IFI27 was significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 compared with that of the controls in a validation cohort that included 38 patients and 35 controls. The concentration of interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;) in the serum of patients with COVID-19 increased significantly compared with that of the controls in an additional cohort of 215 patients with COVID-19 and 106 controls, further suggesting the important role of the IFN-I pathway in the immune response of COVID-19.

Patients were divided into low IL-6/LY group and high IL-6/LY group based on the cutoff value with 2.50. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high-value group (IL-6/LY2.50) had a greater risk of poor prognosis (P<0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that IL-6/LY was the independent risk predictor for in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=3.404, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.090-10.633, P=0.035) and MODS development (HR, 4.143; 95%CI, 1.321-12.986, P=0.015).

This study assesses utilization of a negative PCT (&lt;0.25 ng/ml) to guide antibiotic discontinuation in patients with pneumonia in a community hospital. Methods:Retrospective observational study including adult patients admitted to our community hospital in 1 year (July 2019-June 2020) with diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia and started on empiric antibiotic therapy and had procalcitonin levels checked. Our hypothesis was that PCT is not being appropriately used for discontinuation of antibiotics and that rate of discontinuation of antibiotics will be less despite a negative PCT. Statistical analysis was performed using XLSTAT. Categorical variables were represented by frequencies and proportions and compared using Chi-square and z test for two proportions. Results: 516 charts were reviewed. After excluding missing data, 176 patients were included. 100 patients had negative PCT. Antibiotics were discontinued in 16% of patients with negative PCT, compared to 58% (p&lt;0.0001), in whom antibiotics were continued without any other indication (including UTI, severe COPD exacerbation, COVID pneumonia) despite a negative PCT. The difference between the percentage of antibiotic discontinuation in our PCT guided treatment sample (9%, n=16/176) was also found to be statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001) compared to percentage of antibiotic discontinuation in population using data from a meta-analysis of 7 RCTs (42%, n=698/1658).1 Conclusion:Previous studies have shown that procalcitonin guided treatment aids in decreasing antibiotic exposure. In lower respiratory tract infections, clinicians order PCT test to aid in differentiating viral versus bacterial etiology and ultimately help guide antibiotic therapy. Our data analysis reveals that despite negative PCT, thus indicating a likely viral etiology, clinicians are not consistently making changes to empiric antibiotic use. This study addresses need for further recommendations from antibiotic stewardship programs regarding procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use and prevent unnecessary ordering of PCT test.","output":"Utilization of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic discontinuation in respiratory tract infections in a community hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The Bronx has the highest prevalence of asthma in the United States (US), and was also an early COVID-19 epicenter, making it a unique study location. Worldwide reports describe significant declines in pediatric emergency department (PED) visits during COVID-19. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on all PED presentations, including asthma, at an early epicenter has not been studied beyond the pandemic peak and into the early phases of state re-opening. Objective To compare PED health-seeking behaviors and clinical characteristics during the 2020 pandemic and subsequent initial New York State (NYS) phased re-opening to the same period in 2019. Methods Retrospective chart review of children <21 years utilizing the PED at a high-volume quaternary children's hospital in The Bronx, NY from March 15th 2020 C July 6th 2020 (pandemic cohort) and the same interval in 2019 (comparison cohort). Visits were assigned to pre-determined diagnostic categories. Demographic and clinical data were compared. Results 19,981 visits were included. Visits declined by 66% during 2020. Proportions of asthma visits (2% vs. 7%, p < 0.0001) and minor medical problems (61% vs. 67%, p < 0.0001) had significant declines in the pandemic cohort, while major medical problems (13% vs. 8%, p < 0.0001), appendicitis (1% vs. 0.4%, p < 0.0001) and other surgical complaints (1% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.0001) had proportional increases in the pandemic cohort. No significant proportional changes were noted among psychosocial and trauma groups between the two cohorts. Conclusion The pandemic cohort experienced a substantial decrease in PED volume, but an increase in acuity and admission rates, which was sustained through the NYS phase-II re-opening. Despite being located in an asthma hub, the incidence of asthma-related PED visits declined appreciably in the pandemic cohort. Future studies examining the effects of indoor allergens in isolation on pediatric asthma are warranted.","output":"The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on asthma and pediatric emergency health-seeking behavior in the Bronx, an epicenter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the nationwide lockdown implemented by the government of Bangladesh due to the coronavirus, has led to the various changes in the overall activities and lifestyle. Most of the people began living a sedentary lifestyle, spending more time on their phone, watching television and excessive sleeping. Reduction of physical activity level had profoundly negative impact on musculoskeletal health. AIM: This study aims to investigate the impact of lockdown on musculoskeletal health, association between leisure and musculoskeletal pain during this period. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among general populations living in a specific area of Bangladesh by simple random sampling methods. A total of 230 participants both male (182) and female (48) age group between 18-60 years have participated. The study was carried out by sending the Google Form link containing demographic questionnaire, numeric pain rating scale and Nordic musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Wilcoxon sign rank t and Chi squire test was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The mean height, weight and BMI of the participants were 164.17  8.40 cm, 63.82  10.70 kg and 23.74  3.97 kg/m(2) respectively. There was significant increase in time spent in watching television (p= < 0.0001), using smartphone (p= < 0.0001) and sleeping (p= < 0.0001) during the lockdown period. 33.9% participants had pain before the lockdown which increased by 57% during the lockdown periods. There was a significant association between pain intensity and sleeping time (X(2) = 54.84; p= < 0.0001), time spent watching television (X(2) = 83.70; <0.0001), time spent on smartphone (X(2) = 58.39; <0.0001) during the lockdown period. CONCLUSION: The result of this study concluded that the lockdown has negatively impacted the musculoskeletal health of the participants. The musculoskeletal pain might be short term initially, but can develop to be a long-term problem and burden if proper measures are not taken.","output":"Impact of lockdown on musculoskeletal health due to COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh: A cross sectional survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Engagement with conventional weight management group programmes is low.

This low diagnostic yield may be improved by use of sensitive detection methods and biomarkers. METHODS The prevalence, clinical predictors and inflammatory mediator profile of respiratory viral infection in serious acute respiratory illness were investigated. Sequential bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from all patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness over 12 months (n=283) were tested for the presence of 17 respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR assay and for newly discovered respiratory viruses (bocavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses) by single-target PCR. BAL samples also underwent conventional testing (direct immunoflorescence and viral culture) for respiratory virus at the clinician's discretion. 27 inflammatory mediators were measured in a subset of the patients (n=64) using a multiplex immunoassay. RESULTS 39 respiratory viruses were detected in 37 (13.1% of total) patients by molecular testing, including rhinovirus (n=13), influenza virus (n=8), respiratory syncytial virus (n=6), human metapneumovirus (n=3), coronavirus NL63 (n=2), parainfluenza virus (n=2), adenovirus (n=1) and newly discovered viruses (n=4). Molecular methods were 3.8-fold more sensitive than conventional methods. Clinical characteristics alone were insufficient to separate patients with and without respiratory virus. The presence of respiratory virus was associated with increased levels of interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) (p<0.001) and eotaxin-1 (p=0.017) in BAL. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viruses can be found in patients with serious acute respiratory illness by use of PCR assays more frequently than previously appreciated.

Transmission causes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in poor housing conditions can be complex. An understanding of the exact mechanism of transmission can help to pinpoint contributing environmental issues. Here, we investigated a Hong Kong COVID-19 outbreak in early 2021 in four traditional Tong Lau houses with subdivided units. There are more than 80 subdivided units of less than 20 m(2) floor area each on average. With a total of 34 confirmed COVID-19 cases, the outbreak had an attack rate of 25.4%, being one of the highest attack rates observed in Hong Kong, and ranked among the highest attack rates in reported outbreaks internationally. Tracer gas leakage and decay measurements were performed in the drainage system and in the subdivided units to determine the transport of infectious aerosols by the owner-modified sophisticated wastewater drainage pipe networks and the poor ventilation conditions in some subdivided units. The results show that the outbreak was probably due to multiple transmission routes, i.e. by the drainage pipe spread of stack aerosols, which is enhanced by poor ventilation in the subdivided units.","output":"High attack rate in a Tong Lau house outbreak of COVID-19 with subdivided units in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avoidable patient harm is a major public health concern, and may already have surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared it a pandemic, with Europe becoming its new epicentre. Italy has so far been the most severely hit European country and demand for critical care in the northern region currently exceeds its supply. This raises significant ethical concerns, among which is the allocation of scarce resources. Professionals are considering the prioritisation of patients most likely to survive over those with remote chances, and this news has triggered an intense debate about the right of every individual to access healthcare. The proposed analysis suggests that the national emergency framework in which prioritisation criteria are currently enforced should not lead us to perceive scarce resources allocation as something new. From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice. Rather, it has to do with the extraordinarily high number of people who find themselves personally affected by the implications of scarce resources allocation and who suddenly realise that the principle of equals should be treated equally may no longer be applicable. Along with the need to allocate appropriate additional financial resources to support the healthcare system, and thus to mitigate the scarcity of resources, the analysis insists on the relevance of a medical ethics perspective that does not place the burden of care and choice solely on physicians.","output":"Whose life to save?

In developing countries, where there is poor infrastructure coupled with a low level of education and a high incidence of poverty, the pandemic would result in increased unemployment, decreased income for daily labor, increased food insecurity, depletion of saving and relief measures, and disrupted the marketing system, among others. Recently, some studies have been conducted in Ethiopia regarding the impact of the pandemic on the people and the country as a whole by reviewing the literature and mobile call surveys. However, those studies fail to capture the representative sample and empirical data to forward informed decisions. To this end, the present study has investigated the effect of COVID-19 on the livelihood activities of smallholder farm households in South Wollo and Oromia administrative Zones, Ethiopia. A multistage random sampling procedure was employed to draw 275 respondents out of 32,214 household heads. Data were collected through interview schedules, key informants and case studies from September to November 2020. Descriptive statistics, econometric analysis and qualitative approaches were employed to analyze the data. The major livelihood activities in the study area are crop production (97.4%), livestock rearing (77.4%), daily work (47%), small business (31.4%), livestock trading (30.7%), remittance (24.8%), labor migration (14.8%), sale of firewood (11.1%) and income from Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) (17%). The study shows that the livelihoods of 88.89% of the households were affected by the pandemic. The pandemic significantly affected and forced households to cease their livelihood activities such as daily labor (34.82%), small business trade (26.3%), livestock trading (23.7%), income from remittance (21.49%) and labor migration (11.48%). This implies that the pandemic particularly affected non-farm and off-farm livelihood diversification strategies. Therefore, the government and other rural development partners should focus on immediate and long-term intervention strategies to recover the most affected households through social security programs, creating market linkage and revolve funding mechanisms.","output":"The effects of COVID-19 on livelihoods of rural households: South Wollo and Oromia Zones, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction L?le-de-France a t lune des rgions de France les plus touches par le nouveau coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

Aim The aims of this study are to determine potential risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia, and to analyze the influencing factors of different thrombocytopenia definitions. Method This retrospective study involved patients who were administered intravenous linezolid for  1 day between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2021. Their demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Thrombocytopenia was defined as: thrombocytopenia with platelet count < 100  10(9)/L and a decrease in 25% or more from baseline of the platelet count (criterion 1); thrombocytopenia due to a platelet count drop decrease of 25% or more from baseline (criterion 2). Risk factors were determined via binary logistic regression analysis. Results This study included 320 patients. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that baseline platelet count (p < 0.001), linezolid therapy duration (p = 0.001) and shock (patients require vasoactive medications) (p = 0.019) were independent risk factors for criterion-1thrombocytopenia, while linezolid therapy duration (p < 0.001) and shock (p = 0.015) were independent risk factors for criterion-2 thrombocytopenia. There was also a significant correlation between shock and early-onset thrombocytopenia (p = 0.005 and 0.019 for criterion 1 and criterion 2, respectively). Conclusion Linezolid therapy duration and shock were common causes of different thrombocytopenia definitions; shock was correlated with early-onset thrombocytopenia.

The physician's primary responsibility in such emergencies is to the public rather than to the individual patient. In public health emergencies, physicians need to address the patient's needs and concerns, recognize their changed roles, and work closely with public health officials.

Follow-up was completed on May 30, 2020. Exposures Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, long-term medications, and ventilatory support at ICU admission. Main Outcomes and Measures Time to death in days from ICU admission to hospital discharge. The independent risk factors associated with mortality were evaluated with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Of the 3988 patients included in this cohort study, the median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR] 56-69) years; 3188 (79.9%; 95% CI, 78.7%-81.1%) were men, and 1998 of 3300 (60.5%; 95% CI, 58.9%-62.2%) had at least 1 comorbidity. At ICU admission, 2929 patients (87.3%; 95% CI, 86.1%-88.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

Psychological wellbeing is a protective variable when facing adverse circumstances, like the COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' psychological wellbeing (personal growth and purpose in life) over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-two people over 60 years old participated in a longitudinal study. Data were collected in three time points: during the lockdown on March 2020, when the lockdown finished (4 months after baseline), and during the third wave (10 months after baseline). We used latent growth curve models to assess the linear longitudinal trajectories of psychological wellbeing. RESULTS: Older adults did not show worse psychological wellbeing over time. Age has a positive impact on purpose in life. Furthermore, being a male, worrying about adverse effects of COVID-19, family functioning, resilience, personal growth, and acceptance associated with purpose in life.

The online hospital data related to the users queries are not transparent and reliable. Therefore, it is crucial to have an intelligent web chatbot that manages user requests and provides quick access to local hospital information. In this paper, we present a framework and functionality of a chatbot developed using web technologies. METHODS: The bot engine was integrated by several machine learning approaches like gradient descent (GD) and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. The trained data entered into the bot were split into mini-word batches, and the GD algorithm was applied sequentially on each mini-batch. The NLP methods involved in converting a word to its stem with a text result less readable by humans. RESULTS: The employed ML algorithms were successfully incorporated to manage the alternative synchronisation of text and voice messages.

Usually, the disease remains undiagnosed throughout the patients life, due to its frequent asymptomatic course. If symptomatic, sIgAD is connected to more frequent viral and bacterial infections of upper respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as autoimmune and allergic diseases. Interestingly, it may also be associated with other PIDs, such as IgG subclasses deficiency or specific antibodies deficiency. Rarely sIgAD can evolve to common variable immunodeficiency disease (CVID). It should also be remembered that IgA deficiency may occur in the course of other conditions or result from their treatment. It is hypothesized that allergic diseases (e.g., eczema, rhinitis, asthma) are more common in patients diagnosed with this particular PID.

Based on this premise, we have been searching for M. tuberculosis antigens specifically capable of inducing a unique subset of mycobacterium-protective (9)(2) T cells. Our screening strategy includes the identification of M. tuberculosis fractions that expand (9)(2) T cells with biological functions capable of inhibiting intracellular mycobacterial replication. Chemical treatments of M. tuberculosis whole-cell lysates (MtbWL) ruled out protein, nucleic acid, and nonpolar lipids as the M. tuberculosis antigens inducing protective (9)(2) T cells. Mild acid hydrolysis, which transforms complex carbohydrate to monomeric residues, abrogated the specific activity of M. tuberculosis whole-cell lysates, suggesting that a polysaccharide was required for biological activity. Extraction of MtbWL with chloroform-methanol-water (10:10:3) resulted in a polar lipid fraction with highly enriched specific activity; this activity was further enriched by silica gel chromatography. A combination of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of bioactive fractions indicated that 6-O-methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharides (mGLP) are predominant components present in this active fraction.

Injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) served as a model for inflammatory pain. The CFA injection decreased the thermal thresholds in both sexes but only the male mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior and diminished cognition, while the females were not affected. Increased calcium fluorescence, a marker for neuronal activity, was detected by photometry in the mPFC of males but not in females with CFA. Next, while chemogenetic inhibition of the projections from the mPFC to the LC improved the object recognition memory of males with pain, the inhibition of the mPFC to LC pathway in female mice produced anxiolysis and spatial memory deficits. The behavior results prompted us to compare the reciprocal innervation of mPFC and LC between the sexes. We used an anterograde transsynaptic tagging technique, which relies on postsynaptic cre transfer, to assess the innervation of LC by mPFC efferents. The males showed a higher rate of postsynaptic cre transfer into LC neurons from mPFC efferents than the females. And vice versa, a retrograde tracing experiment demonstrated that LC to mPFC projection neurons were more numerous in females when compared to males. In conclusion, we provide evidence that subtle differences in the reciprocal neuronal circuit between the LC and mPFC may contribute to sex differences associated with the adverse cognitive effects of inflammatory pain.","output":"The role of medial prefrontal cortex projections to locus ceruleus in mediating the sex differences in behavior in mice with inflammatory pain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Falls could be serious events in Parkinsons disease (PD). Patient remote monitoring strategies are on the raise and may be an additional aid in identifying patients who are at risk of falling. The aim of the study was to evaluate if balance and timed-up-and-go data obtained by a smartphone application during COVID-19 lockdown were able to predict falls in PD patients. METHODS: A cohort of PD patients were monitored for 4 weeks during the COVID-19 lockdown with an application measuring static balance and timed-up-and-go test. The main outcome was the occurrence of falls (UPDRS-II item 13) during the observation period. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients completed the study, and 4 (12%) reported falls in the observation period. The rate of falls was reduced with respect to patient previous falls history (24%). The stand-up time and the mediolateral sway, acquired through the application, differed between fallers and non-fallers and related to the occurrence of new falls (OR 1.7 and 1.6 respectively, p < 0.05), together with previous falling (OR 7.5, p < 0.01). In a multivariate model, the stand-up time and the history of falling independently related to the outcome (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new data on falls in Parkinsons disease during the lockdown. The reduction of falling events and the relationship with the stand-up time might suggest that a different quality of falls occurs when patient is forced to stay home  hence, clinicians should point their attention also on monitoring patients sit-to-stand body transition other than more acknowledged features based on step quality.","output":"Remote smartphone gait monitoring and fall prediction in Parkinsons disease during the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has pressured hospital-based care for children with high-risk asthma as they have become deprived of regular clinical evaluations However, COVID-19 also provided important lessons about implementing novel directions for care Personalized eHealth technology, tailored to the individual and the healthcare system, could substitute elements of hospital care and facilitate early and appropriate medical anticipation in response to imminent loss of control This perspective article discusses new approaches to the clinical, organizational, and scientific aspects of the use of eHealth technology in pediatric asthma care in times of COVID-19, as illustrated by a case report of an acute asthma exacerbation possibly caused by COVID-19 infection","output":"COVID-19: Technology-Supported Remote Assessment of Pediatric Asthma at Home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current intersection of the COVID-19 and HIV-1 pandemics, has raised concerns about the risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes particularly in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, disproportionally affected by HIV.

However, certain research applications in particular in molecular biology require incomplete denaturation of the proteins, which might cause safety issues handling contaminated samples. In this study, we evaluated lysis buffers that are commonly used in molecular biological laboratories for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. In addition, viral stability in cell culture media at 4 C and on display glass and plastic surfaces used in laboratory environment was analyzed. Furthermore, we evaluated chemical and non-chemical inactivation methods including heat inactivation, UV-C light, addition of ethanol, acetone-methanol, and PFA, which might be used as a subsequent inactivation step in the case of insufficient inactivation. We infected susceptible Caco-2 and Vero cells with pre-treated SARS-CoV-2 and determined the tissue culture infection dose 50 (TCID(50)) using crystal violet staining and microscopy.

We evaluated the assays performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10C40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence. RESULTS: Combined IgG + IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9 to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6 to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG + IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG + IgM specificity.

The combination of bioprinting and organoids with a focus on structure and function can facilitate further development of real organs.","output":"Developments and Opportunities for 3D Bioprinted Organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text]","output":"Implications of frailty interventions from Korean frailty and aging cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To document if a transient hypercoagulable state occurs in healthy dogs following abrupt cessation of unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy. DESIGN Prospective experimental pilot study. SETTING University research facility. ANIMALS Seven adult random-source male dogs. INTERVENTION Thromboelastography (TEG) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex formation were used to assess coagulation status in healthy dogs. Seven adult research dogs received 200-300 IU/kg subcutaneous UFH every 8 hours for 4 days. A final IV bolus of 100 IU/kg was given on day 4 and the peak measured heparin concentration 1 hour later is defined as the start of heparin withdrawal (time 0). Citrated whole blood samples were collected at baseline (prior to heparin administration) and 3, 6, 12, 30, and 48 hours after UFH withdrawal. At all time points, a kaolin-activated TEG was performed and citrated plasma for measurement of TAT concentration was collected for batch analysis. Fibrinogen concentration, PCV, total plasma proteins, and platelet count were measured at baseline and 48 hours after heparin withdrawal. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Compared to baseline, TAT was increased 12 hours after heparin withdrawal and returned to baseline by 30 hours. TEG clot formation time (K) was decreased 30 and 48 hours after heparin withdrawal. CONCLUSION TAT results suggest that a transient increase in thrombin generation developed 12 hours after withdrawal of UFH therapy. Though clot kinetics were rapid compared to baseline beginning 30 hours after heparin withdrawal, a return to baseline was not documented. Future studies are warranted to determine the clinical relevance of these results and to evaluate the effect of UFH withdrawal in critically ill animals.","output":"A pilot study documenting increased thrombin generation following abrupt withdrawal of heparin therapy in healthy dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on binding its spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein expresses an RGD motif, suggesting that integrins may be co-receptors. Here, we UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and fluorescently labeled the envelope membrane with octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) to explore the role of integrin activation in mediating cell entry and productive infection. We used flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to show that SARS-CoV-2(R18) particles engage basal-state integrins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mn(2+), which induces integrin extension, enhances cell entry of SARS-CoV-2(R18). We also show that one class of integrin antagonist, which binds to the I MIDAS site and stabilizes the inactive, closed conformation, selectively inhibits the engagement of SARS-CoV-2(R18) with basal state integrins, but is ineffective against Mn(2+)-activated integrins. RGD-integrin antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2(R18) binding regardless of integrin activation status. Integrins transmit signals bidirectionally: 'inside-out' signaling primes the ligand-binding function of integrins via a talin-dependent mechanism, and 'outside-in' signaling occurs downstream of integrin binding to macromolecular ligands. Outside-in signaling is mediated by G(13). Using cell-permeable peptide inhibitors of talin and G(13) binding to the cytoplasmic tail of an integrin's  subunit, we demonstrate that talin-mediated signaling is essential for productive infection.","output":"Integrin activation is an essential component of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indian consumers have predominantly been dependent on the small neighborhood store (the unorganized sector).

As of September 30, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 33 million confirmed infections and more than 1 million reported deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic data. Still, forecasters' predictions are useful for the effective allocation of healthcare resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.","output":"Nowcasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases: Foundations, trends, and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the Temporal Focus Hypothesis, people's front-back mental spaceCtime mappings are associated with their attention to the time frames of past and/or future.

METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 27 Danish patients were conducted over a period of 9 months, from February to October 2020. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis was guided by Nelly Oudshoorn's concept of technogeography of care. RESULTS: The following three themes were identified in the data: VC-home dynamics: balancing boundaries; VC-workplace dynamics: logistical considerations; and VC-body image dynamics: on-screen exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Taking human geography and science and technology studies as our analytical point of departure, we used the concept of technogeography of care and demonstrated how the reciprocal dynamics between patients choice of place and how they experience VC made boundaries fluid and complex between different contexts and places, such as the home, the workplace and the clinic. These boundaries were negotiated differently by the patients depending on their need for privacy, convenience and support.

We hypothesized that an international Grand-Rounds using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 extended reality (XR) headset would create an improved bedside-learning experience compared to traditional Grand-Rounds formats. METHODS From December 2020 to March 2021, the world's first two international mixed reality grand rounds events using the HoloLens 2 headset were held, broadcasting transatlantically (between the University of Michigan and the Imperial College of London) bedside rounding experiences on 5 complex surgical patients to an international audience of 325 faculty, residents, and medical trainees. Participants completed pre- and post-event surveys to assess their experience. RESULTS Of the 325 participants, 267 (80%) completed pre-surveys and 95 (29%) completed both the pre- and post-surveys. Respondents [average age= 38 years (44% women; 56% men; 211 U.S.; 56 U.K.)] included 92 (34%) medical students and residents, and 175 faculty and staff. Pre-event survey: 76% had little or no experience prior with XR devices while 94% thought implementation of XR into medical curricula was valuable. Post Survey: 96% felt tele-rounding using XR technology was important for the current era and 99% thought the ability to visualize the exam, imaging, and labs at bedside via XR rounding was highly valuable and that this format was superior to traditional grand rounds.

During the spread of this infectious disease in the world, health care workers are taking place as the main people in the screening and treatment of the disease. The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between anxiety and depression levels with perceived stress and coping strategies in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this study, 200 participants were included. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BDI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) were applied. RESULTS: Mean scores for BDI and BAI were 9.28.9 and 8.29.2, respectively. BDI scores of 33 (16.5%) of 200 participants were 17. 62% of the participants had minimal depression, 21.5% of the participants had mild depression, 13.5 % of the participants had moderate depression, and 3% of the participants had severe depression according to BDI scores. 60.5% of the participants had minimal anxiety, 25.5% of the participants had mild anxiety, 8.5% of the participants had moderate anxiety and 5.5% of the participants had severe anxiety according to BAI scores. BAI and BDI scores of the female participants were statistically higher than the male participants. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between BAI and BDI scores and PSS-10 scores. A statistically significant difference was found in the averages of BAI and BDI, PSS-10 COPE 3 (Focus on and venting of emotions), 7 (Religious coping) and 13 (Acceptance) subscales levels in occupational groups. A statistically significant difference was found in BDI levels in the clinical units during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that different coping strategies can be used in health care workers regarding anxiety, depression and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. While problem-solving and emotion-focused adaptive coping mechanisms help reduce symptoms, maladaptive and negative coping mechanisms can cause symptoms to exacerbate. Thus, training should be given to developing attitudes of health care workers to cope with stress.","output":"The Relationship between Anxiety and Depression Levels with Perceived Stress and Coping Strategies in Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fused PET/computed tomography has demonstrated success in the detection and quantification of atherosclerotic plaques.

Purinergic signalling is cross-linked with other transmitter networks to coordinate numerous aspects of cell behaviour such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis and other physiological processes critical for the proper function of organisms. Pathological deregulation of purinergic signalling contributes to various diseases including neurodegeneration, rheumatic immune diseases, inflammation, and cancer.

We perform a quantitative analysis of the multiphase pore-scale dynamics and we identify the dominant fluid structures governing mass transport. The results show the existence of three different regimes of transport: a fast inertial dynamics at short times, characterised by a compact uniform front, a viscous-capillary regime at intermediate times, where liquid is transported along a gradually increasing number of preferential flow paths of the size of one-two pores, and a third regime at longer times, where liquid, after having reached the outlet, is exclusively flowing along such flow paths and the two-phase fluid structures are stabilised. We observe that the fibrous layer presents significant variations in its microscopic morphology, which have an important effect on the pore invasion dynamics. Liquid transport is affected by the presence of a microstructure-induced capillary pressure acting adversely to the flow, leading to capillary fingering transport mechanisms even in the absence of hydrophobic treatments of the porous material. We propose a macroscopic model based on an effective contact angle that mimics the effects of the such a dynamic capillary pressure.

The results of the study indicated that, the students levels of engagement were relatively high through Advocacy Hybrid-Service Learning approach, where majority of them achieved the Strategic Compliance and Optimal Engagement categories. The students generic skills were further analysed with one-way repeated measures ANOVA and it was discovered that, GAMYSEL had positive impacts in developing these skills in five stages of service-learning. Both of these findings suggest that students engagement and generic skills had a significant effect on students learning after the use of GAMYSEL ? 2021.

COVID-19 has caused significant damage to the health, economy, and lives of people worldwide. Although SARS-CoV-2 is not as lethal as SARS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, its high transmissibility has had disastrous consequences for public health and healthcare systems worldwide given the lack of effective treatment at present. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 caused lung inflammation and injury, from the molecular mechanism to lung damage and tissue repair, from research to clinical practice, and then presented clinical requirements. SOURCES: References for this review were identified through searches (COVID-19[Title]) OR (SARS-CoV-2[Title]) on PubMed, and focused on the pathological damage and clinical practice of COVID-19. CONTENT: We comprehensively reviewed the process of lung inflammation and injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection, including pyroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, cytokine storm, and thrombotic inflammatory mechanisms. IMPLICATIONS: This review describes SARS-CoV-2 from SARS and explores why most people have mild inflammatory responses, even asymptomatic infections, while only a few develop severe disease. It suggests that future therapeutic strategies may be targeted antiviral therapy, the pathogenic pathways in the lung inflammatory response, and enhancing repair and regeneration in lung injury.","output":"Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes lung inflammation and injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lexical phenomena, such as clusters of words, disseminate through social networks at different rates but most models of diffusion focus on the discrete adoption of new lexical phenomena (i.e. new topics or memes). It is possible much of lexical diffusion happens via the changing rates of existing word categories or concepts (those that are already being used, at least to some extent, regularly) rather than new ones. In this study we introduce a new metric, contrastive lexical diffusion (CLD) coefficient, which attempts to measure the degree to which ordinary language (here clusters of common words) catch on over friendship connections over time. For instance topics related to meeting and job are found to be sticky, while negative thinking and emotion, and global events, like school orientation were found to be less sticky even though they change rates over time. We evaluate CLD coefficient over both quantitative and qualitative tests, studied over 6 years of language on Twitter. We find CLD predicts the spread of tweets and friendship connections, scores converge with human judgments of lexical diffusion (r=0.92), and CLD coefficients replicate across disjoint networks (r=0.85). Comparing CLD scores can help understand lexical diffusion: positive emotion words appear more diffusive than negative emotions, first-person plurals (we) score higher than other pronouns, and numbers and time appear non-contagious.","output":"Contrastive Lexical Diffusion Coefficient: Quantifying the Stickiness of the Ordinary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lateral flow immunoassays (LFI) have shown great promise for point-of-care (POC) sensing applications, however, its clinical translation is often hindered by insufficient sensitivity for early detection of diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is mainly due to weak absorption signals of single gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Here, we developed AuNP clusters that maintain the red color of isolated individual AuNPs, but increase the colorimetric readout to improve the detection sensitivity. The plasmon color-preserved (PLASCOP) AuNP clusters is simply made by mixing streptavidin-coated AuNP core with satellite AuNPs coated with biotinylated antibodies. The biotinylated antibody-streptavidin linker forms a gap size over 15 nm to avoid plasmon coupling between AuNPs, thus maintaining the plasmonic color while increasing the overall light absorption. LFI sensing using PLASCOP AuNP clusters composed of 40 nm AuNPs showed a high detection sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.038 ng mL(?1), which was 23.8- and 5.9-times lower value than that of single 15 nm and 40 nm AuNP conjugates, respectively. The PLASCOP AuNP clusters-based LFI sensing also shows good specificity for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins from other influenza and coronaviruses. In a clinical feasibility test, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 particles spiked in human saliva could be detected with an LOD of 54 TCID(50) mL(?1). The developed PLASCOP AuNP clusters are promising colorimetric sensing reporters that present improved sensitivity in LFI sensing for broad POC sensing applications beyond SARS-CoV-2 detection.","output":"Plasmon color-preserved gold nanoparticle clusters for high sensitivity detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on lateral flow immunoassay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coagulation abnormalities in COVID-19 patients have not been addressed in depth. OBJECTIVE: To perform a longitudinal evaluation of coagulation profile of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. METHODS: Conventional coagulation tests, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), platelet function, fibrinolysis, antithrombin, protein C and S were measured at days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14. Based on median total maximum SOFA score, patients were divided in two groups: SOFA &#8804; 10 and SOFA > 10. RESULTS: Thirty patients were studied. Some conventional coagulation tests, as aPTT, PT and INR remained unchanged during the study period, while alterations on others coagulation laboratory tests were detected. Fibrinogen levels were increased in both groups. ROTEM maximum clot firmness increased in both groups from Day 0 to Day 14. Moreover, ROTEM-FIBTEM maximum clot firmness was high in both groups, with a slight decrease from day 0 to day 14 in group SOFA &#8804; 10 and a slight increase during the same period in group SOFA > 10. Fibrinolysis was low and decreased over time in all groups, with the most pronounced decrease observed in INTEM maximum lysis in group SOFA > 10. Also, D-dimer plasma levels were higher than normal reference range in both groups and free protein S plasma levels were low in both groups at baseline and increased over time, Finally, patients in group SOFA > 10 had lower plasminogen levels and Protein C aathan patients with SOFA <10, which may represent less fibrinolysis activity during a state of hypercoagulability. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients have a pronounced hypercoagulability state, characterized by impaired endogenous anticoagulation and decreased fibrinolysis. The magnitude of coagulation abnormalities seems to correlate with the severity of organ dysfunction. The hypercoagulability state of COVID-19 patients was not only detected by ROTEM but it much more complex, where changes were observed on the fibrinolytic and endogenous anticoagulation system.","output":"Coagulation profile of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU: An exploratory study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic has an effect on all the dimensions of health Previous epidemics and pandemics had made a catastrophic impact on mental wellbeing of general public Methods: A cross sectional online study was carried out in the month of May Data collection was done using Google form which contained semi-structured questionnaire Results: Total 450 individuals participated in the study About one-fourth of the participants felt depressed (28 9%) listening to the constant news updates about corona virus Almost half of participants (50 7%) had altered eating habits Nearly one-third of the participants had difficulty (35 1%) in falling asleep Conclusion: This study reports that there is a negative impact on psychosocial health of general public who were confined to their homes due to COVID-19 pandemic in the country","output":"Assessment of psychosocial health during COVID-19 Pandemic among Indian adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In humans, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome which presents edema, hemorrhage, intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, and vascular changes characterized by thrombus formation, micro-angiopathy and thrombosis. These clinical signs are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. In recent studies it has been noted that COVID-19 pandemic can affect patients of all ages, including children (even if less severely) who were initially thought to be immune. Kawasaki disease is an autoimmune acute febrile inflammatory condition, which primarily affects young children. The disease can present immunodeficiency with the inability of the immune system to fight inflammatory pathogens and leads to fever, rash, alterations of the mucous membranes, conjunctiva infection, pharyngeal erythema, adenopathy, and inflammation. In the COVID-19 period, virus infection aggravates the condition of Kawasaki disease, but it has also been noted that children affected by SARS-V-2 may develop a disease similar to Kawasaki's illness. However, it is uncertain whether the virus alone can give Kawasaki disease-like forms. As in COVID-19, Kawasaki disease and its similar forms are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by innate immunity cells such as macrophages and mast cells (MCs). In light of the above, it is therefore pertinent to think that by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines with new anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-37 and IL-38, it is possible to alleviate the symptoms of the disease and have a new available therapeutic tool. However, since Kawasaki and Kawasaki-like diseases present immunodeficiency, treatment with anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant molecules must be applied very carefully.","output":"SARS-CoV-2, which induces COVID-19, causes kawasaki-like disease in children: role of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) shares the common histological hallmarks with other forms of ARDS.

We made the following findings: The majority of IGs are upregulated in the first 12 hours post-infection (PI), and maintained until 48 hours PI in human microvascular EC infected by middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (an EC model for COVID-19). The expressions of IGs are modulated in 21 human EC transcriptomic datasets by various PAMPs/DAMPs, including LPS, LPC, shear stress, hyperlipidemia and oxLDL. Upregulation of many IGs such as nucleic acid sensors are shared between ECs infected by MERS-CoV and those stimulated by PAMPs and DAMPs. Human heart EC and mouse aortic EC express all four types of coronavirus receptors such as ANPEP, CEACAM1, ACE2, DPP4 and virus entry facilitator TMPRSS2 (heart EC); most of coronavirus replication-transcription protein complexes are expressed in HMEC, which contribute to viremia, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular comorbidities of COVID-19. ECs have novel trained immunity (TI), in which subsequent inflammation is enhanced. Upregulated proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL6, CSF1 and CSF3 and TI marker IL-32 as well as TI metabolic enzymes and epigenetic enzymes indicate TI function in HMEC infected by MERS-CoV, which may drive cytokine storms. Upregulated CSF1 and CSF3 demonstrate a novel function of ECs in promoting myelopoiesis. Mechanistically, the ER stress and ROS, together with decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes, facilitate a proinflammatory response and TI. Additionally, an increase of the regulators of mitotic catastrophe cell death, apoptosis, ferroptosis, inflammasomes-driven pyroptosis in ECs infected with MERS-CoV and the upregulation of pro-thrombogenic factors increase thromboembolism potential. Finally, NRF2-suppressed ROS regulate innate immune responses, TI, thrombosis, EC inflammation and death. These transcriptomic results provide novel insights on the roles of ECs in coronavirus infections such as COVID-19, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), inflammation, transplantation, autoimmune disease and cancers.","output":"Endothelial Immunity Trained by Coronavirus Infections, DAMP Stimulations and Regulated by Anti-Oxidant NRF2 May Contribute to Inflammations, Myelopoiesis, COVID-19 Cytokine Storms and Thromboembolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community health workers (CHWs) have the capacity to bring essential health services to under-resourced communities.

To unpack the COVID impacts on finfish aquaculture, two online based surveys were performed in Mymensingh, Bangladesh using structured questionnaires with 40 farmers to assess the economic feasibility of aquaculture farming, and 120 middlemen of the supply chain to unpack market instability. This was followed up with a further open-ended survey done with 120 consumers to gain a clear view of the marketing insights. Our study has revealed that COVID has resulted in a squeeze on profit for the finfish farmer and has opened up inequalities within the supply chain. Benefit-cost ratio analysis of farming reveals that although carp and other catfish farming remain close to the break-even level, pangasius and tilapia farming was potentially putting the farmers in debt. Whilst the consumers are now paying higher prices for pangasius and carp, and slightly reduced prices for tilapia and other catfish, the finfish farmers were receiving less profits. By contrast, the middlemen have increased their selling prices, presumably to offset increased costs and maintain profitability. To compensate rising operational costs and reduced income, farmers have reduced labor costs through reduction in number of staff and their wages. However, this compensation tool risks frustrating working-class people in rural areas and posing huge socio-economic burdens.

Methods: : The crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 was searched for strong druggable cavity pockets and pharmacophore features by the CavityPlus server. The features were selected for high-throughput screening (HTS) of a chemical library of ZINC natural products and hit identification database by ZINCPharmer. Autodock Vina was furthered utilized for estimation of hits' affinities to nsp12. A lead compound with the highest affinity to nsp12 was simulated dynamically by GROMACS for 10 nanoseconds (ns) to measure the hit stability in complex with nsp12 and conformational changes. Results: : 1 of 6 cavities with the highest score was selected for extraction of pharmacophore features and hit-identification. 9 pharmacophores were screened, and a total of unique 1274 hits were identified.

METHODS KEep Evaluating Protocol Simplification In Managing Periinterventional Light Sedation for Endovascular Stroke Treatment (KEEP SIMPLEST) was a prospective, single-center observational study aimed to compare aspects of periinterventional management in AIS patients treated according to our new SOP using a combination of esketamine and propofol with patients having been randomized into conscious sedation (CS) in the Sedation versus Intubation for Endovascular Stroke TreAtment (SIESTA) trial. Primary outcome was early neurological improvement at 24h using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and secondary outcomes were door-to-recanalization, recanalization grade, conversion rate and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. RESULTS Door-to-recanalization time (128.6  69.47 min vs. 156.8  75.91 min; p = 0.02), mean duration of MT (92.01  52 min vs. 131.9  64.03 min; p < 0.001), door-to-first angiographic image (51.61  31.7 min vs. 64.23  21.53 min; p = 0.003) and computed tomography-to-first angiographic image time (31.61  20.6 min vs. 44.61  19.3 min; p < 0.001) were significantly shorter in the group treated under the new SOP.

OBJECTIVES: To provide spine surgeons new to telemedicine with a structured physical examination technique based on manual motor testing principles. METHODS: Expert experience describing a series of specific maneuvers for upper and lower extremity strength testing that can be performed using a telemedicine platform. In addition, we offer instruction on setting up for these visits and highlight special tests that can be used to diagnose specific cervical and lumbar spine conditions. RESULTS: From our experiences in conducting telemedicine visits, we provide a means of testing and scoring upper and lower extremity strength for interpretation of weakness in the context of traditional manual motor testing. Also, we acknowledge the limitations of a remote examination and discuss maneuvers that cannot be performed remotely. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has drastically altered the delivery of care for patients with spine-related complaints. The need for social distancing has led to the widespread adoption of telemedicine. This technical note provides an urgently needed framework for the standardization of the remote physical exam. Validation of the exam as a diagnostic tool will be a crucial next step in studying the impact of telemedicine.","output":"The Spine Physical Examination Using Telemedicine: Strategies and Best Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity and associated insulin resistance (Ins-R) have been identified as important risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma development. Elevated calories and protein consumption are also associated with Ins-R and glucose intolerance. We investigated the effect of a 24-month moderate calorie and protein restriction program on overweight or obese patients affected by Barretts esophagus (BE), as no similar dietary approach has been attempted to date in this disease context. Anthropometric parameters, levels of serum analytes related to obesity and Ins-R, and the esophageal insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway were analyzed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03813381. Insulin, C-peptide, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), adipokines, and esophageal expression of the main proteins involved in insulin/IGF-1 signal transduction were quantified using Luminex-XMAP(?) technology in 46 patients who followed the restriction program (IA) and in 54 controls (CA). Body mass index and waist circumference significantly decreased in 76.1% of IA and 35.2% of CA. IGF-1 levels were reduced in 71.7% of IA and 51.8% of CA. The simultaneous reduction of glycaemia, IGF-1, the IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, and the improvement in weight loss-dependent insulin sensitivity, were associated with the downregulation of the insulin/IGF-1 signal on BE tissue. The proposed intervention program was an effective approach to counteract obesity-associated cancer risk factors. The improvement in metabolic condition resulted in a downregulation of the ERK-mediated mitogenic signal in 43.5% of patients, probably affecting the molecular mechanism driving adenocarcinoma development in BE lesions.","output":"Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling Is Downregulated in Barretts Esophagus Patients Undergoing a Moderate Calorie and Protein Restriction Program: A Randomized 2-Year Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When providing care, nephrologists are subject to various ethical duties. Beyond the Hippocratic notion of doing no harm, nephrologists also have duties to respect their patients' autonomy and dignity, to meet their patients' care goals in the least invasive way, to act impartially, and, ultimately, to do what is (clinically) beneficial for their patients. Juggling these often-conflicting duties can be challenging at the best of times, but can prove especially difficult when patients are not fully adherent to treatment. When a patient's nonadherence begins to cause harm to themselves and/or others, it may be questioned whether discontinuation of care is appropriate. We discuss how nephrologists can meet their ethical duties when faced with nonadherence in patients undergoing hemodialysis, including episodic extreme agitation, poor renal diet, missed hemodialysis sessions, and emergency presentations brought on by nonadherence. Furthermore, we consider the impact of cognitive impairment and provider-family conflict when making care decisions in a nonadherence context, as well as how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic might affect responses to nonadherence.

However, there is limited evidence verifying the short-term associations between meteorological factors and outpatient visits for patients with AS. Therefore, this study evaluates this possible association. METHODS: Meteorological data and data on daily AS outpatient visits to a general hospital in Hefei, China, from 2014 to 2019 were collected and analysed. Distributed lag nonlinear models and Poisson regression models were employed to determine the association between weather conditions and outpatient visits; the results were also stratified by gender and age. RESULTS: High relative humidity is significantly associated with all patient visits in lag 1 (RR = 1.113, 95% CI 1.021 to 1.213) and lag 7 days (RR = 1.115, 95% CI 1.014 to 1.227). A low relative risk to the nadir is observed in lag 4 days (RR = 0.920, 95% CI 0.862 to 0.983).

However, expeditiously designed trials without careful consideration of dose rationale have often resulted in treatment failure and toxicity in the target patient population, which includes not only adults but also children. Here we show how paediatric regimens can be identified using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) principles to establish the target exposure and evaluate the implications of dose selection for early and late intervention. Using in vitro data describing the antiviral activity and published pharmacokinetic data for the agents of interest, we apply a model-based approach to assess the exposure range required for adequate viral clearance and eradication. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were subsequently used with clinical trial simulations to characterise the probability target attainment (PTA) associated with enhanced antiviral activity in the lungs. Our analysis shows that neither remdesivir, nor anti-malarial drugs can achieve the desirable target exposure range based on a mg/kg dosing regimen, due to a limited safety margin and high concentrations needed to ensure the required PTA. To date, there has been limited focus on suitable interventions for children affected by COVID-19. Most clinical trials have defined doses selection criteria empirically, without thorough evaluation of the PTA. The current results illustrate how model-based approaches can be used for the integration of clinical and nonclinical data, providing a robust framework for assessing the probability of pharmacological success and consequently the dose rationale for antiviral drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.","output":"Model-Informed Repurposing of Medicines for SARS-CoV-2: Extrapolation of Antiviral Activity and Dose Rationale for Paediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply changed the way of living, social interactions, and professional relationships around the world Its impact can be perceived in the most varied aspects, as the challenging economic problems, the increasing cases of psychological issues, and obviously, the serious crisis faced by health systems worldwide In this context, most students at different educational levels had their activities interrupted or affected, bringing up an intensive discussion about remote learning In this work, it has been observed the social reality of the students in the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro, Paracambi campus (Rio de Janeiro-Brazil) regarding their family financial situation and emotional conditions during the pandemic, which would severely influence students' performance if they are subjected to remote learning courses The data are compared based on studies that analyze other socioeconomic and geographical contexts, in order to inquire how inclusive remote learning is available to be ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Evaluating Students' Aprehension about Remote Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Brazilian Sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policy decisions on COVID-19 interventions should be informed by a local, regional and national understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

METHODS: A list of statements concerning the diagnosis, classification, treatment and rehabilitation of PMC injuries was created by a working group of four individuals. Using a modified Delphi technique, a group of 35 surgeons with expertise in PMC injuries was surveyed, on three occasions, to establish consensus on the inclusion or exclusion of each statement. Experts were encouraged to propose further suggestions or modifications following each round. Pre-defined criteria were used to refine item lists after each survey. The final document included statements reaching consensus in round three. RESULTS: Thirty-five experts had a 100% response rate for all three rounds. A total of 53 items achieved over 75% consensus. The overall rate of consensus was 82.8%. Statements pertaining to PMC reconstruction and those regarding the treatment of combined cruciate and PMC injuries reached 100% consensus.

They will be the most challenging and dangerous expeditions in the history of human spaceflight and will expose crew members to unprecedented health and performance risks. The development of adverse cognitive or behavioral conditions and psychiatric disorders during those missions is considered a critical and unmitigated risk factor. Here, we argue that spatial cognition, i.e., the ability to encode representations about self-to-object relations and integrate this information into a spatial map of the environment, and their neural bases will be highly vulnerable during those expeditions. Empirical evidence from animal studies shows that social isolation, immobilization, and altered gravity can have profound effects on brain plasticity associated with spatial navigation. We provide examples from historic spaceflight missions, spaceflight analogs, and extreme environments suggesting that spatial cognition and its neural circuitry could be impaired during long-duration spaceflight, and identify recommendations and future steps to mitigate these risks.","output":"Brains in space: the importance of understanding the impact of long-duration spaceflight on spatial cognition and its neural circuitry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As of 13 September 2020, almost 28 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 including more than 920,000 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization.

Limb and digit ischemia have been associated with COVID-19 infection. This systematic review includes primary studies of COVID-19 limb ischemia to identify risk factors, comorbidities, case characteristics, and treatment strategies to better understand the nature of this disease and its effects on the extremities. Methods: A literature search for studies detailing COVID-19 infected patients with limb or digit ischemia was performed, identifying 157 articles, 12 of which met inclusion criteria, accounting for 47 patients. Inclusion criteria were (1) primary studies, (2) positive disease diagnosis (3) limb ischemia, (4) reported treatment. Demographic data, case characteristics, treatments, outcomes and mortality were collected and pooled. Results: The average patient age was 67.6 years, predominantly male (79.6%). Of the 44 cases discussing treatment, 13 (30%) patients underwent medical treatment alone, while 23 (52.3%) patients underwent medical plus surgical treatment. Four patients (9.1%) were treated with observation. In 10 of the 12 studies, lab findings, thrombosis, or conclusions supporting a hypercoagulable state as a cause of limb/digit ischemia were cited. Five patients (10.6%) were on vasopressors and 8 patients (17.0%) were on a ventilator. Of those treated with observation alone, there was 100% resolution of symptoms. Of those treated medically without surgical intervention (17 patients), 6 patients (35.3%) were reported to have revascularization, 6 patients (35.3%) died, and the remaining outcomes were not reported. Medical and surgical treatment resulted in one limb amputation (4.4%) and altogether 74% of patients achieved revascularization of the affected limb/digit. Mortality rate was 45%. Conclusions: COVID-19 infection may be associated with increased risk of limb or digital ischemia, although the quality of evidence supporting this theory is limited. Evidence of inflammatory-mediated thrombosis and endothelial injury are possible explanations which would support the use of immunotherapy in addition to anticoagulation for treatment or prevention of thromboembolic events.

However, the identities of the enzymes did not reveal the full biochemical details of this process, as the enzymes do not bear resemblance to those of other luminescence systems, and thus the properties of the enzymes involved in this fascinating process are still unknown. Here, we describe the characteri-zation of the penultimate enzyme in the pathway, hispidin 3-hydroxylase, from the luminescent fungus Mycena chlorophos (McH3H), which catalyzes the con-ver-sion of hispidin to 3-hydroxyhispidin. 3-Hydroxy-hispidin acts as a luciferin substrate in luminescent fungi. McH3H was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromato-graphy with a yield of 100 mg/l. McH3H was found to be a single component monomeric NAD(P)H-dependent FAD-containing monooxygenase having a preference for NADPH. Through site-directed mutagenesis, based on a modeled structure, mutant enzymes were created that are more efficient with NADH. Except for identifying the residues that tune cofactor specificity, these engineered variants may also help in developing new hispidin-based bioluminescence applications. We confirmed that addition of hispidin to McH3H led to the formation of 3-hydroxy-hispidin as sole aromatic product. Rapid kinetic analysis revealed that reduction of the flavin cofactor by NADPH is boosted by hispidin binding by nearly 100-fold. Similar to other class A flavoprotein hydroxylases, McH3H did not form a stable hydro-peroxyflavin intermediate.

Blood clogging of the needle can cause difficulties with specimen handling and stylet passage, which improves when the needle is primed with heparin before use. However, the effect of heparin on cytology, histology or immunochemistry (IHC) of FNA and FNB specimens is unknown. The goal of the study was to evaluate heparin priming on cytologic/histologic appearance, IHC staining, ease of stylet passage, and specimen bloodiness. Patients and methods This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing EUS-FNA/FNB. Needle sizes were 25 gauge (g), 22 g, and 19 g. Heparin priming of the needle was done and the stylet replaced (\\"dry heparin\\") or suction attached without replacing the stylet (\\"wet heparin\\"). Smears and cellblocks were examined by pathologists, and IHC staining were done as needed. Specimen bloodiness was compared with matched controls. Results Adequate tissue yields were obtained in all samples (37 heparin, 36 no heparin). Heparin priming did not exhibit negative effects on cytologic or histologic interpretation of the specimens, nor IHC. There was no difference in cellblock bloodiness between the heparin primed needle specimens and the non-heparin control group. . Conclusions Heparin priming of EUS-FNA or FNB needles does not negatively affect cytologic or histologic interpretation, nor interfere with IHC. In addition, heparin priming does not increase specimen bloodiness.

Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoVs capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV. IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.","output":"Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Teaching human anatomy to produce deeper understandings and knowledge retention in learners requires meaningful, engaging, and practical activities. Previous studies identify that most students who participated in body painting (BP) reported improved understanding of surface anatomy (SA). This study investigates the key factors underpinning how BP helps students learn SA. METHODS: The study involved an explanatory mixed-methods approach. Towards the end of an anatomy course, a survey was administered to three cohorts of first-year chiropractic, osteopathy, and Chinese medicine students and second-year biomedical sciences students over 3 years (n = 311; response rate = 30%). The survey assessed the effectiveness of BP as a hands-on, group-based approach for learning SA in practical class. Three student focus groups (n = 13) explored the key survey findings. RESULTS: Overall, 72% of student respondents reported BP activities helped them learn SA quite a bit or very much. Multivariate analysis identified students found BP helped them learn SA by remembering the position of the bones, joints, muscles, actions and insertions (POR = 5.7; P < 0.001); integrating textbook and other knowledge on a real live person (POR = 2.4; P = 0.027); and achieving a deeper understanding of SA (POR = 5.2; P < 0.001). The qualitative findings describe specifically how BP helps students learn, understand, and remember SA. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show the majority of students believed BP benefitted their learning of SA through enhancing engagement in self-directed classroom and out-of-hours learning opportunities, deeper understandings of form and function, retention of knowledge, and practical physical examination experiences palpating the variations in form between individuals.","output":"Learning by Doing: a Mixed-Methods Study to Identify Why Body Painting Can Be a Powerful Approach for Teaching Surface Anatomy to Health Science Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strong US-China collaboration on health and medicine is a crucial element of the global effort against COVID-19.

The rapid growth of data collection and linking capabilities combined with the increasing diversity of the data-driven AI techniques, including machine learning (ML), has brought both ubiquitous opportunities for data analytics projects and increased demands for the regulation and accountability of the outcomes of these projects. As a result, the area of interpretability and explainability of ML is gaining significant research momentum. While there has been some progress in the development of ML methods, the methodological side has shown limited progress. This limits the practicality of using ML in the health domain: the issues with explaining the outcomes of ML algorithms to medical practitioners and policy makers in public health has been a recognized obstacle to the broader adoption of data science approaches in this domain. This study builds on the earlier work which introduced CRISP-ML, a methodology that determines the interpretability level required by stakeholders for a successful real-world solution and then helps in achieving it. CRISP-ML was built on the strengths of CRISP-DM, addressing the gaps in handling interpretability. Its application in the Public Healthcare sector follows its successful deployment in a number of recent real-world projects across several industries and fields, including credit risk, insurance, utilities, and sport. This study elaborates on the CRISP-ML methodology on the determination, measurement, and achievement of the necessary level of interpretability of ML solutions in the Public Healthcare sector. It demonstrates how CRISP-ML addressed the problems with data diversity, the unstructured nature of data, and relatively low linkage between diverse data sets in the healthcare domain. The characteristics of the case study, used in the study, are typical for healthcare data, and CRISP-ML managed to deliver on these issues, ensuring the required level of interpretability of the ML solutions discussed in the project.

Participants Studies on international migrants and refugees, as well as internally displaced populations, were included. Methods We conducted a systematic review on the topic of sleep disorders in migrant and refugee populations. Only published articles and reviews in peer-reviewed journals were included. Results We analyzed five studies on sleep disorders in migrants, five studies on adult refugees, and three on refugee children and adolescents. Prevalence of sleep disorders in migrants and refugees ranges between 39 and 99%. In migrant workers, stress related to integration and adaptation to the host society is connected to higher risks of snoring, metabolic diseases, and insomnia. Sleep disturbances in refugees are predicted by past war experience. Sleep difficulties in adult and child refugees are strongly correlated to trauma. Torture of parents and grandparents can predict sleep disorders in refugee children, while being accompanied by parents to the host country has a protective effect on children's sleep. Conclusions and implications Considering the differences in risk factors, vulnerability, and traumatic life events for different migrant populations, origins of sleep difficulties vary, depending on the migrant populations. Effects on sleep disturbances and sleep quality may be a result of integration in the host country, including changes of lifestyle, such as diet and working hours with implication for OSAS (obstructive sleep apnea) and insomnia. Compared with migrant populations, sleep disturbances in refugee populations are more correlated with mental health symptoms and disorders, especially PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), than with psychosocial problems. In juvenile refugee populations, psychological problems and disturbed sleep are associated with traumatic experiences during their journey to the host country. Findings highlight the need for expert recommendations for development of 3P approach stratified in the following: (1) prediction, including structured exploration of predisposing and precipitating factors that may trigger acute insomnia, screening of the according sleep disorders by validated translated questionnaires and sleep diaries, and a face-to-face or virtual setting and screening of OSAS; (2) target prevention by sleep health education for female and male refugees and migrant workers, including shift workers; and (3) personalized medical approach, including translated cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) and imagery rehearsal therapy for refugees and telehealth programs for improved CPAP adherence in migrants, with the goal to enable better sleep health quality and improved health economy.","output":"Sleep disorders in migrants and refugees: a systematic review with implications for personalized medical approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In light of recent crises, not least the COVID-19 pandemic, citizen trust in the political system has been highlighted as one of the central features ensuring citizen compliance and the functioning of democracy. Given its many desirable consequences, one of the key questions is how to increase political trust among ordinary citizens. This paper investigates the role of democratic quality in determining citizens trust in the political system. While we know that citizens evaluations of democratic performance are a strong predictor of political trust, previous research has shown that trust is not always higher in political systems with higher democratic quality, indicating that democratic performance evaluations do not always correspond to actual democratic quality. Several moderating factors may account for this disconnect between democratic quality and citizens evaluations of democratic performance and, ultimately, political trust. For one, citizens may receive different information about the political system;second, they may process this information in different ways;and third, they may have different standards of what democratic quality ought to be. Using survey data from three rounds of the World Values Survey (2005C2020) and aggregate data on democratic quality and other macro determinants of political trust from the V-Dem project and World Development Indicators for 50 democracies around the world, this contribution empirically investigates the complex relationship between democratic quality, democratic performance evaluations, and political trust in multi-level moderated mediation models. Its findings demonstrate that democratic quality affects political trust indirectly through citizens democratic performance evaluations and that this indirect effect is stronger for citizens with higher political interest, higher education, and especially those with more liberal conceptions of democracy.

In this context, human convalescent plasma has been used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the efficacy remains uncertain. Objective: To explore potential signals of efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Design: Open-label, Expanded Access Program (EAP) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with human convalescent plasma. Setting: Multicenter, including 2,807 acute care facilities in the US and territories. Participants: Adult participants enrolled and transfused under the purview of the US Convalescent Plasma EAP program between April 4 and July 4, 2020 who were hospitalized with (or at risk of) severe or life threatening acute COVID-19 respiratory syndrome. Intervention: Transfusion of at least one unit of human COVID-19 convalescent plasma using standard transfusion guidelines at any time during hospitalization. Convalescent plasma was donated by recently-recovered COVID-19 survivors, and the antibody levels in the units collected were unknown at the time of transfusion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seven and thirty-day mortality. Results: The 35,322 transfused patients had heterogeneous demographic and clinical characteristics. This cohort included a high proportion of critically-ill patients, with 52.3% in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 27.5% receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of plasma transfusion. The seven-day mortality rate was 8.7% [95% CI 8.3%-9.2%] in patients transfused within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis but 11.9% [11.4%-12.2%] in patients transfused 4 or more days after diagnosis (p<0.001). Similar findings were observed in 30-day mortality (21.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.0001). Importantly, a gradient of mortality was seen in relation to IgG antibody levels in the transfused plasma. For patients who received high IgG plasma (>18.45 S/Co), seven-day mortality was 8.9% (6.8%, 11.7%); for recipients of medium IgG plasma (4.62 to 18.45 S/Co) mortality was 11.6% (10.3%, 13.1%); and for recipients of low IgG plasma (<4.62 S/Co) mortality was 13.7% (11.1%, 16.8%) (p=0.048). This unadjusted dose-response relationship with IgG was also observed in thirty-day mortality (p=0.021).

Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open up possible lines of research for the development of live-attenuated virus vaccines from CoVs. Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such hypothesis.","output":"Why do children seem to be more protected against COVID-19?

Several issues, however, pertaining to their association with psychosocial, seizure-related and medication factors, remain controversial. Accordingly, the present study was designed to investigate the association of interictal mood disorders with various demographic and seizure-related variables in patients with newly-diagnosed and chronic epilepsy. METHODS We investigated 201 patients with epilepsy (51.2% males, mean age 33.2 +/- 10.0 years, range 16-60) with a mean disease duration of 13.9 +/- 9.5 years. Depression and anxiety were assessed in the interictal state with the Beck Depression Inventory, 21-item version (BDI-21) and the state and trait subscales of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S and STAI-T), respectively. The association of mood disorders with various variables was investigated with simple and multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS High seizure frequency and symptomatic focal epilepsy (SFE) were independent determinants of depression, together accounting for 12.4% of the variation of the BDI-21. The STAI-S index was significantly associated with the type of epilepsy syndrome (SFE). Finally, high seizure frequency, SFE and female gender were independent determinants of trait anxiety accounting for 14.7% of the variation of the STAI-T. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the prevailing view that depression and anxiety are common psychological disorders in epileptics.

So far, transcriptomic analyses of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and cells were performed on mixed populations of infected and uninfected cells or using single-cell RNA sequencing, both leading to inaccurate or low-resolution gene expression interpretations. Moreover, they generally focused on annotated messenger RNAs (mRNAs), ignoring other transcripts, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and unannotated RNAs. Here, we performed deep polyA+ transcriptome analyses of lung epithelial A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, which were sorted based on the expression of the viral protein spike (S). To increase the sequencing depth and improve the robustness of the analysis, the samples were depleted of viral transcripts. Infection caused a massive reduction in mRNAs and lncRNAs, including transcripts coding for antiviral innate immune proteins, such as interferons (IFNs). This absence of IFN response probably explains the poor transcriptomic response of bystander cells co-cultured with spike positive (S+) ones. NF-B and inflammatory response were among the pathways that escaped the global shutoff in S+ cells. In agreement with the RNA-seq analysis, inflammatory cytokines, but not IFNs, were produced and secreted by infected cells. Functional investigations revealed the proviral function of the NF-kB subunit p105/p50 and some of its known target genes, including IL32 and IL8, as well as the lncRNA ADIRF-AS1, which we identified as a novel NF-kB target gene. Thus, analyzing the polyA+ transcriptome of sorted populations of infected lung cells allowed unprecedented identification of cellular functions that are directly affected by infection and the recovery of coding and non-coding genes that contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication.","output":"Transcriptomic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2-infected and bystander lung cells reveal a selective upregulation of NF-B-dependent coding and non-coding proviral transcripts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 has been producing atypical manifestations aside from fever, coughing and dysnea.

METHODS: A systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and EuropePMC was performed on 8 October 2020. This studys main outcome is a poor composite outcome, comprising of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 9 studies with 3663 patients. The prevalence of dyslipidemia in this pooled analysis was 18% (4%-32%). Dyslipidemia was associated with increased composite poor outcome (RR 1.39 [1.02, 1.88], P = .010; I(2): 56.7%, P = .018). Subgroup analysis showed that dyslipidemia was associated with severe COVID-19 (RR 1.39 [1.03, 1.87], P = .008; I(2): 57.4%, P = .029). Meta-regression showed that the association between dyslipidemia and poor outcome varies by age (coefficient: ?0.04, P = .033), male gender (coefficient: ?0.03, P = .042), and hypertension (coefficient: ?0.02, P = .033), but not diabetes (coefficient: ?0.24, P = .135) and cardiovascular diseases (coefficient: ?0.01, P = .506).

Various tissues display sex differences in DNA methylation, however this has not yet been explored in skeletal muscle, despite skeletal muscle being among the tissues with the most transcriptomic sex differences. For the first time, we investigated the effect of sex on autosomal DNA methylation in human skeletal muscle across three independent cohorts (Gene SMART, FUSION, and GSE38291) using a meta-analysis approach, totalling 369 human muscle samples (222 males, 147 females), and integrated this with known sex-biased transcriptomics. We found 10,240 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at FDR < 0.005, 94% of which were hypomethylated in males, and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes were involved in muscle contraction and substrate metabolism. We then investigated biological factors underlying DNA methylation sex differences and found that circulating hormones were not associated with differential methylation at sex-biased DNA methylation loci, however these sex-specific loci were enriched for binding sites of hormone-related transcription factors (with top TFs including androgen (AR), estrogen (ESR1), and glucocorticoid (NR3C1) receptors). Fibre type proportions were associated with differential methylation across the genome, as well as across 16 % of sex-biased DNA methylation loci (FDR < 0.005). Integration of DNA methylomic results with transcriptomic data from the GTEx database and the FUSION cohort revealed 326 autosomal genes that display sex differences at both the epigenome and transcriptome levels. Importantly, transcriptional sex-biased genes were overrepresented among epigenetic sex-biased genes (p-value = 4.6e-13), suggesting differential DNA methylation and gene expression between male and female muscle are functionally linked. Finally, we validated expression of three genes with large effect sizes (FOXO3A, ALDH1A1, and GGT7) in the Gene SMART cohort with qPCR. GGT7, involved in antioxidant metabolism, displays male-biased expression as well as lower methylation in males across the three cohorts. In conclusion, we uncovered 8,420 genes that exhibit DNA methylation differences between males and females in human skeletal muscle that may modulate mechanisms controlling muscle metabolism and health. Significance The importance of uncovering biological sex differences and their translation to physiology has become increasingly evident. Using a large-scale meta-analysis of three cohorts, we perform the first comparison of genome-wide skeletal muscle DNA methylation between males and females, and identify thousands of genes that display sex-differential methylation. We then explore intrinsic biological factors that may be underlying the DNA methylation sex differences, such as fibre type proportions and sex hormones. Leveraging the GTEx database, we identify hundreds of genes with both sex-differential expression and DNA methylation in skeletal muscle. We further confirm the sex-biased genes with gene expression data from two cohorts included in the methylation meta-analysis. Our study integrates genomewide sex-biased DNA methylation and expression in skeletal muscle, shedding light on distinct sex differences in skeletal muscle.","output":"Skeletal muscle methylome and transcriptome integration reveals profound sex differences related to muscle function and substrate metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poor air quality is an emerging problem in Australia primarily due to ozone pollution events and lengthening and more severe wildfire seasons. A significant deterioration in air quality was experienced in Australia's most populous cities, Melbourne and Sydney, as a result of fires during the so-called Black Summer which ran from November 2019 through to February 2020. Following this period, social, mobility and economic restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic were implemented in Australia. We quantify the air quality impact of these contrasting periods in the south-eastern states of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) using a meteorological normalisation approach. A Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was used to compute baseline time series' of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide CO and particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 m (PM2.5), based on a 19 year, detrended training dataset. Across Victorian sites, large increases in CO (188%), PM2.5 (322%) and ozone (22%) were observed over the RF prediction in January 2020. In NSW, smaller pollutant increases above the RF prediction were seen (CO 58%, PM2.5 80%, ozone 19%). This can be partly explained by the RF predictions being high compared to the mean of previous months, due to high temperatures and strong wind speeds, highlighting the importance of meteorological normalisation in attributing pollution changes to specific events. From the daily observation-RF prediction differences we estimated 249.8 (95% CI: 156.6-343.) excess deaths and 3490.0 (95% CI 1325.9-5653.5) additional hospitalisations were likely as a result of PM2.5 and O3 exposure in Victoria and NSW. During April 2019, when COVID-19 restrictions were in place, on average NO2 decreased by 21.5 and 8% in Victoria and NSW respectively. O3 and PM2.5 remained effectively unchanged in Victoria on average but increased by 20 and 24% in NSW respectively, supporting the suggestion that community mobility reduced more in Victoria than NSW. Overall the air quality change during the COVID-19 lockdown had a negligible impact on the calculated health outcomes.","output":"Air quality and health impact of 2019-20 Black Summer megafires and COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The psychological condition of diabetic patients affects blood glucose.

The Macmillan Move More Northern Ireland (MMNI) programme provides access to physical activity and behavioural change support before, during and after cancer treatment. This evaluation details the impact of the pandemic on the MMNI participants and identifies methods to adapt service delivery. METHODS: A multiple-choice and short answer online survey was sent to 730 MMNI participants, to investigate the impact of the initial, national COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, the survey examined physical activity patterns, the physical/emotional/social impact of restrictions and attitudes towards digitally supported exercise. Free text responses were analysed thematically with findings verified within the research team. RESULTS: 377 participants completed the survey (52% response rate). 50% of respondents had breast cancer, with 36 other diagnoses registered (82% were female). Participants reported physical activity levels decreased during restrictions, citing isolation; declining health/fitness; lack of access and motivation. The dataset trended towards women and those diagnosed with breast cancer. 71% reported the pandemic impacted their physical (n=119) and/or psychosocial (n=231) wellbeing. Many respondents were availing of digitally supported exercise, whilst half of males did not engage (46%). Finally, 80% of respondents were interested in using a MMNI smart application. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected participant physical activity levels. Supervised classes were the most popular (pre-pandemic), with enforced leisure centre closures prompting this reduction. The pandemic has negatively affected the psychosocial wellbeing (mental health) of participants, compounded by the restrictions imposed on the traditional delivery of MMNI.

While several types of violent and property crime decreased immediately after the first lockdown, online crime rates increased. Nevertheless, little research has explored the relationship between multiple lockdowns and crime in the mid-term. Furthermore, few studies have analysed potentially contrasting trends in offline and online crimes using the same dataset. To fill these gaps in research, the present article employs interrupted time-series analysis to examine the effects on offline and online crime of the three lockdown orders implemented in Northern Ireland. We analyse crime data recorded by the police between April 2015 and May 2021. Results show that many types of traditional offline crime decreased after the lockdowns but that they subsequently bounced back to pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, results appear to indicate that cyber-enabled fraud and cyber-dependent crime rose alongside lockdown-induced changes in online habits and remained higher than before COVID-19. It is likely that the pandemic accelerated the long-term upward trend in online crime. We also find that lockdowns with stay-at-home orders had a clearer impact on crime than those without. Our results contribute to understanding how responses to pandemics can influence crime trends in the mid-term as well as helping identify the potential long-term effects of the pandemic on crime, which can strengthen the evidence base for policy and practice.","output":"Offline crime bounces back to pre-COVID levels, cyber stays high: interrupted time-series analysis in Northern Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the global spread of COVID-19 epidemic, this paper implements an application of social distance monitoring in public places, aiming to control the spread of virus by controlling the social distance of pedestrians The application mainly uses YOLOv4 object detection algorithm and DeepSORT multiple objects tracking algorithm to detect and label pedestrians, and uses affine transformation to calibrate the scene to a more intuitive birds-eye view Based on the analysis of pedestrian movement, the author proposes a novel pedestrian clustering algorithm to avoid the impact of peers on the monitoring results Finally, three indicators are selected to classify the pedestrian to analyse and evaluate the risk of virus infection in a certain place In this paper, comparing the yolov4 algorithm with the most suitable performance of other research results, the author indirectly concludes that yolov4 is the most suitable method in the application of social distance monitoring And the new pedestrian clustering algorithm plays a role in the application, which improves the practicability of the application Through the experiment, it is found that the social distance in the scene can be monitored in real time and accurately, and there is a correlation between the average distance of pedestrian clusters, the density of pedestrian clusters and the infection index, which can be used to evaluate the safety of places and prevent the spread of virus","output":"The Application of Yolov4 And A New Pedestrian Clustering Algorithm to Implement Social Distance Monitoring During The COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has driven ever-greater demand for tools which enable efficient exploration of biomedical literature.

Immune deficiency, being on corticosteroids for inflammatory diseases, delayed interferon response and advanced age adversely influence prognosis with impairing viral clearance. On the other hand, exuberant immune response with features of cytokine storm is the leading cause of death, which can be alleviated by use of either general immunosuppression with corticosteroids or selective neutralization of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6.

The risk of secondary outcomes (e.g., death) attributable to infection may depend on the underlying disease incidence targeted by the intervention. Consequently, the impact of interventions (e.g., the difference in vaccination and no-vaccination scenarios) on secondary outcomes may not be proportional to the reduction in disease incidence. Here, we illustrate the estimation of the impact of vaccination on measles mortality, where case fatality ratios (CFRs) are a function of dynamically changing measles incidence. METHODS: We used a previously published model of measles CFR that depends on incidence and vaccine coverage to illustrate the effects of (1) assuming higher CFR in no-vaccination scenarios, (2) time-varying CFRs over the past, and (3) time-varying CFRs in future projections on measles impact estimation. We used modeled CFRs in alternative scenarios to estimate measles deaths from 2000 to 2030 in 112 low- and middle-income countries using two models of measles transmission: Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and DynaMICE. We evaluated how different assumptions on future vaccine coverage, measles incidence, and CFR levels in no-vaccination scenarios affect the estimation of future deaths averted by measles vaccination. RESULTS: Across 2000C2030, when CFRs are separately estimated for the no-vaccination scenario, the measles deaths averted estimated by PSU increased from 85.8% with constant CFRs to 86.8% with CFRs varying 2000C2018 and then held constant or 85.9% with CFRs varying across the entire time period and by DynaMICE changed from 92.0 to 92.4% or 91.9% in the same scenarios, respectively. By aligning both the vaccination and no-vaccination scenarios with time-variant measles CFR estimates, as opposed to assuming constant CFRs, the number of deaths averted in the vaccination scenarios was larger in historical years and lower in future years. CONCLUSIONS: To assess the consequences of health interventions, impact estimates should consider the effect of no-intervention scenario assumptions on model parameters, such as measles CFR, in order to project estimated impact for alternative scenarios according to intervention strategies and investment decisions.","output":"Differential health impact of intervention programs for time-varying disease risk: a measles vaccination modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) is a contagious viral infection that has now spread to various countries, one of which is Indonesia.

It is, therefore, integral to identify patients who may benefit from biventricular support early post-LVAD implantation. Our objective was to explore the performance of risk prediction models for RVF in adult patients undergoing LVAD implantation. METHODS A systematic search was performed on Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception until August 2019 for all relevant studies. Performance was assessed by discrimination (via C statistic) and calibration if reported. Study quality was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool criteria. RESULTS After reviewing 3878 citations, 25 studies were included, featuring 20 distinctly derived models. Five models were derived from large multicenter cohorts: the European Registry for Patients With Mechanical Circulatory Support, Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, Kormos, Pittsburgh Bayesian, and Mechanical Circulatory Support Research Network RVF models. Seventeen studies (68%) were conducted in cohorts implanted with continuous-flow LVADs exclusively. The definition of RVF as an outcome was heterogenous among models. Seven derived models (28%) were validated in at least 2 cohorts, reporting limited discrimination (C-statistic range, 0.53-0.65). Calibration was reported in only 3 studies and was variable. CONCLUSIONS Existing RVF prediction models exhibit heterogeneous derivation and validation methodologies, varying definitions of RVF, and are mostly derived from single centers. Validation studies of these prediction models demonstrate poor-to-modest discrimination. Newer models are derived in cohorts implanted with continuous-flow LVADs exclusively and exhibit modest discrimination. Derivation of enhanced discriminatory models and their validations in multicenter cohorts is needed.","output":"Predicting the Risk of Right Ventricular Failure in Patients Undergoing Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mass casualty incidents such as those that are being experienced during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic can overwhelm local healthcare systems, where the number of casualties exceeds local resources and capabilities in a short period of time The influx of patients with lung function deterioration as a result of COVID-19 has strained traditional ventilator supplies To bridge the gap during ventilator shortages and to help clinicians triage patients, manual resuscitator devices can be used to deliver respirations to a patient requiring breathing support Bag-valve mask (BVM) devices are ubiquitous in ambulances and healthcare environments, however require a medical professional to be present and constantly applying compression to provide the patient with respirations We developed an automated manual resuscitator-based emergency ventilator-alternative (AMREV) that provides automated compressions of a BVM in a repetitive manner and is broadly compatible with commercially-available BVM devices approximately 5 inches (128 mm) in diameter The AMREV device relieves the medical professional from providing manual breathing support and allows for hands-free operation of the BVM The AMREV supports the following treatment parameters: 1) adjustable tidal volume (V T ), 2) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (intrinsic and/or external), 3) 1:1 inspiratory: expiratory ratio, and 4) a controllable respiratory rate between 10-30 breaths per minute The relationship between the inherent resistance and compliance of the lung and the delivered breaths was assessed for the AMREV device Adjustable V T of 110-700 ml was achieved within the range of simulated lung states A linear increase in mean airway pressure (P aw ), from 10-40 cmH2O was observed, as the resistance and compliance on the lung model moved from normal to severe simulated disease states The AMREV functioned continuously for seven days with less than 3 2% variation in delivered V T and P aw Additionally, the AMREV device was compatible with seven commercially-available BVM setups and delivered consistent V T and P aw within 10% between models This automated BVM-based emergency-use resuscitator can provide consistent positive pressure, volume-controlled ventilation over an extended duration when a traditional ventilator is not available True ventilator shortages may lead to manual resuscitators devices such as the AMREV being the only option for some healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Development and Evaluation of an Automated Manual Resuscitator-Based Emergency Ventilator-Alternative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) came to attention back in June 2020, when the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) got initial reports regarding the patients who had delayed and multisystem involvement of the disease with clinical course resembling the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

The GoPro is a small, lightweight, high-resolution action camera with a wide-angle field of view that can encompass both the airway as well as the procedurist's hands and positioning technique when worn with a head mount. We aimed to evaluate its effectiveness in improving intubation teaching for novice learners in a simulated setting, via a two-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. METHODS: We recruited Year 4 medical students at the start of their compulsory 2-week Anesthesia posting. Participants underwent a standardized intubation curriculum and a formative assessment, then randomized to receive GoPro or non-GoPro led feedback. After a span of three months, participants were re-assessed in a summative assessment by blinded accessors. Participants were also surveyed on their learning experience for a qualitative thematic perspective. The primary outcomes were successful intubation and successful first-pass intubation. RESULTS: Seventy-one participants were recruited with no dropouts, and all were included in the analysis. 36 participants received GoPro led feedback, and 35 participants received non-GoPro led feedback. All participants successfully intubated the manikin. No statistically significant differences were found between the GoPro group and the non-GoPro group at summative assessment (85.3% vs 90.0%, p = 0.572). Almost all participants surveyed found the GoPro effective for their learning (98.5%). Common themes in the qualitative analysis were: the ability for an improved assessment, greater identification of small details that would otherwise be missed, and usefulness of the unique point-of-view footage in improving understanding. CONCLUSIONS: The GoPro is a promising tool for simulation-based intubation teaching.

It has become the second most affected country worldwide, as of June 9, 2020. Official Brazilian government sources present contradictory data on the impact of the disease; thus, it is possible that the actual number of infected individuals and deaths in Brazil is far larger than those officially reported. It is very likely that the actual spread of the disease has been underestimated. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the underreporting of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 in the most affected cities in Brazil, based on public data available from official Brazilian government internet portals, to identify the actual impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We used data from historical deaths due to respiratory problems and other natural causes from two public portals: DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Healthcare System) (2010-2018) and the Brazilian Transparency Portal of Civil Registry (2019-2020). These data were used to build time-series models (modular regressions) to predict the expected mortality patterns for 2020. The forecasts were used to estimate the possible number of deaths that were incorrectly registered during the pandemic and posted on government internet portals in the most affected cities in the country. RESULTS: Our model found a significant difference between the real and expected values. The number of deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was considerably higher in all cities, with increases between 493% and 5820%. This sudden increase may be associated with errors in reporting. An average underreporting of 40.68% (range 25.9%-62.7%) is estimated for COVID-19Crelated deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The significant rates of underreporting of deaths analyzed in our study demonstrate that officially released numbers are much lower than actual numbers, making it impossible for the authorities to implement a more effective pandemic response. Based on analyses carried out using different fatality rates, it can be inferred that Brazils epidemic is worsening, and the actual number of infectees could already be between 1 to 5.4 million.","output":"COVID-19 Mortality Underreporting in Brazil: Analysis of Data From Government Internet Portals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Our institution cancelled all in-person clerkships owing to the corona virus disease 2019 pandemic.

AIMS: Identifying and understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy may aid future public health messaging. This study, in which we planned to study the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, aims to reveal the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty, belief in conspiracy theories, and COVID-19 phobia with vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted during a COVID-19 outbreak. Participants were reached via various social media platforms and e-mailing lists for convenience. Data were collected with an online survey using SurveyMonkey application. Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12), Conspiracy Mentality Scale (CMS), and COVID-19 Phobia Scale were applied to 488 participants. Statistical significance level was considered p < 0.05. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-eight people between the ages of 18 and 65 participated. Twenty-one participants were excluded from the analysis due to random marking and unreasonable filling times (< 10 min). In this way, analyzes were made with 467 people. We found a positive correlation between the belief in conspiracy theories and vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.05). And also found that individuals with low fear of COVID-19 would hesitate about vaccination (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy is an important public health problem, and it puts public health at risk, especially during the epidemic period we live in. Therefore, it is important to understand the psychological factors involved in vaccine hesitancy.

The first, is to present the evolution of the process of sustainable development in the European Union (EU). We provide evidence that over time, the concept of sustainable development as a broad policy objective has been steadily declining in importance giving way to the less multidimensional strategy of green growth. We argue that the green growth strategy is actually based on the strategic selection of the traditional economic growth model, taking into account certain environmental aspects. We show that environmental protection expenditure is growing much slower than per capita income. Looking at the investment on environmental protection, we document a clear falling trend. Our findings imply that both the social and the environmental dimension of sustainability have been losing ground and the traditional goal of economic growth is being restored. The second, is to provide some assessment of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the process of sustainable development in the EU. Considering the relevant EU forecasts on the immediate effects of the pandemic, we conclude that it will severely hinder the process of sustainability in the EU in the short term. The long-term effects of the pandemic cannot even be outlined, especially at the level of the individual member states. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the Recovery and Resilience Facility as key instrument of recovery and of national recovery and resilience plans, will play a decisive role in minimising or even neutralising the negative longer-term effects of the coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Sustainable economic development in the European Union and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has seen a wealth of research examining the features of the disease While large multicentre studies have detailed the implications of a cancer diagnosis and systemic anti-cancer therapy on mortality, little has been published regarding the end-of-life experiences for cancer patients dying COVID-19 AimsTo review the end-of-life care (EOLC) for patients with COVID-19 at 2 UK cancer centres MethodsPrescriptions of anticipatory medications, opioids and continuous subcutaneous infusions of all non-ventilated inpatient deaths, n=28 ResultsThe mean age was 67 (45C89), most patients were male and white British (18) 10 patients had recognised risk factors of cardiovascular disease and diabetes 18 patients had metastatic disease and 23 were receiving palliative treatment The most commonly recorded tumour type was GI (8) 12 patients were referred to palliative care (PC) for symptom control, while 10 were referred for EOLC The mean number of PC reviews was 3 29 (range 0C10) Baseline IPOS scores on initial assessment at one centre (N=15), recorded the main symptoms as breathlessness, weakness and anxiety Family anxiety was the highest scoring aspect of the IPOS The medical management at the end-of-life was, however, generally uncomplicated;the total opioid (oral morphine equivalent) and benzodiazepine doses administered in last 24 hours before death were relatively low, median dose(range) 31 25 mg (5C160 mg) and 15 mg (0C30 mg) respectively ConclusionsShould a further surge of COVID-19 cases occur, many cancer patients dying with COVID-19 could be appropriately managed by non-specialist physicians supported by comprehensive guidelines, ward-based teaching and specialist palliative care input for more complex cases High levels of family anxiety could be improved by enhanced family support and communication about end-of-life wishes and priorities;healthcare services should have a particular focus on supporting the shadow pandemic of loss","output":"26 The end-of-life experiences for cancer patients with COVID-19;reflections from 2 UK cancer centres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The anesthesia method to be administered during emergency surgical procedures for COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pneumonia patients carries great importance for both patient and surgical team.

Structural and biochemical characterization of these bnAbs has provided molecular insight into how they bind distinct antigens. However, our understanding of the evolutionary pathways leading to bnAbs, and thus how best to elicit them, remains limited. Here, we measure equilibrium dissociation constants of combinatorially complete mutational libraries for two naturally isolated influenza bnAbs (CR9114, 16 heavy-chain mutations; CR6261, 11 heavy-chain mutations), reconstructing all possible evolutionary intermediates back to the unmutated germline sequences. We find that these two libraries exhibit strikingly different patterns of breadth: while many variants of CR6261 display moderate affinity to diverse antigens, those of CR9114 display appreciable affinity only in specific, nested combinations. By examining the extensive pairwise and higher order epistasis between mutations, we find key sites with strong synergistic interactions that are highly similar across antigens for CR6261 and different for CR9114. Together, these features of the binding affinity landscapes strongly favor sequential acquisition of affinity to diverse antigens for CR9114, while the acquisition of breadth to more similar antigens for CR6261 is less constrained. These results, if generalizable to other bnAbs, may explain the molecular basis for the widespread observation that sequential exposure favors greater breadth, and such mechanistic insight will be essential for predicting and eliciting broadly protective immune responses.","output":"Binding affinity landscapes constrain the evolution of broadly neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) alert should be raised when two or more healthcare workers (HCW) in the same health care unit fulfil the SARS clinical criteria, with onset of illness in the same 10-day period. However, in a number of European countries (including Italy) data on reasons for sickness absence are not routinely collected within current HCW worker sickness reporting systems, because of concerns about privacy. To help plan for the implementation of the proposed alert system in Italy, we aimed to determine the minimum number of alert cases defining a cluster. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sickness absences longer than 7 days in HCW employed in three hospitals in 2003, were identified by checking the hospitals administrative databases. HCW with onset of illness in the same 10-day period were contacted and asked whether they have been diagnosed with pneumonia. RESULTS: Overall, 273 absences > 7 days were recorded and 36 clusters of at least two absences > 7 days were identified; a total of 94 HCW were involved in these clusters. Only two HCW involved in different clusters, reported pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of clusters of two or more cases of pneumonia in HCW in the same hospital unit appears to be an uncommon event, and thus the alert system proposed is not likely to result in large numbers of false positive alerts.

Association between higher tumor stage and Fusobacterium nucleatum was reported in ten studies and two studies found an association with unfavorable tumor infiltration of immune cells. Three out of five studies examining Bacteroides fragilis found an association with decreased survival, advanced tumor stage or unfavorable immune infiltration of tumor. High levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum and possibly Bacteroides fragilis was associated with worse prognosis after surgery for colorectal cancer.","output":"The impact of the gut microbiota on prognosis after surgery for colorectal cancer - a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current credentialing process for physicians struggled to accommodate fluctuating regional demands for providers during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic.

METHODS After a two-day hands-on training, six panels of 150 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were cultured onto CT plates prepared in-house in two laboratories. Finally, triplicate readings of 900 CT plates resulted 18 DST patterns for each of the initial isolates. Time intervals to the results and for media preparations were estimated, as were intra- and interobserver agreements, test sensitivities and specificities calculated. BACTEC MGIT 960 DST was used as a reference. RESULTS The median time to produce DST results for isoniazid, rifampicin and levofloxacin was 13 days. The CT sensitivity ranged from 94.7% for levofloxacin to 95.8% and 97.3% for isoniazid and rifampicin, respectively. The test specificities were even higher exceeding 97% for all three drugs tested. Interobserver agreement reached 100% in one of the laboratories and exceeded 97% for levofloxacin and 99% for isoniazid and rifampicin in the second laboratory. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of the CT into a new laboratory was straightforward with only minimal guidance.

During the second quadratic growth phase, the characteristic time of the growth is about eight times shorter than in the beginning, which can be understood as the occurrence of separate hotspots. Quadratic behavior can be motivated by peripheral growth when further spreading occurs only on the outskirts of an infected region. We also study numerical solutions of a simple epidemic model, where the spatial extend of the system is taken into account. To model the delayed onset outside China together with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation much earlier than the others. At each site, quadratic growth commences when the local number of infections has reached a certain saturation level.

As decision makers are considering the recommendations they should evaluate how to provide the most efficient protection strategies with minimum costs. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the existing economic evaluation literature in this area and to offer advice on how future evaluations on this topic should be conducted. METHODS: We searched the Scopus database for all literature on economic evaluation of mask or respirator use to control respiratory infection transmission. Reference lists from the identified studies were also manually searched. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria from the initial 806 studies identified by the search strategy and our manual search. RESULTS: Five studies considered interventions for seasonal and/or pandemic influenza, with one also considering SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The other two studies focussed on tuberculosis transmission control interventions. The settings and methodologies of the studies varied greatly. No low-middle income settings were identified. Only one of the reviewed studies cited clinical evidence to inform their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. Mask and respirator interventions were generally reported by the study authors to be cost saving or cost-effective when compared to no intervention or other control measures, however the evaluations had important limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Given the large cost differential between masks and respirators, there is a need for more comprehensive economic evaluations to compare the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in situations and settings where alternative options are potentially applicable. There are at present insufficient well conducted cost-effectiveness studies to inform decision-makers on the value for money of alternative mask/respirator options.","output":"Review of economic evaluations of mask and respirator use for protection against respiratory infection transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has not only changed peoples health behavior, but also induced a psychological reaction among the public. Research data is needed to develop scientific evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse mental health effects. The aims of this study are to evaluate the anxiety reaction of Chinese people and the related determinants during the earliest phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Evidence from this survey will contribute to a targeted reference on how to deliver psychological counseling service in the face of outbreaks. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted from 28 January to 5 February 2020 using an open online questionnaire for people aged 18 years or above, residing in China and abroad. The socio-demographic information of the respondents was collected, and anxiety scores were calculated. A direct standardization method was used to standardize anxiety scores and a general linear model was used to identify associations between some factors (e.g., sex, age, education, etc.) and anxiety scores. (3) Results: A total of 10,946 eligible participants were recruited in this study, with a completion rate of 98.16% (10,946/11,151). The average anxiety score was 6.46  4.12 (total score = 15); women (6.86  4.11) scored higher than men (5.67  4.04).

All imaging studies' reports, within 20 days of COVID-19 positive test, were reviewed for presence of new arterial or venous thrombosis. Mortality was assessed up to one month since positive COVID-19 test result. Twelve patients (5.5%) were found to have new arterial (N=6, 50%) or venous (N=6, 50%) thrombosis. Five patients (41.7%) had history of prior TE events. Incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Arterial events occurred in the brain (66.7%), aorta (16.7%) and coronary arteries (16.7%). Median time from COVID test was 8 days (IQR, 1.5 - 11.3).

However, the precise mechanism of IEM and the effect of the nature of the ions in the emitted cluster size distribution have not yet been established despite its broad use in mass spectrometry and atmospheric chemistry over the past half century. Here, we present a systematic study of the emitted ion cluster distribution in relation to their spatial distribution in the parent droplet using atomistic modeling. It is found that in the parent droplet, multiple kosmotropic and weakly polarizable chaotropic ions (Cs+) are buried deeper within the droplet than polarizable chaotropic ions (Cl-, I-). This differentiation in the ion location is only captured by a polarizable model. It is demonstrated that the emitted cluster size distribution is determined by dynamic conical deformations and not by the equilibrium ion depth within the parent droplet as the IEM models assume. Critical factors that determine the cluster size distribution such as the charge sign asymmetry that have not been considered in models and in experiments are presented. We argue that the existing IEM analytical models do not establish a clear difference between IEM and Rayleigh fission. We propose a shift in the existing view for IEM from the equilibrium properties of the parent droplet to the chemistry in the conical shape fluctuations that serve as the centers for ion emission. Consequently, chemistry in the conical fluctuations may also be a key element to explain charge states of macromolecules in mass spectrometry and may have potential applications in catalysis due to the electric field in the conical region.","output":"Conical Shape Fluctuations Determine the Rate of Ion Evaporation and the Emitted Cluster Size Distribution from Multicharged Droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ciliopathies are a class of rare human genetic disease whose aetioligies lie in defective primary cilia.

Patients with liver transplant need special care starting from preoperative preparation, surgical intervention ending with postoperative care. The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on liver transplantation programmes and recipients is still not completely understood but overall involves the risk of donor-derived transmission, health-care resource utilization and the effect of immunosuppression. The aim of this study is to describe the situation of liver transplantation in the era of pandemic COVID-19. Methods Data obtained from secondary data on 13 articles journal evaluated by searching in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database that have been carried out in the last 2 years (2019-2020). Results The result showed that patients with liver disease need special attention and continuous follow-up. Similarly, transplant candidates also need special care. Restricting non-transplant elective surgical procedures, managing transplant patients in separate outpatient clinics, and in-patient wards can prevent transmission of infection both to patients and healthcare workers. Telemedicine can help in the triage of patients to screen for symptoms of COVID-19 before their regular appointment. Patients with novel COVID-19 experience various degrees of liver function abnormalities. Liver injury requires extensive work-up and continuous surveillance and can be multifactorial and heterogeneous in nature.

This article compares the healthcare insurance systems, fiscal subsidy policies during the COVID-19 period and takes Yulins healthcare insurance reform and Nanjing healthcare insurance administrations measures to fight against COVID-19 pandemic as specific cases to analyze. AIM: This article presents the advantages of the coverage of Chinas healthcare insurance as well as the insufficiency of the commercial healthcare insurance and market-oriented medical institutions to show the persistence and change in Chinas healthcare insurance reform. CONCLUSION: Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the National Healthcare Security Administration and the Ministry of Finance of PRC jointly issued an announcement on how to guarantee the medical security of the novel coronavirus pneumonia pandemic. More specific policies were made by each province to secure that the total medical costs of the COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients were almost borne by healthcare insurance and government finance subsidy. These policies reveal two basic points ahead Chinas healthcare reform: one is that China shall persist in positively promoting the universal healthcare insurance coverage program, which will break down barriers between urban and rural areas; the other is that the commercial medical insurance shall be a supplementary to social healthcare insurance and the market-oriented medical institutions shall be encouraged. The two basic points stand for the persistence and change in Chinas healthcare reform.

In viruses, the existence of a disordered proteome is also proven and is related to its conformational dynamics inside the host. The SARS-CoV-2 has a large proteome, in which, structure and functions of all proteins are not known yet, along with non-structural protein 11 (nsp11). In this study, we have performed extensive experimentation on nsp11. Our results based on the CD spectroscopy gives characteristic disordered spectrum for IDPs. Further, we investigated the conformational behavior of nsp11 in the presence of membrane mimetic environment, -helix inducer, and natural osmolyte. In the presence of negatively charged and neutral liposomes, nsp11 remains disordered. However, with SDS micelle, it adopted an -helical conformation, suggesting the helical propensity of nsp11. Finally, we again confirmed the IDP behavior of nsp11 using MD simulations.

The NCATS' National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a centralized data resource representing the largest multicenter cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls nationwide. We aimed to construct and characterize the cancer cohort within N3C and identify risk factors for all-cause mortality from COVID-19. METHODS: We used 4,382,085 patients from 50 US medical centers to construct a cohort of patients with cancer. We restricted analyses to adults &#8805; 18 years old with a COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-negative diagnosis between January 1, 2020, and March 25, 2021. We followed N3C selection of an index encounter per patient for analyses. All analyses were performed in the N3C Data Enclave Palantir platform. RESULTS: A total of 398,579 adult patients with cancer were identified from the N3C cohort; 63,413 (15.9%) were COVID-19-positive. Most common represented cancers were skin (13.8%), breast (13.7%), prostate (10.6%), hematologic (10.5%), and GI cancers (10%). COVID-19 positivity was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.24). Among COVID-19-positive patients, age &#8805; 65 years, male gender, Southern or Western US residence, an adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score &#8805; 4, hematologic malignancy, multitumor sites, and recent cytotoxic therapy were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Patients who received recent immunotherapies or targeted therapies did not have higher risk of overall mortality. CONCLUSION: Using N3C, we assembled the largest nationally representative cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 to date. We identified demographic and clinical factors associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with cancer. Full characterization of the cohort will provide further insights into the effects of COVID-19 on cancer outcomes and the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.","output":"Outcomes of COVID-19 in Patients With Cancer: Report From the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An optical sensor for highly sensitive detection of carbon monoxide (CO) in sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was demonstrated by using quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) technique.

The recruitment was done by personal contact of the research team with potential participants. RESULTS: The co-researchers have formulated nine stories expressing their feelings of gratitude towards the healthcare system and their social environment. The question of a social stigmatization of persons with underlying diseases is critically reflected. The high-risk patients act in a health-competent way, consciously apply personal health resources, such as social contacts or health-promoting daily routines, to avoid negative consequences on their health and to increase their well-being.

Measurements and main results Twenty-three patients received full anticoagulation with bivalirudin and 60 with heparin. Despite patients in the bivalirudin group had higher mortality risk scores (SAPS II was 60  16 vs 39 7, p <0.001) and higher need of extracorporeal support compared to heparin group, hospital mortality was comparable (57% vs 45, p=0.3). No difference in thromboembolic complications was observed, and bleeding events were more frequent in patients treated with bivalirudin (65% vs 40%,p=0.01). Similar results were confirmed in the subgroup analysis of patients undergoing intravenous anticoagulation: in addiction to comparable thrombotic complications occurrence and thrombocytopenia rate, however, no difference in bleeding rate was observed (65% vs 35%, p=0.08). Conclusions Although heparin is the most used anticoagulant in the intensive care setting, a bivalirudin-based anticoagulation was safe and effective in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 critically ill patients.

Although the majority of transmissions often occurs within social groups6-9, the contribution of connections that bridge groups and species to pathogen dynamics is poorly understood10-12. These cryptic connections-which are often indirect or infrequent-provide transmission routes between otherwise disconnected individuals and may have a key role in large-scale outbreaks that span multiple populations or species. Here we quantify the importance of cryptic connections in disease dynamics by simultaneously characterizing social networks and tracing transmission dynamics of surrogate-pathogen epidemics through eight communities of bats. We then compared these data to the invasion of the fungal pathogen that causes white-nose syndrome, a recently emerged disease that is devastating North American bat populations13-15. We found that cryptic connections increased links between individuals and between species by an order of magnitude. Individuals were connected, on average, to less than two per cent of the population through direct contact and to only six per cent through shared groups. However, tracing surrogate-pathogen dynamics showed that each individual was connected to nearly fifteen per cent of the population, and revealed widespread transmission between solitarily roosting individuals as well as extensive contacts among species. Connections estimated from surrogate-pathogen epidemics, which include cryptic connections, explained three times as much variation in the transmission of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome as did connections based on shared groups. These findings show how cryptic connections facilitate the community-wide spread of pathogens and can lead to explosive epidemics.","output":"Cryptic connections illuminate pathogen transmission within community networks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has emerged as a valuable modality for bowel imaging in adults and children.

After learning about the Model for Improvement and various quality improvement tools, students worked in teams of four to conduct several plan-do-study-act cycles. Postsession surveys captured student satisfaction, session feedback, and reflections about conducting improvement work. Two medical students then applied conventional content analysis to identify themes to describe the data. Results Student projects focused on addressing patients' health care and social resource needs through telephone and electronic interactions. Five themes were identified in the survey results: (1) learning by doing in the dynamic nature of improvement work; (2) enjoyment of virtual team-based learning; (3) project relevance to COVID-19; (4) utility of quality improvement tools; and (5) continuous curriculum improvement with student feedback. Conclusions In this student-led endeavor, we implemented a virtual improvement curriculum where first-year medical students apply improvement science knowledge to patient needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This led the government to decide that the population should be locked down at home to reduce the spread of the disease and avoid the collapse of the health system. Considering this, this study analyzed the changes in intimate relationships that occurred during lockdown in terms of dyadic adjustment, conflict, and quality of the relationship, as well as their relationship with anxiety symptoms. METHOD Cross-sectional questionnaire-based study with adults (N = 342) aged 20-67 years who lived in Spain. Each participant completed self-report measures of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state and trait subscales), dyadic adjustment (Dyadic Adjustment Scale), relationship conflict and quality, and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS The results showed significant levels of state anxiety, which was associated with poorer dyadic adjustment and a decrease in the perceived quality of relationships since the start of lockdown. Increased partner conflict seems to be an important predictor of dyadic adjustment and relationship quality during social isolation. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the population, especially women. This finding is closely associated with difficulties with one's cohabiting partner (e.g., worse dyadic adjustment), but the most determining factor seems to be the previous state of the relationship.

Although pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a variety of cardiovascular complications have been reported. An integrated diagnostic algorithm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with suspected cardiac involvement (laboratory findings of myocardial injury and electrocardiographic changes) may help to avoid unnecessary examinations and minimize the risk of operator infection. Due to its mobility and bedside feasibility, echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in this clinical setting. It quickly provides information on ventricular functions, pulmonary hypertension, valve disease and pericardial effusion. In case of ST-segment elevation (STE), urgent coronary angiography should be performed. Cardiac ultrasound helps distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardial disease and may detect pericardial disease. Transmural ischemic electrocardiographic changes, with or without early elevated troponin levels or echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities, will determine the need for early invasive coronary angiography. Computed tomography (CT) through its multiple applications (chest CT; CT pulmonary angiography and coronary CT angiography; late iodine enhancement CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance might be helpful in reinforcing or redirecting diagnostic hypothesis emerged by other clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The current pandemic makes it challenging to perform serial invasive and non-invasive diagnostic testing in COVID-19 patients and high serum troponin level.

We aimed to analyze the spatial distribution and factors associated with the risk of SARS and death in COVID-19 cases using routine record data and to develop and validate a prognostic tool for risk of death by Covid-19. Methods: : A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2020 to April 2021 in the South Zone of the city of S?o Paulo, SP, Brazil, with 16,061 positive cases of COVID-19. The data were -obtained from the records of the Brazilian Ministry of Health notification systems for flu-like syndrome (eSUS-VE) and hospitalized SARS (SIVEP-Gripe). The spatial distribution of the cases is represented in 2D kernel density. To assess the possible factors associated with the outcomes, generalized linear and generalized additive logistic models were adjusted. To assess the discriminatory power the C-statistic was used. A calculator was developed based on a prognostic model for the risk of death, validated with accuracy measures in the sample, internal validation and temporal validation. Results: : The average age of patients was 42.1 years. Evolved to SARS 925 (11.98%) and 375 (2.37%) died. The comorbidities associated with a higher risk of SARS were obesity (OR=25.32) and immunodepression (OR=12.15). The comorbidities associated with a higher risk of death were renal diseases (OR=11.8) and obesity (OR=8.49), with clinical and demographic information being more important than the spatial area. The COVID-19 risk of death calculator showed an accuracy of 92.2% in the sample build, 92.3% in the internal validation and 80% in the temporal validation. Conclusions: Age and comorbidities were identified as the most associated factors to the severity of the disease. For the death analysis, the socioeconomic condition is included in addition to these factors.

The study aimed to compare cost of FreeStyle Libre 2 system and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population from the Spanish Health System perspective. METHODS: On the basis of data collected from a literature review, the cost of glucose monitoring was modelled for patients with T2DM on a basal-bolus insulin regimen. The cost estimate included annual consumption for glucose monitoring (strips, lancets and sensors) and severe hypoglycaemic events (SHE) management. A published rate of SHE (2.5 episodes/patient-year) was considered. A reduction of SHE (? 48.8%) associated with FreeStyle Libre 2 system, derived from the REPLACE trial, was applied. Hospital attendance for 20.5% of SHEs (with subsequent hospitalization in 16.0%) was applied. Consumption of strips and lancets was set at 6/day for SMBG (derived from national monitoring recommendations), and 0.2/day for FreeStyle Libre 2 system users, with 26 FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors/year. Unitary costs (, year 2020 excluding VAT) were derived from literature (0.28/strip; 0.09/lancet; 3.09/daily FM sensor; 3804/hospitalized SHE; 1794/hospital-attended non-admitted SHE; 389/community-attended SHE). RESULTS: Costs were 2700 and 2120/year/patient using SMBG or FreeStyle Libre 2 system, respectively. For 1000 patients with T2DM using basal-bolus insulin, 1220 SHEs/year (with 48 hospitalizations) could be prevented and FreeSytle Libre 2 system could generate cost savings of up to 580,953/year versus SMBG (? 21.5%).

In this article, we exploit an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design to examine which aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic 18-25-year-olds found most challenging. We report analyses of American Voices Project (AVP) qualitative in-depth interview data, a MyVoice text-message open-ended survey, and Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data, all collected in 2020. Our interview and text-message results show that young adults were distressed about the effects of COVID-19 on the health of loved ones and older Americans. Young adults expressed concerns that the pandemic was not being treated sufficiently seriously by some politicians and the general public. The policy response was seen to be inadequate to the task of containing the disease, and some feared that the pandemic would never end. Statistical analyses of the HPS confirm that young adults' scores on the HPS's anxiety scale were significantly negatively associated with state-level policy responses. Overall, our results show that young adults found virus mitigation strategies challenging, but that a strong policy response was associated with reduced levels of psychological distress.

They are classified into at least three species, HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C, which are characterized by sequencing the 5 untranslated region (UTR) or the VP4/VP2 region of the genome. Given the increased interest for novel HRV strain identification and their worldwide distribution, we have carried out clinical and molecular diagnosis of HRV strains in a 2-year study of children with acute respiratory infection visiting one district hospital in Shanghai. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We cloned and sequenced a 924-nt fragment that covered part of the 5UTR and the VP4/VP2 capsid genes. Sixty-four HRV-infected outpatients were diagnosed amongst 827 children with acute low respiratory tract infection. Two samples were co-infected with HRV-A and HRV-B or HRV-C. By comparative analysis of the VP4/VP2 sequences of the 66 HRVs, we showed a high diversity of strains in HRV-A and HRV-B species, and a prevalence of 51.5% of strains that belonged to the recently identified HRV-C species. When analyzing a fragment of the 5 UTR, we characterized at least two subspecies of HRV-C: HRV-Cc, which clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B, and HRV-Ca, which resulted from previous recombination in this region with sequences related to HRV-A. The full-length sequence of one strain of each HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc subspecies was obtained for comparative analysis. We confirmed the close relationship of their structural proteins but showed apparent additional recombination events in the 2A gene and 3UTR of the HRV-Ca strain. Double or triple infections with HRV-C and respiratory syncytial virus and/or bocavirus were diagnosed in 33.3% of the HRV-infected patients, but no correlation with severity of clinical outcome was observed. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high diversity of HRV strains that cause bronchitis and pneumonia in children. A predominance of HRV-C over HRV-A and HRV-B was observed, and two subspecies of HRV-C were identified, the diversity of which seemed to be related to recombination with former HRV-A strains. None of the HRV-C strains appeared to have a higher clinical impact than HRV-A or HRV-B on respiratory compromise.","output":"Evidence of Recombination and Genetic Diversity in Human Rhinoviruses in Children with Acute Respiratory Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age1,2. Adults develop respiratory symptoms, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most severe form, while children are largely spared from respiratory illness but can develop a life-threatening multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)3-5. Here, we show distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adult COVID-19 cohorts had anti-spike (S) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibody, while children with and without MIS-C had reduced breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, predominantly generating IgG antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein. Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children independent of whether they develop MIS-C, with implications for developing age-targeted strategies for testing and protecting the population.","output":"Distinct antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults across the COVID-19 clinical spectrum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and event system theory (EST), this study constructed a moderated mediating model to investigate the direct effect of career calling on work fatigue, the mediating effect of role overload, and the moderating effect of COVID-19 event disruption in the above relationships.

This observational study aimed to identify demographic and morphologic factors associated with difficult FB intubation. METHODS We recruited 420 adult elective surgery patients undergoing tracheal intubation during general anesthesia. Patients characteristics were recorded including age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, history of snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, Mallampati score, upper lip bite test score, neck circumference and skinfold thickness, maximal neck flexion and extension angles, absence of teeth, Cormack and Lehane grade, presence of blood or secretions during intubation, as well as the inter-incisor, thyromental, sternothyroid, and manubriomental distances. The time (duration) needed to complete intubation (primary endpoint) and the number of attempts needed were correlated with these patient characteristics in a multivariable analysis. RESULTS Intubation was successful on the first attempt in 409/420 patients (97%). Seven patients (1.7%) needed more than one attempt. Failure to intubate with the FB occurred in four patients (1%). A correlation was found between intubation duration and visibility impaired by secretions or blood (P < 0.001), higher neck skinfold thickness (P < 0.001), and larger endotracheal tube diameter (relative to a constant 5.5 mm FB; P < 0.001).

RESULTS A total of 18 patients were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19, then underwent PC. The patients comprised 14 (78%) males and 4 (22%) females with an average age of 73.4 years (range, 67-81 years). In 17 (94%) patients, symptoms associated with acute cholecystitis decreased within 48-72 h of the PC treatment and a clinical improvement was determined.

The objective of this study was to quantify the frequency of barriers encountered by patients seeking to fill buprenorphine prescriptions from pharmacies in United States (US) counties with high opioid-related mortality. METHODS: To characterize buprenorphine availability, we conducted a telephone audit (\\"secret shopper\\") study using a standardized script in two randomly selected pharmacies (one chain, one independent) in US counties reporting higher than average opioid overdose rates. Availability across pharmacy type (chain versus independent), county characteristics (rurality, region, overdose rate), and day of week were analyzed using univariate tests of categorical data. Independent predictors of buprenorphine availability were then identified using a multivariable binomial regression model. RESULTS: Among 921 pharmacies contacted (467 chain, 454 independent), 73 % were in urban counties and 42 % were in Southern states. Of these pharmacies, 675 (73 %) reported being able to dispense buprenorphine. There were 183 (20 %) pharmacies that indicated they would not dispense buprenorphine.

Prior to the development of specific drug therapies or a vaccine, more immediately available treatments were sought including convalescent plasma. A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Convalescent plasma was collected from an existing network of plasma donation centers. A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases. RESULTS: Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activity (per mg/ml IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B, and anti-D) were reduced to minimal levels.

Based on the technology acceptance model, this research proposes an integrated research model of online education participation intention to investigate university students online education participation intention to reveal the key factors and mechanisms that affect online education participation intention. A structural equation model of participation intention is constructed, and 342 valid samples are obtained by questionnaire survey. The empirical results of PLS-SEM show that: (1) students participation attitude positively affects their participation intention;(2) the perceived ease of use and usefulness positively affect their participation attitude, and the perceived usefulness and ease of use affect their participation intention through the complete mediation of participation attitude;(3) the perceived playfulness does not have a significant impact on participation attitude but has a positive impact on participation intention;(4) the innovative discovery university support positively moderates the relationship between participation attitude and intention during such emergencies. The research found that improving students attitudes toward participation, perceived ease of use, usefulness, playfulness, and strengthening university support are all helpful to optimize students participation intention in online education. At the same time, it also explored operability suggestions for improving the quality of online education and optimizing future education.","output":"Do Playfulness and University Support Facilitate the Adoption of Online Education in a Crisis?

Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020, and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients with 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory test results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Although there was a trend toward increased rates of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak C-reactive protein values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, although HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all 3 patients died during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared with matched non-HIV patients. A larger study is required to determine whether the trends we observed apply to all HIV-positive patients.","output":"Outcomes Among HIV-Positive Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: and aims : In this study we aimed to assess multiple addiction-related behaviours simultaneously for an extended period of time during the Covid-19 pandemic and their relation to distress. Methods: Data were collected every three days from Amazons MTurk between 26.03.2020 and 02.10.2020 in cohorts of 25 participants resulting in a total sample of 1430 US adults (60% men, mean age 36.6 years, SD = 11). General distress and Covid-19 related fear were assessed as well as self-reported frequency of eight potentially addictive behaviours: shopping (compulsive buying), alcohol, smoking, legal substances, illegal substances, gambling, gaming and overeating. Results: : We found a positive relationship between time and the frequency of each self-reported addiction-related behaviour (? = 0.15 - 0.23, all p<0.001), and their frequency is linearly related to the intensity of (Covid-19-related and general) distress (? = 0.12 - 0.28, all p<0.001). Most popular activities were gaming and compulsive buying, and the relative frequency of the behaviours remained about the same during the data collection period. Discussion: It is possible that people seek substitutes when other coping mechanisms (e.g. social recreation) are hindered depending on their level of distress . Conclusion: Given the evidence for the increasing frequency of addiction-related excessive behaviours and their relevance to distress, special attention needs to be paid to reduce potential harmful effects of maladaptive coping during and after this demanding period.","output":"Addiction-related behavioral problems increase during the first six months of the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sustained stress during COVID-19 may be associated with depression in front-line medical staff, which would expose them to severe threats. This study aimed to examine whether the relationship between perceived stress and depression is mediated by insomnia, and whether this mediation is moderated by resilience. METHODS: For front-line medical staff, this study used online questionnaire to evaluate their perceived stress, depression, insomnia and resilience. A conditional process model was performed to examine the relationship between perceived stress and depression, as well as the mediating effect of insomnia and the moderating effect of resilience. RESULTS: A total of 606 front-line medical staff completed the survey. Higher level of perceived stress was significantly positively related to severe insomnia and depression. In addition, insomnia was positively related to depression, while resilience could moderate the effect of perceived stress on depression by direct and indirect paths. LIMITATIONS: The causality among perceived stress, depression, insomnia and resilience is difficult to be verified. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived stress is positively related to depression, and insomnia can mediate the effect of perceived stress on depression. In addition, the effect of perceived stress on depression, whether direct or indirect, is moderated by resilience, which is a protective factor for mental health.","output":"Relationship between perceived stress and depression in Chinese front-line medical staff during COVID-19: A conditional process model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes a novel approach to expand in run-time the knowledge base of an Artificial Conversational Agent.

The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative's campaign involves a proportional framework to finance and distribute SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. However, the COVAX framework has critical limitations, including limited funding and the failure to account for the special epidemic risks and needs of its participating nations, as recommended by the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization framework. These drawbacks disproportionately impact Africa, where many nations rely on COVAX as their main source of vaccines. The current plan to vaccinate only up to 20% of participating nations' populations is short-sighted from both epidemiologic and moral perspectives. COVAX must commit to vaccinating all of Africa and its initiative must be modified to account for the health and economic infrastructures in these countries. Lessons learned from successful vaccination campaigns, including the West African Ebola outbreak, have shown that vaccinating all of Africa is possible and feasible, and that infrastructure and human resources can support mass vaccination. To halt this global pandemic, global responsibility must be accepted to finance and equitably distribute SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to African nations.

This advancement of social media disclosures has numerous merits and demerits to prevent and control contagious diseases like the Covid-19 pandemic. In this respect, this research scrutinizes the role of creative social media use in preventing the Covid-19 outbreak in Bangladesh utilizing the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. To this end, this study uses an online survey from June to October 2020 engaging 265 (N = 265) Bangladeshi people as respondents at different ages. The study results establish that creative social media use helps enhance the knowledge of Covid-19 precautions online, and this pertinent knowledge contributes to preventing Covid-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. It implies that creative social media use has a significant indirect effect on Covid-19 prevention, whereas knowledge of Covid-19 precautions online mediates this relationship between creative social media use and Covid-19 prevention. The results also discover that the educational level of the people has a significant direct and positive impact on Covid-19 prevention.

However, it needs an adequate learning curve, and it may be challenging in non-expert hands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Transcollation Technology over Traditional Electrocautery to perform hilar and mediastinal dissection during VATS lobectomy. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study including consecutive patients undergoing VATS lobectomy for lung cancer. Patients were divided in two groups based on whether Transcollation Technology (TT Group) or Traditional Electrocautery (TE Group) was used for hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Operative time and surgical outcome, including number of transfusions, length of chest drainage, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality were registered, and the inter-group differences were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: 53 patients were included in the final analysis. The TT Group (n = 24) compared to the TE Group (n = 29) showed significant shorter operative time (75.2  25.8 min versus 98.1  33.3 min; p = 0.023), and reduction of length of chest tube stay (4.7  0.8 days vs. 6.8  1.1 days, p = 0.013) and length of hospital stay (5.3  1.9 days vs. 6.8  1.1 days, p = 0.007). No intraoperative or major postoperative complications were observed in either groups.

We present our experience with such a case where all known etiologies were ruled out and the cause of deterioration could not be conclusively identified. The course was found to be similar to sub-acute post-traumatic ascending myelopathy (SPAM). However, the condition has only been described for traumatic injuries so far. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient presented a history of back pain and associated gait instability for one and a half months. There was no history of trauma. Investigations suggested an Anderson-like lesion at T11CT12 with cord edema at the same level suggestive of instability. She underwent posterior stabilization T9 to L2 and laminectomy of T11 as well as T12 under neuromonitoring. The postoperative sequence of events included an episode of pyrexia on the fifth day of surgery, neurological deterioration from the seventh day of surgery proceeding to complete paraplegia by the fourteenth day, no response to steroid treatment and no signs of recovery till two years post surgery. MRI findings were suggestive of SPAM, and there was no evidence of infection. DISCUSSION: Ascending myelopathy is a potential but rare cause of delayed deterioration in neurological status after surgical intervention. MRI findings of cord edema extending more than four levels above the involved segments is a characteristic finding of the condition. Ascending myelopathy may lead to complete cord injury. The precise cause of the condition is unknown and prognosis remains poor.","output":"A rare cause of neurological deterioration to complete paraplegia after surgery for thoracic myelopathy: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The antiviral effect of anti-influenza drugs such as zanamivir may be demonstrated in patients as an increased rate of decline in viral load over a time course of treatment as compared with placebo. Historically this was measured using plaque assays, or Culture Enhanced Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (CE-ELISA). Objectives: to develop and characterise real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to measure influenza A and B viral load in clinical samples, that offer improvements over existing methods, in particular virus infectivity assays. Study design: The dynamic range and robustness were established for the real time qPCR assays along with stability of the assay components. Cross validation of the real time PCR assays with CE-ELISA was performed by parallel testing of both serial dilutions of three different subtypes of cultured virus and a panel of influenza positive throat swab specimens. Results: the assays were specific for influenza A and B and the dynamic ranges were at least seven logs. The assay variability was within acceptable limits but increased towards the lower limit of quantification, which was 3.33 log(10) viral cDNA copies/ml of virus transport medium (ten viral RNA copies/PCR). The components of the assay were robust enough to withstand extended storage and several freezeCthaw cycles. For the real time PCR assays the limit of quantification was equivalent to the virus infectivity cut off, which equates to a 93-fold increase in sensitivity.

VWF exists in plasma as multimers of increasing size, with the largest (high molecular weight; HMW) expressing the greatest functional activity. A deficiency of VWF is associated with a bleeding disorder called von Willebrand disease (VWD), whereas an excess of VWF, in particular the HMW forms, is associated with thrombosis. ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif-13), also known as VWF-cleaving protease, functions to moderate the activity of VWF by cleaving multimers of VWF and limiting the expression of the largest multimers of VWF. A deficiency of ADAMTS13 is therefore associated with an excess of (HMW forms of) VWF, and thus thrombosis. Indeed, any disturbance of the VWF/ADAMTS13 ratio or axis may be associated with pathophysiological processes, including prothrombotic tendency. However, both thrombosis or bleeding may be associated with such disturbances, depending on the presenting events.

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the pandemic on the workers of a hospital located in one of the most affected areas of Madrid (Alcala de Henares) using a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). METHODS: We conducted a seroprevalence survey between June 25th and July 31st, 2020, over hospital workers from our institution. This study population was previously analyzed using a diagnostic approach which consisted of PCR and a serologic rapid test. For the present survey, prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was studied using chemiluminescence. We analyzed the prevalence in healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (nHCW). Information about professional category, use of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and previous COVID-19 contacts was collected to determine the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables) and the two-tailed Fisher's exact test (categorical variables). Risk factors for seropositivity were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 2,219 workers were included and 847 of them (38.2%) presented IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, being seroprevalence significantly higher for HCW (39.3%) than for nHCW (30.7%, p=0.006).

To determine the region of S responsible, overlapping DNA fragments spanning the entire S gene were cloned and expressed as fusion proteins by in vitro transcription and translation. Fusion proteins containing relevant epitopes were identified by radioimmunoprecipitation with neutralizing and enhancing FIPV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). A region spanning residues 509 to 673 reacted with most MAbs tested. Translation in the presence of microsomal membranes did not enhance reactivity, suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for recognition by the MAbs. To localize the antigenic sites further, several MAb-resistant (mar) mutants of FIPV were cloned and sequenced. Amino acid residues that contribute to the neutralizing and enhancing epitopes were localized to two regions, designated A1 and A2, which show partial overlap with the homologous antigenic site A of transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Site A1 contains residues 568 and 591 and is homologous with part of subsite Aa of transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Site A2 contains residues 643, 649, and 656. Double mutations in sites A1 and A2 were found in mar mutants derived from neutralizing and enhancing MAbs 23F4.5 and 18A7.4, while a single mutation in site A2 was found in a mar mutant derived from MAb 24H5.4, which is neutralizing but not enhancing.

METHODS An SILS? port using three 5-mm instrument cannulas or EndoCone? port was used to perform an initial limited laparoscopic abdominal exploration. The stomach and descending duodenum were explored intracorporeally and the jejunum through orad descending colon was explored extracorporeally. All intestinal procedures (enterotomy, biopsy, resection, and anastomosis) were performed extracorporeally. Omentalization of affected bowel was accomplished either intracorporeally or extracorporeally. Short-term outcome was determined. RESULTS SILAIS was completed successfully in all but 1 dog and all animals had a good short-term outcome. Most (n = 5) animals were discharged the day after surgery. SILAIS was performed in a median of 120 minutes (interquartile range; 82-148 minutes) and was associated with a moderate level of difficulty.

Antioxidant supplementation may be helpful to control inflammatory processes and consequential skin damage. The clinical performance and safety of an emollient medical device for topical treatment enriched with antioxidant ingredients in adults with mild-to-moderate dermatitis is presented in this manuscript. METHODS: We performed a monocenter, open\\\\label, uncontrolled clinical trial. Participants applied the product twice a day for 28 days. No other medication or moisturizer was allowed. Changes in dermatitis severity were assessed at days 14 and 28 by study investigators. Subjects self-assessed pruritus, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and product satisfaction. At the end of the study, a global evaluation of the product was done both by patient-reported outcomes and investigators evaluations. RESULTS: Forty subjects were enrolled in the study (mean age 35 years). Treatment success was achieved in 87.5% of subjects (p < 0.0001) after 28 days. Mean Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores decreased at days 14 and 28 (p < 0.0001). Subjects reported a reduction in pruritus severity and improvement of quality of life (p < 0.0001), along with satisfaction with the product. At the end of the study, skin condition improved in more than 90% of subjects. No safety issues were identified.

Two experiments entailing two culturally sensitive variablesself-construal (interdependent vs. independent) and temporal framing (present vs. future oriented)were conducted with some similar patterns identified between cultures: For one, narrative persuasion can successfully increase the matching effect of interdependent self-construal and present-oriented temporal framing on eliciting higher intentions of preventative behaviors;nonnarrative messages, on the other hand, are more effective to enhance the matching effect of independent selfconstrual and future-oriented temporal framing. The study also confirms the mediating role of self-efficacy. When collective efficacy, a multilayered mediator was added to the hypothesized model, it was found that Chinese participants attained collective efficacy at familial and national levels, whereas American participants behavioral intentions were mostly mediated by collective efficacy at familial and organizational levels.

METHODS Children under 2 years admitted with fever and/or respiratory symptoms were enrolled from 2010 to 2013 in Amman, Jordan. Nasal/throat swabs were collected and stored for testing. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected through parent/guardian interviews and medical chart abstractions. Prior stored specimens were tested for HCoVs (HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63) by qRT-PCR. RESULTS Of the 3168 children enrolled, 6.7% were HCoVs-positive. Among HCoV-positive children, the median age was 3.8 (1.9-8.4) months, 59% were male, 14% were premature, 11% had underlying medical conditions and 76% had viral-codetection. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, fever, wheezing and shortness of breath. HCoVs were detected year-round, peaking in winter-spring months. Overall, 56%, 22%, 13% and 6% were OC43, NL63, HKU1 and 229E, respectively. There was no difference in disease severity between the species, except higher intensive care unit admission frequency in NL63-positive subjects. CONCLUSIONS HCoVs were detected in around 7% of children enrolled in our study. Despite HCoV detection in children with ARI with highest peaks in respiratory seasons, the actual burden and pathogenic role of HCoVs in ARI merits further evaluation given the high frequency of viral codetection.","output":"Coronavirus Surveillance in a Pediatric Population in Jordan From 2010 to 2013: A Prospective Viral Surveillance Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health care delivery in all aspects of medicine, including abortion care.

In response to growing demands on the healthcare systems, new models of healthcare delivery are emerging. Community paramedicine is a novel approach in which paramedics use their knowledge and skills beyond emergency health response to contribute to preventative and rehabilitative health. In our systematic review, we aimed to identify evidence of the community paramedicine role in care delivery for elderly patients, with an additional focus on palliative care, and the possible impact of this role on the wider healthcare system. METHODS A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Sciences was undertaken to identify relevant full-text articles in English published until October 3, 2019. Additional inclusion criteria were studies focussing on extended care paramedics or community paramedics caring for elderly patients. Case studies were excluded. All papers were screened by at least two authors and underwent a quality assessment, using the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal checklists for cross sectional, qualitative, cohort, and randomised controlled trial studies to assess the methodological quality of the articles. A process of narrative synthesis was used to summarise the data. RESULTS Ten studies, across 13 articles, provided clear evidence that Community Paramedic programs had a positive impact on the health of patients and on the wider healthcare system. The role of a Community Paramedic was often a combination of four aspects: assessment, referral, education and communication. Limited evidence was available on the involvement of Community Paramedics in palliative and end-of-life care and in care delivery in residential aged care facilities. Observed challenges were a lack of additional training, and the need for proper integration and understanding of their role in the healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS The use of community paramedics in care delivery could be beneficial to both patients' health and the wider healthcare system. They already play a promising role in improving the care of our elderly population. With consistent adherence to the training curriculum and effective integration within the wider healthcare system, community paramedics have the potential to take on specialised roles in residential aged care facilities and palliative and end-of-life care.","output":"Reshaping healthcare delivery for elderly patients: the role of community paramedicine; a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant disruption to the cell and gene therapy (CGT) industry, which has historically faced substantial complexities in supply of materials, and manufacturing and logistics processes.

The increasing number of scientific journals in biomedicine and published papers in them has not always been matched by increased quality in publishing due to lack of information and education of the scientific community, especially of the young scientists, about ethical principles in research and publishing. In addition, some unethical behavior, fraud and attempts by experts for increasing their scientific productivity in research and publishing their results in scientific journals was recognized. Objective To present the initiatives, chronology of activities and leading role of Academician Momir Polenakovic towards the establishment and initial development of the Macedonian Association of Medical Editors (MAME) which has a mission for advancing the integrity of science and publishing. Method A retrospective study based on review of the relevant literature, archive materials, minutes from organizational meetings and workshops and other documentation related to activities in the initial process for establishing and defining the mission and objectives of MAME. Results The expansion of higher education and inappropriate implementation of the Bologna Declaration and the European Credit Transfer System in R. Macedonia from 2004/2005 contributed to a decline of the study criteria for obtaining higher education diplomas and postgraduate education degrees, as well as numerous frauds in scientific research and publishing activities in biomedicine and other fields. The first meeting of the Initiative Board for organizing an SEE Conference on research and publishing integrity and a workshop for editors of scientific journals was held in the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts (MASA) on Nov. 1st, 2013. In April 2014 two preparatory meetings of the Organizational Board were held and the Workshop for editors of scientific journals and the Constitutional meeting for establishing MAME were held on Apr. 25, 2014. The first President of MAME (with a two-year mandate) was Academician Momir Polenakovic and in 2016 he was elected as the first Honorary President of MAME.

This study aimed to compare the learning effectiveness between physical classroom and online class learning for dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic by the questionnaire survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire-based online survey was used to evaluate the learning effectiveness on the dental students who took the compulsory course entitled oral pathology and diagnosis in School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University in 2021. Student's t-test and MannCWhitney U test were used to analyze the difference in learning effectiveness between physical classroom and online class learning for dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In this study, dental students tended to have a viewpoint that the learning effectiveness of online class learning was better than that of physical classroom learning. On the contrary, they tended to have a viewpoint that the convenience and fairness of physical classroom examination was better than that of online examination (all P-values < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We conclude that our dental students are ready to take online courses. In terms of blended learning courses, the combination of physical classroom and online courses is the future trend of dental education.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, several antimicrobial drugs have lost their efficacy and are no longer useful to treat life-threatening infections. Since the exacerbation of antimicrobial resistance is likely to be another casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a pressing need to develop innovative strategies to minimize the risk of antimicrobial resistance. AREAS COVERED : Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, I have briefly summarized the current knowledge and challenges in our understanding of antimicrobial resistance, emphasizing quorum sensing and quorum quenching. Our understanding of bacterial communication by quorum sensing to acquire virulence has paved the way to reduce bacterial pathogenicity through quorum quenching. Availability of clinically viable quorum quenching agents would likely to diminish bacterial virulence to create a microenvironment for the host phagocytic cells to reduce bacterial infection. EXPERT OPINION : Future studies that aim to generate clinically useful quorum quenching agents need to be considered. An important benefit of such agents may be a diminished risk of antimicrobial resistance.","output":"Exacerbation of antimicrobial resistance: another casualty of the covid-19

Data were collected from 1111 Polish university students via an online survey conducted between IV and VI 2020. The survey included demographic variables, the level of psychopathological symptoms (General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-28), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress (Impact of Events Scale-Revised, IES-R). The results showed that over half of the studied group of students had some form of sleep disturbances during the period of data collection, with moderate-to-severe insomnia symptoms noted in 21.6%.

Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LV-D) increase was an independent risk factor of HF and adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. In this study, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) system to detect LV-D increase early. Objective: We developed a deep learning model (DLM) to predict left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter (LV-D and LV-S) with internal and external validations and investigated the relationship between ECG-LV-D and echocardiographic LV-D and explored the contributions of ECG-LV-D on future CV outcomes. Methods: Electrocardiograms and corresponding echocardiography data within 7 days were collected and paired for DLM training with 99,692 ECGs in the development set and 20,197 ECGs in the tuning set. The other 7,551 and 11,644 ECGs were collected from two different hospitals to validate the DLM performance in internal and external validation sets. We analyzed the association and prediction ability of ECG-LVD for CV outcomes, including left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, CV mortality, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and coronary artery disease (CAD). Results: The mean absolute errors (MAE) of ECG-LV-D were 5.25/5.29, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) were 0.8297/0.8072 and 0.9295/0.9148 for the detection of mild (56 a?| LV-D < 65 mm) and severe (LV-D a? 65 mm) LV-D dilation in internal/external validation sets, respectively. Patients with normal ejection fraction (EF) who were identified as high ECHO-LV-D had the higher hazard ratios (HRs) of developing new onset LV dysfunction [HR: 2.34, 95% conference interval (CI): 1.78-3.08], CV mortality (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.05-5.05), new-onset AMI (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.36-3.29), and CAD (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26-2.00) in the internal validation set. In addition, the ECG-LV-D presents a 1.88-fold risk (95% CI 1.47-2.39) on new-onset LV dysfunction in the external validation set. Conclusion: The ECG-LV-D not only identifies high-risk patients with normal EF but also serves as an independent risk factor of long-term CV outcomes.","output":"Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Electrocardiogram Predicted Left Ventricle Diameter as an Independent Risk Factor of Long-Term Cardiovascular Outcome in Patients With Normal Ejection Fraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As of 26 March 2021, the Africa CDC had reported 4,159,055 cases of COVID-19 and 111,357 deaths among the 55 African Union Member States; however, no country has published a nationally representative serosurvey as of May 2021. Such data are vital for understanding the pandemic's progression on the continent, evaluating containment measures, and policy planning. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, nationally representative, age-stratified serosurvey in Sierra Leone in March 2021 by randomly selecting 120 Enumeration Areas throughout the country and 10 randomly selected households in each of these. One to two persons per selected household were interviewed to collect information on socio-demographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. Capillary blood was collected by fingerstick, and blood samples were tested using the Hangzhou Biotest Biotech RightSign COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. Total seroprevalence was was estimated after applying sampling weights. FINDINGS: The overall weighted seroprevalence was 2.6% (95% CI 1.9-3.4). This is 43 times higher than the reported number of cases. Rural seropositivity was 1.8% (95% CI 1.0-2.5), and urban seropositivity was 4.2% (95% CI 2.6-5.7). INTERPRETATION: Although overall seroprevalence was low compared to countries in Europe and the Americas (suggesting relatively successful containment in Sierra Leone), our findings indicate enormous underreporting of active cases. This has ramifications for the countrys third wave (which started in June 2021), where the average number of daily reported cases was 87 by the end of the monththis could potentially be on the order of 3,700 actual infections, calling for stronger containment measures in a country with only 0.2% of people fully vaccinated.

The scale of the problem is enormous because we still do not have any specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agent or vaccine. The human immune system has never been exposed to this novel virus, so the viral interactions with the human immune system are completely naive. New approaches are being studied at various levels, including animal in vitro models and human-based studies, to contain the COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible. Many drugs are being tested for repurposing, but so far only remdesivir has shown some positive benefits based on preliminary reports, but these results also need further confirmation via ongoing trials. Otherwise, no other agents have shown an impactful response against COVID-19. Recently, research exploring the therapeutic application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19 has gained momentum. The patients belonging to this subset are most likely beyond the point where they could benefit from an antiviral therapy because most of their illness at this stage of disease is driven by inflammatory (over)response of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the potential of MSCs as a therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19, based on the encouraging results from the preliminary data showing improved outcomes in the progression of COVID-19 disease.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells in COVID-19: A Journey from Bench to Bedside"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To defense harmful stimuli or maintain the immune homeostasis, the body produces and recruits a superfamily of cytokines such as interleukins, interferons, chemokines etc. Among them, chemokines act as crucial regulators in defense systems.

Being endemic to several infectious diseases, Lebanon might be at increased risk of outbreaks as the utilization of RI services might have deteriorated due to the pandemic and the countrys political unrest following the October 2019 uprising. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the utilization of RI services in both the public and private sectors following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was completed electronically, in April 2020, by 345 private pediatricians who are registered in professional associations of physicians in Lebanon and provide immunization services at their clinics. Means of the reported percentages of decrease in the utilization of vaccination services by pediatricians were calculated. As for the public sector, an examination of the monthly differences in the number of administered vaccine doses in addition to their respective percentages of change was performed. Adjustment for the distribution of RI services between the sectors was performed to calculate the national decrease rate. RESULTS: The utilization of vaccination services at the national level decreased by 31%. In the private sector, immunization services provision diminished by 46.9% mainly between February and April 2020. The highest decrease rates were observed for oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and hepatitis A, followed by measles and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The number of vaccine doses administered in the public sector decreased by 20%. The most prominent reductions were detected for the OPV and measles vaccines, and during October 2019 and March 2020.

Guidelines called for reduced frame use and reducing the number of fractions. Our institution implemented these guidelines, and herein we show the resultant effect on patient treatments on our Gamma Knife Icon program. Methods: In early March 2020 we rapidly implemented suggested changes according to ASTRO and other consensus guidelines as they relate to stereotactic radiosurgery in the COVID-19 era. We reviewed the GK Icon schedule at our institution between January 01 and April 30, 2020. We documented age, condition treated, technique (frame vs. mask), and number of fractions. We then tabulated and graphed the number of patients, framed cases, and fractions delivered. Results: Seventy-seven patients were treated on the GK Icon over that period, for a total of 231 fractions. The number of unique patients varied from 18 (April) to 22 (January). Of the 77 patients only 5 were treated using a frame. The number of fractions per month decreased significantly over time, from 70 in January to 36 in April. Likewise, the percentage of single fraction cases increased from 4.5% per month in January to 67% in April. Conclusions: The results presented here show that it is possible to quickly and efficiently change work flows to allow for reduced fractionation and frame use in the time of a global pandemic.

However, some general critical issues have been reported concerning national community health information systems, but no detailed study was found after a non-systematic review in Medline database and institutional websites. OBJECTIVES to assess uniformity and comparability of health information collected by the national health information Systems for Home Care (SIAD), Nursing Homes (FAR), and Hospices (HOS) in Italy, three healthcare settings sharing patients with common conditions and healthcare needs. METHODS information was gathered from current Technical Regulations Papers of the Italian Health Ministry. All variables of the three Information Systems were ordered on the basis of the characteristics provided by the ministerial documents into a single grouping model created for the purpose and their distribution compared among and between the Systems. According to the grouping model, the variables were divided in two main groups: System Variables for administrative, bill, and identification-personal data and the Pathway Variables for patient's conditions and provided healthcare data. Common information content variables among all systems and between two of them were then identified, highlighting those with also identical terminology and allowed values. On the basis of the percentages of common and identical variables, uniformity in content and terminology was then calculated among all systems and between two of them. Besides, levels of content and terminology agreement have been calculated with Cohen's K matching the three Systems in all possible combinations of pairs. RESULTS there are 70 variables in SIAD, 45 variables in FAR, and 34 in HOS. System variables are nearly the half in FAR and HOS, 22 (48.9%) and 17 (50.0%) variables, respectively. Pathway variables are prevalent only in SIAD, with 55 variables (78.6%). Only SIAD and HOS use ICD-9-CM, with 2 (2.8%) and 9 (26.5%) variables, respectively. The three Systems share 18 common variables, with other 16 common between just two of them. Considering the common variables, the total number of variables used by all the Systems is 97, with 23 System variables (23.7%) and 74 Pathway variables (76.3%). Overall, content uniformity among the three Systems is 18.5%, but becomes 60.9% considering only the System variables and 5.4% for the Pathway variables, with respectively 14 and 4 common variables. Among the common variables, 11 have the same denomination and allowed values, with an overall terminological uniformity of 11.3%. Being all of them System variables, no terminological uniformity has been found among the three Systems.The level of content agreement was fair for the couple FAR-HOS (K Cohen 0.26), but null for HOS-SIAD and SIAD-FAR (K Cohen -0.20 and <0.01). Null was also the level of terminological agreement in all the possible pairs of matched systems (K Cohen all negative). CONCLUSIONS content and terminology uniformity of National Health Information Systems in Italy for Home Care, Nursing Homes, and Hospices has been found to be poor, with little reference to standardised classification systems and a scarce level of comparability of the information gathered in the three healthcare settings, although similarity in patients' characteristics and provided health services. Data comparability among them is mainly limited to administrative and identification-personal information, with little possibility of comparing information on patients' conditions and provided healthcare in the three settings. This scarce uniformity might undermine the contribution of national Health Information Systems in the development of community healthcare services in Italy and limit the potential of epidemiological research in this area. Also in the light of the establishment of new national Health Information Systems for Primary Care and Community Hospitals, a methodological reassessment of languages, codes, and evaluation tools used by community health services and information systems is needed.","output":"[Uniformity and comparability of national Health Information Systems for home care, nursing homes, and hospices in Italy]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 can cause a clinical spectrum from asymptomatic disease to life-threatening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).There is an ongoing discussion whether the clinical presentation and ventilatory parameters are the same as typical ARDS or not.There is no clear understanding of how the hemodynamic parameters have been affected in COVID-19 ARDS patients.

Extracted data includes; demographic data, clinical symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and clinical outcomes. The outcome of interest was either discharged or died. Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. RESULTS: the median age was 45 years (range 2-84 years). Majority of the patients were males (66.5%). The most affected age group was 50-59 years (21%). Children and adolescents were least affected; less than 10 years constituted 2.5% and 10-19 years constituted 4.5%. The commonest symptoms at presentation were fever (94%) and cough (92%). Ninety-four patients (47%) had underlying comorbidities; the commonest was hypertension (36%). Based on disease severity; 126 (63%) had mild disease, 22 (11%) had moderate disease and 52 (26%) had severe disease. The commonest complication was Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) seen in 29 (14.5%) patients. Out of the 200 cases managed, 189 (94.5%) were discharged in a stable condition while 11 (5.5%) died. Patients with under lying comorbidities had 9.6% death rate while those without comorbidities had 1.9% death rate. CONCLUSION: among Nigerian patients', COVID-19 affects males more than females while children and adolescents were least affected. The study highlighted the clinical features of COVID-19 patients.

In this study, we present evidence that virion disassembly is a key determinant of reovirus oncolysis. To penetrate cell membranes and initiate infection, the outermost capsid proteins of reovirus must be proteolyzed to generate a disassembled particle called an infectious subviral particle (ISVP). In fibroblasts, this process is mediated by the endo/lysosomal proteases cathepsins B and L. We have analyzed the early events of infection in reovirus-susceptible and -resistant cells. We find that, in contrast to susceptible glioma cells and Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, reovirus-resistant cancer cells and untransformed NIH3T3 cells restrict virion uncoating and subsequent gene expression. Disassembly-restrictive cells support reovirus infection, as in vitro-generated ISVPs establish productive infection, and pretreatment with poly(I:C) does not prevent infection in cancer cells. We find that the level of active cathepsin B and L is increased in tumors and that disassembly-restrictive glioma cells support reovirus oncolysis when grown as a tumor in vivo.

Plasma steady-state gabapentin exposure during GEn treatment was as expected and consistent between treatment periods. No new safety signals or adverse event trends relating to GEn exposure were identified. CONCLUSIONS While the overall results demonstrated efficacy in a PHN population, the differences between treatment periods confound the interpretation. These findings could provide insight into future trial designs.","output":"A phase 2a, randomized, crossover trial of gabapentin enacarbil for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in gabapentin inadequate responders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild to death, with high morbidity and mortality rates reported amongst a vulnerable subset of patients termed high risk. While vaccines remain the primary option for COVID-19 prevention, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as bamlanivimab and etesevimab, have been shown to benefit certain subpopulations after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Unlike vaccine-derived immunity that develops over time, administration of neutralizing mAbs is an immediate and passive immunotherapy, with the potential to reduce disease progression, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and death. Bamlanivimab alone and together with etesevimab hold emergency use authorizations in several countries globally, with countries increasingly transitioning to the use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together and other authorized mAbs on the basis of their evolving variant landscape, regulatory authorizations, and access to drugs. The current guidelines for the administration of bamlanivimab alone or together with etesevimab are informed by an iterative process of testing and development. Herein the rationale for these guidelines is provided by sharing the learnings that have been gathered throughout the development process of these mAbs. In addition, this review addresses the most common clinical questions received from health care professionals (HCPs) and patients regarding indicated population, dose, use with other medications and vaccines, duration of protection, and variants in clinical practice. As prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants can differ by country and state, prescribing HCPs should consider the prevalence of bamlanivimab and etesevimab resistant variants in their area, where data are available, regarding potential efficacy impact when considering treatment options.

Unlike most LMIC countries, the prevalence of smoking in Mexico is higher among the well-off than among the poor. Yet, tobacco tax rates in Mexico are lower than those in most LMIC countries.

More precisely, several tax reforms are analyzed through the so-called Consumption Dominance curves. In addition, the reforms are assumed to be revenue neutral and to give rise to compensating subsidies on specific goods. Our results show that if the Mexican government were to implement a WHO-type reform, poverty among households with at least one smoking member would increase by 2.6 % points. Yet, the deleterious effects are entirely mitigated by price subsidies on staple foods.

A key strategy in the program is to test for presence of antibodies and protect test-negative herds from infection. Because these viruses are endemic, the rate of re-introduction can be high, and a disease-free status will become more uncertain as time from testing elapses. The aim of this study was to estimate the probability of freedom (PostPFree) from BRSV and BCV antibodies over time by use of bulk tank milk (BTM) antibody-testing, geographic information and animal movement data, and to validate the herd-level estimates against subsequent BTM testing. BTM samples were collected from 1148 study herds in West Norway in 2013 and 2016, and these were analyzed for BRSV and BCV antibodies. PostPFree was calculated for herds that were negative in 2013/2014, and updated periodically with new probabilities every three months. Input variables were test sensitivity, the probability of introduction through animal purchase and local transmission. Probability of introduction through animal purchase was calculated by using real animal movement data and herd prevalence in the region of the source herd. The PostPFree from the final three months in 2015 was compared to BTM test results from March 2016 using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. The probability of freedom was generally high for test-negative herds immediately after testing, reflecting the high sensitivity of the tests. It did however, decrease with time since testing, and was greatly affected by purchase of livestock. When comparing the median PostPFree for the final three months to the test results in 2016, it was significantly lower (p < 0.01) for test positive herds. Furthermore, there was a large difference in the proportion of test positive herds between the first and fourth quartile of PostPFree. The results show that PostPFree provides a better estimate of herd-level BTM status for both BRSV and BCV than what can be achieved by relying solely on the previous test-result.","output":"Herd level estimation of probability of disease freedom applied on the Norwegian control program for bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study describes the characteristics of children requiring admission with an acute lower-respiratory disease (ALRD) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.

Subjects and methods: The current study was conducted on a total of 518 people over the social media through the Google e-forms. In the study, the \\"Short Psychological Resilience Scale\\" and the \\"Beck Depression Scale\\" were used to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, t-test, One Way Anova, Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Pearson Correlation Coefficient were used. Results: In the current study, psychological resilience and depression were investigated in relation to different variables. Psychological resilience was found to be higher male participants, educators,university graduates and groups with not mental health problems. Depression was found to be higher females, university students, high school and lower graduates,with mental health problems. When the relationship between psychological resilience and depression was investigated, it was found that there is a medium and negative correlation between them. Moreover, the cut-offpoint for the depression score was set to be 17 and the rate of the people having 17 points or higher scores was found to be 16.6%. Conclusion: In light of the findings of the current study, it can be suggested to offer more mental health care services to those having higher levels of depression.

The probability of the rare event of getting severely sick and hospitalized was overestimated. Overestimation increased in the exponential growth phase of the pandemic and later on decreased again, showing an inverse U-shaped pattern. Individuals showed biases in their risk perception concerning overconfidence and the underestimation of exponential growth of infection cases in the early phase of the pandemic. Forecasts were more accurate after the growth curve had flattened. Risk perceptions increased with perceived dread and tended to increase with perceived control over infection, the evaluation of scientific and own knowledge about the pandemic. Approval for the introduction of stricter governmental measures and acceptance of future vaccination measures was mainly influenced by rational utilitarian factors of risk perception (probabilities and utilities of outcomes). These rational influences were mediated by dread, but dread had an additional potentially irrational effect. Adherence to governmental recommendations was mainly driven by dread and positive expected long-term consequences of the measures. To a smaller degree, adherence increased with perceived personal consequences of infection and decreased with negative expected short-term consequences of these measures.

Since the start of July, cases have increased, while deaths have continued to decrease. Methods We report results from 594,000 swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained from a representative sample of people in England over four rounds collected regardless of symptoms, starting in May 2020 and finishing at the beginning of September 2020. Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. Findings Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. Interpretation Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study included 435,504 UK Biobank participants. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study used the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative in 1.6 million participants. We examined associations of total adiposity, body composition, fat distribution and metabolic consequences of excess weight, particularly type 2 diabetes, with incidence and severity of COVID-19, assessed by test positivity, hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. RESULTS: BMI and body fat were associated with COVID-19 in the observational and MR analyses but muscle mass was not. The observational study suggested the association with central fat distribution was stronger than for BMI, but there was little evidence from the MR analyses than this was causal. There was evidence that strong associations of metabolic consequences with COVID-19 outcomes in observational but not MR analyses. Type 2 diabetes was strongly associated with COVID-19 in observational but not MR analyses. In adjusted models, the observational analysis showed that the association of BMI with COVID-19 diminished, while central fat distribution and metabolic consequences of excess weight remained strongly associated. In contrast, MR showed the reverse, with only BMI retaining a direct effect on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Excess total adiposity is probably casually associated with severe COVID-19.

This systematic review aims to explore the prevalence of comorbidities among cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection and their impact on mortality. METHODS: Online databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of science were searched for articles published between 9th July 2019 to July 8th 2020.Studies of cancer patients (>18 years) with diagnosis of SARS CoV-2 infection, published in English were included.

RESULTS: Total 31studies with 4086 SARS-CoV-2 infectedcancer patientsmet the inclusion criteria. Most prevalent co-morbidities in cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection were hypertension [42.3% (95%CI:37.5- 47.0)], diabetes [17.8% (95% CI: 15.3-20.4)] and cardiovascular diseases [16.7% (95%CI:12.9-20.4)].The risk of mortality (pOR) was significantly higher in individuals with hypertension[1.6(95%CI 1.24-2.00)], cardiovascular diseases [2.2 (95%CI 1.49- 3.27)], chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [1.4(95% CI 1.05-2.00)] and diabetes [1.35(95%CI 1.06-1.73)].

EXPERIENCES: ACS made system, treatment, harm reduction, and discharge planning adaptations. System changes included patient visits shifting to primarily telephone-based consultations and ACS leading regional COVID-19 emergency response efforts such as substance use treatment care coordination for people experiencing homelessness in COVID-19 isolation units and regional substance use treatment initiatives. Treatment adaptations included providing longer buprenorphine bridge prescriptions at discharge with telemedicine follow-up appointments and completing benzodiazepine tapers or benzodiazepine alternatives for people with alcohol use disorder who could safely detoxify in outpatient settings. We believe that regulatory changes to buprenorphine, and in Vancouver other medications for opioid use disorder, helped increase engagement for hospitalized patients, as many of the barriers preventing them from accessing care on an ongoing basis were reduced. COVID-19 specific harm reductions recommendations were adopted and disseminated to inpatients. Discharge planning changes included peer mentors and social workers increasing hospital in-reach and discharge outreach for high-risk patients, in some cases providing prepaid cell phones for patients without phones. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE: We believe that ACS were essential to hospitals readiness to support patients that have been systematically marginilized during the pandemic. We suggest that hospitals invest in telehealth infrastructure within the hospital, and consider cellphone donations for people without cellphones, to help maintain access to care for vulnerable patients. In addition, we recommend hospital systems evaluate the impact of such interventions.

The radiological abnormality was felt to be consistent with a pneumonitis associated with some small airway disease. The clustering of these deaths, occurring in a similar unusual manner, was felt to constitute an outbreak warranting investigation. An Incident Committee was established to plan and manage a large multidisciplinary investigation during which the unit was temporarily closed.

In addition, we made an attempt to explain concerns and problems raised by the families, the importance of providing SLP services during the critical period of speech and language development, telepractice services, the roles of speech-language-hearing related scientific associations, and the roles of SLPs during the outbreak of COVID-19.","output":"Provision of speech-language pathology services for the treatment of speech and language disorders in children during the COVID-19 pandemic: Problems, concerns, and solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most effective methods of preventing COVID-19 infection include maintaining physical distancing and wearing a face mask while in close contact with people in public places. However, densely populated areas have a greater incidence of COVID-19 dissemination, which is caused by people who do not comply with standard operating procedures (SOPs). This paper presents a prototype called PADDIE-C19 (Physical Distancing Device with Edge Computing for COVID-19) to implement the physical distancing monitoring based on a low-cost edge computing device. The PADDIE-C19 provides real-time results and responses, as well as notifications and warnings to anyone who violates the 1-m physical distance rule. In addition, PADDIE-C19 includes temperature screening using an MLX90614 thermometer and ultrasonic sensors to restrict the number of people on specified premises. The Neural Network Processor (KPU) in Grove Artificial Intelligence Hardware Attached on Top (AI HAT), an edge computing unit, is used to accelerate the neural network model on person detection and achieve up to 18 frames per second (FPS). The results show that the accuracy of person detection with Grove AI HAT could achieve 74.65% and the average absolute error between measured and actual physical distance is 8.95 cm. Furthermore, the accuracy of the MLX90614 thermometer is guaranteed to have less than 0.5 C value difference from the more common Fluke 59 thermometer.

METHODS During a \\"circuit-breaker\\" period in Singapore, the Nanyang Polytechnic School of Health & Social Sciences (Oral Health Therapy) distributed portable manikins and instruments to students and staff for use at home. Synchronous teaching sessions with real-time feedback were carried out over the Zoom teleconferencing platform. A cross-sectional survey of students was conducted after 3 weeks of the HBSL program. Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to assess the association between satisfaction with domains of simulation design and overall satisfaction with HBSL. RESULTS The top three factors of importance to students in HBSL were feedback and guided reflection, support, and objectives and information. Final-year students expressed higher levels of overall satisfaction and self-confidence following HBSL than first-year students.

Our protocol advised early CPAP and self-proning for severe cases, aiming to prevent rather than respond to deterioration. CPAP was provided outside critical care by ward staff supported by physiotherapists and an intensive critical care outreach program. Data were analysed descriptively and compared against a large UK cohort (ISARIC).Results559 patients admitted before 1 May 2020 were included. 376 were discharged alive, and 183 died. 165 patients (29.5%) received CPAP, 40 (7.2%) were admitted to critical care and 28 (5.0%) were ventilated. Hospital mortality was 32.7%, and 50% for critical care. Following CPAP, 62% of patients with S:F or P:F ratios indicating moderate or severe ARDS, who were candidates for escalation, avoided intubation. Figures for critical care admission, intubation and hospital mortality are lower than ISARIC, whilst critical care mortality is similar. Following ISARIC proportions we would have admitted 92 patients to critical care and intubated 55. Using the described protocol, we intubated 28 patients from 40 admissions, and remained within our expanded critical care capacity.ConclusionBradford?s protocol produced good results despite our population having high levels of co-morbidity and ethnicities associated with poor outcomes.

Recently, the human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) has received considerable attention as an infectious agent candidate that might be associated with the pathogenesis of MS. The chapter focuses on this agent and the data that support the role of this virus in MS disease pathogenesis. A model is proposed, whereby in genetically susceptible individuals, multiple viruses may trigger either a virus-specific or a cross-reactive auto-immune response that results in clinical MS.

BACKGROUND: During the unprecedented era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of countries worldwide adopted very strong measures. Universities closed their doors, and education continued through digital learning lectures. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was administered to all 189 eligible candidates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health was assessed via the MH domain of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 81.5%. The overall burnout prevalence did not differ significantly between the two periods (pre-COVID-19 18.1% vs. COVID-19 18.2%). However, the burnout prevalence dropped significantly in year 4 (pre-COVID-19 40.7% vs. COVID-19 16.7%, p = 0.011), whereas it increased significantly in year 6 (pre-COVID-19 27.6% vs. COVID-19 50%, p = 0.01). When looking at each MBI-SS dimension separately, we found that emotional exhaustion decreased significantly in year 4 but increased in year 6, and cynicism increased in all years. The overall MH deteriorated significantly between the two periods (pre-COVID-19 58.8  21.6 vs. COVID-19 48.3  23, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Digital learning in medical studies carries significant risks. Not only does the MH deteriorate, but cynicism levels also increase.

Baseline CEA levels were determined before treatment, and CEA-based follow-up tests and examinations were applied in the surveillance after treatment. RESULTS A total of 62.6% (62/99) overall, 53.5% (23/43) local, and 64.9% (50/77) distant recurrences were seen in patients who had similar CEA levels with their baseline statuses. The sensitivity of elevated CEA levels during surveillance for overall recurrence was significantly lower in patients with negative baseline CEA than in those with elevated baseline CEA levels (41.3% vs 69.4%; P =.007). Moreover, similar results were observed in the surveillance for local (50% vs 61.5%; P =.048) and distant (39.6% vs 72.4%; P =.005) recurrences between these 2 patient groups. However, CEA had comparable and excellent specificity during surveillance for recurrent disease in these groups. The addition of CA19-9 to the CEA assay significantly improved the sensitivity in recurrence surveillance for patients with negative baseline CEA (49.2% vs 41.3%; P =.037). Finally, we identified a subgroup of CEA-turn recurrences characterized by negative CEA at baseline, elevated CEA at recurrence, and worse survival outcomes after recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.07-3.30; P =.026).

Of 2703 studies initially identified, 2226 had their titles and abstracts screened. Of these, 53 were selected for full-text reading, of which 10 were included and analyzed. The main results of interest were length of PICU stay, number of deaths or mortality rate, and satisfaction of health professionals and family members. The results of meta-analysis show that the mortality rate reduced by 34% with an increase of the length of PICU stay in the PICUs with the use of telemedicine. Family members and health professionals were satisfied with the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine has the potential to improve PICU outcomes, such as mortality rate and family and staff satisfaction. However, it extended length of PICU stay in the studies included in this systematic review.","output":"The use of telemedicine in the PICU: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eight young thoroughbred horses, taken 1858 km by road (travelling time, 41 h), were exmanined toassess the pathological nature of respiratory disease associated with transport. Three of the horses showed clinical abnormalities including pyrexia, coughing, leucocytosis and neutrophilia after the first 20 h of transportation. Endoscopical examination of the trachea revealed exacerbation of airway inflammation as a result of transport in two of the three affected horses. A consistent finding in the affected horses was focal serous neutrophilic pneumonia affecting the cranio-ventral portion of the caudal lung lobe with a propensity to affect the right lung. Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus was isolated from the pneumonic areas, in which corresponding bacterial antigens were identified immunohistochemically.

This paper aims to identify the causative factors of contact dermatitis from PPE and hygiene practices. Methods The search was conducted adhering to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A Delphi process was employed to ensure that the aims of this study were met. PubMed and Web of Science databases were systematically searched through September 12, 2021, using search terms: Contact dermatitis, case report, covid-19. The findings were tabulated as author/year, gender, age, presentation, cause, dermatological diagnosis, testing modality, provided treatment, symptom resolution (time in days), prognosis, and follow-up. Results The mean age of all individuals was 29.75 years, with 75% females. All cases presented with erythema, with 62.5% reporting pruritus and 37.5% reporting burning facial symptoms. Surgical masks and hand-hygiene products (37.5%) were the most commonly reported causative agent with 25% due to KN95/FFP type 2 use. Allergic contact dermatitis (50%) and irritant contact dermatitis (25%) were common diagnoses. Treatments included creams, emollients, and desloratadine, with restriction of irritant-causing factors. The prognosis was generally good among the cases, with 62.5% presenting complete resolution within a week and 12.5% showing moderate improvement at the fourth month after discontinuing use.

The viral spike protein binds the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and thus is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share this mechanism. Here we functionally analyzed the key amino acid residues located within receptor binding motif of RBD that may interact with human ACE2 and available neutralizing antibodies. The in vivo experiments showed that immunization with either the SARS-CoV RBD or SARS-CoV-2 RBD was able to induce strong clade-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice; however, the cross-neutralizing activity was much weaker, indicating that there are distinct antigenic features in the RBDs of the two viruses. This finding was confirmed with the available neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 human antibody, HA001, was able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but failed to recognize SARS-CoV. Moreover, the potential epitope residues of HA001 were identified as A475 and F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, representing new binding sites for neutralizing antibodies. Overall, our study has revealed the presence of different key epitopes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which indicates the necessity to develop new prophylactic vaccine and antibody drugs for specific control of the COVID-19 pandemic although the available agents obtained from the SARS-CoV study are unneglectable.","output":"Key residues of the receptor binding motif in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that interact with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microscopes are used in virtually every biological and medical laboratory.

Multivariable ordered logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between COVID-19 related attitudes and knowledge and adoption of preventive behaviors, controlling for socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. A total of 923 individuals fully completed the survey. Individuals who believed that the virus is out of control, is transmitted through the air, and is not similar to the common flu were more likely to adopt public health preventive behaviors more frequently, particularly wearing masks in public spaces, washing their hands, and spending fewer hours out of their homes. Uncertainty about the virus symptomatology was associated with less frequent mask-wearing and handwashing. Increased social support, frequent media use for COVID-19 updates, trust to authorities, older age, worse health status, female gender and being a healthcare professional were also associated with uptake of some preventive health behaviors.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the incidence of T2DM, associated factors and mean time to outcome in PLH under cART. METHOD: Data for this multicenter cohort study were obtained from PLH aged over 18, who started cART in 13 Brazilian sites from 2003 to 2013. Factors associated with incident T2DM were evaluated by Cox multiple regression models. RESULTS: A total of 6724 patients (30,997.93 person-years) were followed from January 2003 to December 2016. A T2DM incidence rate of 17.3/1000 person-years (95%CI 15.8-18.8) was observed. Incidence of isolated hypertriglyceridemia and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were 84.3 (95%CI 81.1-87.6) and 14.5/1000 person-years (95%CI 13.2-15.9), respectively. Mean time to T2DM onset was 10.5 years (95%CI 10.3-10.6). Variables associated with incident T2DM were age 40-50 [Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.7, 95%CI 1.4-2.1] and  50 years (HR 2.4, 95%CI 1.9-3.1); obesity (HR 2.1, 95%CI 1.6-2.8); abnormal triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol ratio (HR 1.8, 95%CI 1.51-2.2). IFG predicted T2DM (HR 2.6, 95%CI 1.7-2.5) and occurred on average 3.3 years before diabetes onset. Exposure to stavudine for  2 years was independently associated with incident T2DM [HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.0-2.2). CONCLUSION: Brazilian PLH under cART are at significant risk of developing T2DM and share risk factors for diabetes onset with the general population, such as older age, obesity, and having metabolic abnormalities at baseline. Moreover, stavudine use was independently associated with incident T2DM.

Of the total respondents, 19.7% were experiencing severe anxiety, 17.4% moderate anxiety, and 37.1% mild anxiety, according to the GAD-7; and 13.5% of the respondents were experiencing severe depression, 21.9% moderateCsevere depression, and 23% mild depression according to the PHQ-9. There was no statistically significant difference between the grades in terms of GAD-7 or PHQ-9 scores. Male participants were more likely to have suicidal thoughts (p = 0.013). According to our study, the factors with the highest influence on students were as follows: Major changes in personal life, Disruption in educational activities, and Covid-19 related anxiety of loss of relatives and contamination or infection. On average, women voted higher points for Covid-19 related anxiety of loss of relatives and contamination. Conclusions: We found that a significant portion of students regardless of their year in medical school were profoundly affected by the pandemic process as is shown by their anxiety and depression scores. The disruption in educational activities is one of the main factors of these effects, and we believe that these should not be ignored, as they could in the future lead to a series of problems for medical education and students alike.","output":"The Effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak on Medical Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research investigates the extent to which the personality trait of Openness-to-Experience can protect individuals from living in personal echo chambers that create and reinforce a narrow view on the world. Analyses of 2 large-scale data sets with over 80,000 participants and more than 40,000,000 behavioral observations demonstrate that individuals scoring high on Openness show higher variability in the psychological profiles associated with their personal interests-a novel concept termed psychological interest diversity. Study 1 examines the Facebook profiles of 57,185 users to demonstrate that a person's Openness level predicts the degree to which the pages they like are diverse in the political ideologies, personal values, and personality traits of their followers. Study 2 replicates the findings of Study 1 using over 28,000,000 GPS-tracked event attendances collected via people's smartphones. Specifically, the results show that individuals (N = 22,953) with higher levels of Openness also show higher levels of psychological interest diversity in the events they attend, and that this effect is incremental to county-level variation in psychological interest diversity. The findings empirically support the theoretical conceptualization of Openness as a preference for variety and exploration and corroborate the role of personal dispositions in the creation of personal echo chambers. The discussion highlights the need to further explore psychological interest diversity as the initial basis of algorithmic filter bubbles-for example, recommendation systems or targeted advertising-which further amplify and reinforce existing interests and preferences.

This assertion was based on the existing conditions in sub-Saharan Africa that exposed the region to the dire consequences of the pandemic. Previously existing underlying conditions that affected the food system include a high dependence on trade for inputs supply, the adverse effects of climate change, crop pests and diseases, poverty, low input use, weak institutions and ineffective policies, and insecurity and conflicts. We collected data from farmers, aggregators, bean research coordinators, and urban and peri-urban consumers in five Eastern African countries in order to describe the immediate impacts of the pandemic on the bean value chain. Access to seed and labor appear to be the most critical impacts of the pandemic on bean production. There are observable differences in patterns and frequency of bean consumption in these regions, suggesting that the effect of the pandemic depends on the level of implementation of containment measures and pre-COVID-19 underlying conditions that affect the food systems. In the mid to long-term, the pandemic may disrupt food systems, resulting in hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.

The blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased viral RNA synthesis and yield. The role of the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt in regulating reovirus replication was further analyzed. We found that during reovirus infection, the level of phosphorylated MDM2 (p-MDM2) was increased and the expression of p53 was reduced. In addition, the blockage of PI3K/Akt by Ly294002 or knockdown of Akt by siRNA reduced the level of p-MDM2 and increased the level of p53. Both indicated that the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt were activated. Pre-treatment with Nutlin, which can destroy MDM2 and p53 cross-talk and increase the expression of p53 RNA and protein, dose-dependently enhanced reovirus replication. Additionally, the overexpression of p53 alone also supported reovirus replication, and knockdown of p53 significantly inhibited viral replication.

Furthermore, reports on the characteristics of these patients during the pandemic have been scarce. Objectives The purpose of this retrospective study was 1) to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on T2DM and MetS incidence, and 2) to describe sex-based differences in the characteristics of T2DM and MetS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using electronic health records (EHRs) obtained from the USA-based TriNetX research database (TriNetX, Cambridge, MA), the incidence and the total number of patients with T2DM (ICD-10-CM: E11) and MetS (ICD-10-CM: E88.81) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were determined. Aggregate lab data from EHRs were extracted and statistical analyses on the lab values and patient demographics including sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities were performed. Results After analyzing T2DM and MetS patient data from 2018, 2019, and 2020, we observed a considerable decrease in both T2DM and MetS incidence, with data in April 2020 exhibiting the largest decrease when compared to other months. Furthermore, monthly male T2DM and MetS patients lab data revealed worsening parameters in April 2020, such as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) and blood glucose, when compared to females. Demographic data during 2020 revealed that male T2DM and MetS patients had a significantly higher prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure, but female T2DM and MetS patients had significantly higher asthma comorbidity. Conclusions During 2020, there was a marked decrease in T2DM and MetS diagnosis. Due to a lack of screening, these data may suggest a subsequent increase in T2DM and MetS-related heart disease in the future and may magnify the existing sex-related differences identified in these patients.","output":"COVID-19-Related Trends and Characteristics of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Metabolic Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pollen exposure weakens the immunity against certain seasonal respiratory viruses by diminishing the antiviral interferon response. Here we investigate whether the same applies to the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is sensitive to antiviral interferons, if infection waves coincide with high airborne pollen concentrations. Our original hypothesis was that more airborne pollen would lead to increases in infection rates. To examine this, we performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal data analysis on SARS-CoV-2 infection, airborne pollen, and meteorological factors. Our dataset is the most comprehensive, largest possible worldwide from 130 stations, across 31 countries and five continents. To explicitly investigate the effects of social contact, we additionally considered population density of each study area, as well as lockdown effects, in all possible combinations: without any lockdown, with mixed lockdown-no lockdown regime, and under complete lockdown. We found that airborne pollen, sometimes in synergy with humidity and temperature, explained, on average, 44% of the infection rate variability. Infection rates increased after higher pollen concentrations most frequently during the four previous days. Without lockdown, an increase of pollen abundance by 100 pollen/m3 resulted in a 4% average increase of infection rates. Lockdown halved infection rates under similar pollen concentrations. As there can be no preventive measures against airborne pollen exposure, we suggest wide dissemination of pollen-virus coexposure dire effect information to encourage high-risk individuals to wear particle filter masks during high springtime pollen concentrations.","output":"Higher airborne pollen concentrations correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, as evidenced from 31 countries across the globe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the growing concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, colleges and universities either canceled or remotely hosted their 2020 National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs.

This study introduces a GPS-based tool, i.e., lockdown breaching index (LBI), which helps to determine the extent of breaching activities during the lockdown period. It is evaluated using the community mobility reports. This index ranges between 0 and 100, which implies the extent of following the lockdown policies. A score of 0 indicates that civilians strictly adhered to the guidelines while a score of 100 points to complete violation. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is modified to compute the LBI. We considered fifteen states of India, where the spread of coronavirus is relatively dominant. A significant breaching activity is observed during the first phase of lockdown, and the intensity increased in the third and fourth phases of lockdown. Overall breaching activities are dominant in Bihar with LBI of 75.28. At the same time, it is observed that the majority of the people in Delhi adhered to the lockdown policies strictly, as reflected with an LBI score of 47.05, which is the lowest. Though an average rise of 3% breaching activities during the second phase of lockdown (L2.0) with reference to the first phase of lockdown (L1.0) is noticed in all the states, a decreasing trend is noticed in Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Since the beginning of third phase of lockdown L3.0, a significant rise in breaching activities is observed in every state considered for the analysis. The average LBI rise of 16.9% and 27.6% relative to L1.0 is observed at the end of L3.0 and L4.0, respectively. A positive spearman rank correlation of 0.88 is noticed between LBI and the cumulative confirmed cases.

However, low solubility and poor bioavailability of TanIIA limit its clinical application. Similarly, gene therapy with GPC3-shRNA, a type of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) capable of silencing the glypican-3 (GPC3) expression, is seriously limited due to its susceptibility to nuclease degradation and high off-target effects. In the present study, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-PEG) were used as a drug carrier. By encapsulating TanIIA into MSN-PEG, we synthesized MSN-TanIIA-PEG nanoparticles and observed the involved characteristics. This was followed by exploration of antitumor activity on the HepG2 cell lines in vitro. Meanwhile, in order to construct GPC3-shRNA plasmids, a shRNA sequence targeting GPC3 was synthesized and cloned into the pSLenti-U6 vector. Accordingly, the performance of MSN-PEG as a gene transfer carrier for GPC3-shRNA gene therapy of HCC in vitro was evaluated, including transfection efficiency and DNA binding biological characteristics. The results indicated successful encapsulation of TanIIA in MSN-PEG, which had satisfactory efficacy, favorable dispersity, suitable particle size, and sustained release effect. The in vitro anti-HCC effects of nano-TanIIA were greatly improved, which outperformed free-TanIIA in terms of proliferation and invasion inhibition, as well as apoptosis induction of HCC cells. As expected, MSN-PEG possessed excellent gene delivery capacity with good binding, release, and protection from RNase digestion. Using MSN-PEG as a gene carrier, the plasmids were successfully transfected into HepG2 cells, and both the mRNA and protein expressions of GPC3 were significantly downregulated. It was thus concluded that a sustained release TanIIA delivery system for HCC treatment was synthesized and that MSN-PEG could also serve as a gene transfer carrier for gene therapy. More interestingly, MSN-PEG may be a potential delivery platform that combines TanIIA and GPC3-shRNA together to enhance their synergistic effect.","output":"PEI-PEG-Coated Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles Enhance the Antitumor Activity of Tanshinone IIA and Serve as a Gene Transfer Vector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of mid-2020, eradicating COVID-19 seems not to be an option, at least in the short term. The challenge for policy makers consists of implementing a suitable approach to contain the outbreak and limit extra deaths without exhausting healthcare forces while mitigating the impact on the country's economy and on individuals' well-being. To better describe the trade-off between the economic, societal and public health dimensions, we developed an integrated bioeconomic optimization approach. We built a discrete age-structured model considering three main populations (youth, adults and seniors) and 8 socio-professional characteristics for the adults. Fifteen lockdown exit strategies were simulated for several options: abrupt or progressive (4 or 8 weeks) lockdown lift followed by total definitive transitory final unlocking. Three values of transmission rate (Tr) were considered to represent individuals' barrier gesture compliance. Optimization under constraint to find the best combination of scenarios and options was performed on the minimal total cost for production losses due to contracted activities and hospitalization in the short and mid-term, with 3 criteria: mortality, person-days locked and hospital saturation. The results clearly show little difference between the scenarios based on the economic impact or the 3 criteria. This means that policy makers should focus on individuals' behaviors (represented by the Tr value) more than on trying to optimize the lockdown strategy (defining who is unlocked and who is locked). For a given Tr, the choices of scenarios permit the management of the hospital saturation level with regard to both its intensity and its duration, which remains a key point for public health.

Stress caused by COVID-19 was significantly correlated with depression, instrumental activities of daily living and social participation. Using socioenvironmental factors as moderators of the relationship between stress and depression, we found that increased depression was alleviated by social attitudes ( = 2.064; P < 0.01), family attitudes ( = 2.028; P < 0.05) and healthcare services and policies ( = ?4.579; P < 0.001). Moreover, instrumental activities of daily living increased with decreased stress as moderated by social attitudes ( = 0.140; P < 0.05) and healthcare services and policies ( = ?0.306; P < 0.001).

This entails sacrifice of the 3D learning component of the laboratory and creates a major experience gap in the curriculum. At the School of Health Professions of SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, anatomy courses were delivered remotely over the past two summers for the physical therapy, physician assistant, and occupational therapy programs. Student evaluations reveal the perception of their respective cohorts having \\"lost out\\" on the value of in-person experience in the anatomy lab compared to upper classmen who took this course before the pandemic lockdown. To bridge this gap, medical educators came together as a community to offer an in-person, hands-on anatomy experience to 94 health professional students. Weill Cornell Medicine hosted the event and provided 20 donor dissection bodies with a total of 16 participating faculty that included anatomy directors from SUNY Albany, University at Buffalo, Icahn and NYU Schools of Medicine, in addition to Emergency department and Rehabilitative Medicine Attendings and former students who are now in private practice. A review of the musculoskeletal system was offered in three distinct categories that involved demonstration of movements, the neurovascular elements involved, and clinicopathologies. The follow up survey reveals positive student responses in all three categories. They also credited the event with providing an appreciation of the three-dimensionality of the region, citing that remote learning did not offer a full understanding of contiguous anatomical structures in 3D space. What was not measured in the survey were unexpected losses of corollary benefits to other courses that learning human dissection conferred. Program directors reported that some of these students underperformed in their respective programs which was unexpected based on their admissions profile compared to students who had the in-person anatomy lab experience. What is missing when students do not have a 3-D appreciation for the musculoskeletal system is their understanding of elements such as direction of muscle fibers (parallel vs pennate), line of pull, and eccentric versus concentric contractions. Human gross anatomy in the laboratory, aside from providing 3D learning, lays the foundation for the problem-solving skills and professionalism that will be expected of them throughout their health professional careers. Thus, gross anatomy education is not solely a course to \\"memorize\\" the names of soft-tissue structures in 3D space but instead also serves to develop and fortify professional behaviors that will prepare students beyond the laboratory and into the workplace.","output":"A Community of Medical Educators Coming together to lend an \\"Anatomical\\" Hand: Showing the Value of an In-Person Anatomy Lab based Curriculum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading around the world at an exponential pace, leading to millions of individuals developing the associated disease called COVID-19 Due to the novel nature and the lack of immunity within humans, there has been a collective global effort to find effective treatments against the virus This has led the scientific community to repurpose Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs with known safety profiles Of the many possible drugs, vitamin C has been on the shortlist of possible interventions due to its beneficial role as an immune booster and inherent antioxidant properties Within this manuscript, a detailed discussion regarding the intracellular function and inherent properties of vitamin C is conducted It also provides a comprehensive review of published research pertaining to the differences in expression of the vitamin C transporter under several pathophysiologic conditions Finally, we review recently published research investigating the efficacy of vitamin C administration in treating viral infection and life-threatening conditions Overall, this manuscript aims to present existing information regarding the extent to which vitamin C can be an effective treatment for COVID-19 and possible explanations as to why it may work in some individuals but not in others [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Aging & Disease is the property of JKL International LLC and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Low level of Vitamin C and dysregulation of Vitamin C transporter might be involved in the severity of COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a virus that spreads through contact with the respiratory droplets of infected persons, so quarantine is mandatory to break the infection chain.

Polypharmacy is common in older people with multimorbidity. Given the potential for interactions between polypharmacy and inflammation, the relationship between inflammation and polypharmacy were studied in older adults with multimorbidity and in healthy ageing mice. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the five-year wave of the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project, a population-based study of community-dwelling men aged  70 years. Serum concentrations of 27 cytokines were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. Associations between polypharmacy (5 medications) and cytokines were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, frailty, comorbidities and individual drug classes. Interaction between polypharmacy and Drug Burden Index (DBI - drugs with anticholinergic and sedative effects) was analysed. Effects of polypharmacy and DBI on serum levels of 23 cytokines were determined in ageing male mice treated with chronic polypharmacy or control. RESULTS: Compared to the non-polypharmacy group (n=495), CHAMP participants with polypharmacy (n=409) had significantly higher concentrations of IL-8, IL-6, CCL3, Eotaxin, IL-1ra, IL-1?, IP-10 and lower concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4. In fully-adjusted multivariable models, polypharmacy was positively associated with concentrations of IL-8 and CCL3. There were no significant differences in inflammatory profiles between control and polypharmacy-treated mice. The relationship was not influenced by DBI in men or in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory markers associated with polypharmacy in older adults were not seen in healthy aged mice administered polypharmacy, and may be related to underlying diseases.

Males are 2.84 times more often admitted to the ICU and mortality is 1.39 times higher as a result of COVID-19. Various factors play a role in this, and novel studies suggest that the gene-dose of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 7 could contribute to the sex-skewed severity. TLR7 is one of the crucial pattern recognition receptors for SARS-CoV-2 ssRNA and the gene-dose effect is caused by X chromosome inactivation (XCI) escape. Female immune cells with TLR7 XCI escape have biallelic TLR7 expression and produce more type 1 interferon (IFN) upon TLR7 stimulation. In COVID-19, TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is one of the pattern recognition receptors responsible for IFN production and a delayed IFN response has been associated with immunopathogenesis and mortality. Here, we provide a hypothesis that females may be protected to some extend against severe COVID-19, due to the biallelic TLR7 expression, allowing them to mount a stronger and more protective IFN response early after infection. Studies exploring COVID-19 treatment via the TLR7-mediated IFN pathway should consider this sex difference. Various factors such as age, sex hormones and escape modulation remain to be investigated concerning the TLR7 gene-dose effect.","output":"Why Females Do Better: The X Chromosomal TLR7 Gene-Dose Effect in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Conjugation plays a major role in the transmission of plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance genes in both clinical and general settings. The conjugation efficiency is influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors, one of which is the taxonomic relatedness between donor and recipient bacteria. A comprehensive overview of the influence of donor-recipient relatedness on conjugation is still lacking, but such an overview is important to quantitatively assess the risk of plasmid transfer and the effect of interventions which limit the spread of antibiotic resistance, and to obtain parameter values for conjugation in mathematical models. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis on reported conjugation frequencies from Escherichia coli donors to various recipient species. RESULTS Thirty-two studies reporting 313 conjugation frequencies for liquid broth matings and 270 conjugation frequencies for filter matings were included in our meta-analysis. The reported conjugation frequencies varied over 11 orders of magnitude. Decreasing taxonomic relatedness between donor and recipient bacteria, when adjusted for confounding factors, was associated with a lower conjugation frequency in liquid matings. The mean conjugation frequency for bacteria of the same order, the same class, and other classes was 10, 20, and 789 times lower than the mean conjugation frequency within the same species, respectively. This association between relatedness and conjugation frequency was not found for filter matings. The conjugation frequency was furthermore found to be influenced by temperature in both types of mating experiments, and in addition by plasmid incompatibility group in liquid matings, and by recipient origin and mating time in filter matings. CONCLUSIONS In our meta-analysis, taxonomic relatedness is limiting conjugation in liquid matings, but not in filter matings, suggesting that taxonomic relatedness is not a limiting factor for conjugation in environments where bacteria are fixed in space.","output":"Effect of donor-recipient relatedness on the plasmid conjugation frequency: a meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine has been accompanied by increased discussion of vaccine hesitancy. However, it is unclear if there are shared patterns between general vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine rejection, or if these are two different concepts. This study characterized rejection of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine, and compared patterns of association between general vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine rejection. The survey was conducted online March 20-22, 2020. Participants answered questions on vaccine hesitancy and responded if they would accept the vaccine given different safety and effectiveness profiles. We assessed differences in COVID-19 rejection and general vaccine hesitancy through logistic regressions. Among 713 participants, 33.0% were vaccine hesitant, and 18.4% would reject a COVID-19 vaccine. Acceptance varied by effectiveness profile: 10.2% would reject a 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, but 32.4% would reject a 50% effective vaccine. Those vaccine hesitant were significantly more likely to reject COVID-19 vaccination [odds ratio (OR): 5.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.39, 9.11]. In multivariable logistic regression models, there were similar patterns for vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine rejection by gender, race/ethnicity, family income, and political affiliation. But the direction of association flipped by urbanicity (P=0.0146, with rural dwellers less likely to be COVID-19 vaccine rejecters but more likely to be vaccine hesitant in general), and age (P=0.0037, with fewer pronounced differences across age for COVID-19 vaccine rejection, but a gradient of stronger vaccine hesitancy in general among younger ages). During the COVID-19 epidemics early phase, patterns of vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine rejection were relatively similar. A significant minority would reject a COVID-19 vaccine, especially one with less-than-ideal effectiveness.

A cross-sectional study was performed in a single center in Cali, Colombia. The inclusion criteria were patients with a diagnosis of dengue or COVID-19 who were older than 14 years of age. All patients experienced fever or other symptoms for fewer than 10 days. Linear regression was performed to evaluate the differences in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) between patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and dengue, and was adjusted for sex and age group ( 31 and > 31 years). The sample size was calculated to test the hypothesis that the median NLR in COVID-19 patients is higher than that in dengue patients. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. A total of 93 patients were included: 70 with dengue and 23 with COVID-19.

Objectives: We aimed to determine the predictive properties of common community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) severity scores and COVID-19 specific indices. Methods: In this retrospective cohort, COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a teaching hospital between 18 March-20 May 2020 were included. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics related to severity and mortality were measured and CURB-65, PSI, A-DROP, CALL, and COVID-GRAM scores were calculated as defined previously in the literature. Progression to severe disease and in-hospital/overall mortality during the follow-up of the patients were determined from electronic records. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard regression model was used. The discrimination capability of pneumonia severity indices was evaluated by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Two hundred ninety-eight patients were included in the study. Sixty-two patients (20.8%) presented with severe COVID-19 while thirty-one (10.4%) developed severe COVID-19 at any time from the admission. In-hospital mortality was 39 (13.1%) while the overall mortality was 44 (14.8%). The mortality in low-risk groups that were identified to manage outside the hospital was 0 in CALL Class A, 1.67% in PSI low risk, and 2.68% in CURB-65 low-risk. However, the AUCs for the mortality prediction in COVID-19 were 0.875, 0.873, 0.859, 0.855, and 0.828 for A-DROP, PSI, CURB-65, COVID-GRAM, and CALL scores respectively. The AUCs for the prediction of progression to severe disease was 0.739, 0.711, 0,697, 0.673, and 0.668 for CURB-65, CALL, PSI, COVID-GRAM, A-DROP respectively. The hazard ratios (HR) for the tested pneumonia severity indices demonstrated that A-DROP and CURB-65 scores had the strongest association with mortality, and PSI, and COVID-GRAM scores predicted mortality independent from age and comorbidity. Conclusion: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) scores can predict in COVID-19. The indices proposed specifically to COVID-19 work less than nonspecific scoring systems surprisingly.

Finally, we have built and configured two DTN nodes to implement DTN-SMTP. Also, we have confirmed the mails reception and the file attachment from the external mail client with minimized interactions between the SMTP messages.","output":"DTN-SMTP: A Novel Mail Transfer Protocol with Minimized Interactions for Space Internet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the reported data from the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in January - May 2020 in 119 countries. We observe that the time series of active cases in individual countries (the difference of the total number of confirmed infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered cases) display a strong agreement with polynomial growth and at a later epidemic stage also with a combined polynomial growth with exponential decay. Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number $R_0$ as $T_M/t$, where $T_M$ is a constant and $t$ is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic data and estimate some epidemic parameters. Note that although the model shows a good agreement with the reported data we do not make any claims about the real size of the pandemics as the relation of the observed reported data to the total number of infected in the population is still unknown.","output":"Emerging Polynomial Growth Trends in COVID-19 Pandemic Data and Their Reconciliation with Compartment Based Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 63-year-old diabetic smoker with alcoholism was the first mortality case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Taiwan.

Determining optimal treatments in high risk populations is crucial, as is the case in those with hematological malignancies. We analyzed a cohort of 23 patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 who had received plasma 48-72 h after the diagnosis of infection and compared it with a historical group of 22 patients who received other therapy. Overall survival in those who received convalescent plasma was significantly higher than in the historical group (p = 0.03460). The plasma-treated group also showed a significantly milder course of infection (p = 0.03807), characterized by less severe symptoms and faster recovery (p = 0.00001). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that convalescent plasma is an effective treatment and its early administration leads to clinical improvement, increased viral clearance and longer overall survival in patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19.

It shows how a recently developed method for controlling coupling errors can be applied to analyze propellers operating in off-design conditions. The approach allows the use of fast potential flow methods for the representation of the propeller in the context of viscous flow solvers and works accurately for a wide range of advance numbers and incidence angles with a minimum computational cost. The new method makes it possible to disclose flow phenomena on the effective wake that were hidden in conventional approaches of effective wake simulation. Different application cases are analyzed, such as a propeller-shaft configuration in inclined flow, a pod propulsor in an oblique inflow, and a ship hull advancing at a yaw angle. A dipole-like distortion on the effective wake is unmasked for a uniform flow incident to a propeller mounted on an inclined shaft. The flow component perpendicular to the axis is found to be responsible for the distortion. The effect of the direction of propeller rotation on the effective wake is illustrated for a single-shaft ship moving at a yaw angle. In particular, keel vortices are either attracted to or repelled from the propeller disk depending on the sign of the yaw angle or alternatively on that of the propeller rotation.","output":"Simulation of turbulent effective wakes for propellers in off-design conditions by a correction factor approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores a tension at the core of the concept of herd immunity that has been overlooked in public and scientic discussionsanamely: how can immunity, a phenomenon of individual biological defenses, be made relevant to populations? How can collectives be considered \\"immune\\"? Over the course of more than a century of use of the term, scientists have developed many different understandings of the concept in response to this inherent tension. Originating among veterinary scientists in the United States in the late 19th century, the concept was adopted by British scientists researching human infectious disease by the early 1920s. It soon became a staple concept for epidemiologists interested in disease ecology, helping to articulate the population dynamics of diseases such as diphtheria and inuenza. Finally, though more traditional understandings of the concept remained in scientic use, in the era after World War II, it increasingly came to signal the objective and outcome of mass vaccination. Recognizing the complexity of scientic efforts to resolve the paradox of herd immunity may help us consider the best distribution of immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).(Am J Public Health.

This article examines how history was searched for possible insights and predictions about the present-day pandemic. The article then traces why assumptions about what COVID would do based on the past, such as COVID leading to a leveling of inequality, were faulty: these supposed lessons from the past flattened pandemics into one-size-fits-all approaches, which existed in neither the past nor the present. To understand the possibilities and limits of what pandemics do, we must ground the differing experiences of a pandemic in their specific times and places. In particular, framing pandemic responses in terms of resilience serves to center the market and the state, rather than individuals.

Since both, workload and HCW's well-being are related to the quality of care, continuous monitoring of working hours and indicators of mental health in HCWs is of relevance during the current pandemic. The existing investigations, however, have been limited to a single study period. We examined changes in working hours and mental health in Swiss HCWs at the height of the pandemic (T1) and again after its flattening (T2). METHODS: We conducted two cross-sectional online studies among Swiss HCWs assessing working hours, depression, anxiety, and burnout. From each study, 812 demographics-matched participants were included into the analysis. Working hours and mental health were compared between the two samples. RESULTS: Compared to prior to the pandemic, the share of participants working less hours was the same in both samples, whereas the share of those working more hours was lower in the T2 sample. The level of depression did not differ between the samples. In the T2 sample, participants reported more anxiety, however, this difference was below the minimal clinically important difference. Levels of burnout were slightly higher in the T2 sample. CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks after the health care system started to transition back to normal operations, HCWs' working hours still differed from their regular hours in non-pandemic times. Overall anxiety and depression among HCWs did not change substantially over the course of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"Development of health care workers' mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland: two cross-sectional studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessment of T-cell immunity to the COVID-19 coronavirus requires reliable assays and is of great interest, given the uncertain longevity of the antibody response. Some recent reports have used immunodominant spike (S) antigenic peptides and anti-CD28 co-stimulation in varying combinations to assess T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2. These assays may cause T-cell hyperstimulation and could overestimate antiviral immunity in chronically immunosuppressed transplant recipients, who are predisposed to infections and vaccination failures. Here, we evaluate CD154-expressing T-cells induced by unselected S antigenic peptides in 204 subjects-103 COVID-19 patients and 101 healthy unexposed subjects. Subjects included 72 transplanted and 130 non-transplanted subjects. S-reactive CD154+T-cells co-express and can thus substitute for IFN (n=3). Assay reproducibility in a variety of conditions was acceptable with coefficient of variation of 2-10.6%. S-reactive CD154+T-cell frequencies were a) higher in 42 healthy unexposed transplant recipients who were sampled pre-pandemic, compared with 59 healthy non-transplanted subjects (p=0.02), b) lower in Tr COVID-19 patients compared with healthy transplant patients (p<0.0001), c) lower in Tr patients with severe COVID-19 (p<0.0001), or COVID-19 requiring hospitalization (p<0.05), compared with healthy Tr recipients. S-reactive T-cells were not significantly different between the various COVID-19 disease categories in NT recipients. Among transplant recipients with COVID-19, cytomegalovirus co-infection occurred in 34%; further, CMV-specific T-cells (p<0.001) and incidence of anti-receptor-binding-domain IgG (p=0.011) were lower compared with non-transplanted COVID-19 patients.

Protein acetylation is known to play a crucial role in host response to viral infection. Acetylation of viral proteins encoded by other RNA viruses have been reported to affect viral replication. It is therefore of interest to see whether MERS-CoV proteins are also acetylated. Viral proteins obtained from infected cells were trypsin-digested into peptides. Acetylated peptides were enriched by immunoprecipitation and subject to nano-LC-Orbitrap analysis. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to assess the conservation level of identified acetylation sites and to predict the upstream regulatory factors. A total of 12 acetylation sites were identified from 7 peptides, which all belong to the replicase polyprotein pp1ab. All identified acetylation sites were found to be highly conserved across MERS-CoV sequences in NCBI database. Upstream factors, including deacetylases of the SIRT1 and HDAC families as well as acetyltransferases of the TIP60 family, were predicted to be responsible for regulating the acetylation events identified. Western blotting confirms that acetylation events indeed occur on pp1ab protein by expressing NSP4 in HEK293 cells. Acetylation events on MERS-CoV viral protein pp1ab were identified for the first time, which indicate that MERS-CoV might use the host acetylation machinery to regulate its enzyme activity and to achieve optimal replication.

We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of BBV152 administered 6 months after the second of a two-dose primary vaccination series. Methods: In an ongoing phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04471519) the protocol was amended after six months to re-consent and randomise 184 previously vaccinated participants to receive a third dose of vaccine or placebo on Day 215. The primary outcome was to measure neutralising antibody titres by plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) four weeks after the booster; safety as serious adverse events (SAE) was the key secondary outcome. Findings: Four weeks after a second BBV152 vaccination geometric mean titres (GMTs) of neutralising antibodies were 197.0 PRNT50 (95% CI: 155.6,249.4); this level declined to 23.9 PRNT50 (14.0,40.6) six months later, with a seroconversion rate of 75.4% (95% CI: 68.4,81.6). Four weeks after booster vaccination the GMT increased on Day 243 to 746.6 PRNT50 (514.9,1081) compared with 100.7 PRNT50 (43.6,232.6) in the placebo group. Corresponding seroconversion rates were 98.7% (92.8,99.9) and 79.8% (69.6,87.8). Increased titres in the placebo group were attributed to natural infection as the study was conducted during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. PRNT50 titres against the SARS-CoV-2 variants increased Alpha (32.6 fold), Beta (161.0 fold), Delta (264.7 fold), and Delta plus (174.2 fold) after the booster vaccination. We found that vaccine induces both memory B and T cells with a distinct AIM+ specific CD4+T central and effector memory phenotype, including CD8+ TEMRA phenotype. Reactogenicity after vaccine and placebo was minimal and comparable, and no SAEs were reported. Interpretation: Six months after a two dose BBV152 vaccination series cell mediated immunity and neutralising antibodies to both homologous (D614G) and heterologous strains (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Delta plus) persisted above baseline, although the magnitude of the responses had declined. Neutralising antibodies against homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants increased 19 to 97 fold after a third vaccination. Booster BBV152 vaccination is safe and may be necessary to ensure persistent immunity to prevent breakthrough infections.","output":"Persistence of immunity and impact of a third (booster) dose of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152; a phase 2, double-blind, randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health-care workers (HCW) have paid a heavy toll to the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Routes of transmission remain to be fully understood. METHODS: This prospective study compared a 1,500-bed adult and a 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From February 24th until April 10th, 2020, all symptomatic HCW were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCW screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, occupational and non-occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 1344 HCW tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no death were reported. Most HCW (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on March 23rd, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment (PPE) for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric setting, respectively (p=0.0022). In the adult setting, HCW more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% versus 15%, p=0.046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. CONCLUSION: Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCW and containment of the outbreak.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, type, and cost of comorbidities occurring in older T2DM patients versus older non-T2DM patients, and the factors associated with high cost (HC) T2DM patients. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using information from the Campania Region healthcare database. People aged 65 years who received 2 prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs were identified as T2DM patients. Comorbidities among T2DM and non-T2DM groups were assessed through the RxRiskV Index (modified version). T2DM individuals were classified according to the total cost distribution as HC or non-high cost. Two sub-cohorts of HC T2DM patients were assessed: above 90th and 80th percentile of the total cost. Age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models were created. Results: Among the T2DM cohort, concordant and discordant comorbidities occurred significantly more frequently than in the non-T2DM cohort. Total mean annual cost per T2DM patient due to comorbidities was 7,627 versus 4,401 per non-T2DM patient. Among T2DM patients identified as being above 90th and 80th percentiles of cost distribution, the total annual costs were >19,577 and >2,563, respectively. The hospitalization cost was higher for T2DM cases. Strongest predictors of being a HC T2DM patient were having 5 comorbidities and renal impairment. Conclusion: HC patients accrued >80% of the total comorbidities cost in older T2DM patients.

The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) is the first open access database in the ICU domain. Many studies have shown that common data models (CDMs) improve database searching by allowing code, tools, and experience to be shared. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is spreading all over the world. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to transform MIMIC into an OMOP database and to evaluate the benefits of this transformation for analysts. METHODS: We transformed MIMIC (version 1.4.21) into OMOP format (version 5.3.3.1) through semantic and structural mapping. The structural mapping aimed at moving the MIMIC data into the right place in OMOP, with some data transformations. The mapping was divided into 3 phases: conception, implementation, and evaluation. The conceptual mapping aimed at aligning the MIMIC local terminologies to OMOP's standard ones. It consisted of 3 phases: integration, alignment, and evaluation. A documented, tested, versioned, exemplified, and open repository was set up to support the transformation and improvement of the MIMIC community's source code. The resulting data set was evaluated over a 48-hour datathon. RESULTS: With an investment of 2 people for 500 hours, 64% of the data items of the 26 MIMIC tables were standardized into the OMOP CDM and 78% of the source concepts mapped to reference terminologies. The model proved its ability to support community contributions and was well received during the datathon, with 160 participants and 15,000 requests executed with a maximum duration of 1 minute.

We aimed at validating these findings in independent patient cohorts. METHODS: We obtained peripheral blood samples from 112 children with a new diagnosis of IBD (71 with Crohn's disease and 41 with ulcerative colitis) and 19 children without IBD (controls) and recorded medical information on disease activity and outcomes. CD8+ T cells were isolated from blood samples by magnetic bead sorting at the point of diagnosis and during the course of disease. Genome-wide transcription (n=192) and DNA methylation (n=66) profiles were generated using Affymetrix and Illumina arrays, respectively. Publicly available transcriptomes and DNA methylomes of CD8+ T cells from three adult patient cohorts with and without IBD were included in data analyses. RESULTS: Previously reported CD8+ T cell prognostic expression and exhaustion signatures were only found in the original adult IBD patient cohort. These signatures could not be detected either in a pediatric, or in a second adult IBD cohort. In contrast, an association between CD8+ T cell gene expression with age and sex was detected across all three cohorts. CD8+ gene transcription was clearly associated with IBD in the two cohorts that included non-IBD controls. Lastly, DNA methylation profiles of CD8+ T cells from children with Crohn's disease correlated with age but not with disease outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to validate previously reported findings of an association between CD8+ T cell gene transcription and disease outcome in IBD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was exempt from approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sixty ablations (30 MW and 30 RF ablations) were performed ex vivo in 15 bovine livers perfused with autologous blood via the portal vein at 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 mL/min per 100 g of liver tissue (three livers were used for each flow rate). Long-axis diameter (LAD), short-axis diameter (SAD), and volume were measured for each ablation lesion. A general linear mixed model was used to examine the effect of location, ablation device, and flow rate on LAD, SAD, and volume. Results were considered to indicate a significant difference at P less than .05. RESULTS Location was not a significant predictor of LAD, SAD, or volume (P  .4). The slope of the relationship between flow rate and LAD, SAD, and volume was significantly different according to ablation device (P < .0001). For RF ablation lesions, the mean LAD, SAD, and volume demonstrated a significant inverse relationship with flow rate, while the measurements for MW ablation did not change with variation in flow rates. CONCLUSION The size of RF ablation lesions is highly variable, with a significant inverse relationship to the rate of portal venous blood flow. Conversely, the size of MW ablation lesions is unaffected by changes in portal venous blood flow. The consistency of the size of MW ablation lesions could translate into a higher local tumor eradication rate than that reported with RF ablation.","output":"Effect of variation of portal venous blood flow on radiofrequency and microwave ablations in a blood-perfused bovine liver model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among people at risk of infection is crucial for understanding both the past transmission of COVID-19 and vulnerability of the population to continuing transmission and, when done serially, the intensity of ongoing transmission over an interval in a community. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort in Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March, 2020. METHODS: We did a population-based study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Iquitos at two timepoints: July 13C18, 2020 (baseline), and Aug 13C18, 2020 (1-month follow-up). We obtained a geographically stratified representative sample of the city population using the 2017 census data, which was updated on Jan 20, 2020. We included people who were inhabitants of Iquitos since COVID-19 was identified in Peru (March 6, 2020) or earlier. We excluded people living in institutions, people receiving any pharmacological treatment for COVID-19, people with any contraindication for phlebotomy, and health workers or individuals living with an active health worker. We tested each participant for IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, China). We used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. FINDINGS: We identified 726 eligible individuals and enrolled a total of 716 participants (99%), distributed across 40 strata (four districts, two sexes, and five age groups). We excluded ten individuals who: did not have consent from a parent or legal representative (n=3), had moved to Iquitos after March 6, 2020 (n=3), were in transit (n=2), or had respiratory symptoms (n=1). After adjusting for the study sampling effects and sensitivity and specificity of the test, we estimated a seroprevalence of 70% (95% CI 67C73) at baseline and 66% (95% CI 62C70) at 1 month of follow-up, with a test-retest positivity of 65% (95% CI 61C68), and an incidence of new exposures of 2% (95% CI 1C3). We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants aged 18C29 years having lower seroprevalence than those aged younger than 12 years (prevalence ratio 085 [95% CI 073C098]; p=0029). INTERPRETATION: After the first epidemic peak, Iquitos had one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies worldwide. Nevertheless, the city experienced a second wave starting in January, 2021, probably due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 P1 variant, which has shown higher transmissibility and reinfection rates.

While the world at large is waiting that the released vaccines immunize most citizens, public health experts suggest that, in the meantime, it is only through behavior change that the spread of COVID-19 can be controlled. Importantly, the required behaviors are aimed not only at safeguarding ones own health. Instead, individuals are asked to adapt their behaviors to protect the community at large. This raises the question of which social concerns and moral principles make people willing to do so. We considered in 23 countries (N = 6948) individuals willingness to engage in prescribed and discretionary behaviors, as well as country-level and individual-level factors that might drive such behavioral intentions. Results from multilevel multiple regressions, with country as the nesting variable, showed that publicized number of infections were not significantly related to individual intentions to comply with the prescribed measures and intentions to engage in discretionary prosocial behaviors. Instead, psychological differences in terms of trust in government, citizens, and in particular toward science predicted individuals behavioral intentions across countries. The more people endorsed moral principles of fairness and care (vs. loyalty and authority), the more they were inclined to report trust in science, which, in turn, statistically predicted prescribed and discretionary behavioral intentions. Results have implications for the type of intervention and public communication strategies that should be most effective to induce the behavioral changes that are needed to control the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Trust predicts COVID-19 prescribed and discretionary behavioral intentions in 23 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Trust in science meaningfully contributes to our understanding of peoples belief in misinformation and their intentions to take actions to prevent COVID-19. However, no experimental research has sought to intervene on this variable to develop a scalable response to the COVID-19 infodemic. OBJECTIVE: Our study examined whether brief exposure to an infographic about the scientific process might increase trust in science and thereby affect belief in misinformation and intention to take preventive actions for COVID-19. METHODS: This two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit a US representative sample of 1000 adults by age, race/ethnicity, and gender using the Prolific platform. Participants were randomly assigned to view either an intervention infographic about the scientific process or a control infographic. The intervention infographic was designed through a separate pilot study. Primary outcomes were trust in science, COVID-19 narrative belief profile, and COVID-19 preventive behavioral intentions. We also collected 12 covariates and incorporated them into all analyses. All outcomes were collected using web-based assessment. RESULTS: From January 22, 2021 to January 24, 2021, 1017 participants completed the study. The intervention slightly improved trust in science (difference-in-difference 0.03, SE 0.01, t(1000)=2.16, P=.031). No direct intervention effect was observed on belief profile membership, but there was some evidence of an indirect intervention effect mediated by trust in science (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, SE 0.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.12, z=2.01, P=.045) on membership in the scientific profile compared with the others. No direct nor indirect effects on preventive behaviors were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Briefly viewing an infographic about science appeared to cause a small aggregate increase in trust in science, which may have, in turn, reduced the believability of COVID-19 misinformation. The effect sizes were small but commensurate with our 60-second, highly scalable intervention approach. Researchers should study the potential for truthful messaging about how science works to serve as misinformation inoculation and test how best to do so.

Rapid detection of the disease saves lives, and relying on medical imaging (Computed Tomography and X-ray) to detect infected lungs has shown to be effective. Deep learning and convolutional neural networks have been used for image analysis in this context. However, accurate identification of infected regions has proven challenging for two main reasons. Firstly, the characteristics of infected areas differ in different images. Secondly, insufficient training data makes it challenging to train various machine learning algorithms, including deep-learning models. This paper proposes an approach to segment lung regions infected by COVID-19 to help cardiologists diagnose the disease more accurately, faster, and more manageable. We propose a bifurcated 2-D model for two types of segmentation. This model uses a shared encoder and a bifurcated connection to two separate decoders. One decoder is for segmentation of the healthy region of the lungs, while the other is for the segmentation of the infected regions. Experiments on publically available images show that the bifurcated structure segments infected regions of the lungs better than state of the art. ?

In addition, OcUGT1 was observed to exhibit additional five types of functions, including classical sugar transfer reaction and three reversible reactions namely NDP-sugar synthesis, sugars exchange and aglycons exchange reactions, as well as enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, suggesting OcUGT1 displays both glycosyltransferase and glycosidase activities. Expression profiles revealed that the expression of OcUGT1 was development-dependent and affected by environmental factors. The unusual multifunctionality of OcUGT1 broadens the applicability of OcUGT1, thereby generating diverse carbohydrate-containing structures.","output":"Isolation and characterization of a multifunctional flavonoid glycosyltransferase from Ornithogalum caudatum with glycosidase activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The objective of this study is to investigate the perceptions of healthcare providers about the use of social media for healthy diet management in Saudi Arabia.

The purpose was to explore the impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on children with intellectual disability and their families. The review aimed to explore if the disruption to the systems involved in their care would impact their wellbeing and behavioural presentations. We also measured if there had been an increase in the use of medication. Our focus was on the distress calls, which are requests for urgent clinical review to prevent a crisis.MethodSix clinical areas across three Welsh health boards under the same specialist team were surveyed. Case notes and email correspondence were reviewed to obtain the number and content of crisis calls made to specialist CAMHS across an eight week period during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. Data were gathered on frequency, purpose, and outcome of calls. Comparison data were also collected for the period October 2019 to March 2020.ResultPre-COVID-19: Two crisis calls were identified in two different areas during the pre-COVID period surveyed. Increases in medication and increases in respite care packages were made as a result.During COVID-19 restrictions: 20 different initial distress calls made (children age 9 and 17 years old (M = 13.2);75% were boys) across five of the six clinical areas. Of these 20 calls, 17 were active cases and 3 were new referrals. 95% of calls resulted in medication increases and there were few other interventions used due to COVID-19 constraints. Changes to the child's support system were discussed across all cases and return to school was highlighted as a key protective factor in improved well-being. Differences between clinical areas were also identified.ConclusionThere was a clear increase in distress calls and requests to prescribe or increase psychotropic medication to calm the distress during the lockdown. Changes in behavioural presentation may have occurred partly due to the disruption to the complex systems that typically support a child and the shift away from community support. Children with intellectual disability and their families are unique and embedded in complex systems comprising schools, respite, and healthcare provision which work together to deliver optimal mental healthcare with psychosocial interventions with medication for higher-risk situations.

The reproductive performance of 927 crossbred BC F4 gilts and 320 purebred CH gilts was recorded. Sixty pigs of each breed were randomly selected at approximately 60 days of age to determine growth performance during fattening period, which lasted for 150 days for BC pigs and 240 days for CH pigs. At the end of the fattening period, 30 pigs of each breed were slaughtered to determine carcass composition and meat quality. Results: The coat color of BC pigs exhibits a \\"dominant black\\" hereditary pattern, and all piglets derived from boars or sows genotyped ED1ED1 homozygous for MC1R gene showed a uniform black coat phenotype. The BC F4 gilts displayed a good reproductive performance, showing a higher litter and tear size and were heavier at farrowing litter and at weaning litter than the CH gilts, but they reached puberty later than the CH gilts. BC F4 pigs exhibited improved growth and carcass characteristics with a higher average daily live weight gain, lower feed-to-gain ratio, and higher carcass lean meat rate than CH pigs.

Polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400) is an important constituent of eye drops and artificial tears. The present study was targeted to study the binding of -crystallin and PEG-400 employing multi spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) along with molecular modeling and docking approach. There was an apparent hypochromism in -crystallin in the presence of varying PEG-400 concentrations; the binding constant obtained was 0.9 X 105 M-1 implying that strong binding is taking place between -crystallin and PEG-400. Fluorescence spectroscopy suggested good binding of PEG-400 to -crystallin with a binding constant (K) of 106 M-1. Moreover, fluorescence quenching studies carried out at three different temperatures suggested -crystallin-PEG-400 complex formation to be guided by combination of static and dynamic modes. Thermodynamic parameters suggested -crystallin-PEG-400 complex formation is driven by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, making it seemingly specific. Far UV-CD spectra revealed no shift in the peak implying no alterations in the secondary structure of -crystallin upon PEG-400 binding further validating complex formation. In vitro assays were further entrenched by in silico assays. Molecular modeling was used to make the functionally active form of -crystallin. A binding pocket located in the  chain was delineated by Prank Web; molecular docking showed binding of PEG-400 in this pocket. This study will give an insight into the binding of PEG-400 with -crystallin and can serve as a rationale for the discovery of therapeutic molecules that can be used for the treatment of eye-related crystallin-directed diseases.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI to collect all relevant studies published before July 26, 2020, and a total of 30 papers were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the severe COVID-19 patients, 60% (95% CI = 56-64%) were male, 25% (95% CI = 21-29%) were over 65 years old, 34% (95% CI = 24-44%) were obese, and 55% (95% CI = 41-70%) had comorbidities. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (34%, 95% CI = 25-44%), diabetes (20%, 95% CI = 15-25%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD; 12%, 95% CI = 9-16%). The most common blood test abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 87%, 82-92%), decreased lymphocyte count (68%, 58-77%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (69%, 95% CI = 57-81%). In addition, abnormal laboratory findings revealing organ dysfunctions were frequently observed in the severe cases, including decrease in albumin (43%, 95% CI = 24-63%) and increase in aspartate aminotransferase (47%, 95% CI = 38-56%), alanine aminotransferase (28%, 95% CI = 16-39%), troponin I/troponin T (TnI/TnT; 29%, 95% CI = 13-45%), and serum Cr (SCr; 10%, 95% CI = 5-15%). CONCLUSION: The male, elderly and obese patients and those with any comorbidities, especially with hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, were more likely to develop into severe cases. But the association between hypertension, diabetes, CVD, and severity of COVID-19 was declined by the increase of age. A significant elevation in cardiac TnI/TnT, the hepatic enzymes, and SCr and the reduction in lymphocytes with elevated CRPs are important markers for the severity.

The Texas City BP accident in 2005 and its tremendous human and economic losses underlined the obstacles in defining a well\\\\structured corporation process safety management. The main causes of the above\\\\mentioned accident were connected to an inadequate safety culture at the managerial level. Strong leadership and high standards of corporate governance are required to inspire correct safety behavior in the staff. The so\\\\called soft skills become even more important in the Industry 4.0 arena, where the foundation of the whole system is based on an intelligent use and interpretation of data. The importance of this aspect is confirmed by several post-accidental analyses of past events. Although some research on this topic has been already done, it is worth it to dedicate some effort to identifying specific factors which influence the corporate process safety management quality, and, once identified, to assess them. This paper applies the concept of lessons learnt for the identification of organizational and managerial aspects worth consideration in process safety management. Based on accident and literature reviews and expert opinions, the aim is to identify the major contributing factors among leadership and safety culture, risk aware-ness, knowledge and competence, communication, and information and decision\\\\making processes. To self\\\\assess the level of commitment of the top leaders in process safety management, a checklist approach is proposed, combined with a quantitative, weighted evaluation based on the Relative Efficiency Indicator (REI). Positive value of REI may ensure the effectiveness of process safety management in major hazard industries and their appropriate adaptation to the corporation community.

We aimed to compare the pattern of abnormal liver tests in SARS-CoV-2 patients with those of patients infected with influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), two non-hepatotropic respiratory viruses, and their association with in-hospital mechanical ventilation or death. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 1271 hospitalized patients (872 influenza, 218 RSV, and 181 SARS-Cov-2) in a tertiary medical center. We defined abnormal liver tests as GPT, GOT or GGT[]40IU/ML at any time-point during hospitalization. Results: Abnormal liver tests were mild-moderate in the majority of patients regardless of infection type but the majority of patients with influenza or RSV had a transaminases peak earlier during hospitalization compared to patients with SARS-Cov-2. Abnormal liver tests correlated with markers of severe disease across all types of infections, and were associated with mechanical ventilation or death, occurring mainly in patients with severe liver tests abnormalities (>200IU/L) (27.2%, 39.4% and 55.6% of patients with influenza, RSV or SARS-Cov-2). In multivariate analysis, controlling for age, gender, lymphopenia and CRP, liver tests abnormalities remained significantly associated with mechanical ventilation or death for influenza (OR= 3.047, 95% CI 1.518-6.117) and RSV (OR= 3.402, 95% CI 1.032- 11.220) but not for SARS-Cov-2 (OR= 0.995, 95% CI 0.198-4.989).

MAIN TEXT: Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO(2)R) aims to eliminate blood CO(2) to fight against the adverse effects of hypercapnia and related acidosis. Hypercapnia has deleterious extrapulmonary consequences, particularly for the brain. In addition, in the lung, hypercapnia leads to: lower pH, pulmonary vasoconstriction, increases in right ventricular afterload, acute cor pulmonale. Moreover, hypercapnic acidosis may further damage the lungs by increasing both nitric oxide production and inflammation and altering alveolar epithelial cells. During an exacerbation of COPD, relieving the native lungs of at least a portion of the CO(2) could potentially reduce the patient's respiratory work, Instead of mechanically increasing alveolar ventilation with MV in an already hyperinflated lung to increase CO(2) removal, the use of ECCO(2)R may allow a decrease in respiratory volume and respiratory rate, resulting in improvement of lung mechanic. Thus, the use of ECCO(2)R may prevent noninvasive ventilation failure and allow intubated patients to be weaned off mechanical ventilation. In ARDS patients, ECCO(2)R may be used to promote an ultraprotective ventilation in allowing to lower tidal volume, plateau (Pplat) and driving pressures, parameters that have identified as a major risk factors for mortality. However, although ECCO(2)R appears to be effective in improving gas exchange and possibly in reducing the rate of endotracheal intubation and allowing more protective ventilation, its use may have pulmonary and hemodynamic consequences and may be associated with complications.

We have determined the structure of the NV protease to 1.5 and 2.2 A from crystals grown in the absence or presence, respectively, of the protease inhibitor AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride]. The protease, which crystallizes as a stable dimer, exhibits a two-domain structure similar to those of other viral cysteine proteases with a catalytic triad composed of His 30, Glu 54, and Cys 139. The native structure of the protease reveals strong hydrogen bond interactions between His 30 and Glu 54, in the favorable syn configuration, indicating a role of Glu 54 during proteolysis. Mutation of this residue to Ala abolished the protease activity, in a fluorogenic peptide substrate assay, further substantiating the role of Glu 54 during proteolysis. These observations contrast with the suggestion, from a previous study of another norovirus protease, that this residue may not have a prominent role in proteolysis (K. Nakamura, Y. Someya, T.

The initial epidemiological investigations showed that COVID-19 occurred more likely in adults, with patients younger than 10 years old accounting for less than 1% of the total number of confirmed cases, and infant infections were more rare. In our case, we present an infant who was only 35 days old when he was tested positive for COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, a 35 day-old male infant with atypical symptoms had close contact with 2 confirmed patients of COVID-19 who were his grandmother and mother. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 after his oropharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. INTERVENTIONS: The therapeutic schedule included aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon &#945;-2b and supportive therapy. OUTCOMES: Two consecutive (1 day apart) oropharyngeal swabs tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; then, the patient was discharged on February 27, 2020.

Nowadays, intensive efforts have been made to develop diverse PDE4 inhibitors for treatment of COPD, asthma and other human diseases, and four small-molecule PDE4 inhibitors have been approved by the FDA. Here, we review the current status of development of PDE4 inhibitors since 2013 and discuss the applicability of novel medicinal-chemistry strategies for identifying more efficient and safer inhibitors. AREAS COVERED This review summarizes the clinical development of PDE4 inhibitors from 2013-2021, focused on their pharmacophores, the strategies to reduce the side effects of PDE4 inhibitors and the development of subfamily selective PDE4 inhibitors. EXPERT OPINION To date, great efforts have been made in the development of PDE4 inhibitors, and researchers have established a comprehensive preclinical database and collected some promising data from clinical trials. Although four small-molecule PDE4 inhibitors have been approved by FDA for the treatment of human diseases up to now, further development of other reported PDE4 inhibitors with strong potency has been hampered due to the occurrence of severe side effects. There are currently three main strategies for overcoming the dose limitation and systemic side effects, which provide new opportunities for the clinical development of new PDE4 inhibitors.","output":"Phosphodiesterase?4 inhibitors: a review of current developments (2013-2021)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have reported the association of obesity with increased morbidity or mortality due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Previous animal studies reported that repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli potentiated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, but no clinical study has examined the effects of this intervention on hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation. We thus performed a single-center, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial to investigate whether repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli to the operative lung reduce hypoxemia during the subsequent one-lung ventilation for thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS Patients undergoing one-lung ventilation were randomized into two groups (n = 68 each). Before one-lung ventilation, in the intermittent hypoxia group, the nondependent lung was not ventilated for 2 min and then ventilated for 2 min while the dependent lung was continuously ventilated. This was repeated five times. In the continuous normoxia group, both lungs were ventilated for 20 min. We measured SpO2, PaO2, FiO2, PaCO2, SaO2, and central venous oxygen saturation during one-lung ventilation. The primary outcome was the number of patients with hypoxemia defined as a SpO2 <95% during one-lung ventilation, which was analyzed with a chi-squared test. RESULTS Hypoxemia was less frequent in the intermittent hypoxia group than in the continuous normoxia group during OLV [6/68 (8.8%) vs 17/68 (25.0%), risk ratio (95% CI) 0.35 (0.15-0.84), p = 0.012]. The PaO2 (p = 0.008 for 30 min and 0.007 for 60 min) and PaO2/FiO2 (p = 0.008 for both) were higher 30 and 60 min after starting one-lung ventilation, and the alveolar-arterial pressure gradient (p = 0.010) and shunt index (p = 0.008) were lower 30 min after starting one-lung ventilation in the intermittent hypoxia group than in the continuous normoxia group. Postoperative adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS Repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli to the operative lung seemed to potentiate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and thus reduced hypoxemia during the subsequent one-lung ventilation.","output":"Repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli to operative lung reduce hypoxemia during subsequent one-lung ventilation for thoracoscopic surgery: A randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the US economy was closed to limit the virus spread, and several emergency interventions were implemented.

While the country is currently experiencing substantial COVID-19 epidemic spread, no outbreaks have been reported yet among Syrian refugees. However, testing of this population remains limited and exposure levels are high given dire living conditions and close interaction with the host community. Here, we use quantitative insights of transmission dynamics to outline risk and contextual factors that may modulate vulnerability of Syrian refugees in Lebanon to potentially large COVID-19 epidemics.Syrian refugees live in close contact with the host community, and their living conditions are favorable for epidemic spread. We found that the high levels of crowding within Syrian refugee households and among those in informal tented settlements, the inadequate water supply and sanitation, limited use of masks, inadequate access to health care, and inadequate community awareness levels are vulnerability factors that directly impact important parameters of transmission dynamics, leading to larger epidemic scale. Poverty, stigma, and fear of legal consequences are contextual factors that further exacerbate this vulnerability. The relatively high prevalence of non-communicable diseases in this population could also affect the severity of the disease among those infected. Mathematical modeling simulations we conducted illustrated that even modest increases in transmission among Syrian refugees could result in a large increase in the incidence and cumulative total number of infections in the absence of interventions.In conclusion, while the young age structure of the Syrian refugee population might play a protective role against the scale and disease-burden severity of a potential COVID-19 epidemic, the epidemic potential due to several vulnerability factors warrants an immediate response in this population group. Local and international actors are required to mobilize and coordinate efforts to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, and to mitigate its impact amongst the vulnerable refugee populations globally.","output":"Vulnerability of Syrian refugees in Lebanon to COVID-19: quantitative insights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phylogeny construction can help to reveal evolutionary relatedness among molecular sequences.

Another aim was to analyze the S gene sequences phylogenetically. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences collected in the MENA were retrieved from the GISAID public database, together with its metadata. Mutation analysis was conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software. Phylogenetic analysis was done using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. A total of 553 MENA sequences were analyzed and the most frequent S gene mutations included: D614G=435, Q677H=8, and V6F=5.

Further, surface tension, T, should be elevated and VILI is proportional to T. Surfactant therapy is effective in NRDS but not ARDS. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) is a potential alternative T-lowering therapeutic. In anesthetized male rats, we injure the lungs with 15 min of 42 ml/kg tidal volume, VT, and zero end-expiratory pressure ventilation. Then, over 4 hrs, we support the rats with protective ventilation C VT of 6 ml/kg with positive end-expiratory pressure. At the start of the support period, we administer intravenous non-T-altering fluorescein (targeting 27 M in plasma) without or with therapeutic SRB (10 nM). Throughout the support period, we increase inspired oxygen fraction, as necessary, to maintain >90% arterial oxygen saturation. At the end of the support period we sacrifice the rat; sample systemic venous blood for injury marker ELISAs; excise the lungs; combine confocal microscopy and servo-nulling pressure measurement to determine T in situ in the lungs; image fluorescein in alveolar liquid to assess local permeability; and determine lavage protein content and wet-to-dry ratio (W/D), both to assess global permeability. Lungs exhibit focal injury. Surface tension is elevated 72% throughout control lungs and in uninjured regions of SRB-treated lungs, but normal in injured regions of treated lungs.

New and Noteworthy Sulforhodmaine B lowers T. Given the problematic intratracheal delivery of surfactant therapy for ARDS, intravenous SRB might constitute an alternative therapeutic. In a lung injury model, we find that intravenously administered SRB crosses the injured alveolar-capillary barrier, reduces T specifically in injured lung regions, improves oxygenation and reduces the degree of further lung injury.

INTERVENTION: Simultaneous recording of 1L-ECGs and 12L-ECGs with blinded manual QT assessment. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: (1) Difference in QT interval in milliseconds (ms) between the devices; (2) measurement agreement between the devices (excellent agreement <20 ms and clinically acceptable agreement <40 ms absolute difference); (3) sensitivity and specificity for detection of extreme QTc (short (340 ms) or long (480 ms)), on 1L-ECGs versus 12L-ECGs as reference standard. In case of significant discrepancy between lead I/II of 12L-ECGs and 1L-ECGs, we developed a correction tool by adding the difference between QT measurements of 12L-ECG and 1L-ECGs. RESULTS: 250 ECGs of 125 patients were included. The mean QTc interval, using Bazetts formula (QTcB), was 39325 ms (meanSD) in 1L-ECGs and 39227 ms in lead I of 12L-ECGs, a mean difference of 121 ms, which was not statistically different (paired t-test (p=0.51) and Bland Altman method (p=0.23)). In terms of agreement between 1L-ECGs and lead I, QTcB had excellent agreement in 66.9% and clinically acceptable agreement in 93.4% of observations. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting extreme QTc were 0% and 99.2%, respectively. The comparison of 1L-ECG QTcB with lead II of 12L-ECGs showed a significant difference (p=<0.01), but when using a correction factor (+9 ms) this difference was cancelled (paired t-test (p=0.43) or Bland Altman test (p=0.57)). Moreover, it led to improved rates of excellent (71.3%) and clinically acceptable (94.3%) agreement.

Methods: We conducted a rapid review of studies that investigated the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We synthesized evidence for four categories: 1) studies reporting documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by infected children; 2) studies presenting indirect evidence on the potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) children; 3) studies reporting cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools; 4) studies estimating the proportions of children infected by SARS-CoV-2, and reported results narratively. Results: A total of 16 unique studies were included for narrative synthesis. There is limited evidence detailing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected children. We found two studies that reported a 3-month-old whose parents developed symptomatic COVID-19 seven days after caring for the infant and two children who may have contracted COVID-19 from the initial cases at a school in New South Wales. In addition, we identified six studies presenting indirect evidence on the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission by children, three of which found prolonged virus shedding in stools. There is little data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. We identified only two studies reporting outbreaks of COVID-19 in school settings and one case report of a child attending classes but not infecting any other pupils or staff. Lastly, we identified six studies estimating the proportion of children infected; data from population-based studies in Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Netherlands, California and a hospital-based study in the UK suggest children may be less likely to be infected. Conclusions: Preliminary results from population-based and school-based studies suggest that children may be less frequently infected or infect others, however current evidence is limited. Prolonged faecal shedding observed in studies highlights the potentially increased risk of faeco-oral transmission in children. Further seroprevalence studies (powered adequately for the paediatric population) are urgently required to establish whether children are in fact less likely to be infected compared to adults.

The pathological data of these patients were statistically analyzed according to the Sydney classification. RESULTS Group 1 comprised of 6,787 patients with 3,915 females and 2872 males (F:M=1.3:1), while Group 2 with 1,734 females and 1,455 males (F:M=1.2:1), and this gender difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p=0.002). A comparison of the patient groups in terms of the inflammation, activation, intestinal metaplasia, and presence of H. pylori revealed a significant difference, with higher rates recorded in the COVID-19 period than in the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION In the pandemic period, the results of the upper endoscopic biopsy are adversely affected by various factors compared to the pre-pandemic period.

The current therapeutic modules of disease prevention are not fully effective and have some adverse effects on physiological parameters. In this vista, medicinal plants and their active compounds have proven to be effective against disease prevention and treatment. Ajwa dates have high nutritional value and are reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties. In the current in vitro study, Ajwa fruit pulp and seed extract were found to have strong antioxidant properties, stabilize the RBC membrane, and have a good protective capacity against protein denaturation. Besides this, the seed extract prevents glucose-mediated browning of BSA as well as inhibiting the development of cross-amyloid and AGEs formations. Molecular docking results confirm the interaction between functional residues of antioxidant enzymes and components of Ajwa fruit pulp and seed contents. Therefore, the consumption of Ajwa dates can be beneficial in disease prevention and treatment. However, more detailed study is required based on pharmacological aspects to determine the mechanisms of action of Ajwa dates components in disease prevention. ABSTRACT: This study investigated the health-promoting activities of methanolic extracts of Ajwa date seed and fruit pulp extracts through in vitro studies. These studies confirmed potential antioxidant, anti-hemolytic, anti-proteolytic, and anti-bacterial activities associated with Ajwa dates. The EC(50) values of fruit pulp and seed extracts in methanol were reported to be 1580.35  0.37 and 1272.68  0.27 g/mL, respectively, in the DPPH test. The maximum percentage of hydrogen peroxide-reducing activity was 71.3 and 65.38% for both extracts at 600 g/mL. Fruit pulp and seed extracts inhibited heat-induced BSA denaturation by 68.11 and 60.308%, heat-induced hemolysis by 63.84% and 58.10%, and hypersalinity-induced hemolysis by 61.71% and 57.27%, and showed the maximum anti-proteinase potential of 56.8 and 51.31% at 600 g/mL, respectively. Seed and fruit pulp inhibited heat-induced egg albumin denaturation at the same concentration by 44.31 and 50.84%, respectively. Ajwa seed showed minimum browning intensity by 63.2%, percent aggregation index by 64.2%, and amyloid structure by 63.8% at 600 g/mL. At 100 mg/mL, Ajwa seed extract exhibited good antibacterial activity. Molecular docking analysis showed that ten active constituents of Ajwa seeds bind with the critical antioxidant enzymes, catalase (1DGH) and superoxide dismutase (5YTU). The functional residues involved in such interactions include Arg72, Ala357, and Leu144 in 1DGH, and Gly37, Pro13, and Asp11 in 5YTU. Hence, Ajwa dates can be used to develop a suitable alternative therapy in various diseases, including diabetes and possibly COVID-19-associated complications.","output":"Role of Ajwa Date Fruit Pulp and Seed in the Management of Diseases through In Vitro and In Silico Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Next-generation COVID-19 vaccines are critical due to the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus and waning duration of the neutralizing antibody response against current vaccines. The mRNA vaccines mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 were developed using linear transcripts encoding the prefusion-stabilized trimers (S-2P) of the wildtype spike, which have shown a reduced neutralizing activity against the variants of concern B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529. Recently, a new version of spike trimer, termed VFLIP has been suggested to possess native-like glycosylation, and greater pre-fusion trimeric stability as opposed to S-2P. Here, we report that the spike protein VFLIP-X, containing six rationally substituted amino acids to reflect emerging variants (K417N, L452R, T478K, E484K, N501Y and D614G), offers a promising candidate for a next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Mice immunized by a circular mRNA (circRNA) vaccine prototype producing VFLIP-X elicited neutralizing antibodies for up to 7 weeks post-boost against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs). In addition, a balance in TH1 and TH2 responses was achieved by immunization with VFLIP-X.

Production of atherogenic trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from carnitine is a gut microbiota-directed pathway and varies widely among individuals. Here, we demonstrated a personalized TMAO formation and carnitine bioavailability from carnitine supplements by differentiating individual TMAO productivities with a recently developed oral carnitine challenge test (OCCT). By exploring gut microbiome in subjects characterized by TMAO producer phenotypes, we identified 39 operational taxonomy units that were highly correlated to TMAO productivity, including Emergencia timonensis, which has been recently discovered to convert -butyrobetaine to TMA in vitro. A microbiome-based random forest classifier was therefore constructed to predict the TMAO producer phenotype (AUROC = 0.81) which was then validated with an external cohort (AUROC = 0.80). A novel bacterium called Ihubacter massiliensis was also discovered to be a key microbe for TMA/TMAO production by using an OCCT-based humanized gnotobiotic mice model. Simply combining the presence of E. timonensis and I. massiliensis could account for 43% of high TMAO producers with 97% specificity.

There is evidence that placebo interventions can reduce insomnia symptoms, but this research has involved deceptively administering the placebo under the guise of a real medication (conventional placebo, CP), which has obvious ethical constraints. Open-label placebo (OLP) treatment, in which a placebo is administered with full disclosure that there are no active ingredients, has been proposed as a method of using the placebo effect ethically, but the efficacy and acceptability of OLP for insomnia is currently unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study uses a cohort multiple randomised controlled trial design to compare OLP, CP and no treatment for insomnia. Two-hundred and sixty-seven participants with self-reported insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI 10) will be recruited into an observational study and have their sleep monitored over a 2-week period. Participants will then be randomised to one of three groups: invite to OLP, invite to CP described deceptively as a new pharmacological agent, or no invite/observational control. Those in OLP and CP accepting the invite receive identical placebos for a 2-week treatment period while sleep is monitored in all participants. The primary outcome is ISI at the end of the treatment period. Secondary outcomes include treatment uptake and clinically significant response rates, objective and subjective sleep parameters, fatigue, mood, expectancy, treatment satisfaction and side effects. Predictors of uptake and responses to OLP and CP will be explored. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent is obtained from every participant. OLP and CP participants accepting the invite undergo an additional consent process.

In this study, 261 adult participants were evaluated for their preferences toward basic tastes and food as well as sensory evaluation of a meal prepared from cruciferous vegetables with the addition of two different salts, sodium chloride and salt substitute containing a blend of potassium and sodium salts. A general questionnaire was used to assess taste and food preferences, while the Cruciferous Vegetable Food Frequency Questionnaire (CVFFQ) was used for vegetable intake assessment. The Labeled Magnitude Scale (LMS), Just About Right (JAR) scale, and several hedonic scales were used to determine taster status and sensory evaluation. The results show that a low concentration of the salt substitute did not impact bitterness suppression but did result in higher preference of the cruciferous vegetable meal. Although, subjects self-reported to have salty taste preferences were more sensitive to bitter taste, they did not perceive samples as less salty and less acceptable than subjects with lower sensitivity.

However, the prognostic value of 3D-RVEF in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unknown. We aimed to investigate whether 3D-RVEF can predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A cohort of 128 COVID-19-confirmed patients who had undergone echocardiography were studied. Thirty-one healthy volunteers were also enrolled as controls. COVID-19 patients were divided into three subgroups (general, severe, and critical) according to COVID-19 severity-of-illness. Conventional RV structure and function parameters, RV free wall longitudinal strain (FWLS) and 3D-RVEF were acquired. RVFWLS was measured by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. RVEF was acquired by 3DE. Results: Compared with controls, 2D-RVFWLS and 3D-RVEF were both significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients (?27.2  4.4% vs. ?22.9  4.8%, P < 0.001; 53.7  4.5% vs. 48.5  5.8%, P < 0.001). Critical patients were more likely to have a higher incidence of acute cardiac injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and worse prognosis than general and severe patients. The critical patients exhibited larger right-heart chambers, worse RV fractional area change (RVFAC), 2D-RVFWLS, and 3D-RVEF and higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension than general and severe patients. Eighteen patients died during a median follow-up of 91 days. The multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed the acute cardiac injury, ARDS, RVFAC, RVFWLS, and 3D-RVEF were independent predictors of death. 3D-RVEF (chi-square to improve 18.3; P < 0.001), RVFAC (chi-square to improve 4.5; P = 0.034) and 2D-RVFWLS (chi-square to improve 5.1; P = 0.024) all provided additional prognostic value of higher mortality over clinical risk factors. Moreover, the incremental predictive value of 3D-RVEF was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than RVFAC and RVFWLS. Conclusion: 3D-RVEF was the most robust independent predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients and provided a higher predictive value over conventional RV function parameters and RVFWLS, which may be helpful to identify COVID-19 patients at a higher risk of death.","output":"Prognostic Value of Right Ventricular Ejection Fraction Assessed by 3D Echocardiography in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The IEAs Committee on Ergonomics for Children in Educational Environments originally focused on ergonomic initiatives in educational environments and studies that have used children as the participants in their research effort(s).

NPI effect on the transmission of other respiratory viruses has not been examined at the national level thus far. METHODS: Upper respiratory tract specimens from 3580 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), collected within the nationwide German ARI Sentinel, underwent RT-PCR diagnostics for multiple respiratory viruses. The observation period (weeks 1-38 of 2020) included the time before, during and after a far-reaching contact ban. Detection rates for different viruses were compared to 2017-2019 sentinel data (15350 samples; week 1-38, 11823 samples). FINDINGS: The March 2020 contact ban, which was followed by a mask mandate, was associated with an unprecedented and sustained decline of multiple respiratory viruses. Among these, rhinovirus was the single agent that resurged to levels equalling those of previous years. Rhinovirus rebound was first observed in children, after schools and daycares had reopened. By contrast, other nonenveloped viruses (i.e. gastroenteritis viruses reported at the national level) suppressed after the shutdown did not rebound. INTERPRETATION: Contact restrictions with a subsequent mask mandate in spring may substantially reduce respiratory virus circulation. This reduction appears sustained for most viruses, indicating that the activity of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the subsequent winter season might be low,whereas rhinovirus resurgence, potentially driven by transmission in educational institutions in a setting of waning population immunity, might signal predominance of rhinovirus-related ARIs.

This is the first study to investigate the relationship between PM1.0 and FEV1 and FVC of young asthmatics in Hong Kong, based on personal exposures obtained from portable sensors. Our preliminary results show that a higher level of PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 would deteriorate the health conditions of young asthmatics in HK. All correlations between particulates and lung functions are significant and negative, including PM1.0 exposure vs. FEV1 (R2=12%; p=0.023), PM1.0 exposure vs. FVC (R2=15%; p=0.010), PM2.5 exposure vs. FEV1 (R2=13%; p=0.019), PM2.5 exposure vs. FVC (R2=16%; p=0.008), PM10 exposure vs. FEV1 (R2=14%; p=0.012), and PM10 exposure vs. FVC (R2=18%; p=0.005). Moreover, after accounting for covariates, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), temperature, and relative humidity, we found a significant relationship between PM1.0 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1224; p=0.032), PM2.5 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1177; p=0.021), PM10 exposure vs. FEV1 (Coefficient=-0.0703; p=0.019), and PM10 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1204; p=0.006).

For example, disasters like wildfires have been shown to have a strong association with psychological symptomsthe 2020 U.S. Western wildfire season was the worst on record and occurred while the country was still navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented two quasi-experimental analyses, an interrupted time series analysis, and a difference-in-difference analysis to evaluate the impacts of wildfires and COVID-19 on mental health crisis help-seeking patterns. Both methods showed no statistical association between exposure to wildfires and the seeking of mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlighted that 2020 wildfires were not associated with an acute increase in crisis texts for youth in the two months after the events, likely due to an already elevated text volume in response to the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 throughout the fall wildfire season (Aug to Oct 2020). Future research is needed outside of the context of the pandemic to understand the effects of extreme and concurrent climatic events on adolescent mental health, and targeted interventions are required to ensure youth and adolescents are receiving adequate support during these types of crisis events.","output":"Understanding the concurrent risk of mental health and dangerous wildfire events in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines constitute a strategy to reduce the burden of COVID-19, but the treatment of COVID-19 is still a challenge. The lack of approved drugs for severe COVID-19 makes repurposing or repositioning of approved drugs a relevant approach because it occurs at lower costs and in a shorter time. Most preclinical and clinical tests, including safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, were already performed. However, infective and inflammatory diseases such as COVID-19 are linked with hypoalbuminemia and downregulation of both phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, which can occur in modifications of pharmacokinetics and consequentially of safety profiles. This appears to occur in a sex- and gender-specific way because of the sex and gender differences present in the immune system and inflammation, which, in turn, reflect on pharmacokinetic parameters. Therefore, to make better decisions about drug dosage regimens and to increases the safety profile in patients suffering from infective and inflammatory diseases such as COVID-19, it is urgently needed to study repurposing or repositioning drugs in men and in women paying attention to pharmacokinetics, especially for those drugs that are previously scarcely evaluated in women.","output":"Just a Reflection: Does Drug Repurposing Perpetuate Sex-Gender Bias in the Safety Profile?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although previous studies have shown that the host immune response is crucial in determining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, the association between host immune signatures and COVID-19 patient outcomes remains unclear. Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immune-inhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes, respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID-19 patients.

EOs are an excellent choice to replace petroleum-derived additives in food packaging materials due to their abundance in nature, eco-friendliness, and superior antimicrobial and antioxidant attributes. Thus far, EOs have been used in cellulose-, starch-, chitosan-, and protein-based food packaging materials. Biopolymer-based materials have lower antioxidant and antibacterial properties in comparison with their counterparts, and are not suitable for food packaging applications. Various synthetic-based compounds are being used to improve the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of biopolymers. However, natural essential oils are sustainable and non-harmful alternatives to synthetic antimicrobial and antioxidant agents for use in biopolymer-derived food packaging materials. The incorporation of EOs into the polymeric matrix affects their physicochemical properties, particularly improving their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. EOs in the food packaging materials increase the shelf life of the packaged food, inhibit the growth of microorganisms, and provide protection against oxidation. Essential oils also influence other properties, such as tensile, barrier, and optical properties of the biopolymers.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing and social distance, can slow the transmission. However, both mask and social distance have not prevented the spread of respiratory viruses SARS-CoV2 within the US. There is an urgent need to develop an intervention that could reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. The key to preventing transmission is to eliminate the emission of SARS-CoV2 from an infected person and stop the virus from propagating in the human population. Rhamnolipids are environmentally friendly surfactants that are less toxic than the synthetic surfactants.

We examined the association between psychiatric disorders and hydroxychloroquine adherence and determined whether psychiatric treatment modifies this association. METHODS: We identified incident hydroxychloroquine users among youth with SLE (ages 10-24 years) using de-identified U.S. commercial insurance claims in Optum Clinformatics? Data Mart (2000-2016). Adherence was estimated using medication possession ratios (MPR) over a 365-day interval. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of having any psychiatric disorder on MPR, as well as the independent effects of depression, anxiety, adjustment and other psychiatric disorders. We tested for interactions between psychiatric diagnoses and treatment with psychotropic medications or psychotherapy. RESULTS: Among 873 subjects, 20% had a psychiatric diagnosis, most commonly depression. Only adjustment disorders were independently associated with decreased MPRs (? -0.12, p=0.05). We observed significant crossover interactions, in which psychiatric disorders had opposite effects on adherence depending on the receipt of psychiatric treatment. Among youth with any psychiatric diagnosis, psychotropic medication use was associated with a 0.15 increase in MPR compared with no psychotropic medication (p=0.02 for interaction). Among youth with depression or anxiety, psychotherapy was also associated with a higher MPR compared with no psychotherapy (p=0.05 and p<0.01 for interaction, respectively).

Few studies have tested the allostasis theory in humans using neuroimaging. Here, we used fMRI and an instrumental learning task to test allostasis theory predictions (ATP) of functional abnormalities in both positive valence (PVS) and negative valence (NVS) accumbens systems in OUD patients with protracted abstinence (n = 15), comparing them with OUD patients receiving methadone treatment (MT) (n = 33), and with healthy controls (n = 23).

Protracted abstinence OUD patients also showed improvements in depression symptoms compared to MT patients. Residual depressive symptoms and pre-MT intravenous drug measures were associated with worse accumbens function in protracted abstinence.

To date, no nationally representative studies have examined the effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution on under-5 mortality. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of short-term exposure to PM2.5 with under-5 mortality from total and specific causes in China. METHODS: We used the national Maternal and Child Health Surveillance System to identify under-5 mortality cases during the study period of 2009 to 2019. We adopted a time-stratified case-crossover study design at the individual level to capture the effect of short-term exposure to daily PM2.5 on under-5 mortality, using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 61,464 under-5 mortality cases were included. A 10 g/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5 on lag 0-1 d was significantly associated with a 1.15% (95%confidence interval: 0.65%, 1.65%) increase in under-5 mortality. Mortality from diarrhea, pneumonia, digestive diseases, and preterm birth were significantly associated with exposure to PM2.5. The effect estimates were larger for neonatal mortality (<28 days), female children, and in warm seasons. We observed steeper slopes in lower ranges (<50 g/m3) of the concentration-response curve between PM2.5 and under-5 mortality, and positive associations remained below the 24-h PM2.5 concentration limit recommended by WHO Air Quality Guidelines and China Air Quality Standards. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide case-crossover study in China demonstrated that acute exposure to PM2.5 may significantly increase the risk of under-5 mortality, with larger effects for neonates, female children, and during warm seasons.

Approximately one-third (34.4 %) of the images containing individuals were considered objectifying. Posts also perpetuated the controllability of weight through diet (51.5 %) and physical activity (27.5 %), while 46.9 % expressed dislike towards higher-weight bodies. Future experimental research in this area will be important for understanding both the acute and long-term effects of viewing quarantine15 content on body image, weight stigmatizing attitudes and thoughts, and internalized weight stigma.","output":"#quarantine15: A content analysis of Instagram posts during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malaria is the most deadly parasitic disease, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Malaria parasites have been associated with their hosts for millions of years. During the long history of host-parasite co-evolution, both parasites and hosts have applied pressure on each other through complex host-parasite molecular interactions. Whereas the hosts activate various immune mechanisms to remove parasites during an infection, the parasites attempt to evade host immunity by diversifying their genome and switching expression of targets of the host immune system. Human intervention to control the disease such as antimalarial drugs and vaccination can greatly alter parasite population dynamics and evolution, particularly the massive applications of antimalarial drugs in recent human history. Vaccination is likely the best method to prevent the disease; however, a partially protective vaccine may have unwanted consequences that require further investigation. Studies of host-parasite interactions and co-evolution will provide important information for designing safe and effective vaccines and for preventing drug resistance. In this essay, we will discuss some interesting molecules involved in host-parasite interactions, including important parasite antigens. We also discuss subjects relevant to drug and vaccine development and some approaches for studying host-parasite interactions.","output":"Host-Malaria Parasite Interactions and Impacts on Mutual Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fireworks algorithm (FWA) is an emerging swarm intelligence inspired by the phenomenon of fireworks explosion. The numbers of sparks generated by fireworks have a great impact on the algorithm performance. It is widely accepted that promising fireworks should generate more sparks. However, in many researches, the quality of a firework is judged only on its current fitness value. This work proposes a Learning Automata-based Fireworks Algorithm (LA-FWA) introduced Learning automata (LA) to assign sparks for a better algorithm performance. Sparks are assigned to fireworks according to a state probability vector, which is updated constantly based on feedbacks from an environment so that it accumulates historical information. The probability vector converges as the search proceeds so that the local search ability of the LAFWA turns strong in the late search stage.

Their biocidal activity boosted their application in both diagnostic and therapeutic medical systems. It is therefore crucial to provide sound evidences for human-related safety of AgNPs. This study aimed to enhance scientific knowledge with regard to biomedical safety of AgNPs by investigating how their different surface properties affect human immune system. Methods: preparation, characterization and stability evaluation was performed for four differently coated AgNPs encompassing neutral, positive and negative agents used for their surface stabilization. Safety aspects were evaluated by testing interaction of AgNPs with fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) by means of particle cellular uptake and their ability to trigger cell death, apoptosis and DNA damages through induction of oxidative stress and damages of mitochondrial membrane. Results: all tested AgNPs altered morphology of freshly isolated hPBMC inducing apoptosis and cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Highest toxicity was observed for positively-charged and protein-coated AgNPs. Cellular uptake of AgNPs was also dose-dependently increased and highest for positively charged AgNPs. Intracellularly, AgNPs induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damaged mitochondrial membrane. Depending on the dose, all AgNPs exhibited genotoxic potential. Conclusions: this study provides systematic and comprehensive data showing how differently functionalized AgNPs may affect the human immune system.

Two different vaccine trials were conducted. In a small-scale experimental trial, involving 21 pregnant cows (13 vaccinated and eight unvaccinated controls), a significant increase in neutralizing antibody titres against different serotypes of bovine rotaviruses was found in both the colostrum and serum of vaccinated cows compared with that of unvaccinated controls. Seven days after birth, half of the calves born to vaccinated dams or to control cows were challenged with live virulent virus whereas the other half of both groups were left in contact with the infected calves in order to mimic a natural field challenge. Although no statistically significant differences in the rate of protection were observed among the different groups of animals, a larger number of vaccinated calves were protected in comparison with their controls, particularly where animals in contact with infected calves were concerned. Secondly, a large-scale field trial was carried out in 17 beef herds involving a total of 4066 vaccinated pregnant cows. In 11 farms morbidity and mortality in calves from vaccinated cows were compared with historical data from the previous 3 years at the same locations. In the other six herds, control groups were used to compare data of the same year: 1540 cows were vaccinated and 2700 were left as controls. Taking into account the previous and current incidence of diarrhoea, morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced in 16 of the 17 beef herds tested.

These unintended consequences can be far-reaching and just as important as the intended ones. The World Health Organization identified the assessment of unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures as a top priority. Thus far, however, their systematic assessment has been neglected due to the inattention of researchers as well as the lack of training and practical tools. MAIN TEXT: Over six years our team has gained extensive experience conducting research on the unintended consequences of complex health interventions. Through a reflexive process, we developed insights that can be useful for researchers in this area. Our analysis is based on key literature and lessons learned reflexively in conducting multi-site and multi-method studies on unintended consequences. Here we present practical guidance for researchers wishing to assess the unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures. To ensure resource allocation, protocols should include research questions regarding unintended consequences at the outset. Social science theories and frameworks are available to help assess unintended consequences. To determine which changes are unintended, researchers must first understand the intervention theory. To facilitate data collection, researchers can begin by forecasting potential unintended consequences through literature reviews and discussions with stakeholders. Including desirable and neutral unintended consequences in the scope of study can help minimize the negative bias reported in the literature. Exploratory methods can be powerful tools to capture data on the unintended consequences that were unforeseen by researchers. We recommend researchers cast a wide net by inquiring about different aspects of the mitigation measures. Some unintended consequences may only be observable in subsequent years, so longitudinal approaches may be useful. An equity lens is necessary to assess how mitigation measures may unintentionally increase disparities. Finally, stakeholders can help validate the classification of consequences as intended or unintended. CONCLUSION: Studying the unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures is not only possible but also necessary to assess their overall value. The practical guidance presented will help program planners and evaluators gain a more comprehensive understanding of unintended consequences to refine mitigation measures.","output":"The unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures matter: practical guidance for investigating them"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite numerous efforts to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, there are few longitudinal studies that examine the change in the burden of psychological distress over time and its associated factors, especially in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to assess the levels of psychological distress at two time points during the COVID-19 outbreak based on a representative community sample in Chile. The secondary aim was to identify groups that are more vulnerable to psychological distress during the pandemic. METHODS: A nationally representative, longitudinal telephone survey of Chilean adults was conducted. This study analyses panel data from two waves in 2020: May 30 to June 10 and September 15 to October 9. A total of 823 people participated in both surveys. Changes in mental health outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptoms) were assessed, estimating the effect of demographic characteristics, psychosocial and economic factors, household conditions, and health status. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in psychological distress (PHQ-4  6) between Waves 1 (22.6%) and 2 (27.0%), especially among younger participants. Overall, the results of this study show that being female, living in or near the capital, living in overcrowded households and having a perceived lack of space in the home, loneliness or perceived social isolation, and having received mental health treatment within the last year are significantly associated with psychological distress over time (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need to implement psychosocial programs to protect people's psychological well-being, as well as social policies to improve household living conditions and levels of social connectedness during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"A Longitudinal Nationwide Study of Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with cardiovascular disease are vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. Although SARS-CoV2 vaccination may be effective, its impact on surgical patients is not well studied. We investigated the effects of cardiovascular surgery, especially under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), on the antibody titers after SARS-CoV2 vaccination. METHODS: A prospective observational study was designed for patients undergoing surgery between July to November 2021. The IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD-IgG) was measured and antibody preserved rate (APR) was calculated from perioperative titers comparison. RESULTS: Enrolled 63 study patients were divided into 39 undergoing surgery with CPB (Group CPB) and 24 without CPB (Group None). Preoperative vaccines were BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) (n = 58, 92%) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (n = 5, 8%). While RBD-IgG titers did not significantly decrease after surgery in Group None, they decreased significantly in Group CPB from 21.80 [11.15, 37.85] U/ml to 11.95 [6.80, 18.18] U/ml (p < 0.001) a day after surgery, 11.40 [7.85, 22.65] U/ml (p < 0.001) 14 days after surgery, and 7.60 [4.80, 17.60] U/ml (p < 0.001) a month after surgery, respectively.

However, these data could help answer important questions in cancer surveillance and epidemiology research. Artificial intelligence (AI) data processing methods are capable of evaluating large volumes of data, yet current literature on their use in this context of pharmacy informatics is not well characterized. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate relevant publications within four domains (cancer, pharmacy, AI methods, population science) across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and included all publications indexed between July 17, 2008, and December 31, 2018. The search returned 3,271 publications, which were evaluated for inclusion. RESULTS: There were 36 studies that met criteria for full-text abstraction.

The cumulative incidence was calculated only for dehiscence that occurred after hysterectomies without evidence of malignancy. The incidence of cuff dehiscence in RALH (2.61%) versus TLH (1.94%) was not statistically significant (P = 0.60). However, among RALH patients, the overall incidence of cuff dehiscence after each surgeon's first 25 cases was low at 0.85%.

We assessed the clinical performances of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) ELISA detection in serum or plasma using the COVID-19 Quantigene? (AAZ, France) assay. METHODS: Performances were determined on 63 sera from 63 non-COVID patients and 227 serum samples (165 patients) from the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 142 serum (114 patients) obtained within 14 days after symptoms' onset. RESULTS: Specificity was 98.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.3 to 100). Sensitivity was 79.3% overall (180/227, 95% CI, 74.0 to 84.6) and 93.0% (132/142, 95% CI, 88.7 to 97.2) within 14 days after symptoms onset. 91 included patients had a sera and nasopharyngeal swabs collected in the same 24 hours.

The link of these morbidities with renin angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as the site of the multiplication of COVID-19 has widely been accepted. The objective of this research report was to delineate the clinical characteristics with COVID-19 infection with RAS and to consider its significance not just for the search of novel antiviral drugs, but for the management and prevention of death of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: It was a retrospective case series analysis of demographic and clinical data with associated comorbidities of 206 deaths reported in India up to 10th April 2020. The data were available from the official release from Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Government of India. This was followed by a literature search to correlate the available evidence for their possible relationship with RAS. RESULTS: The demographic data were consistent with those reported from other countries. The death (53.4%) was more common in patients with age above 60 years and men (69.3%) were more susceptible as compared to women (30.68%).We found that 50.5% of the deceased patients had pre-existing comorbidities. Diabetes and hypertension were the major comorbidities in 27.8% and 22.1% of the deceased cases respectively. Although respiratory and cardiac problems were prevalent at the time of death, the pre-existing pulmonary disease was comparatively less prevalent. Only 13.6% of the deceased were having pre-existing respiratory problems and 6.2% had cardiac ailments. We could correlate the reports that RAS plays a significant role in the prognosis of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection. There may be massive derangement of the entire RAS after the attack of COVID-19 and hence, patients with these pre-existing comorbidities and on ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be monitored carefully considering the role of RAS in the prognosis of COVID-19 infections.","output":"Delineating clinical characteristics and comorbidities among 206 COVID-19 deceased patients in India: Emerging significance of renin angiotensin system derangement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glutaredoxins (GRXs) are disulfide oxidoreductases that are involved in various biological processes. However, little information on the role of GRXs in the regulation of fruit ripening and the response to stress is available. In this study, we isolated 64 GRX genes from banana genome. Their encoded GRX proteins could be classified into four classes: CC, CGFS, CPYC and GRL types. The distribution and synteny of these GRXs on chromosomes, the gene structures, the promoter sequences, and the possible protein subcellular localizations were characterized. Molecular interaction network analysis suggested that MaGRX might interact with glutathione reductase (GR), sulfiredoxin, peroxiredoxin (Prx), and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC), contributing to the antioxidative defense of banana fruit. MicroRNA prediction showed that MaGRX genes might be targeted by different miRNAs. Transcriptome analysis characterized the expression profiles of different MaGRX genes during banana fruit ripening, and in response to different storage stresses. The results suggested that CC-type, CPYC-type and GRL-type MaGRXs might be more active than CGFS-type MaGRXs during banana fruit ripening and the response to stress. Moreover, MaGRX6/7/9/11/17/23/28 and MaGRL3/16/19 might play important roles in regulating fruit ripening or in response to low and high temperature, or Fusarium proliferatum infection.","output":"Genome-wide identification, characterization and expression profile of glutaredoxin gene family in relation to fruit ripening and response to abiotic and biotic stresses in banana (Musa acuminata)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Eradicating food insecurity is necessary for achieving global health goals. Liberal trade policies might increase food supplies but how these policies influence individual-level food insecurity remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between liberal trade policies and food insecurity at the individual level, and whether this association varies across country-income and household-income groups. METHODS: For this observational analysis, we combined individual-level data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN with a country-level trade policy index from the Konjunkturforschungsstelle Swiss Economic Institute. We examined the association between a country's trade policy score and the probability of individuals reporting moderate-severe or severe food insecurity using regression models and algorithmic weighting procedures. We controlled for multiple covariates, including gross domestic product, democratisation level, and population size. Additionally, we examined heterogeneity by country and household income. RESULTS: Our sample comprised 460 102 individuals in 132 countries for the period of 2014C17. Liberal trade policy was not significantly associated with moderate-severe or severe food insecurity after covariate adjustment. However, among households in high-income countries with incomes higher than US$25 430 per person per year (adjusted for purchasing power parity), a unit increase in the trade policy index (more liberal) corresponded to a 007% (95% CI ?010 to ?004) reduction in the predicted probability of reporting moderate-severe food insecurity. Among households in the lowest income decile (<$450 per person per year) in low-income countries, a unit increase in the trade policy index was associated with a 035% (006 to 060) increase in the predicted probability of reporting moderate-severe food insecurity. INTERPRETATION: The relationship between liberal trade policy and food insecurity varied across countries and households. Liberal trade policy was predominantly associated with lower food insecurity in high-income countries but corresponded to increased food insecurity among the world's poorest households in low-income countries.

Doctors in charge of the intensive care unit (ICU) usually decide whether tracheotomy should be performed. However, long-term follow-up of a closed fistula by these doctors is rarely continued in most cases. Doctors in charge of the ICU should be interested in the long-term prognosis of tracheotomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether different tracheotomy procedures affect the long-term outcome of a closed tracheal fistula. METHODS We mailed questionnaires to patients undergoing tracheotomy in Fukushima Medical University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2010. Questions concerned problems related to perception, laryngeal function, and the appearance of a closed fistula. Patients were classified into percutaneous tracheotomy (PT) group and surgical tracheotomy (ST) group. We evaluated the statistical significance of differences in the frequency and degree of each problem between the two groups. A door-to-door objective evaluation using the original scoring system was then performed for patients who replied to the mailed questionnaire. We evaluated the percentage of patients with high scores as well as the mean scores for problems with function and appearance. RESULTS We received completed questionnaires from 28/40 patients in the PT group and 35/55 patients in the ST group. There were no significant differences in age, mean hospital stay, or APACHE II score between the groups. Regarding problems with appearance, the outcomes of PT were significantly better than those of ST with respect to self-evaluation (p = 0.04) and the frequency (p = 0.03) and degree (p = 0.02) of scar unevenness according to door-to-door evaluation. However, there were no significant differences in the frequency or degree of self-evaluation in problems with perception and function between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the frequency or degree of door-to-door evaluation of problems with function. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that PT might be superior to ST with respect to problems with long-term appearance. Continuous follow-up of closed tracheal fistulas can help assure that patients recovering from a critical condition experience a better return to their former lives. A systematic follow-up of post-critical-care patients is required.","output":"Patient questionnaire following closure of tracheotomy fistula: percutaneous vs. surgical approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an urgent need for therapeutics that inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus and suppress the fulminant inflammation characteristic of advanced illness Here, we describe the anti-COVID-19 potential of PTC299, an orally available compound that is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway In tissue culture, PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2 replication (EC (50) range, 2 0 to 31 6 nM) with a selectivity index &gt;3,800 PTC299 also blocked replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus Consistent with known DHODH requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue culture models The combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, cytokine inhibitory activity, and previously established favorable pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles render PTC299 a promising therapeutic for COVID-19","output":"The DHODH Inhibitor PTC299 Arrests SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Suppresses Induction of Inflammatory Cytokines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resistance mutations to monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has been reported, but in the non-immunosuppressed population, it is unclear if in vivo emergence of SARS-CoV-2 resistance mutations alters either viral replication dynamics or therapeutic efficacy. In ACTIV-2/A5401, non-hospitalized participants with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized to bamlanivimab (700mg or 7000mg) or placebo. Treatment-emergent resistance mutations were significantly more likely detected after bamlanivimab 700mg treatment than placebo (7% of 111 vs 0% of 112 participants, P=0.003). There were no treatment-emergent resistance mutations among the 48 participants who received bamlanivimab 7000mg. Participants with emerging mAb resistant virus had significantly higher pre-treatment nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal viral load. Intensive respiratory tract viral sampling revealed the dynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, with evidence of rapid and sustained viral rebound after emergence of resistance mutations, and worsened symptom severity. Participants with emerging bamlanivimab resistance often accumulated additional polymorphisms found in current variants of concern/interest and associated with immune escape. These results highlight the potential for rapid emergence of resistance during mAb monotherapy treatment, resulting in prolonged high level respiratory tract viral loads and clinical worsening.

However, cardiac safety of these drugs is still controversial in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate association of HCQ or HCQ+AZM treatment regimens, corrected QT (QTc) interval and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, and observational study. All data were extracted from the electronic medical records. The initial and post-treatment mean QTc intervals were calculated and compared in patients with HCQ alone or HCQ+AZM therapy. Associated factors with QTc prolongation, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia during treatment and in-hospital mortality due to ventricular arrhythmias were evaluated. RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 101 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (mean age of 49.6018 years, 54.4% men). HCQ+AZM combination therapy group (n=56) was more likely to have comorbidities.

This has prompted research on improving delivery methods for applying exogenous dsRNA into plants and insects for the management of pests and pathogens. Another aspect to improve RNAi activity is the incorporation of modified 2'-F pyrimidine nucleotides into the dsRNA trigger. Modified dsRNA incorporating 32-55% of the 2'-F- nucleotides produced improved RNAi activity that increased insect mortality by 12-35% greater than non-modified dsRNA triggers of the same sequence. These results were repeatable across multiple Hemiptera: the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri, Liviidae); whitefly (Bemisia tabaci, Aleyroididae); and the glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca vitripennis, Cicadellidae). Studies using siRNA with modified 2'-F- pyrimidines in mammalian cells show they improved resistance to degradation from nucleases, plus result in greater RNAi activity, due to increase concentrations and improved binding affinity to the mRNA target. Successful RNAi biopesticides of the future will be able to increase RNAi repeatability in the field, by incorporating modifications of the dsRNA, such as 2'-F- pyrimidines, that will improve delivery after applied to fruit trees or crop plants, with increased activity after ingestion by insects.

RESULTS: The cohort included 43 men (67%), 21 women (33%), and the median age was 66 years (range: 20-92). 36 (56%) brain MRIs were considered abnormal, possibly related to SARS-CoV-2. Ischemic strokes (27%), leptomeningeal enhancement (17%), and encephalitis (13%) were the most frequent neuroimaging findings. Confusion (53%) was the most common neurological manifestation, following by impaired consciousness (39%), presence of clinical signs of corticospinal tract involvement (31%), agitation (31%), and headache (16%).

We compared the clinical characteristics, inflammatory response, and outcomes between patients with and without microbiologically confirmed ICU-acquired pneumonia. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING ICUs of a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS We prospectively collected 270 consecutive patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia. Patients were clustered according to positive or negative microbiologic results. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We compared the characteristics and outcomes between both groups. Negative microbiology was found in 82 patients (30%). Both groups had similar baseline severity scores. Patients with negative microbiology presented more frequently chronic renal failure (15 [18%] vs 11 [6%]; p=0.003), chronic heart disorders (35 [43%] vs 55 [29%]; p=0.044), less frequently previous intubation (44 [54%] vs 135 [72%]; p=0.006), more severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2: 16573 mm Hg vs 19979 mm Hg; p=0.001), and shorter ICU stay before the onset of pneumonia (55 days vs 79 days; p=0.001) compared with patients with positive microbiology. The systemic inflammatory response was similar between both groups. Negative microbiology resulted in less changes of empiric treatment (33 [40%] vs 112 [60%]; p=0.005) and shorter total duration of antimicrobials (136 days vs 1712 days; p=0.006) than positive microbiology. Following adjustment for potential confounders, patients with positive microbiology had higher hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.96, 95% confidence interval 1.24-7.04, p=0.014) and lower 90-day survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.94, p=0.031), with a nonsignificant lower 28-day survival. CONCLUSIONS Although the possible influence of previous intubation in mortality of both groups is not completely discarded, negative microbiologic findings in clinically suspected ICU-acquired pneumonia are associated with less frequent previous intubation, shorter duration of antimicrobial treatment, and better survival. Future studies should corroborate the presence of pneumonia in patients with suspected ICU-acquired pneumonia and negative microbiology.","output":"ICU-acquired pneumonia with or without etiologic diagnosis: a comparison of outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many psychological factors play a role in the COVID-19 pandemic, including various forms of worry, avoidance, and coping.

RESULTS: The network contained three major hubs, replicated across gender and age groups. The most important hub centered around worries about the dangerousness of COVID-19, and formed the core of the previously identified COVID Stress Syndrome. The second most important hub, which was negatively correlated with the first hub, centered around the belief that the COVID-19 threat is exaggerated, and was associated with disregard for social distancing, poor hand hygiene, and anti-vaccination attitudes. The third most important hub, which was linked to the first hub, centered around COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking, including self-protective behaviors such as panic buying and use of personal protective equipment.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite and has essential biological functions in inflammation. However, the kinetic effects of influenza virus infection on physiological S1P levels and their signaling in multiple tissues remain unknown. In this study, we utilized a mouse model intranasally infected with 50 or 500 plaque forming units (PFU) of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) virus to investigate how S1P levels and expression of its regulating factors are affected by influenza virus infection by the liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry and real-time PCR, respectively. The S1P level was significantly high in the plasma of mice infected with 500 PFU of the virus than that in control mice at 6 day-post-infection (dpi). Elevated gene expression of sphingosine kinase-1 (Sphk1), an S1P synthase, was observed in the liver, lung, white adipose tissue, heart, and aorta of infected mice. This could be responsible for the increased plasma S1P levels as well as the decrease in the hepatic S1P lyase (Sgpl1) gene in the infected mice. These results indicate modulation of S1P-signaling by influenza virus infection. Since S1P regulates inflammation and leukocyte migration, it must be worth trying to target this signaling to control influenza-associated symptoms.","output":"Defining the kinetic effects of infection with influenza virus A/PR8/34 (H1N1) on sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in mice by targeted LC/MS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Sars-CoV2 virus has caused serious damage in different areas.

Despite the existence of an effective vaccine, recent sporadic YF epidemics have underscored concerns about sylvatic vector surveillance, as very little is known about their spatial distribution. Here, we model and map the environmental suitability of YFs main vectors in Brazil, Haemagogus spp. and Sabethes spp., and use human population and NHP data to identify locations prone to transmission and spillover risk. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compiled a comprehensive set of occurrence records on Hg. janthinomys, Hg. leucocelaenus, and Sabethes spp. from 1991C2019 using primary and secondary data sources. Linking these data with selected environmental and land-cover variables, we adopted a stacked regression ensemble modelling approach (elastic-net regularized GLM, extreme gradient boosted regression trees, and random forest) to predict the environmental suitability of these species across Brazil at a 1 km x 1 km resolution. We show that while suitability for each species varies spatially, high suitability for all species was predicted in the Southeastern region where recent outbreaks have occurred. By integrating data on NHP host reservoirs and human populations, our risk maps further highlight municipalities within the region that are prone to transmission and spillover. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our maps of sylvatic vector suitability can help elucidate potential locations of sylvatic reservoirs and be used as a tool to help mitigate risk of future YF outbreaks and assist in vector surveillance.

For example, generating samples at the International Space Station (ISS) is challenging because the time and laboratory footprint allotted to a project can get expensive. In an effort to be economical with available resources, snap-frozen euthanized mice are the straightforward solution; however, this method increases the risk of temperature abuse during the thawing process at the beginning of the tissue collection. We found that prolonged immersion of snap frozen mouse carcass in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4C yielded minimal microscopic signs of ice crystallization and delivered tissues with histomorphology that is optimal for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and fixation on glass slides.

Evidence suggests timely follow-up is associated with reduced risk of readmission, but it is unknown whether timely follow-up reduces disparities in readmission. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether follow-up within 7 days after discharge from a hospitalization reduces risk of readmission and mitigates identified readmission disparities. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the associations between sociodemographic characteristics (race and ethnicity, dual-eligibility status, rurality, and area social deprivation), follow-up, and readmission. Mediation analysis was used to examine if disparities in readmission were mitigated by follow-up. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data from 749,402 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, or pneumonia, and discharged home between January 1 and December 1, 2018. MAIN MEASURE: All-cause unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge. KEY RESULTS: Post-discharge follow-up within 7 days of discharge was associated with a substantially lower risk of readmission (HR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.52C0.53). Across all four HRRP conditions, beneficiaries with dual eligibility and beneficiaries living in areas with high social deprivation had a higher risk of readmission. Non-Hispanic Black beneficiaries had higher risk of readmission after hospitalization for pneumonia relative to non-Hispanic Whites. Mediation analysis suggested that 7-day follow-up mediated 21.2% of the disparity in the risk of readmission between dually and non-dually eligible beneficiaries and 50.7% of the disparity in the risk of readmission between beneficiaries living in areas with the highest and lowest social deprivation. Analysis suggested that after hospitalization for pneumonia, 7-day follow-up mediated nearly all (97.5%) of the increased risk of readmission between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White beneficiaries.

We compared patients showing weight loss (n = 39, - 3.30  2.93 kg) to patients showing weight gain (n = 22, + 2.35  1.54 kg): the BMI was lower (34.60  9.18 versus 40.45  9.45 kg/m2, p = 0.02), PA increased (25.6% versus 4.5%, p = 0.04), and EDs improved (51.3% versus 13.6%, p = 0.005). Behavioral disorders increased for 12.9% of the cohort. Three individuals (3.5%) were diagnosed with non-severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with positive effects for most French adults with PWS, with weight loss probably associated with a more favourable environment during this period.

Studies on temporal trends in incidence of infection in this population are limited. We report the trends in infection-related hospitalisation in people with diabetes and compared hospitalisation rates between people with and without diabetes in Hong Kong. METHODS: Hospital admissions with infection, including pneumonia, influenza, tuberculosis, kidney infection, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, foot infection and sepsis, listed as principal diagnosis occurring between 2001 and 2016 were identified from people with diabetes in the electronic medical record system of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Data on hospitalisation for a subset of these infections in the general population between 2007 and 2016 were obtained from the Department of Health. The number of people with diabetes ranged between 117,322 in 2001 and 570,929 in 2016, and the number without diabetes ranged between 5,242,614 in 2007 and 5,593,153 in 2016. Joinpoint regression was used to describe the trends. RESULTS: In people with diabetes, over a period of 16 years, the age-standardised annual rates of hospitalisation decreased for tuberculosis but increased for influenza; rates of hospitalisation for pneumonia increased up until 2004/2005 and declined in men and stabilised in women. The rates of hospitalisation for most infection types were unchanged or increased in the 20C44 year and 45C64 year age groups and decreased in those aged 65 years or above. Trends for most of the infections were similar when comparing sexes. Between 2007 and 2016, the rate ratios of hospitalisation for most infection types between people with and without diabetes were stable, and the rate ratios remained higher in people with diabetes, ranging from 1.3C1.4 for pneumonia to 3.2C4.9 for kidney infections in 2016 compared with non-diabetic individuals. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite advances in medical care, hospitalisation due to infections remains a major healthcare burden in people with diabetes.

It is important to determine whether vaccination can mitigate this burden. This study examined the association between COVID-19 vaccination status and time until return to work among 952 healthcare workers (HCW) who tested positive for COVID-19. Study design Prospective observational study. Methods Data were collected between December 2020 and July 2021 at an academic campus in Southern California consisting of two large hospitals and multiple outpatient clinics and other facilities. HCW who tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period (N = 952, mean age = 39.2 years, 69% female, 45% Hispanic, 14% white, 14% Asian/Pacific Islander, 5% African American, and 21% other race/ethnicity) completed an initial interview and were followed until they returned to work. We assessed associations between COVID-19 vaccination status (unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated) and outcomes (days until return to work and presenting symptom). Results Return-to-work time for fully vaccinated HCWs (mean = 10.9 days) was significantly shorter than that of partially vaccinated HCWs (15.5 days), which in turn was significantly shorter than that of unvaccinated HCWs (18.0 days). Fully vaccinated HCWs also showed milder symptom profiles compared to partially vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs.

This study examined the spatiotemporal spread pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia from the index case to 291,774 cases in 13 months, emphasizing on the spatial autocorrelation of the high-risk cluster events and the spatial scan clustering pattern of transmission. METHODOLOGY: We obtained the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Malaysia from the official GitHub repository of Malaysia's Ministry of Health from January 25, 2020 to February 24, 2021, 1 day before the national vaccination program was initiated. All analyses were based on the daily cumulated cases, which are derived from the sum of retrospective 7 days and the current day for smoothing purposes. We examined the daily global, local spatial autocorrelation and scan statistics of COVID-19 cases at district level using Moran's I and SaTScan?. RESULTS: At the initial stage of the outbreak, Moran's I index > 0.5 (p < 0.05) was observed. Local Moran's I depicted the high-high cluster risk expanded from west to east of Malaysia. The cases surged exponentially after September 2020, with the high-high cluster in Sabah, from Kinabatangan on September 1 (cumulative cases = 9,354; Moran's I = 0.34; p < 0.05), to 11 districts on October 19 (cumulative cases = 21,363, Moran's I = 0.52, p < 0.05). The most likely cluster identified from space-time scanning was centered in Jasin, Melaka (RR = 11.93; p < 0.001) which encompassed 36 districts with a radius of 178.8 km, from November 24, 2020 to February 24, 2021, followed by the Sabah cluster. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Both analyses complemented each other in depicting underlying spatiotemporal clustering risk, giving detailed space-time spread information at district level. This daily analysis could be valuable insight into real-time reporting of transmission intensity, and alert for the public to avoid visiting the high-risk areas during the pandemic. The spatiotemporal transmission risk pattern could be used to monitor the spread of the pandemic.","output":"Assessing the Spatiotemporal Spread Pattern of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Esta nota tcnica tem o objetivo de analisar, de modo exploratrio, algumas vantagens e desvantagens da eventual adoo de uma fila nica, conforme vem sendo proposto, para organizar as internaes, inclusive em unidades de terapia intesiva (UTIs), em todos os hospitais pblicos e privados brasileiros, no contexto da atual pandemia do novo coronavrus (Sars-COV-2), causador da Covid-19 A anlise utiliza elementos tericos, e de resultados prticos, observados em economia da sade e, de modo complementar, em teoria das filas (Queueing Theory) Essa anlise se justifica em funo da gravidade da situao atual e da possibilidade de que a fila nica seja adotada na presente pandemia, ou que venha a ser novamente objeto de debate, em eventuais futuras pandemias, ou em epidemias que ocorram no pas","output":"A proposta de adoo de fila nica nas unidades de terapia intensiva e nas demais internaes hospitalares, durante a pandemia de Covid-19 no Brasil: consideraes tericas do campo da economia da sade sobre as alternativas disponveis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Globally, healthcare has shouldered much of the socioeconomic brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the area of clinical research, reports indicate that numerous clinical trials have had to be suspended or discontinued. However, these reports have been either qualitative in nature or limited in quantitative scope. The aim of the present analysis was to quantitatively estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the number of clinical trials worldwide. Methods: : Data deposited by 219 countries in the ClinicalTrials.gov database between 2007 and 2020 were interrogated using targeted queries. A time series model was fitted to the data for studies ongoing, initiated, or ended between 2007 Quarter (Q) 1 and 2019 Q4 to predict the expected number of trials in 2020 in the absence of COVID-19. The predicted values were compared with the actual 2020 data to quantify the impact of the pandemic. Results: : The number of ongoing registered trials showed continuous growth from 2007 Q1 to 2019 Q4 (from 33,739 to 80,319 trials). By contrast, there were markedly fewer ongoing trials in all four quarters of 2020 compared with forecasted values (1.6%C2.8% decrease). When excluding COVID-19-related studies, this disparity grew further (3.4%C5.8% decrease), to a peak of almost 5,000 fewer ongoing trials than estimated for 2020 Q2. Promisingly, however, the number of newly initiated non-COVID-19 trials was higher than predicted in 2020 Q4 (by 9.9%). Conclusions: : This quantitative analysis confirmed that the pandemic has had an appreciable impact on clinical trials.

At our institution, COVID peaked twice in 2020. The first peak showed a drop in total fellow TEE's. To counter this decline, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID testing patients requiring TEE's were implemented to maintain patient care and ensure the safety of health personnel. We analyzed the differences in fellow TEE's during the second COVID wave compared to the first to determine if these interventions prevented a decline in fellow TEE's. Methods: The monthly number of TEE's performed by fellows on core TEE rotations was plotted for the year 2019, prior to the COVID pandemic. For the data set, a linear line was fit to account for the variation of studies read over the year. This linear variation was subtracted from the monthly totals to remove seasonal variation. The degree of variation was taken as the standard deviation (SD) for 2019. The 2020 data was processed using the predictions for 2019 and the upper and lower limits of variation were taken as three times the SD of the 2019 data. Results: Using the 2019 TEE data (Figure 1A), the linear seasonal variation line was created and used to account for variations in the 2020 TEE data (Figure 1B). After accounting for seasonal variation, a significant decline is noted, indicated by the red dot, in the number of fellow TEE'sduring the month of April, the first peak (Figure 1C). Institutional guidelines for PPE and COVID testing were put in place in June 2020 and December 2020. After implementation, fellow TEE numbers improve back to baseline and remain consistent even through the December peak (Figure 1C). Conclusions: Our data demonstrates the value of PPE and COVID testing prior to TEE's can help maintain fellow education during a pandemic while ensuring the safety of fellows, faculty, and technicians. COVID brings uncertainty to the healthcare field and these systems will allow for maintenance of both fellow education and patient care.","output":"Countering the impact of covid-19 on fellow transesophageal echocardiogram education in a tertiary academic program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonwoven products are widely used in disposable products, such as wipes, diapers, and masks. Microfibers shed from these products in the aquatic and air environment have not been fully described. In the present study, 15 commercial single-use nonwoven products (wipes) and 16 meltblown nonwoven materials produced in a pilot plant were investigated regarding their microfiber generation in aquatic and air environments and compared to selected textile materials and paper tissue materials. Microfibers shed in water were studied using a Launder Ometer equipment (1C65 mg of microfibers per gram material), and microfibers shed in air were evaluated using a dusting testing machine that shakes a piece of the nonwoven back and forth (~ 4 mg of microfibers per gram material). The raw materials and bonding technologies affected the microfiber generation both in water and air conditions. When the commercial nonwovens contained less natural cellulosic fibers, less microfibers were generated. Bonding with hydroentangling and/or double bonding by two different bonding methods could improve the resistance to microfiber generation. Meltblown nonwoven fabrics generated fewer microfibers compared to the other commercial nonwovens studied here, and the manufacturing factors, such as DCD (die-to-collector distance) and air flow rate, affected the tendency of microfiber generation. The results suggest that it is possible to control the tendency of microfiber shedding through the choice of operating parameters during nonwoven manufacturing processes.

Overall, 25 players met the criteria prior to the COVID-19 induced break, playing a minimum of eight matches. Second, the physical match performance of these players was analyzed separately for each position they played. The following four parameters were captured: total distance, high-intensity distance, sprinting distance, and accelerations. Third, the 25 players physical match performance data was then compared to normative data for each position they played to understand whether players adapted their physical performance (position dependent), or maintained their performance regardless of which position they were assigned to (position independent). When switching the position, the change in physical match performance of the respective players could be explained by 44C58% through the normative positional data. Moreover, there existed large individual differences in the way players adapted or maintained their performance when acting in different positions.

However, high disease relapse rates during the tapering period or upon drug discontinuation result in long-term corticosteroid use that increases the risk of infection. This same concept applies to other immunosuppressive agents, such as antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, and cyclophosphamide. Corticosteroids are associated with a length-of-treatment and dose-dependent risk for infection. Screening and antimicrobial prophylaxis against tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) might be indicated in patients who are scheduled to be on high-dose corticosteroids for >4 weeks (>30 mg of prednisone-equivalent dose [PEQ]) or in patients chronically treated (8 weeks of continuous or intermittent corticosteroid use) with moderate doses (15 to <30 mg PEQ). Antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate) increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); however, other opportunistic infections and viral reactivation have also been reported. In case of new onset of neurological symptoms, PML needs to be considered, and an urgent neurology consultation should be obtained. Cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression can lead to serious infections related to neutropenia. PJP prophylaxis should be considered with combination therapy of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids until a PEQ dose  5 mg/d is reached. Data on infectious risk when cyclosporine is used in patients with nonmalignant hematologic diseases are lacking. Discontinuation of any immunosuppressive agent during an episode of infection is recommended.

In a cohort of 13 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China, we observed that the gut virome and bacteriome in the COVID-19 patients were notably different from those of five healthy controls.

My method for achieving this goal comprises two interlinked endeavours: first, a theoretical analysis of the concepts of crisis and national identity;second, an overview of current global conflicts and political debates to determine the extent to which they fit with a nationalist worldview. The results of this research suggest that national perspectives C from which national identities arise C are not experiencing any meaningful challenge in contemporary societies. Even in those cases where deep-seated national discourses are threatened, such opposition remains constrained by the assumptions of the nationalist worldview.

We previously established unsupervised AI, a BLSOM (batch-learning SOM), which can analyze five million genomic sequences simultaneously. The present study applied the BLSOM to the oligonucleotide compositions of forty thousand SARS-CoV-2 genomes. RESULTS: While only the oligonucleotide composition was given, the obtained clusters of genomes corresponded primarily to known main clades and internal divisions in the main clades. Since the BLSOM is explainable AI, it reveals which features of the oligonucleotide composition are responsible for clade clustering. Additionally, BLSOM also provided information concerning the special genomic region possibly undergoing RNA modifications.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are implicated in COVID-19-induced immunothrombosis. Furthermore, human cathelicidin, a NET component, can perturb the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its ACE2 receptor, which mediates viral entry into cells. At present, however, the levels of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides after SARS-CoV-2 infection and their role in COVID-19 thrombosis formation remain unclear. In the current study, we analyzed coagulation function and found a decrease in thrombin time but an increase in fibrinogen level, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was upregulated by the spike protein and significantly elevated in the plasma of patients. Furthermore, LL-37 levels were negatively correlated with thrombin time but positively correlated with fibrinogen level. In addition to platelet activation, cathelicidin peptides enhanced the activity of coagulation factors, such as factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin, which may induce hypercoagulation in diseases with high cathelicidin peptide levels. Injection of cathelicidin peptides promoted the formation of thrombosis, whereas deletion of cathelicidin inhibited thrombosis in vivo. These results suggest that cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is elevated during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may induce hypercoagulation in COVID-19 patients by activating coagulation factors.

We present US case studies to examine P transitions management in intensive agriculture, wastewater disposal, and food waste management. Our goal is twofold. By first understanding past transitions in P management in the USA, we can build upon these insights for future management. This can then be applied to other global regions such as developing countries to bypass stages of transition as they intensify agriculture, incorporate sewers into cities, and expand waste management, to avoid becoming entrenched in unsustainable P management. We suggest how spaces for experimentation and collaboration can be created, how and which actor networks can be mobilized, and what action strategies and policies can be recommended to accelerate their transition to P sustainability. Our case studies show that while substantial improvements have been made, the transition toward a circular economy of P is far from complete. Our findings point to the value of utilizing TM for future progress in the US Development of TM frameworks for managing P in other regions of the world may enable them to achieve sustainable P development faster and more effectively than the USA.","output":"A transition management framework to stimulate a circular phosphorus system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 research and antiviral discovery are hampered by the lack of a cell-based virus replication system that can be readily adopted without biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) restrictions.

General characteristics, anthropometric indices, D-Sat and mental status were assessed in these patients. Results The greatest weight loss (WL) and waist circumference (WC) change was associated with the highest tertile of the D-Sat score in the first four months of the coronavirus pandemic (P < 0.05). Participants with the highest tertile of all D-sat scores compared to those with the lowest had an 85% risk of depression.

Here, we determined whether SGLT2 inhibition affects megalin endocytic function through suppressing its O-linked ?-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) and protects the diabetic kidney from protein overload. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We treated 8-week-old male non-obese and hypoinsulinemic KK/Ta-Ins2Akita (KK/Ta-Akita) mice which develop progressive DN with an SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin or insulin for 6a?weeks, and investigated the endocytic function (proximal tubular protein reabsorption), renal expression and O-GlcNAcylation of megalin along with their effects on renal phenotypes including histology and biochemical markers. RESULTS: The treatment with ipragliflozin, but not insulin, suppressed megalin O-GlcNAcylation and accelerated its internalization, resulting in reduction in proximal tubular reabsorption of the highly filtered plasma proteins such as albumin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. These alterations following the ipragliflozin treatment contributed to amelioration of proximal tubular protein overload, mitochondrial morphological abnormality, and renal oxidative stress and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides a novel crosstalk mechanism between SGLT2 inhibition and megalin underlying the potential renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in DN.","output":"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition attenuates protein overload in renal proximal tubule via suppression of megalin O-GlcNacylation in progressive diabetic nephropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we demonstrate a statistical method for fitting the parameters of a sophisticated network and epidemic model to disease data. The pattern of contacts between hosts is described by a class of dyadic independence exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs), whereas the transmission process that runs over the network is modeled as a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) epidemic. We fit these models to very detailed data from the 1861 measles outbreak in Hagelloch, Germany. The network models include parameters for all recorded host covariates including age, sex, household, and classroom membership and household location whereas the SEIR epidemic model has exponentially distributed transmission times with gamma-distributed latent and infective periods. This approach allows us to make meaningful statements about the structure of the population-separate from the transmission process-as well as to provide estimates of various biological quantities of interest, such as the effective reproductive number, R. Using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, we produce samples from the joint posterior distribution of all the parameters of this model-the network, transmission tree, network parameters, and SEIR parameters-and perform Bayesian model selection to find the best-fitting network model. We compare our results with those of previous analyses and show that the ERGM network model better fits the data than a Bernoulli network model previously used.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of endothelial dysfunction associated with higher risk of mortality. It is unclear whether endothelial dysfunction is caused by direct infection of endothelial cells or is mainly secondary to inflammation. Here, we investigate whether different types of endothelial cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Human endothelial cells from different vascular beds including umbilical vein endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), cardiac and lung microvascular endothelial cells, or pulmonary arterial cells were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Viral spike protein was only detected in HCAECs after SARS-CoV-2 infection but not in the other endothelial cells tested. Consistently, only HCAEC expressed the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), required for virus infection. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.2 resulted in significantly higher levels of viral spike protein. Despite this, no intracellular double-stranded viral RNA was detected and the supernatant did not contain infectious virus. Analysis of the cellular distribution of the spike protein revealed that it co-localized with endosomal calnexin. SARS-CoV-2 infection did induce the ER stress gene EDEM1, which is responsible for clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER. Whereas the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 did not induce cytotoxic or pro-inflammatory effects, the variant B.1.1.7 reduced the HCAEC cell number. Of the different tested endothelial cells, HCAECs showed highest viral uptake but did not promote virus replication. Effects on cell number were only observed after infection with the variant B.1.1.7, suggesting that endothelial protection may be particularly important in patients infected with this variant.

DESIGN: A large, 1-year, prospective, observational three-centre study. First measured vital sign datasets on general wards were prospectively collected using a mobile solution system during routine patient care. Area under receiver operator characteristic curves were constructed, and comparisons between ROC curves were conducted with Delongs test for two correlated ROC curves. SETTING: One university hospital and two regional hospitals in Finland. PARTICIPANTS: All 19 001 adult patients admitted to 45 general wards in the three hospitals over the 1-year study period. After excluding 102/19 001 patients (0.53%) with data on some vital signs missing, the final cohort consisted of 18 889 patients with full datasets. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was 1-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 2-day and 30-day mortality rates. RESULTS: Patients median age was 70 years, 51% were male and 31% had a surgical reason for admission. The 1-day mortality was 0.36% and the 30-day mortality was 3.9%. The NEWS discriminated 1-day non-survivors with excellent accuracy (AUROC 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.95) and 30-day mortality with acceptable accuracy (0.75, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.77). The NEWSs respiratory rate component discriminated 1-day non-survivors better (0.78, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.84) as compared with the oxygen saturation (0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.73), systolic blood pressure (0.65, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.72) and heart rate (0.67, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.74) subcomponents (p<0.01 in all ROC comparisons). As with the total NEWS, the discriminative performance of the individual score components decreased substantially for the 30-day mortality.

We performed a systematic review on PEEP-induced recruited lung volume measured from inspiratory volume-pressure (VP) curves in ARDS patients to assess the prevalence of patients with PEEP-induced recruited lung volume and the mortality in recruiters and non-recruiters. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed to identify studies including ARDS patients in which the intervention of an increase in PEEP was accompanied by measurement of the recruited volume (V(rec) increase versus no increase) using the VP curve in order to assess the relation between V(rec) and mortality at ICU discharge. We first analysed the pooled data from the papers identified and then analysed individual patient level data received from the authors via personal contact. The risk of bias of the included papers was assessed using the quality in prognosis studies tool and the certainty of the evidence regarding the relationship of mortality to V(rec) by the GRADE approach. Recruiters were defined as patients with a V(rec) > 150 ml. A random effects model was used for the pooled data. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for individual patient data. RESULTS: We identified 16 papers with a total of 308 patients for the pooled data meta-analysis and 14 papers with a total of 384 patients for the individual data analysis. The quality of the articles was moderate. In the pooled data, the prevalence of recruiters was 74% and the mortality was not significantly different between recruiters and non-recruiters (relative risk 1.20 [95% confidence intervals 0.88C1.63]). The certainty of the evidence regarding this association was very low and publication bias evident. In the individual data, the prevalence of recruiters was 70%. In the multivariable logistic regression, V(rec) was not associated with mortality but Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and driving pressure at PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O were. CONCLUSION: After a PEEP increment, most patients are recruiters. V(rec) was not associated with ICU mortality. The presence of similar findings in the individual patient level analysis and the driving pressure at PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O was associated with mortality as previously reported validate our findings.

A Proof-of-Verifying consensus scheme is then designed to remove low-quality model updates and manage qualified model updates in a decentralized and secure manner, thereby achieving secure FEL. To improve communication efficiency of the blockchain-empowered FEL, a gradient compression scheme is designed to generate sparse but important gradients to reduce communication overhead without compromising accuracy, and also further strengthen privacy preservation of training data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographics, injury details, hospital quality measures, and outcomes were reviewed for a consecutive series of patients presenting to our institution with an operative hip fracture. In May of 2019, a new protocol assigning the responsibility to indicate a patient for preoperative TTE was mandated to the co-managing hospitalist at the institution. Patients were split into pre-protocol and post-protocol cohorts. Linear regression modeling and comparative analyses were conducted with a Bonferroni adjusted alpha as appropriate. RESULTS: Between September 2015 and June 2021, 1002 patients presented to our institution and were diagnosed with a hip fracture. Patients in the post-protocol cohort were less likely to undergo a preoperative echocardiogram, experienced a shorter time (days) to surgery, shorter length of stay, an increase in amount of home discharges, and lower complication risks for urinary tract infection and acute blood loss anemia as compared to those in the pre-protocol cohort. There were no differences seen in inpatient or 30-day mortality. Multivariable linear regression demonstrated a patients comorbidity profile (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)) and their date of presentation (pre- or post-protocol), were both associated with (P<0.01) a patients' time to surgery. CONCLUSION: A standardized preoperative work flow protocol regarding which physician evaluates and determines which patients require a preoperative TTE allows for a streamlined perioperative course for hip fracture patients.

The unpredictability of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) poses a major burden on health care and economic systems across the world. This is caused by the paucity of in-depth knowledge of the risk factors for severe COVID-19, insufficient diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the absence of specific and effective drug treatments. While protective humoral and cellular immune responses are usually mounted against these betacoronaviruses, immune responses to SARS-CoV2 sometimes derail towards inflammatory tissue damage, leading to rapid admissions to intensive care units.

Following Spencer (2013), this study examines the relationship between the mix of household-scale water supplies, sanitation systems, and construction materials, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among poultry in a developing country: Vietnam. Findings of our multivariate logistic regressions suggest that a non-linear, Kuznets-shaped urban transition (Spencer, 2013) has an independent effect on the outbreak of HPAI, especially as it relates to household-level sanitation infrastructure. We conclude that the Kuznets-shape development of household infrastructure characteristics in Vietnam play a significant role in explaining where poultry outbreaks occur. Using secondary data from the Census of Population and Housing, and the Agricultural Census at the District and Commune levels for the country of Vietnam, we performed logistic regression to test the relationship between outbreaks of HPAI in poultry and newly-developed coherence indices (Spencer, 2013) of household water supply, sanitation, and construction materials that measure nonlinear, transitional development. Results show that district-scale coherence indices are negatively and independently correlated with HPAI outbreaks, especially for sanitation.

The review identified 12 factors across 3 layers, including: 1) macro-layer ( policy-level , legal, other-structural), 2) meso-layer ( specialty-level historical telehealth rationale, hospital-organizational, specialty-society, treatment, technological, research, cultural) and 3) micro-layer ( individual-level provider-and-patient-specific) factors. A key finding was that among higher-using medical specialties, the specialty societies and hospital organizations in the meso - layer , proactively promoted telehealth use by influencing both macro- and micro-layer factors (e.g., advocating for consistent payment policies and enabling provider practices to be more tech-savvy & patient-centric, respectively). Conclusion: By identifying a comprehensive set of contextual, individual (and interaction) factors influencing telehealth use across six medical specialties, this review addresses a gap and provides a foundation for future research. Importantly, it identifies: 1) strategies for reducing variation in telehealth use across medical specialties, and 2) implications for ensuring widespread sustainability in the post-pandemic era.","output":"Specialty-level Factors Historically Influencing Telehealth Use Can Provide Implications for Sustainability in a Post-Pandemic Era: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the world and become a new virus threatening the health of all mankind. The survey found that prostate cancer accounts for one in three male cancer patients infected with COVID-19. This undoubtedly makes prostate cancer patients face a more difficult situation. Prostate cancer is the second most harmful malignant tumor in men because of its insidious onset, easy metastasis, and easy development into castration-resistant prostate cancer even after treatment. Due to its high immunogenicity and a small number of specific infiltrating T cells with tumor-associated antigens in the tissue, it is difficult to obtain a good therapeutic effect with immune checkpoint blocking therapy alone. Therefore, in the current study, we developed a platform carrying Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded black phosphate nanometer combined with photothermal therapy (PTT) and found this drug combination stimulated the immungentic cell death (ICD) process in PC-3 cells and DC maturation. More importantly, zinc ions have a good immunomodulatory function against infectious diseases, and can improve the killing ability of the nanosystem against prostate cancer cells. The introduction of Aptamer (Apt) enhances the targeting of the entire nanomedicine. We hope that this excellent combination will lead to effective treatment strategies for prostate cancer patients infected with COVID-19.","output":"Zinc-Loaded Black Phosphorus Multifunctional Nanodelivery System Combined With Photothermal Therapy Have the Potential to Treat Prostate Cancer Patients Infected With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The recent lockdown, resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, has had a strong social and psychological impact on the most fragile individuals and family structures. In the present work we investigated the experience of families without specific elements of social or health vulnerability during the quarantine period that occurred in the spring of 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May and July 2020, 22 primary care pediatricians belonging to AUSL Romagna administered to a number of families a questionnaire to detect changes that occurred, during the lockdown, in family environment, school attendance and personal attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 721 questionnaires were collected, analyzing the associations between variables relating to home environment, daily rhythms, school and warning signs in relation to the age of children. As a result of the lockdown, family habits changed in 31% of cases, with a greater presence of the reference figure in 68% of these. Three out of four families reported they had sufficient domestic spaces, and nine out of ten had access to an outdoor, private or condominium space. Daily rhythms were preserved in 56.7% of cases; mood disorders appeared in 30% of adolescent children, followed by sleep, appetite and psychosomatic disorders. One in three children has made progress in terms of evolution and behavior, and one in 5 children has seen their relationships improve. The overall resilience of families during the lockdown period was considered good in 66.3%, sufficient in 31.3% and not satisfactory in only 2.4% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that, in the interviewed families, the simultaneous presence of adults and children at home has generally intensified. Families refer, on the whole, a positive and resilient behavior in the lockdown period, even if initial emotional problems are reported in one out of three children-adolescents. The ability to maintain a family organized structure seems to be partially compromised. Forced cohabitation leads to competition for the same resources of time and space and affects the entire family unit. The school institution emerges as a protective factor for children, young people and also for the well-being of families themselves.","output":"[Impact of the lockdown on children and families: a survey of family pediatricians within a community.]/ Impatto del lockdown sui bambini e sulle famiglie: un'indagine dei pediatri di famiglia all'interno di una comunit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Protection of Brand Rights has a strategic role in increasing healthy business competitiveness, as well as in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational single center study, we evaluated 96 COVID-19 patients referred to the RICU for acute respiratory failure (ARF) according to their transferal to the ICU or their stay at the RICU. We compared demographic data, baseline laboratory profile, and final clinical outcomes to identify early risk factors for transfer. RESULTS: The best predictors for transfer to the ICU were elevated C-reactive protein and lymphopenia. The mortality rate was lower in the RICU than in the ICU, where transferred patients who died were mostly younger men and with less comorbidities than those in the RICU.

These are songs with new lyrics set to the tunes of established and well-known popular songs. The new lyrics describe life during the pandemic, the experience of isolation during lockdown, the importance of wearing masks and washing hands, the importance of social distancing when one is out. The pandemic parodies are a comment, sometimes jocular sometimes more anguished, on the new normal. They are posted on social media sites, mostly YouTube but also other sites such as TikTok, and invite comments from their audience about everything from the quality of the recording to the accuracy of the lyrics in reflecting people's lives during this time. Some of these parodies are by semi-professional singers, others by amateurs. Most of the parodists are white males and most of the songs parodied are from the 1970s and 1980s, part of the cultural capital of Generation X. This article argues that calling these songs parodies invites misunderstanding. They function more like the ballads of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when new lyrics would be written to be sung to well-known tunes. Often these lyrics would be commentaries on significant public or political events. This article argues that the pandemic parodies function similarly only now rather than the new lyrics being sold in the streets by hawkers, the songs are available on the web. At a time when the popular music industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation as a consequence of the impact of new technologies such as streaming, these pandemic parodies suggest another transformation in the production and consumption of popular music.","output":"Parodies for a pandemic: coronavirus songs, creativity and lockdown.

To get shielded through this war, the world is racing to reach and manufacture COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination hesitancy is one of the significant obstacles to global health. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the perception and attitude of healthcare workers in Egypt toward COVID-19 vaccines, acknowledge the determinants of their attitude, and the factors that could increase the acceptance of the vaccine. METHODS: an observational web-based anonymous survey was conducted on 385 Egyptian healthcare workers in different governorates. The questionnaire-based on Vaccine Hesitancy Survey Questions of the World Health Organization was available in Arabic and English languages and was tested for reliability. RESULTS: Regarding vaccination decision, 51% of the participants were undecided, 28% refused, and 21% accepted vaccination. Reasons for vaccine acceptance mainly were risks of COVID-19 (93%), safety (57.5%), and effectiveness (56.25%) of the vaccine. Simultaneously, the reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the absence of enough clinical trials (92.4%) and fear of side effects of the vaccine (91.4%). The leading factor that could increase vaccination acceptance among the participants was to get sufficient and accurate information about the available vaccines. The participants revealed a high mean level of concern for COVID-19 vaccines safety (3.8 of 5) that differs significantly among the different study groups (P-value .002).

OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the organisation and the characteristics of consultations in Belgian out-of-hours primary care during five weekends at the peak of a COVID-19 outbreak and compares it to a similar period in 2019. METHODS: Real-time observational study using pseudonymised routine clinical data extracted out of reports from home visits, telephone- and physical consultations (iCAREdata). Nine general practice cooperatives (GPCs) participated covering a population of 1 513 523. RESULTS: All GPCs rapidly re-organised care in order to handle the outbreak and provide a safe working environment. The average consultation rate was 222 per 100 000 citizens per weekend. These consultations were handled by telephone alone in 40% (N = 6293). A diagnosis at risk of COVID-19 was registered in 6692 (43%) consultations,. Out of 5311 physical consultations, 1460 were at risk of COVID-19 of which 443 (30%) did not receive prior telephone consultation to estimate this risk. Compared to 2019, the workload initially increased due to telephone consultations but afterwards declined drastically. The physical consultation rate declined by 45% with a marked decline in diagnoses unrelated to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners can rapidly re-organise out-of-hours care to handle patient flows during a COVID-19 outbreak. Forty percent of the out-of-hours primary care contacts are handled by telephone consultations alone. We recommend to give a telephone consultation to all patients and not to rely on call takers to differentiate between infectious and regular care. The demand for physical consultations declined drastically provoking questions about patients safety for care unrelated to COVID-19.","output":"Organisation and characteristics of out-of-hours primary care during a COVID-19 outbreak: A real-time observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Chorioamnionitis complicates about 1C5% of deliveries at term and causes about one-third of stillbirths. CXC-chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) binds IL-8 with high affinity and regulates neutrophil recruitment. We aimed to determine the immunoexpression of CXCR1 in placentas with chorioamnionitis, and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes. Methods: A total of 101 cases of chorioamnionitis and 32 cases of non-chorioamnionitis were recruited over a period of 2 years. CXCR1 immunohistochemistry was performed, and its immunoexpression in placentas was evaluated. The adverse perinatal outcomes included intrauterine death, poor APGAR score, early neonatal death, and respiratory complications. Results: Seventeen cases (17/101, 16.8%) with chorioamnionitis presented as preterm deliveries. Lung complications were more common in mothers who were >35 years (p = 0.003) and with a higher stage in the foetal inflammatory response (p = 0.03). Notably, 24 cases (23.8%) of histological chorioamnionitis were not detected clinically. Interestingly, the loss of CXCR1 immunoexpression in the umbilical cord endothelial cells (UCECs) was significantly associated with foetal death (p = 0.009). Conclusion: The loss of CXCR1 expression in UCECs was significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and could be used as a biomarker to predict adverse perinatal outcomes in chorioamnionitis.

The pre-pandemic cohort includes 969 pregnant women recruited in 2018. The pandemic cohort comprises 1168 pregnant women recruited in 2020. Information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, reproductive history, characteristics of the current pregnancy and its outcome were obtained from medical records. Birth by Caesarean section was more frequent in the pre-pandemic cohort (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55C0.92). A birth weight lower than 2500 g and higher than 4000 g occurred more frequently in the pre-pandemic cohort (adjusted OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.41C0.93 for lower than 2500 g and adjusted OR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.20C0.46 for higher than 4000 g).

The secondary aim was to describe differences in nursing workload in COVID-19 patients, pneumonia patients and other patients on the Intensive Care. We finally wanted to assess the cause of possible differences in Nursing Activities Scores between the different groups. METHODS: We analyzed data on nursing staff and nursing workload as measured by the Nursing Activities Score of 3,994 patients and 36,827 different shifts in 6 different hospitals in the Netherlands. We compared data from the COVID-19 period, March 1st 2020 till July 1st 2020, with data in a non-COVID period, March 1st 2019 till July 1st 2019. We analyzed the Nursing Activities Score per patient, the number of patients per nurse and the Nursing Activities Score per nurse in the different cohorts and time periods. Differences were tested by a Chi-square, non-parametric Wilcoxon or Student's t-test dependent on the distribution of the data. RESULTS: Our results showed both a significant higher number of patients per nurse (1.1 versus 1.0, p<0.001) and a significant higher Nursing Activities Score per Intensive Care nurse (76.5 versus 50.0, p<0.001) in the COVID-19 period compared to the non-COVID period.

The ORF must remain open throughout most of its sequence for replication to occur. To determine the qualitative importance of the N portion of the chimeric ORF in DI RNA replication, transcripts of mutated reporter-containing constructs were tested for replication in helper virus-infected cells. It was determined that the N ORF could not be replaced by the naturally occurring internal I protein ORF, accomplished by deleting the first base in the N start codon which leads to a +1 frameshift, nor could it be replaced by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ORF. Furthermore, 3'-terminal truncations of the N gene leaving less than 85% of its total length were likewise not tolerated. Small in-frame deletions and in-frame foreign sequence insertions of up to 99 nucleotides within certain regions of the N ORF were tolerated, however, but the rate of DI RNA accumulation in these cases was lower.

Moreover, the course concept is based on a variety of methods, including MS Teams with screencasts, videos, synchronous teaching sessions, gamified audience response systems, the online Inverted Classroom Model and a final oral examination. Despite various challenges such as the short planning period or the necessary restructuring of a part previously planned as \\"en bloc\\", the experiences are mostly positive. Among other things, the use of MS Teams as an integrated learning, collaboration and communication platform has proven to be useful. In the students' feedback, the broad use of methods, the gamification elements and the flexibility of the lecturers are evaluated positively.","output":"Digital health communication and health literacy in times of COVID-19.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of community pharmacists in Qatar was conducted. Pharmacists burnout was measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory: Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI-HSS? for MP-Mindgarden). Resilience was assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10). Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Fear of COVID-19 was assessed by the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). RESULTS: 256 respondents completed the survey and were included in the final study analysis (response rate: 42.7%). Overall, participants reported a moderate level of burnout as illustrated in the mean scores of the three burnout dimensions; 20.54 (SD=12.37) for emotional exhaustion, 6.76 (SD=6.22) for depersonalization, and 36.57 (SD=9.95) for personal accomplishment. Moreover, depression, anxiety and stress were reported by 44.8%, 53.2% and 25.4% of particiants respectively. Participants had shown moderate resilience (mean score: 27.64 (SD=8.31)) and their mean score fear of COVID19 was 15.67 (SD=6.54). Fear of COVID-19 was a statistically significant and an independent predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress levels. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacists experienced moderate burnout but moderate resilience, which indicates their potential to overcome difficulties. Future interventions at the personal, national and organizational levels are required to enhance the pharmacists wellbeing by decreasing stress, improving self-efficacy and resilience, and preventing burnout.","output":"Mental Health Problems, Burnout and Resilience in Community Pharmacists during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Chemical Countermeasures Research Program (CCRP) was established in 2006 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH) on behalf of the National Institutes of Health Office of the Director (NIH OD).

In doing so, these religions found new modalities of practising rituals and transmitting sacred knowledge in the digital world. Despite the fundamental importance of bodily engagement in these religious expressions, Candombl and Umbanda practitioners are increasing their presence online through producing different types of pedagogical, educational and ritual contents. While on the one hand, this new content aims at promoting social distancing and sanitary precautionary measures, on the other hand, it involves a restructuring of the dynamics of legitimation and power that are present in Afro-religious social structures.

The simple framework adopted for the assessment accounts for two kinds of costs that a society may bear in a pandemic. The first is welfare loss due to infection and its consequences, and the second is welfare loss resulting from a slowdown in economic transactions. We call the first infection costs, and the second economic costs, for convenience in the paper. Efficient social distancing should minimize the sum of these costs. Infection costs are likely to decrease with social distancing at a decreasing rate as intensified social distancing eases pressure on scarce resources for intensive care. Economic costs on the other hand are likely to increase at an increasing rate as extreme slowdown in economic life may entail job losses and business failures. The resulting U-shaped total costs curve implies parity between infection costs and economic costs as a necessary condition for efficiency. In a simplified implementation of the framework, we approximate infection costs by the value of (statistical) lives lost, and economic costs by the gap between the actual gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 and the potential GDP as predicted by the within-country growth trend during the preceding decade. The results for 158 countries suggest that the global community perhaps reacted with overly strict social distancing measures. The results for the subgroup of high-income countries, however, suggest that these countries were more successful in maintaining the parity between infection and economic costs.","output":"A Ballpark Assessment of Social Distancing Efficiency in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe empirical basis for a quantitative assessment of the disease burden imposed by long-COVID is currently scant. We aimed to assess the disease burden caused by long-COVID in Japan. MethodsWe conducted a cross sectional self-report questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was mailed to 530 eligible patients, who were recovered from acute COVID-19 in April 2021. Answers were classified into two groups; participants who have no symptom and those who have any ongoing symptoms that lasted longer than four weeks at the time of the survey. We compared health-related quality of life scores estimated by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire between these two groups after adjusting basic characteristics of the participants by propensity score matching. Results349 participants reported no symptoms and 108 reported any symptoms at the time of the survey. The participants who reported any symptoms showed a lower value on a Visual Analogue Scale (median 70 [IQR 60-80]) and on the EQ-5D-3L (median 0.81 [IQR 0.77-1.0]) than those reporting no symptoms (median 85 [IQR 75-90] and 1.0 [IQR 1.0-1.0], respectively). After adjusting for background characteristics, these trends did not change substantially (Visual Analog Scale: median 70 [IQR 60-80] vs 80 [IQR 77-90], EQ-5D-3L: median 0.81 [IQR 0.76-1.0] vs 1.0 [IQR 1.0-1.0]).

This has heavily affected the quality of life in border regions, which are often found to be at a disadvantage when compared to other regions in terms of employment, accessibility, social services and economic growth. Based upon developing threads in the literature concerning the untapped potential for development in border regions, we argue that the Mission-Oriented Approach (MOA) can fit well with the ambitious goal to revitalize those territories in the aftermath of the pandemic. Despite the surge of MOA in discourses on innovation policy, we seek to implement it in a regional development perspective, pursuing both economic and social policy objectives. The authors unravel the policy concept of MOA into three main aspects: I) address a sound societal challenge; II) Research & Development (R&D) regional agenda embedded in a cross-border regional development vision; III) mobilizing multiple cross-sectorial projects. Through a desk study analysis, the authors draw insights from selected case studies where these aspects have been implemented to inspire policy intervention in the aftermath of COVID-19.

Reflective practice provides an opportunity for individuals to learn through their experience as well as gaining insight into themselves and their practice. If completed effectively, it has been shown to reduce stress and improve mental well-being. Our aim therefore was to provide regular group reflective practice sessions with the aim of supporting junior doctor's mental wellbeing during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Junior doctors within a critical care setting were offered two-weekly group reflective practice sessions focusing on difficult or challenging cases and encounters. The sessions were offered to all junior and middle grade doctors within a critical care department in a small district general hospital. Consultants were also able to attend. The groups were facilitated by a consultant liaison psychiatrist and an accredited balint group leader. Critical care doctors were provided a feedback questionnaire assessing the impact of the sessions and the levels of stress and burnout. The themes emerging from the sessions were also explored. RESULT: A total of six reflective practice sessions were offered during a three-month period. A total of four reflective practice sessions were completed; two sessions were cancelled due to high workload on the department. Each session lasted approximately 50mins. On average a total of 3-4 junior doctors attended each session. The sessions were conducted face to face in a socially distanced manner and with all participants wearing face masks. The sessions were predominately attended by foundation doctors and SHOs. There was occasional attendance by middle grades and a consultant. The predominant themes that emerged included: guilt, prolonged suffering, desensitisation, support and exhaustion. Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and lockdown, many of the doctors also acknowledged the benefit of being at work during both waves of the pandemic. There was a sense of collectiveness and group belonging. The group found it beneficial to be able to share their experiences and challenges faced; this was most striking amongst the very junior members of the team. Questionnaires were also provided to gain additional insight into the wellbeing of the critical care doctors. Worryingly the results highlighted a significant proportion of doctors were experiencing signs of burnout including fatigue (77%), lack of energy (54%), cynicism (31%), frustration and irritability (45%) and detachment (38%). Many of the issues highlighted were in response to the demand created by the pandemic and a lack of medical staffing wth 69% of doctors requesting regular feedback on staffing issues. CONCLUSION: Burnout and low morale were already highlighted in a significant number of junior doctors prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 has identified a clear need for NHS employers and medical leaders to provide emotional and psychological support to staff. It is vital that we create an open environment where individuals can express their feelings openly without fear that they will be judged. Group reflective practice provides an avenue to build on collectiveness created during both waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pilot has demonstrated that if introduced as part of a wellbeing support package, junior doctors within a critical care setting are able to utilise the sessions in an effective and productive manner.","output":"The introduction of regular group reflective practice sessions for junior doctors in a critical care setting during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic C a Pilot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review is dedicated to the development of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and the application of MIPs in sensor design.

Cash transfers have also been used as a key instrument in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This article uses an exploratory research strategy to understand how non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and governments implement humanitarian cash transfer in a post-disaster setting. This article asks: what are the institutional constraints and opportunities faced by humanitarian emergency responders in ensuring an effective humanitarian cash transfer, and how do humanitarian actors address such institutional constraints? In this article, we have introduced a new conceptual framework, namely the humanitarian and disaster management ecosystem for cash transfer. This framework allows non-governmental actors to restore complex relations amongst state, disaster survivors (citizen), local market economy and civil society. Mixed methods and multistage research strategies were used to collect and analyse primary and secondary data. The authors conclude that by implementing cash transfers in the context of post-tsunamigenic earthquakes and liquefaction hazards, NGOs must co-create an ecosystem of response that aims to restore disaster-affected peoples access to cash and basic needs. However, in order to ensure such access to basic needs, the responders must first restore relations between the states and their citizens before linking the at-risk communities with the private sectors to jump-start local livelihoods and market economy.","output":"Creating an institutional ecosystem for cash transfer programmes in post-disaster settings: A case from Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study examines perceptions of the operational and organisational management of a major outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Perspectives were sought from key decision-makers and clinical staff about the factors perceived to promote and inhibit effective and rapid control of the outbreak. SETTING: A large teaching tertiary healthcare centre in KSA; the outbreak lasted 6 weeks from June 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected via individual and focus group interviews with 28 key informant participants (9 management decision-makers and 19 frontline healthcare workers). DESIGN: We used qualitative methods of process evaluation to examine perceptions of the outbreak and the factors contributing to, or detracting from successful management. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Five themes and 15 subthemes were found. The themes were related to: (1) the high stress of the outbreak, (2) factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, (3) factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, (4) factors inhibiting outbreak control and (5) long-term institutional gains in response to the outbreak management. CONCLUSION: Management of the MERS-CoV outbreak at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh was widely recognised by staff as a serious outbreak of local and national significance. While the outbreak was controlled successfully in 6 weeks, progress in management was inhibited by a lack of institutional readiness to implement infection control (IC) measures and reduce patient flow, low staff morale and high anxiety. Effective management was promoted by greater involvement of all staff in sharing learning and knowledge of the outbreak, developing trust and teamwork and harnessing collective leadership. Future major IC crises could be improved via measures to strengthen these areas, better coordination of media management and proactive staff counselling and support.","output":"Perceptions of postoutbreak management by management and healthcare workers of a Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in a tertiary care hospital: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The lockdown and social distancing caused by COVID-19 may influence common health behavior.

The conducted analysis, however, is part of a broader trend of research on the solutions incorporated into the labour law in force in connection with the pandemic, implemented on the basis of the legislation of particular European countries. The author proposes a thesis that the introduced solutions, assessed collectively, have fulfilled their purpose C they have made it possible for employers to survive in spite of the restrictions on the way they conduct their business and have curbed the increase in unemployment. However, the analysis of particular solutions that were applied reveals their numerous short-comings, including those related to compliance with European law and the Polish Constitution. The results of the research are original and may be a valuable contri-bution to further, more in-depth scientific studies, becoming a point of reference for comparative legal research.

Michigan Medicine, a primary regional health center, provided an ideal setting to understand serologic testing patterns over time. Between 27 April 2020 and 3 May 2021, characteristics for 10,416 individuals presenting for SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests (10,932 tests in total) were collected. Relative to the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out date, 14 December 2020, the data were split into a pre- (8026 individuals) and post-vaccine launch (2587 individuals) period and contrasted with untested individuals to identify factors associated with tested individuals and seropositivity. Exploratory analysis of vaccine-mediated seropositivity was performed in 347 fully vaccinated individuals. Predictors of tested individuals included age, sex, smoking, neighborhood variables, and pre-existing conditions. Seropositivity in the pre-vaccine launch period was 9.2% and increased to 46.7% in the post-vaccine launch period. In the pre-vaccine launch period, seropositivity was significantly associated with age (10 year; OR = 0.80 (0.73, 0.89)), ever-smoker status (0.49 (0.35, 0.67)), respiratory disease (4.38 (3.13, 6.12)), circulatory disease (2.09 (1.48, 2.96)), liver disease (2.06 (1.11, 3.84)), non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (2.18 (1.33, 3.58)), and population density (1.10 (1.03, 1.18)). Except for the latter two, these associations remained statistically significant in the post-vaccine launch period.

METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively collected data from 99 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 19 January and 17 February 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China. We classified them into 2 groups based on whether the virus test results eventually became negative. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding. RESULTS: Among 99 patients, 61 patients had SARS-CoV-2 clearance (virus-negative group), but 38 patients had sustained positive results (virus-positive group). The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 excretion was 15 (interquartile range, 12-19) days among the virus-negative patients. The shedding time was significantly increased if the fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA test result was positive. Male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .35-.98]), immunoglobulin use (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, .24-.76]), APACHE II score (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, .84-.96]), and lymphocyte count (HR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.05-3.1]) were independent factors associated with a prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Antiviral therapy and corticosteroid treatment were not independent factors. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance time was associated with sex, disease severity, and lymphocyte function. The current antiviral protocol and low-to-moderate dosage of corticosteroid had little effect on the duration of viral excretion.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Factors Associated With Long-Term Viral Excretion in Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: a Single-Center 28-Day Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disproportional morbidity and mortality experienced by ethnic minorities in the UK have been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this commentary, we argue that the term 'aftercare' fails to articulate the nature of ongoing care required by people who are managing AOD use. We maintain that 'aftercare' positions post-residential care as being less important than other treatment modalities, rather than as integral to a continuum of care. It is a term that implies that care should be acute, like much treatment delivered through a medical model, and assumes that people follow linear pathways in managing their AOD use. Assumptions embedded in the term 'aftercare' such as these may disincline governments from funding ongoing services for people exiting intensive programs.

The age-related remodelling of the immune system affects both adaptive and innate immunity. In particular, a chronic low-grade inflammation, termed inflammaging, is associated with the aging process. Immunosenescence not only is present in inflammaging state, but it also occurs in several pathological conditions in conjunction with chronic inflammation. It is known that persistent inflammation stimulates a counteracting compensatory immunosuppression intended to protect host tissues. Inflammatory mediators enhance myelopoiesis and induce the generation of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) which in mutual cooperation stimulates the immunosuppressive network. Immunosuppressive cells, especially MDSCs, regulatory T cells (Treg), and M2 macrophages produce immunosuppressive factors, e.g., TGF-, IL-10, ROS, arginase-1 (ARG1), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which suppress the functions of CD4/CD8T and B cells as well as macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells. The immunosuppressive armament (i) inhibits the development and proliferation of immune cells, (ii) decreases the cytotoxic activity of CD8T and NK cells, (iii) prevents antigen presentation and antibody production, and (iv) suppresses responsiveness to inflammatory mediators. These phenotypes are the hallmarks of immunosenescence.

For such datasets it is very costly and time-consuming to obtain the accurate 3D segmentation markup to train neural networks. The annotation is typically done for a limited number of 2D slices, followed by an interpolation. In this work, we propose a pre-training method SortingLoss. It performs pre-training on slices instead of volumes, so that a model could be fine-tuned on a sparse set of slices, without the interpolation step. Unlike general methods (e.g. SimCLR or Barlow Twins), the task specific methods (e.g. Transferable Visual Words) trade broad applicability for quality benefits by imposing stronger assumptions on the input data. We propose a relatively mild assumption -- if we take several slices along some axis of a volume, structure of the sample presented on those slices, should give a strong clue to reconstruct the correct order of those slices along the axis. Many biomedical datasets fulfill this requirement due to the specific anatomy of a sample and pre-defined alignment of the imaging setup. We examine the proposed method on two datasets: medical CT of lungs affected by COVID-19 disease, and high-resolution synchrotron-based full-body CT of model organisms (Medaka fish). We show that the proposed method performs on par with SimCLR, while working 2x faster and requiring 1.5x less memory.

The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively. For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day. But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment. The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh ( . ) since in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic. Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase. The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial. In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh ( . ) could satisfy the aforementioned properties. By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results. They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually. Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to 0.021 % , in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to 0.012 % and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of - 0.195% in the short-term period of infection. In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February. In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained. A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented. This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China.

AE was defined by the presence of delirium or depressed level of consciousness in the absence of deep sedation. Controls were identified as patients not developing AE and were matched by propensity score for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 24-h Apache III score and invasive ventilation use. RESULTS: The total number of eligible ICU admissions during our study period was 152,999. AE was present in 57,726 (37.7%) with a median AE duration of 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.0C51.8) hours. We matched 14,645 cases with AE with the same number of controls. Cefepime was used in 1241 (4.2%) patients and its use was associated with greater incidence of AE [713 (4.9%) vs 528 (3.6%), p < 0.001] and duration [unit estimate 0.73; (95% CI 0.542C0.918)]. On multivariate analysis, cefepime was associated with an increased likelihood of AE after controlling for shock, midazolam infusion and acute kidney injury [OR 1.24 (95% CI 1.10C1.27)]. These associations were also present after controlling for prior chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: The use of cefepime is associated with increased likelihood and duration of AE. These associations are stronger among patients with impaired renal function, but can also occur in patients without renal impairment.

Despite urgent and extensive global efforts, the existing evidence is inconclusive regarding the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. PURPOSE: To generate an up-to-date evidence for the clinical safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZ) among patients treated for COVID-19. Data Source. PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, LITCOVID, Web of Science, SCOPUS, BioRxiv, Embase, MedRxiv, and Wiley online library were searched from 2019/12/30 to 2020/05/23. Study Selection. Three investigators assessed the quality of the studies. Data Extraction. Data about study characteristics, effect estimates, and the quality of the studies were extracted by two independent reviewers and cross-checked by the third reviewer. Data Synthesis. The data of 6,782 (HCQ group, 3623; HCQ + AZ group, 1,020; control group, 2139) participants were included. HCQ was compared with standard care for virologic efficacy, disease progression, mortality, and adverse effects. HCQ was also compared with HCQ + AZ for QTc prolongation, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality. The study found HCQ did not alter the rate of virologic cure (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.39C1.56) and the risk of mortality (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.66C2.39). The pooled prevalence for mortality was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.9%C10.8%). Moreover, HCQ did not impact disease progression (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.36C2.29) but resulted in a higher risk of adverse effects (OR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.15C4.8). HCQ was also compared against HCQ + AZ, and no difference was observed in QTc prolongation above 500 ms (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.54C2.28), admission to the intensive care unit (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.52C1.63), and mortality (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.55C1.43). However, in the analysis of single-arm studies, about 11.2% (95% CI: 7.0%C15.5%) of patients have developed an absolute increase of QTc greater than 500 ms, and 4.1% (95% CI: 1.1%C7.1%) of patients discontinued their medication. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis and systematic review, which included a limited number of poorly designed studies of patients with COVID-19, revealed HCQ is intolerable, unsafe, and not efficacious. Similarly, HCQ + AZ combination was not different from HCQ alone in curbing mortality and ICU admission.","output":"The Outcome of Hydroxychloroquine in Patients Treated for COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study uses a public health lens to review evidence about the impacts of wearing a school uniform on students' health and educational outcomes.

We aimed to study the incidence and clinical characteristics of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to respiratory viruses in adults adding PCR to routine conventional laboratory tests. METHODS Consecutive adult patients diagnosed of CAP from January 2003 to March 2004 were included. Conventional tests including cultures of blood, sputum, urine antigen detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, and paired serologies were routinely performed. Nasopharyngeal swabs were processed for study of respiratory viruses through antigen detection by indirect immunofluorescence assay, isolation of viruses in cell culture and detection of nucleic acids by two independent multiplex RT-PCR assays. According to the aetiology, patients were categorized in 4 groups: group 1, only virus detected; group 2, only bacteria detected; group 3, viral and bacterial; and group 4, unkown aetiology. RESULTS Of 340 patients diagnosed with CAP, 198 had nasopharyngeal swabs available and were included in this study. Aetiology was established in 112 (57%) patients: group 1, n=26 (13%); group 2, n=66 (33%); group 3, n=20 (10%). The most common aetiological agent was S. neumoniae (58 patients, 29%), followed by respiratory viruses (46 patients, 23%). Forty-eight respiratory viruses were identified: influenza virus A (n=16), respiratory syncytial virus A (n=5), adenovirus (n=8), parainfluenza viruses (n=5), enteroviruses (n=1), rhinoviruses (n=8) and coronavirus (n=5). There were two patients coinfected by two respiratory viruses. Serology detected 6 viruses, immunofluorescence 8, viral culture 12, and PCR 45. For the viruses that could be diagnosed with conventional methods, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR was 85% and 92%, respectively. The only clinical characteristic that significantly distinguished viral from bacterial aetiology was a lower number of leukocytes (P=0.004). CONCLUSION PCR revealed that viruses represent a common aetiology of CAP. There is an urgent need to reconsider routine laboratory tests for an adequate diagnosis of respiratory viruses, as clinical characteristics are unable to reliably distinguish viral from bacterial aetiology.","output":"The role of viruses in the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Tamiflu/oseltamivir phosphate (OP), an anti-influenza drug, has a highly doubted safety especially after many cases of abnormal behaviour and deaths reported after being used. Such controversy was also locally and globally generated, especially after being heavily used in COVID-19 treatment protocol. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of three different doses of OP on the liver and kidneys of male adult albino rats through histological approaches, measuring their DNA integrity and biochemical analyses. Different doses of Tamiflu applied to humans were converted to rats, then observed their effects on the liver and kidneys. Rats were divided into four groups. G1: considered as control group. The rest of the three treated groups were received the same calculated dose of Tamiflu (6.75 mg/kg b.w.) in three different durations. G2, G3 and G4 represented the animals orally received OP, in which the rats received OP twice for 5 consecutive days, once for 10 and 45 days, respectively. Results Our data showed numerous deleterious necrotic and fibrotic histopathological changes in the liver, and kidneys;as well as necrotic DNA smears, by using electrophoresis, in OP-treated rats of G2 and G4. In addition, OP significantly increased the serum cellular hepatic/renal toxicity markers (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, indirect bilirubin, urea, creatinine, uric acid, & Na+). Also, it showed a reduction in the levels of serum total protein, albumin and K+ ions in rats of G2 and G4 compared with G1. In G3, OP treatment did not significantly alter hepatic/renal histological, DNA integrity and biochemical analyses in rats. Conclusions The therapeutic and long-term prophylactic doses of OP most likely cause structural and functional hepato- and nephrotoxicity in experimentally subjected rats. So, caution must be taken during Tamiflu treatment, and not used for long durations and/or with repetitive doses (time- and/or accumulative-dose-dependent); especially with patients suffer from liver and/or kidney dysfunction, while the short-term prophylactic dose of OP appears to be relatively safe and could be explored for oral medications.

We now investigate its potential effects on the brain versus the semirecumbent position. We studied 17 anesthetized pigs and randomized to be ventilated and positioned as follows: duty cycle (TI/TTOT) of 0.33, without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), placed with the bed oriented 30 in anti-Trendelenburg (control group); positioned as in the control group, with TI/TTOT adjusted to achieve an expiratory flow bias, PEEP of 5 cm H2O (IRV-PEEP); positioned in 5 TP and ventilated as in the control group (TP). Animals were challenged into the oropharynx with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We assessed hemodynamic parameters and systemic inflammation throughout the study. After 72 h, we evaluated incidence of microbiological/histological VAP and brain injury. Petechial hemorrhages score was greater in the TP group (P = 0.013). Analysis of the dentate gyrus showed higher cell apoptosis and deteriorating neurons in TP animals (P < 0.05 vs. the other groups). No differences in systemic inflammation were found among groups. Cerebral perfusion pressure was higher in TP animals (P < 0.001), mainly driven by higher mean arterial pressure. Microbiological/histological VAP developed in 0%, 67%, and 86% of the animals in the TP, control, and IRV-PEEP groups, respectively (P = 0.003). In conclusion, the TP prevents VAP; yet, we found deleterious neural effects in the dentate gyrus, likely associated with cerebrovascular modification in such position.

OBJECTIVE: We searched for protein sequence alignment between herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) HSV-2, and A. METHODS: Protein data bank (pdb) structures for A, HSV-1, and HSV-2 were searched on the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The protein structures were superimposed and aligned on PYMOL v 2.3.4. RESULTS: For HSV-1 and A, amino acid residues ser549 C his569 of HSV-1 aligned closely with residues asp7 - asn27 of A. For HSV-2 and A, amino acid residues of HSV-2 aligned less closely than those of HSV-1 with residues of A. CONCLUSION: Conjugating and binding to the same alpha helix in the HSV-1 protease, A could be marking HSV-1 for attack by the immune system, providing a rapid inherited immune response to a destructive neurotropic virus that would otherwise require the more time-consuming involvement of T-cells, B-cells, and the adaptive immune system.

The specialized care hospital used a treatment protocol including hydroxyurea, a medication commonly used for sickle cell treatment, to improve respiratory distress in the COVID-19 patients. None of the COVID-19 patients included in the analyzed data were diagnosed with sickle cell, and none had previously taken hydroxyurea for any other conditions. RESULTS: In all presented cases, patients reverted to their baseline respiratory health after treatment with the hydroxyurea protocol.

Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions (both at national and local levels) the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in some cases, to be consistent with plateau- or shoulder-like phenomena. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, epidemic dynamics can be characterized by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations after exponential rises at the outset of disease dynamics. We also show that incorporating long-term awareness can avoid peak resurgence and accelerate epidemic decline. We suggest that awareness of epidemic severity is likely to play a critical role in disease dynamics, beyond that imposed by intervention-driven policies.","output":"Moving Beyond a Peak Mentality: Plateaus, Shoulders, Oscillations and Other Anomalous Behavior-Driven Shapes in COVID-19 Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The necessity to know information about the real identity of an online subject is a highly relevant issue in User Profiling, especially for analysis from digital sources such as social media.

For many years this issue has received a considerable amount of attention from the whole community, which has developed several solutions, also based on machine learning, to estimate user characteristics.

In this work, we focus on the problem of load forecasting. With strict social distancing restrictions, power consumption profiles around the world have shifted both in magnitude and daily patterns. These changes have caused significant difficulties in short-term load forecasting. Typically algorithms use weather, timing information and previous consumption levels as input variables, yet they cannot capture large and sudden changes in socioeconomic behavior during the pandemic. In this paper, we introduce mobility as a measure of economic activities to complement existing building blocks of forecasting algorithms. Mobility data acts as good proxies for the population-level behaviors during the implementation and subsequent easing of social distancing measures. The major challenge with such dataset is that only limited mobility records are associated with the recent pandemic. To overcome this small data problem, we design a transfer learning scheme that enables knowledge transfer between several different geographical regions. This architecture leverages the diversity across these regions and the resulting aggregated model can boost the algorithm performance in each region's day-ahead forecast. Through simulations for regions in the US and Europe, we show our proposed algorithm can outperform conventional forecasting methods by more than three-folds.

Despite its disruptive effect, it is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated in Bangladesh. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of migraines and its impact on daily life of university students in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,352 students of Rajshahi University and Jahangirnagar University during March 2020 through a self-administered online survey. ID Migraine? scale and HIT-6 scale were used to screen migraine and its impact respectively. Frequency distribution, Chi-square test and t-test along with multiple logistic regressions model were used to determine the prevalence and associated factors of migraine respectively. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of migraine among the participants was 21.4%. The prevalence was higher among females (29%) than males (12%). A multivariable logistic regression model provided the following eight risk factors of migraine: (i) gender (p < 0.01), (ii) family income (p < 0.01), (iii) marital status (p < 0.01), (iv) infrequent exercise (p < 0.01), (v) family history of headache (p < 0.01), (vi) high screen time (p < 0.05), (vii) depressive symptoms (p < 0.05) and (viii) anxiety disorder (p < 0.01). More than two-thirds of the people with migraines reported more than five attacks during the past month with moderate to severe intense headache. Stress was the most reported trigger of migraine among university students (71%) followed by irregular sleep (47%), academic pressure (33%), and external noise (28%). Almost 37% of the participants who had migraines reported that headache caused severe impact in their day to day life. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of migraine among university students of Bangladesh is alarmingly high. Frequent migraine attacks and severe intensity of headache cause a substantial level of impact among the sufferers.

Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP bind more tightly to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively).

Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation.

A total of 502 physicians completed the online survey, of which 62.0% (n = 312) were male. General physicians accounted for 51.2%, while internal-medicine specialists and pulmonologists accounted for 26.9% and 6.6%, respectively. Only 146 (29%) physicians had referred COPD patients to a PR program. The difference in referral rates between all specialties (p = 0.011) was statistically significant. Physicians with more years of experience were more likely to refer COPD patients to PR (p < 0.001). Moreover, a home-based PR program was preferred by 379 physicians (75.5%), and 448 (89.2%) perceived smoking cessation as an essential component of PR. Availability of PR centers (69%) was the most common barrier for not referring patients to PR. The overall referral rate was low among all physicians, owing to a lack of PR centers and trained staff.

We listened to stories about the challenges they faced, and the initiative and actions they took during the lockdown of nine towers in public housing estates of inner Melbourne during June and July of 2020. In this research, we have found that, despite many pre-existing disadvantages, young people of refugee background have responded to the crisis through public health promotion, volunteering, and innovation. The pandemic has highlighted the role that young people play in supporting their families and communities in the settlement/integration process and the added responsibilities young people have assumed in the context of COVID-19. In negotiating these, young people have drawn upon embodied and communal ways of coping. This paper starts with an exploration of refugee young peoples narratives about their lives and experiences during the pandemic. We adopt intersectionality as a method and analytical tool to interpret these experiences and the roles in which young people have enacted during this timeas navigators, carers, providers, and innovators.

Notably, the alphaviruses encode catalytically active macrodomains capable of ADP-ribosylhydrolase (ARH) activities, implying a role in remodeling the cellular ADP-ribosylome. This report decouples mono- and poly-ARH contributions to macrodomain function using a newly engineered Sindbis virus (SINV) mutant with attenuated poly-ARH activity. Our findings indicate that viral poly-ARH activity is uniquely required for high titer replication in mammalian systems. Despite translating incoming genomic RNA as efficiently as WT virus, mutant viruses have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection, offering a more complete understanding of the kinetics and role of the alphavirus macrodomain with important implications for broader ADP-ribosyltransferase biology. IMPORTANCE Viral macrodomains have drawn attention in recent years due to their high degree of conservation in several virus families (e.g., coronaviruses and alphaviruses) and their potential druggability. These domains erase mono- or poly-ADP-ribose, posttranslational modifications written by host poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) proteins, from undetermined host or viral proteins to enhance replication. Prior work determined that efficient alphavirus replication requires catalytically active macrodomains; however, which form of the modification requires removal and from which protein(s) had not been determined. Here, we present evidence for the specific requirement of poly-ARH activity to ensure efficient productive infection and virus replication.","output":"Sindbis Macrodomain Poly-ADP-Ribose Hydrolase Activity Is Important for Viral RNA Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 and resulting lockdowns have had a tremendous impact on our daily activities, and subsequently, the traffic on the roads.

Psychological resilience has never been investigated live (e.g., in the moment) throughout the duration of an extreme endurance challenge, despite anecdotal accounts of the need for resilience to successfully function in such environments. The aim of the study was to explore psychological resilience with challenge team members (n = 4, mean age = 46.0 years) involved in a 25-day extreme endurance challenge. The object of the challenge was to TAB (Tactical Advance to Battle, fast marching with weighted packs) 100 peaks in the UK in 25 days and complete long-distance bike rides between base camps. A mixed-methods approach with a focus on qualitative methods was utilised. Specifically, individual reflective video diaries (n = 47) and focus groups (n = 4) were completed and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). At the same time, the 10-item Connor Davidson Resilience Scale was employed to measure resilience, which highlighted the individualised and dynamic nature of resilience. Two superordinate themes were identified from the video diaries and focus groups, namely, the identification of the stressors within extreme environments and strategies to maintain functioning. Stressors were split into subordinate themes of significant and every day, and collectively, they created a cluster effect which contributed to pressure associated with operating in these environments. Challenge team members employed various strategies to maintain functioning, including using a challenge mindset to positively appraise pressure as a challenging learning experience.

Quantifying uncertainty accompanied by point estimation is essential because it mitigates model unfairness and permits practitioners to develop trustworthy systems which abstain from suboptimal decisions due to low confidence. Explicitly, assessing uncertainties associated with DNNs predictions is critical in real-world card fraud detection settings for characteristic reasons, including (a) fraudsters constantly change their strategies, and accordingly, DNNs encounter observations that are not generated by the same process as the training distribution, (b) owing to the time-consuming process, very few transactions are timely checked by professional experts to update DNNs. Therefore, this study proposes three uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques named Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble, and ensemble Monte Carlo dropout for card fraud detection applied on transaction data. Moreover, to evaluate the predictive uncertainty estimates, UQ confusion matrix and several performance metrics are utilized. Through experimental results, we show that the ensemble is more effective in capturing uncertainty corresponding to generated predictions.

We used Google Trends (GT) to investigate whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to smell loss during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Iran, and The Netherlands. METHODS: GT was used to explore internet activity related to loss of smell in the 8 aforementioned countries. Spearman rank analysis was performed to correlate loss-of-smell-relative search volumes (RSVs), with the increases of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and deaths attributed to disease. As a control event, we also performed analysis of smell-related searches during the last UK influenza epidemic of 2009. RESULTS: In all 8 countries, we observed strong correlations between daily RSVs related to loss of smell, increases of daily COVID-19+ cases and deaths ranging from 0.633 to 0.952. All correlations were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is a strong correlation between the frequency of searches for smell-related information and the onset of COVID-19 infection in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran, and The Netherlands.

For this reason, there is an emphasis on evaluating diagnostic tools for screening. Chest CT scans are emerging as a useful tool in the diagnostic process of viral pneumonia cases associated with COVID-19. This review examines the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 in its various phases was compared using RT-PCR as a gold standard. A \\"reverse calculation approach\\" was applied and treated chest CT as a hypothetical gold standard and compared RT-PCR to it point out the flaw of the standard approach. RESULTS: High sensitivity (67-100%) and relatively low specificity (25-80%) was reported for the CT scans. However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was reported to be modest (53-88%), hence cannot serve as an appropriate ground truth. The \\"reverse calculation approach\\" showed that CT could have a higher specificity (83-100%) if we consider the modest sensitivity of the RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of the chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 and the radiation exposure have to be judged together. Arguments are presented that chest CT scans have added value in diagnosing COVID-19 especially in patients, who exhibit typical clinical symptoms and have negative RT-PCR results in highly infected regions. KEY POINTS: a? CT scans have higher specificity if we take into account the low sensitivity of the RT-PCR. a? Avoid chest CT as a sole diagnostic approach for COVID-19 infection. a?

Thrombi discovered in the postoperative period are referred to as endovenous heat-induced thrombi (EHIT). In spite of the few studies of the ultrasound differentiation between EHIT and deep vein thrombi (DVT), there remains a paucity of literature regarding the evaluation of ultrasound examination and pathologic differentiation. METHODS Six Yorkshire cross swine underwent femoral vein thrombosis by suture ligation or endovenous radiofrequency ablation. At 1 week after the procedure, each femoral vein was imaged by color Duplex ultrasound and sent for histologic interpretation for differentiation between EHIT and DVT. Five blinded vascular surgery faculty, two vascular surgery fellows, and three vascular surgery residents reviewed the ultrasound images. RESULTS Thrombi associated with radiofrequency ablation demonstrated a greater degree of hypercellular response, fibroblastic reaction, and edema (3.42 vs 2.92; 3.75 vs 2.42; 2.83 vs 1.33). Specimens harvested from the iatrogenic-induced DVT swine demonstrated a more prolific response to trichrome staining (3.42 vs 2.67). Evidence of revascularization was found in all of the EHIT specimens but in 33% of DVT specimens. On the basis of histologic findings, the pathologist predicted correct modality 92% of the time. Subgroup analysis comparing paired specimens from each swine failed to demonstrate any marked pathologic differences. Recorded ultrasound images from EHIT and DVT samples were reviewed by fellows, residents, and vascular surgery staff to determine whether clot was stationary or free-floating (n = 111; 93%), evidence of retracted or adherent vein (n = 105; 88%), and absence of color flow (n = 102; 85%). The degree of occlusion (partial vs total) and degree of distention of a visualized vein were least likely to be agreed on by reviewers (n = 95; 79% each, respectively). In subgroup (DVT vs EHIT) analyses, the percentage agreement was greatest among vascular surgery fellows (89% and 92%) compared with residents (82% and 79%) and faculty (78% and 77%). CONCLUSIONS It is possible to differentiate the thrombus origin on pathologic examination but not clinically on ultrasound. Wide variability exists for ultrasound diagnosis of EHIT and de novo DVT. Care must be taken in evaluating post-treatment duplex scans to not assign diagnosis of EHIT when DVT may well be present and extending into the deep venous system. The modulation of collagen production in the treatment of DVT may be helpful in preventing vascular dysfunction and reducing the post-thrombotic changes. Further studies on injury after radiofrequency ablation and laser ablation are needed.","output":"Venous duplex and pathologic differences in thrombus characteristics between de novo deep vein thrombi and endovenous heat-induced thrombi."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The motor threshold measurement is a standard in preintervention probing in TMS experiments.

For monophasic, bidirectional, and unidirectional rectangular stimuli in posterior-anterior or anterior-posterior directions as generated by the cTMS device, computational modeling of the HH model captured the experimentally measured population-averaged motor threshold values at high precision (maximum error  8%). The convergence of our biophysically based modeling study with experimental data in humans reveals that the effect of the stimulus shape is strongly correlated with the activation kinetics of the voltage-gated ion channels. The proposed method can reliably predict motor threshold size using the conductance-based neuronal models and could therefore be embedded in new generation neurostimulators.

However, since 2020, myocarditis linked to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is now common. In recent months, myocarditis related to COVID-19 vaccines has also been described. This study aims to compare these three different types of myocarditis with regards to clinical presentation, course, and outcomes. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients <21 years of age hospitalized at our institution with classic viral myocarditis from 2015-2019, MIS-C myocarditis from 3/2020-2/2021 and COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis from 5/2021-6/2021. We compared demographics, initial symptomatology, treatment, laboratory data, and echocardiogram findings. Results: Of 201 total participants, 43 patients had classic myocarditis, 149 had MIS-C myocarditis, and 9 had COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis. Peak troponin was highest in the classic myocarditis group, whereas the MIS-C myocarditis group had the highest recorded brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).

Demographic and obstetric data were similar in the SARS-CoV-2+ women across all sites - characterised by predominantly Black/Middle Eastern women, and women with elevated body mass index. DISCUSSION: Overall, the frequency of placental abnormalities is increased in SARS-CoV-2+ women, but the incidence of placental abnormalities is also higher in SARS-CoV-2- women that gave birth during the pandemic, which highlights the importance of appropriate control groups to ascertain the roles of pandemic stress and SARS-CoV-2 infection on the placenta and pregnancy outcomes.","output":"Pandemic stress and SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with pathological changes at the maternal-fetal interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aleutian mink disease virus is the type species in the genus Amdoparvovirus, and in mink and other Mustelidae can cause either subclinical disease or fatal chronic immune stimulation and immune complex disease.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a relatively common condition affecting young females that could lead to permanent blindness if not properly treated. In this article, we provide some insight and recommendations regarding the management of IIH during the pandemic. METHODS The diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment methods of IIH during the COVID-19 pandemic period are reviewed. COVID-19 as a mimic of IIH is also discussed. RESULTS Diagnosis and follow-up of papilledema due to IIH during the COVID-19 pandemic can be facilitated by nonmydriatic fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. COVID-19 may mimic IIH by presenting as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, papillophlebitis, or meningoencephalitis, so a high index of suspicious is required in these cases. When surgical treatment is indicated, optic nerve sheath fenestration may be the primary procedure of choice during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION IIH is a serious vision threatening condition that could lead to permanent blindness and disability at a relatively young age if left untreated. It could be the first presentation of a COVID-19 infection. Certain precautions during the diagnosis and management of this condition could be taken that may allow appropriate care to be delivered to these patients while minimizing the risk of coronavirus infection.","output":"Management of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension during the COVID19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess the association between pet ownership and quality of life (QoL), loneliness, anxiety, stress, overall health, and mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic using a One Health perspective.

In this study, we report the successful assembly of one single gapless, unambiguous contiguous sequence representing the complete viral genome from a nasopharyngeal swab of an infected health care worker in Cairo, Egypt. The sequence has all typical features of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, with no protein-disrupting mutations.

Both affected proteins, S and NSP3, are relevant to vaccine and drug development. Although the genome, named CU_S3, belongs to the prevalent global genotype, marked by the D614G spike variation, the combined variations in the spike proteins and ORF1a do not co-occur in any of the 197,000 genomes reported to date.

Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. We aim to quantify vulnerability to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing and mask usage. SETTING: The Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage and a well-functioning test-and-trace system. PARTICIPANTS: None (simulation study). RESULTS: We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower and vice versa. Scenarios with very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case) were estimated to lead to a robustly controlled epidemic. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period was projected to be 2-3 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 8-12 times higher if the testing rate was 65% or 30-50 times higher with a 50% testing rate. In reality, NSW diagnosed 254 locally acquired cases over this period, an outcome that had a moderate probability in the model (10%-18%) assuming low mask uptake (0%-25%), even in the presence of extremely high testing (90%) and near-perfect community contact tracing (75%-100%), and a considerably higher probability if testing or tracing were at lower levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Role of masks, testing and contact tracing in preventing COVID-19 resurgences: a case study from New South Wales, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19-, SARS- and MERS-related coronaviruses share many genomic and structural similarities. However, the SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Despite some differences in the cytokine patterns, it seems that the cytokine storm plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-, SARS- and MERS. Monocytes and macrophages may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2-dependent and ACE2-independent pathways. SARS-CoV-2 can effectively suppress the anti-viral IFN response in monocytes and macrophages. Since macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) act as antigen presenting cells (APCs), the infection of these cells by SARS-CoV-2 impairs the adaptive immune responses against the virus. Upon infection, monocytes migrate to the tissues where they become infected resident macrophages, allowing viruses to spread through all organs and tissues. The SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and macrophages can produce large amounts of numerous types of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to local tissue inflammation and a dangerous systemic inflammatory response called cytokine storm. Both local tissue inflammation and the cytokine storm play a fundamental role in the development COVID-19-related complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Here, we describe the monocytes and macrophage responses during severe coronavirus infections, while highlighting potential therapeutic interventions to attenuate macrophage-related inflammatory reactions in possible approaches for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Contribution of monocytes and macrophages to the local tissue inflammation and cytokine storm in COVID-19: Lessons from SARS and MERS, and potential therapeutic interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Post\\\\viral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is one of the most common causes of olfactory loss.

Case Description/Methods: A 74 year-old male with a past medical history of Dementia, Parkinson's Disease, Controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was admitted with worsening dyspnea found to be COVID-19 positive. Vitals on presentation: 84 beats/min heart rate, 151/95 mmHg blood arterial pressure, 98.1 F temperature, 18 breaths/min, and 89% O2 saturation. On examination, he was oriented to person, place, but not time. Breath sounds were coarse bilaterally, and the abdomen was soft, mildly distended, active bowel sounds. Initial lab work was unremarkable. He was admitted and started on dexamethasone, remdesevir, and supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. The following day, the patient had increasing abdominal distention and nausea. An abdominal film was obtained which revealed a gas-distended stomach with concern for gastric outlet obstruction. CT showed similar gastric distention, progression of oral contrast, and dilated sigmoid colon. The patient was made NPO and nasogastric (NG) tube was placed with removal of 1L of bilious content, a bedside rectal tube was placed, and IV metoclopramide was started. Over the next several days, the patient had a gradual improvement in NG output and abdominal distention with close monitoring. Follow up abdominal plain films showed complete resolution of gastric and colonic distention, tubes were removed, and diet was advanced.

OBJECTIVES: To detect outcomes associated with nurses PAS and the factors that influence PAS and to review the psychometric properties of instruments used to measure PAS in a hospital setting. DESIGN AND METHODS: A scoping review was performed to identify outcomes associated with PAS, factors influencing PAS and instruments measuring PAS. A search of PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Business Source Complete and Embase databases identified 2609 potentially relevant articles. Data were independently extracted, analysed and synthesised. The quality of studies describing influencing factors or outcomes of PAS and psychometric properties of instruments measuring PAS were assessed following the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence quality appraisal checklist and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments guidelines. RESULTS: Sixty-three studies were included, describing 60 outcomes of PAS, 79 factors influencing PAS and 21 instruments measuring PAS. In general, positive PAS was related to positive outcomes for the patient, nurse and organisation, supporting the relevance of PAS as a staffing measure. We identified a variety of factors that influence PAS, including demand for care, nurse supply and organisation of care delivery. Associations between these factors and PAS were inconsistent. The quality of studies investigating the development and evaluation of instruments measuring PAS was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring the PAS may enhance nurse staffing methods in a hospital setting.

We examine these relationships in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the Trump administration sought to shift blame by scapegoating outgroups (by using the term \\"Chinese virus\\"), and framing performance information on COVID-19 testing in positive terms. Using a novel pre-registered survey experiment that incorporates open and close-ended items, we offer three main findings. First, there is clear evidence of motivated reasoning: conservatives rate the performance of the Trump administration more positively and are more apt to blame prominent Democrats, Chinese residents and the Chinese Government. Second, performance information framing was found to impact blame attribution among conservatives, but only for open-ended responses. Third, while exposure to the term \\"Chinese virus\\" increased blame assigned to Chinese residents among all participants, conservatives exposed to the term appeared to blame President Trump more, suggesting repeated use of divisive blame shifting strategies may alienate even supporters.","output":"Motivated Reasoning and Blame: Responses to Performance Framing and Outgroup Triggers during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emissions from coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) have a negative impact on the environment and metals are one of the categories of substances that have received considerable attention. In the present study, atmospheric zinc (Zn) emissions from eight CFPPs with different kinds of boilers and air pollution control devices (APCDs) in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, were investigated as well as the partitioning of this metal among boilers and APCDs. During the investigation of a CFPP, samples were taken of input and output materials during the same period. Our results give a Zn content of 32-165 mg kg-1 for feed coal, 52-237 mg kg-1 for bottom ash, 108-725 mg kg-1 for fly ash, 1.2-6.0 mg kg-1 for limestone, 1.6-7.3 mg kg-1 for gypsum, and 1.39-7.06 g Nm-3 for stack gas. Most of the zinc content in the feed coal goes with the flue gas after combustion and amounts to 94.2-96.1% and 60.5-78.1% for pulverized coal-fired boilers (PC) and circulating fluidized bed boilers (CFB), respectively. Based on input Zn, a larger share (80.8-96.4%) ends up the captured fly ash of PC boilers than the case of CFB boilers (66.1-73.6%). In turn, a minor portion is captured into the flue gas desulfurization gypsum, while we found a maximum of 0.05? is emitted into the atmosphere. The atmospheric emission factors (EMFs) of Zn for the eight CFPPs are 7.55-57.22 mg ton-1 coal, 4.17-22.75 g (kWh)-1, or 0.39-2.36 g TJ-1 using different benchmarks. Overall, the calculated emission factors here are distinctively low with the upgrading of APCDs in recent years. An estimation of 1276  1047 kg year-1 (range: 498-3777 kg year-1) of Zn is emitted into the atmosphere from the CFPPs of Guizhou Province in 2017 by coupling the EMFs obtained from this study and the coal consumption by this category of power plants.","output":"Partitioning behaviors of zinc in eight coal-fired power plants with different fueled coals and air pollution control devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) To merge Occupational Health (OH) and Human Resources (HR) administrative data to describe reasons for absenteeism among hospital employees and (2) to consider the advantages and disadvantages of using these combined data for surveillance of health care workers.

This is especially well-studied regarding the mite Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman (Parasitiformes: Varroidae), a parasite of honey bee brood and disease vector. Varroa was introduced relatively recently to Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and is a major driver of the catastrophic die-off of honey bee colonies in the last decade. In contrast, the original host species, Apis cerana Fabricius (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is able to survive mite infestations with little effect on colony health and survival. This resilience is due in part to a newly identified social immune response expressed by developing worker brood. Varroa infested female A. cerana brood experience delayed development and eventually die in a process called 'social apoptosis'. Here, an individual's susceptibility to Varroa results in colony level resistance. We tested for the presence of the social apoptosis trait in two Varroa resistant stocks of A. mellifera (Pol-line and Russian) with different selection histories and compared them to a known Varroa-susceptible stock (Italian). We assessed the survival and development of worker brood reared in either highly or lightly infested host colonies, then receiving one of three treatments: uninfested, experimentally inoculated with a Varroa mite, or wounded to simulate Varroa damage. We found that response to treatment was only differentiated in brood reared in lightly infested host colonies, where experimentally infested Russian honey bees had decreased survival relative to the mite-susceptible Italian stock.

During this research, we found that a large number of lawsuits against doctors and hospitals might have in fact been the unfortunate result of the constraints of implicit prioritization.

Little is known about how physician practice leaders view the program and its benefits and challenges. OBJECTIVE: To understand practice leaders perceptions of MIPS. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Interviews were conducted from December 12, 2019, to June 23, 2020, with leaders of 30 physician practices of various sizes and specialties across the USA. Practices were randomly selected using the Medical Group Management Associations membership database. Practices included small primary care and general surgery practices (1C9 physicians); medium primary care and general surgery practices (10C25 physicians); and large multispecialty practices (50 or more physicians). Participants were asked about their perceptions of MIPS measures; the programs effect on patient care; administrative burden; and rationale for participation. MAIN MEASURES: Major themes related to practice participation in MIPS. KEY RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 30 practices representing all US census regions. Six major themes emerged: (1) MIPS is understood as a continuation of previous value-based payment programs and a precursor to future programs; (2) measures are more relevant to primary care practices than other specialties; (3) leaders are conflicted on whether the program improves patient care; (4) MIPS creates a substantial administrative burden, exacerbated by annual programmatic changes; (5) incentives are small relative to the effort needed to participate; and (6) external support for participation can be helpful. Many participants indicated that their practice only participated in MIPS to avoid financial penalties; some reported that physicians cared for fewer patients due to the programs administrative burden. CONCLUSIONS: Practice leaders reported several challenges related to MIPS, including irrelevant measures, administrative burden, frequent programmatic changes, and small incentives. They held mixed views on whether the program improves patient care. These findings may be useful to policymakers hoping to improve MIPS.

The pioneer work conducted with the adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mouse provided irrefutable evidence that excess adenosine (ADO) accumulating in the lungs of asthmatic patients, constitutes a powerful mediator of disease severity. These original studies launched the development of murine strains for the two major ectonucleotidases responsible for the generation of airway ADO from ATP release: CD39 and CD73. The dramatic acute lung injury and chronic lung complications, manifested by these knockout mice in response to allergens and endotoxin, demonstrated the critical importance of regulating the availability of ATP and ADO for their receptors. Therapeutic targets are currently evaluated using knockout mice and agonists/antagonists for each ADO receptor (A(1)R, A(2A)R, A(2B)R, and A(3)R) and the predominant ATP receptors (P2Y(2)R and P2X(7)R).

We sought to explore and explain how this curricular change affects the future teaching commitment of year three GP clinical teachers. We adopted a realist approach. We firstly developed a candidate theory of how the new curriculum may affect future teaching commitment. Data collection and analysis then involved interviews of 10 GP teachers to refine this theory and produce a final Programme Theory. The results suggest that different teachers are affected in different ways, influenced by practice and individual contexts. Some parts of the new curriculum tend to reduce future teaching commitment, whereas other aspects tend to increase commitment. Mechanisms include changes to autonomy and sense of value. The results allow medical schools to better understand how GP teacher retention can be facilitated during curricular change. We make numerous recommendations, including advocating a team-based approach to teaching, paying attention to teacher autonomy, and considering patient contact in relation to generalist, primary care-orientated medicine as a core component of GP teaching.","output":"How does the introduction of a new year three GP curriculum affect future commitment to teach?

The present study was conducted with the purpose of evaluating the damages of UV-A and UV-C radiations in Allium cepa L. roots. The effects of two different types of UV on some physiological, biochemical, cytogenotoxic, and anatomical parameters were investigated in a multifaceted study. Three groups were formed from Allium bulbs, one of which was the control group. One of the other groups was exposed to 254 nm (UV-C) and the other to 365 nm (UV-A) UV. Growth retardation effect of UV was investigated with respect to germination percentage, total weight gain, and root elongation, while cytogenotoxicity arisen from UV exposure was analyzed using mitotic index (MI) and chromosomal aberration (CA) and micronucleus (MN) frequency. Oxidative stress due to UV application was investigated based on the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the total activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes. Also, anatomical changes induced by UV-A and UV-C were analyzed in root meristematic cells. UV treatments caused significant reductions in growth-related parameters. Both UV treatments caused a significant increase in MDA levels and induction of SOD and CAT enzymes in root meristematic cells. A decrease in MI and an increase in the frequency of MN and CAs were observed in root tip cells, indicating the cytogenotoxic effect of UV application. Anatomical damages such as epidermis cell damage, cortex cell damage, necrotic zones, giant cell nucleus, and indistinct transmission tissue occurred in cells exposed to UV. All of the physiological, biochemical, cytogenetic, and anatomical damages observed in this study were more severe in cells treated with UV-C compared to UV-A. This study suggested that UV exposure triggered growth inhibition, cytogenotoxicity, oxidative stress, and meristematic cell damages in A. cepa roots depending on the wavelength.","output":"Comparative investigation of toxicity induced by UV-A and UV-C radiation using Allium test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

The topics covered include Surveying and Geomatics, GPS and GNSS, Remote Sensing, LiDAR, UAV, 2D and 3D GIS, disaster management, flood modelling and many more. GGT2021 was supposedly held as GGT2020 on 21 C 24 September 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic last year, the conference was postponed to 2021. The Movement Control Order (MCO) issued by the Malaysian government had prohibited any gathering including for meetings, seminars and conferences. In addition, there are travel restrictions not only for international but also domestic travel. Travel between different states and districts in Malaysia is prohibited. Since, the conferences participants came from all over the world, even more than half of the local participants need to travel inter-state or inter-district to attend the conference, the organizer decided to change the conference to a virtual format. If the organizer decided to wait for the government decisions to lift those restrictions, it will be unclear when the conference can be held.

Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic data.

Results Of 127 COVID-19 patients, 16 cases (12.60%) were classified into the severe group. High level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reaction protein (CRP) and hypertension were independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19.

We investigated the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and subsequent infection in this population. Methods Prospective cohort study of infection in staff and residents in 100 LTCFs in England between October 2020 and February 2021. Blood samples were collected at baseline (June 2020), 2 and 4 months and tested for IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike protein. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken weekly in staff and monthly in residents. The primary analysis estimated the relative hazard of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, from Cox regression adjusted for age and gender, and stratified by LTCF. Findings Study inclusion criteria were met by 682 residents and 1429 staff. Baseline IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 residents (33%) and 408 staff (29%). A total of 93 antibody-negative residents had a PCR-positive test (0.054 per month at risk) compared to 4 antibody-positive residents (0.007 per month at risk). There were 111 PCR-positive tests in antibody-negative staff (0.042 per month at risk) compared to 10 in antibody-positive staff (0.009 per month at risk). The adjusted hazard ratios for reinfection in staff and residents with a baseline positive versus negative antibody test were 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.40) and 0.39 ((95% CI: 0.19-0.77) respectively. Of 12 reinfected participants with data on symptoms, 11 were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. Interpretation The presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

The clinical appearance and histopathology of avridine-induced arthritis show great similarity to other arthritis models such as collagen-induced arthritis. In LEW and DA rats the avridine-induced arthritis is severe and long lasting. To investigate a possible genetic influence on the disease we compared LEW, DA and E3 rats, which are of different genetic origins, for their ability to develop arthritis after injection of a low dose of avridine (1.5 mg/rat). The E3 rat was shown to be resistant, whereas all of the DA rats developed arthritis. Recombinant inbred strains derived from DA and E3 parentals varied in susceptibility to avridine. Only strains sharing RT1av1 with DA developed arthritis, indicating a role for the MHC genes. The MHC association was further analysed in a series of Lewis congenic strains using the 1.5 mg avridine dose. All strains developed arthritis. LEW.1C and LEW.1W developed only acute arthritis, whereas LEW.1A, LEW, LEW.1D, LEW.1N and LEW.1F developed chronic arthritis. In particular, the LEW.1F rats developed a chronic severe arthritis of high incidence. The chronic arthritis showed an active, erosive joint inflammation several months after induction. Nude rats are resistant to avridine-induced arthritis, indicating a T cell dependence of the disease which supports the importance of MHC. However, non-MHC genes are also crucial to arthritis development. Recombinants between DA and E3, sharing RT1av1 with DA, showed either a lower incidence or a lower severity of disease than the DA rats. The E3 rat and the recombinants with RT1u were completely resistant, whereas LEW.1W, also RT1u, were highly susceptible.","output":"Avridine-induced arthritis in rats; a T cell-dependent chronic disease influenced both by MHC genes and by non-MHC genes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Specific immunoglobulin G antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was detected in maternal blood, umbilical blood, and amniotic fluid from a pregnant SARS patient.

For this reason, in the literature, the data obtained from psychophysical tests are few and based on small case series. Methods: A multicenter, cohort study conducted in seven European hospitals between March 22 and August 20, 2020. The Sniffin-Sticks test and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center orthonasal olfaction test were used to objectively evaluate the olfactory function. Results: This study included 774 patients, of these 481 (62.1%) presented olfactory dysfunction (OD): 280 were hyposmic and 201 were anosmic. There was a significant difference between self-reported anosmia/hyposmia and psychophysical test results (p = 0.006). Patients with gastroesophageal disorders reported a significantly higher probability of presenting hyposmia (OR 1.86; p = 0.015) and anosmia (OR 2.425; p < 0.001). Fever, chest pain, and phlegm significantly increased the likelihood of having hyposmia but not anosmia or an olfactory disturbance. In contrast, patients with dyspnea, dysphonia, and severe-to-critical COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have no anosmia, while these symptoms had no effect on the risk of developing hyposmia or an OD. Conclusions: Psychophysical assessment represents a significantly more accurate assessment tool for olfactory function than patient self-reported clinical outcomes. Olfactory disturbances appear to be largely independent from the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients. The non-association with rhinitis symptoms and the high prevalence as a presenting symptom make olfactory disturbances an important symptom in the differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and common flu.","output":"Psychophysical Evaluation of the Olfactory Function: European Multicenter Study on 774 COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2019 in Indonesia, many parties must always be vigilant about the spread of this deadly virus, because many health workers and patients have died, and its development continues to increase positively.

The index is based on a Bayesian Poisson model with a random intercept in the linear predictor, allowing for extra-Poisson variation at neighbourhood and town/city scales. This permits within-city differences to be decoupled from broader regional trends in the disease. The research finds that members of ethnic minority groups tend to be living in areas with higher infection rates but also that the risk of exposure is distributed unevenly across these groups. Initially, in the first wave, the disease disproportionately affected Black residents. As the pandemic has progressed, especially the Pakistani but also the Bangladeshi and Indian groups have had the highest exposure. This higher exposure of the Pakistani group is not straightforwardly a function of neighbourhood deprivation because it is present across a range of average house prices.

DESIGN A total of 80 fine-needle aspirates from various sites and serous effusion samples were included. Of these cases, by random selection, 40 each were prepared by PT method and SA methods, respectively.

We evaluated 6 cases from each method by ICC for a range of membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear marker expression. DNA was extracted from four cases to evaluate their utility for molecular analysis. RESULTS CB sections from PT and SA techniques showed comparable cellularity and excellent cytomorphological preservation. Blue gel-like artefacts were common in the SA technique but did not interfere with morphological evaluation. ICC staining results were also similar.

However, the distribution and zoonotic potential of Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. in these animals remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 889 fecal specimens were collected in this study from farmed masked palm civets in Hainan, Guangdong, Jiangxi and Chongqing, southern China, and analyzed for these pathogens by nested PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Altogether, 474 (53.3%), 34 (3.8%) and 1 (0.1%) specimens were positive for E. bieneusi, G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium sp., respectively. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of 11 novel E. bieneusi genotypes named as PL1CPL11 and two known genotypes Peru8 and J, with PL1 and PL2 accounting for 90% of E. bieneusi infections. Phylogenetically, PL4, PL5, PL9, PL10 and PL11 were clustered into Group 1, while PL1, PL2, PL3, PL6, PL7 and PL8 were clustered into Group 2. Assemblage B (n = 33) and concurrence of B and D (n = 1) were identified among G. duodenalis-positive animals. Further multilocus genotyping of assemblage B has revealed that all 13 multilocus genotypes in civets formed a cluster related to those from humans. The Cryptosporidium isolate from one civet was identified to be genetically related to the Cryptosporidium bamboo rat genotype II.

The investigators rounded through the various departments that were included in the study and they accosted a sample of interns, residents and attending physicians, who were then asked to fill the questionnaire. Overall compliance of filling the questionnaire was 95%. Residents accounted for 72% of the filled questionnaires, seniors and interns accounted for 15 and 13% respectively. Second, a convenience sample of 300 electronic records of hospitalized patients (135 from the surgical wards, 129 from the Medical wards and 36 from the emergency room and General ICU) of actually carried out consultations was reviewed for validated indicators of quality for both the consultation request and response. We used a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from poor (1) to superb (5), to grade the measured parameters. RESULTS: The availability, timeliness and documentation rate for medical consultations were 4  0.9, 4.1  0.9 and 4.3  0.9 respectively, as compared with surgical consultations 3.2  1.1, 3.4  1.2 and 3.6  1.2 respectively (P < 0.001). The mean time (in hours) from the consultation request till documentation (of the requested consultation) by consultants in the medical and surgical departments was 3.9  5.9 and 10.0  15.6, respectively (P < 0.001). The quality of requests of consultations from the medical and surgical departments was 3.4  1.1 and 2.8  1.2, respectively (P < 0.001). Two different models of consultations are employed: while each medical department adopts several departments for medical consultations, each days on-call surgeon provides all the hospitals surgical consultations. CONCLUSION: We detected significant differences in key aspects of consultations provided by the departments. The medical model of consultations, in which each medical department adopts several other wards to which it provides consulting services upon request, should probably be adopted as a major policy decision by hospitals directors to enhance inter-departmental consultations.

Though a positive result is highly specific for the virus, the false negative rate of the test can vary from 20% to 100%. This can have implications including, but not limited to, delay in treatment, improper management, and more costly and invasive testing. We present a case of a 54 year old male who presented for hypoxic respiratory failure diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) after extensive workup including 5 negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests (NP RT-PCR). Case The patient is a 54 year old male with a past medical history significant for morbid obesity and well controlled asthma who presented for dyspnea on exertion. Throughout the patient's hospitalization, his oxygen requirements rapidly increased leading to a short course of ventilator support. CT angiogram of the chest on presentation did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism however did show bilateral multi-lobar ground glass opacities. The patient admitted to recently removing an old carpet at work but denied any other significant inhalational exposures. Dozens of his co-workers recently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Extensive workup including respiratory virus panel, 5 NP RT-PCR tests one week apart, basic rheumatologic serologies, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel were all unremarkable. Treatment for community acquired pneumonia was completed without improvement. Empiric treatment with steroids was started. BAL and trans-bronchial biopsies were initially unremarkable (Table 1). Repeat imaging demonstrated multiple sub-segmental pulmonary emboli. RT-PCR of the BAL specimen and serum antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were collected, both of which resulted positive. The patient was eventually discharged on oral anticoagulation, a short prednisone taper, and 2L oxygen via nasal cannula on exertion with scheduled outpatient follow-up. Conclusion NP RT-PCR has become the gold standard diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, but it does not come without imperfections. Timing of the test in relation to symptoms, assay limit of detection, and sample collection technique all affect the results. Our patient's clinical presentation, known recent exposure, and imaging findings increased his probability of having SARS-CoV-2. However, NP RT-PCR was negative on 5 separate occasions. Limitations of this test may therefore extend beyond our current understanding. After obtaining SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis from the BAL, this obviated the need for a thoracoscopic biopsy and treatment with prolonged steroids. BAL RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing consequently may play a necessary role in such patients with negative NP RT-PCR testing.","output":"COVID-19: The Great Masquerader"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The uncertainty related to prevention and treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 due to lack of effective vaccine candidates or drug molecules has resulted in extensive spread of infection and mortality worldwide.

Our results suggest that hippocampal volume may be a useful gatekeeper for identifying depressed individuals at risk for AD who would benefit from additional amyloid biomarkers when available.","output":"An optimized MRI and PET based clinical protocol for improving the differential diagnosis of geriatric depression and Alzheimer's disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertrophic scar formation and non-healing wounds following Achilles tendon repair arise from poor vascularity to the incisional site or from excess mechanical stress/strain to the incision during the healing process.

The optimal dosage of thromboprophylaxis is unknown. ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of tinzaparin in prophylactic, intermediate, and therapeutic doses in non-critical patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia. Design, setting, and participantsRandomized controlled, multicenter trial (PROTHROMCOVID) enrolling non-critical, hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. InterventionsPatients were randomized to prophylactic (4500 IU), intermediate (100 IU/kg), or therapeutic (175 IU/kg) doses of tinzaparin during hospitalization, followed by 7 days of prophylactic tinzaparin at discharge. MeasurementsThe primary efficacy outcome was a composite endpoint of symptomatic systemic thrombotic events, need for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or death within 30 days. The main safety outcome was major bleeding at 30 days. ResultsOf the 311 subjects randomized, 300 were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [14.6] years; males, 182 [60.7%]. The composite endpoint at 30 days from randomization occurred in 58 patients (19.3%) of the total population; 19 (17.1 %) in the prophylactic group, 20 (22.1%) in the intermediate group, and 19 (18.5%) in the therapeutic dose group (P= 0.72).

There are reports of the role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of MERS-CoV, however, the exact role is not known. METHOD: The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant papers published till August 2018 describing asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection. RESULTS: A total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review. The extent of asymptomatic MERS infection had increased with change in the policy of testing asymptomatic contacts. In early cases in April 2012COctober 2013, 12.5% were asymptomatic among 144 PCR laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases while in 2014 the proportion rose to 25.1% among 255 confirmed cases. The proportion of asymptomatic cases reported among pediatric confirmed MERS-CoV cases were higher (41.9%C81.8%). Overall, the detection rate of MERS infection among asymptomatic contacts was 1-3.9% in studies included in this review. Asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition compared to fatal cases. Of particular interest is that most of the identified pediatric cases were asymptomatic with no clear explanation. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of asymptomatic MERS cases were detected with increasing frequency as the disease progressed overtime.

ADHD is associated with an increased risk of seizures and, in this context, concerns have been expressed that stimulant drugs, including MPH, may increase the seizure risk. However, 4 large observational studies have found that ADHD drugs in general and stimulant drugs in particular are not associated with increased seizure risk and may, in fact, be associated with a reduced risk of seizures; these studies were largely conducted in children and adolescents, including those with epilepsy, with or without other brain comorbidities. The findings were obtained in both between-subjects and within-subjects analyses; the latter controlled for time-invariant inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds. These reassuring results support the results of many small, short-duration trials that found that MPH was not associated with increased seizure risk. One other observational study however found that MPH was indeed associated with an increased risk of seizures, but only during the first 30 days after drug initiation; there was no increase in risk in earlier or later time windows. There are many reasons why this single finding should be viewed with reservation; in any case, even if the finding is valid, the absolute risk of seizures with MPH appears to be very low. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that MPH may be safely used in children and adolescents, even those with a current or past history of epilepsy; however, prudence dictates that attention be paid to potential seizure triggers during the first month of treatment.

METHOD: In this cohort study, consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to four different Italian Institutions were enrolled. Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as in-hospital treatment and outcomes were evaluated. The primary outcome was mortality. RESULTS: A total of 844 COVID-19 patients were enrolled as study cohort, n = 65 (7.7%) taking OACs prior to hospitalization. Regarding clinical outcomes, OAC patients developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) more frequently than non-OAC patients as well as presenting a higher mortality rate (44.6% vs 19.8%, p < 0.001). At overall multivariate logistical regression, use of heparin (n = 394, 46.6%) was associated with a better chance of survival to hospital discharge (OR 0.60 [0.38-0.94], p < 0.001), in particular in patients with AHRF, with no association found with the use of OACs. In a sub-analysis, the highest mortality rate was found for AHRF patients when heparin was not administered. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, OACs appeared to be ineffective in reducing mortality rate, while heparin resulted to be a useful treatment when lung disease was sufficiently severe, potentially suggesting a crucial role of microthrombosis in severe COVID-19.

The current challenges of drug resistance in tuberculosis highlight an urgent need to develop newer anti-mycobacterial compounds. In the present study, we report the serendipitous discovery of a bacterial laboratory contaminant (LC-1) exhibiting a zone of growth inhibition on an agar plate seeded with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: We utilized microbiological, biochemical and biophysical approaches to characterize LC-1 and anti-mycobacterial compound(s) in its secretome. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing and BIOLOG analysis, LC-1 was identified as Staphylococcus hominis, a human bacterial commensal. Anti-mycobacterial activity was initially found in 30 kDa retentate that was obtained by ultrafiltration of culture filtrate (CF). SDS-PAGE analysis of peak fractions obtained by size exclusion chromatography of 30 kDa retentate confirmed the presence of high molecular weight ( 30 kDa) proteins. Peak fraction-1 (F-1) exhibited inhibitory activity against M. bovis BCG, but not against M. smegmatis, E. coli and S. aureus. The active fraction F-1 was inactivated by treatment with Proteinase K and -chymotrypsin. However, it retained its anti-mycobacterial activity over a wide range of heat and pH treatment. The anti-mycobacterial activity of F-1 was found to be maintained even after a long storage (~12 months) at ? 20 C. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the identified peptide masses do not match with any previously known bacteriocins. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the anti-mycobacterial activity of high molecular weight protein(s) present in culture filtrate of LC-1, which may be tested further to target M. tuberculosis.

In medicine, a definition or syndrome representing a constellation of symptomatology seen in association should stand the trial of time after it is coined. Health organisations should provide consistent definitions for index surveillance, epidemiological and prognostication studies.

From patient transcriptomic data, we determined a circulating miRNA, miR-2392, is directly involved with SARS-CoV-2 machinery during host infection. Specifically, we show that miR-2392 is key in driving downstream suppression of mitochondrial gene expression, increasing inflammation, glycolysis, and hypoxia as well as promoting many symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection. We demonstrate miR-2392 is present in the blood and urine of patients positive for COVID-19, but not present in patients negative for COVID-19. These findings indicate the potential for developing a minimally invasive COVID-19 detection method. Lastly, using in vitro human and in vivo hamster models, we design a miRNA-based antiviral therapeutic that targets miR-2392, significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 viability in hamsters and may potentially inhibit a COVID-19 disease state in humans.","output":"Role of miR-2392 in Driving SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients often contact the cystic fibrosis (CF) multidisciplinary team (MDT) via phone to express health-related concerns in between the standard quarterly review. This often requires a phone evaluation before organising an unscheduled appointment. These sporadic interactions heavily affect available resources. This strain on resources will be further impacted when considering that data from the European CF registry predicts that there will be a 75% increase in the adult CF population by 2025. Furthering this, CF services are increasingly more strained now during the global Covid-19 pandemic. Objective: This research first sets about to design and develop a Virtual Doctor system based on the expertise of a MDT through multiple consultations. Next, pilot data pertaining to user acceptance and experience with using this novel technology is gathered. We therefore aim to investigate if the use of such technology can be beneficial in a specific clinical setting. Method: The final collaborative-design of the Virtual Doctor comprises several technical features and is primarily a voice synthesis system allowing the patient to interact with natural language. The virtual doctor asks the patient questions regarding their health concerns and can collect real-time clinical metrics such as FEV1, oxygen saturation, temperature. The patients responses and metrics are then compared to baseline values calculating a score which stratifies a response time from the CF team. This information is then collated in a report and sent to the CF team for action. Future works: Initial stress testing of the technical performance is now complete. Supportive visual media to improve coaching of using clinical devices have now been implemented in preparation for patient pilot testing which is currently ongoing. It is anticipated that a virtual system such as the Virtual Doctor will become more accessible and acceptable to patients, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Virtual cystic fibrosis doctor: design, development, and user experience pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Super-spreading events in an outbreak can change the nature of an epidemic.

However, several questions remain unanswered regarding the prescription of steroids which led to differing opinions and practice. We surveyed practice patterns of critical care physicians in India for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Methods: This was a nationwide, cross-sectional, online, knowledge attitude practice-based survey, among intensivists for corticosteroid use in COVID-19. The survey questionnaire had seven questions for demographic data and 14 questions in the core survey. Results: 384 responses were analyzed from different parts of the country. A majority (81.2%) agreed that steroids improved oxygenation and survival chances. 88.3% agreed that steroids are indicated because of their anti-inflammatory properties, and should be prescribed in patients with moderate (75.8%), severe (59.9%), or critical (41.1%) COVID-19. 68.8% of physicians start steroids on the basis of \\"need for oxygen therapy\\" and hyperglycemia (85.2%) was the most commonly reported complication. 59.1% prefer prescribing methylprednisolone followed by Dexamethasone (38.8%). 51.8% preferred to use low dose steroids, and 59.1% have used \\"pulse steroids''. Rather than a fixed duration of therapy, 66.9% of the respondents rely on \\"clinical improvement\\" before stopping steroids, even if it meant continuing steroids for prolonged periods beyond 14 days (34.1%). 57.8% always taper steroids before stopping.

Symptoms range from mild flu-like symptoms to more severe presentations, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) approved the use of several vaccines. Because vaccines have been fast-tracked for emergency use, the short and long-term safety profile has been an area of concern. The aim of this paper is to extensively review published literature regarding post-COVID-19 vaccination neurological complications and characterize neuroimaging findings from three case presentations for early diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The analysis includes data from PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles included were retrieved from database inception beginning December 2020 with no language restrictions. Terms used include SARS-CoV-2, post Covid vaccination, neurological complications, Guillain-barre Syndrome, Transverse-myelitis, Cerebral Venous Sinus thrombosis, and Cerebral hemorrhage. Results: The literature review yielded several neurological complications post vaccination, including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis, transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barr Syndrome and optic neuritis, to name a few. Patient case presentation findings were consistent with documented results in published literature. Conclusions: We present a case series with a thorough literature review documenting adverse neurological affects following COVID-19 vaccination. Our case presentations and literature review highlight the importance of neuroimaging when diagnosing post-COVID-19 vaccination adverse effects.

The microbiological analysis, both culture dependent and independent, of the successfully operating bioreactors revealed a domination of obligately chemolithoautotrophic and extremely haloalkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Two subgroups were recognized among the isolates.

BACKGROUND: Following the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, a drop in blood donation has been observed. It is crucial to determine the actual number of potential SARS-CoV-2-positive donors to define the measures and ensure adequate blood supply. METHODS: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, calculated on the general population, was applied to the donor population by estimating the number of positive subjects. The calculation model was validated by the linear interpolation method. The number of blood units actually discarded based on post-donation information was also taken into account. RESULTS: Three months after the outbreak, 5322 donors were estimated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were therefore potentially excluded from donation. A total of units of blood components were discarded following post donation information. The estimated number of donors deceased (180) and the number of clinically recovered individuals in the same period was also considered. CONCLUSION: This forecasting model can be used to obtain information on blood donors' involvement during future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, especially in case of changes concerning epidemiology, incidence by age bracket and geographical distribution and also for new outbreaks of emerging viruses.","output":"A forecasting model to estimate the drop in blood supplies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With COVID-19 largely spread through communities, and the lack of a national strategy to manage the spread and impact of COVID-19 into communities in the United States (US), community well-being is at risk.

A vaccine for the COVID-19 could safeguard community well-being, but cannot be counted upon at this point. We believe it is imperative for communities to form and implement strategies to manage the spread and impacts of COVID-19 and that understanding the overall death rate and for young people (ages 15C35) as well at the length of the pandemic in important to planning.

It argues that despite serious administrative failures, especially in the State of Victoria, the measures implemented by Australian governments at a Commonwealth, State, Territory and local level have been remarkably successful in containing the virus and providing quality health care to those infected. The federal system has worked relatively well, enabling a nationally coordinated approach with localised variations in governmental response, especially at a State and Territory level, although the policy response has not always been well-adjusted to the needs and circumstances of smaller local communities, especially in rural and remote regions. The centrepiece of the intergovernmental response has been the formation of a 'National Cabinet' composed of the Australian Prime Minister, the State Premiers and the Territory Chief Ministers. The National Cabinet has been relatively sucessful in coordinating the Australian governmental response to the crisis.

Reported findings indicate that a direct viral-mediated hyperinflammatory response leads to local thromboinflammation. According to those findings, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-19 and PE should be low. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of DVT in patients with COVID-19 who developed PE. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, consecutive patients hospitalized in the internal medicine ward with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who developed PE were screened for DVT in the lower extremities with complete compression ultrasound. RESULTS: The study comprised 26 patients. Fifteen patients (57.7%) were male. The median age was 60 years (interquartile range, 54-73 years). Compression ultrasound findings were positive for DVT in 2 patients (7.7%; 95% confidence interval, 3.6%-11.7%). Patients with DVT had central and bilateral PE. In both, venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in the emergency department, so they did not receive previous prophylactic therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin.

However, it remains unknown how SARS-CoV-2 induces strong molecular signals in distant cells for immunopathogenesis. In this study, we examined the consequence of human endothelial cells, microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), and liver endothelial cells (TMNK-1) to exosomes isolated from plasma of mild or severe COVID-19 patients. We observed a significant induction of NLRP3, caspase-1, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) mRNA expression in endothelial cells following exposure to exosomes from severe COVID-19 patients compared with that from patients with mild disease or healthy donors. Activation of caspase-1 was noted in the endothelial cell culture medium following exposure to the COVID-19 exosomes. Furthermore, COVID-19 exosomes significantly induced mature IL-1 secretion in both HMEC-1 and TMNK-1 endothelial cell culture medium.

CD38-targeted monoclonal antibodies (MABs) such as daratumumab and isatuximab bind to CD38 and promote cancer cell death by stimulating the antitumor immune response. Although MABs are achieving unprecedented success in a percentage of cases, high rates of resistance limit their efficacy. Formation of the immunosuppressive intermediate adenosine is a major route by which this resistance is mediated. Thus there is an urgent need for small molecule agents that boost the immune response in T-cells. Importantly, CD38 is a dual-function enzyme, serving as a hydrolase and a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) cyclase, and both of these activities promote immunosuppression. We have employed virtual and physical screening to identify novel compounds that are selective for either the hydrolase or the cyclase activity of CD38, and have demonstrated that these compounds activate T cells in vitro. We are currently optimizing these inhibitors for use in immunotherapy. These small molecule inhibitors of the CD38-hydrolase or cyclase activity can serve as chemical probes to determine the mechanism by which CD38 promotes resistance to MAB therapy, and could become novel and effective therapeutic agents that produce immunostimulatory effects. Our studies have identified the first small molecule inhibitors of CD38 specifically for use as immunostimulants.","output":"Selective targeting of CD38 hydrolase and cyclase activity as an approach to immunostimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the utility of robotic repair of injuries to the ureter or bladder from obstetrical and gynaecological (OBGYN) surgery PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective review of all patients from four different high-volume institutions between 2002 and 2013 that had a robot-assisted (RA) repair by a urologist after an OBGYN genitourinary injury. RESULTS Of the 43 OBGYN operations, 34 were hysterectomies: 10 open, 10 RA, nine vaginally, and five pure laparoscopic. Nine patients had alternative OBGYN operations: three caesarean sections, three oophorectomies (one open, two laparoscopic), one RA colpopexy, one open pelvic cervical cerclage with mesh and one RA removal of an invasive endometrioma. In all, 49 genitourinary (GU) injuries were sustained: ureteric ligation (26), ureterovaginal fistula (10), ureterocutaneous fistula (one), vesicovaginal fistula (VVF; 10) and cystotomy alone (two). In all, 10 patients (23.3%) underwent immediate urological repair at the time of their OBGYN RA surgery. The mean (range) time between OBGYN injury and definitive delayed repair was 23.5 (1-297) months. Four patients had undergone prior failed repair: two open VVF repairs and two balloon ureteric dilatations with stent placement. In all, 22 ureteric re-implants (11 with ipsilateral psoas hitch) and 15 uretero-ureterostomies were performed. Stents were placed in all ureteric cases for a mean (range) of 32 (1-63) days. In all, 10 VVF repairs and two primary cystotomy closures were performed. Drains were placed in 28 cases (57.1%) for a mean (range) of 4.1 (1-26) days. No case required open conversion. Two patients (4.1%) developed ureteric obstruction after RA repair requiring dilatation and stenting. The mean (range) follow-up of the entire cohort was 16.6 (1-63) months. CONCLUSIONS RA repair of GU injuries during OBGYN surgery is associated with good outcomes, appears safe and feasible, and can be used successfully immediately after injury recognition or as a salvage procedure after prior attempted repair.

The uncontrolled activation of monocytes and the subsequent excessive production of inflammatory factors damage bone-cartilage joints in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), a childhood rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease. Inflammatory monocytes also exert a critical role in the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV2 infection in severe COVID-19 patients. The moderate beneficial effect of current therapies and clinical trials highlights the need of alternative strategies targeting monocytes to treat RA and COVID-19 pathologies. Here, we show that targeting CXCR4 with small amino compound such as the histamine analogue clobenpropit (CB) inhibits spontaneous and induced-production of a set of key inflammatory cytokines by monocytes isolated from blood and synovial fluids of JIA patients. Moreover, daily intraperitoneal CB treatment of arthritic mice results in significant decrease in circulating inflammatory cytokine levels, immune cell infiltrates, joints erosion, and bone resorption leading to reduction of disease progression. Finally, we provide the prime evidence that the exposure of whole blood from hospitalized COVID-19 patients to CB significantly reduces levels of key cytokine-storm-associated factors including TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1.

There is a need for more effective intervention approaches to help young adolescents safely navigate through adolescence and into adulthood. We are assessing the efficacy of Tumaini, a smartphone game designed to prevent HIV among young Africans. Against the background of COVID-19, meaningful alteration of the research protocol was necessary to ensure successful implementation and retention of the study participants in ongoing research. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our protocol is to determine (1) if Tumaini delays sexual debut and increases condom use at first sex and (2) whether it influences behavioral mediators of early and unprotected sex. METHODS: Participants were recruited from Kisumu County in Western Kenya. This study is a 2-arm, individual-randomized controlled trial that enrolled 1004 adolescents aged between 12 years and 15 years. The intervention arm participants are playing Tumaini, while the control arm is provided with Brainilis, a commercially available control game. The study period will last 45 months. At baseline, participants in both arms completed a baseline survey and biological testing for HIV and herpes simplex virus, type 2 (HSV-2); participants will have annual game play periods in years 1-3. They will also complete a total of 12 follow-up surveys. At endline, repeat biological testing will be conducted. Protocol adaptations were necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and implemented in accordance with local public health guidelines. RESULTS: Participants were enrolled between October 2020 and November 2020. We plan to complete study procedures in September 2024. The enrolled participant sample was 50.1% (499/996) female and had a mean age of 14.0 (SD 0.6) years. CONCLUSIONS: This ongoing research demonstrates that, with appropriate revisions to planned protocol activities guided by the need to maintain study integrity, protect both study participants and staff, and adhere to institutional review board and local health authority guidelines, human subject research is possible in the context of a global pandemic. If the trial demonstrates efficacy, Tumaini would provide an alternative, remote means of delivering age-appropriate education to adolescents on safer sex, HIV prevention, and effective life skills on a highly scalable, low-cost, and culturally adaptable platform.

Interventions: Oocytes (GV, MII) and embryos (1 cell (1C); blastocyst (BL)) were donated to research at disposition by IVF patients. Follicular cells (cumulus (CC); granulosa (GC)) were collected from women undergoing egg retrieval after ovarian stimulation without an ovulatory trigger for IVM/IVF treatment cycles. Main Outcome Measures: The presence or absence of ACE2, CD147, TMPRSS2, and CTSL mRNA using RT-qPCR and protein using capillary Western blotting in human oocytes, embryos and ovarian follicular cells. Result s: RT- q-PCR analysis revealed high abundance of ACE2 gene transcripts in GV and MII oocytes compared to CC, GC, and BL. ACE2 protein was only present in MII oocytes, 1C, and BL embryos, but other ACE2 protein variants were observed in all the samples. TMPRSS2 protein was present in all samples while mRNA was observed only at the blastocyst stage. All the samples were positive for CD147 and CTSL mRNA expression. However, cumulus and granulosa cells were the only samples that showed co-expression of both CD147 and CTSL proteins in low abundance. Conclusions: Cumulus and granulosa cells are least susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of required receptors and proteases combination (ACE2/TMPRSS2 or CD147/CTSL) in high abundance.

Clinical data on patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are still scarce. METHODS This multicentre cohort study evaluated risk factors for morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLWH), infected with SARS-CoV-2 in three countries in different clinical settings. COVID-19 was clinically classified as to be mild-to-moderate or severe. RESULTS Of 175 patients, 49 (28%) had severe COVID-19 and 7 (4%) patients died. Almost all patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and in 94%, HIV RNA was below 50 copies/mL prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. In the univariate analysis, an age 50 years or older, a CD4+ T cell nadir of < 200/l, current CD4+ T cells < 350/l and the presence of at least one comorbidity were significantly associated with severity of COVID-19. No significant association was found for gender, ethnicity, obesity, a detectable HIV RNA, a prior AIDS-defining illness, or tenofovir (which was mainly given as alafenamide) or protease inhibitor use in the current ART. In a multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with risk for severe COVID-19 was a current CD4+ T cell count of < 350/l (adjusted odds ratio 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.26-6.44, p=0.01). The only factor associated with mortality was a low CD4 T cell nadir.

Upon the validation of our computational approach, we then surveyed potential hot spot residues in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence of COVOX-222 and S2H97 antibodies. We identified many single sites in the antigen-antibody interface that are similarly prone to potential antibody escape and that match many of the known sites of mutations arising in the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

The longitudinal association between different social engagement and physical frailty among older people has not been explored adequately in China. Marital status forms a critical context for the link between social engagement and frailty among older people, which might constitute a moderating process. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the longitudinal association between social engagement and the changes in physical frailty among Chinese older adults, and to examine whether the association between social engagement and frailty differs by marital status. METHODS: The data use in this study were from the data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study aged 60+ years from 2011 to 2015. A total of 6575 respondents who participated in at least one follow-up wave were included in the analysis. The relationship between social engagement and changes in frailty over time, and the moderating role of marital status were estimated using individual fixed-effects models. Sensitive analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: After adjusting the confounders, participants who interact with friends (Coef: -1.309, P < 0.001), engaging in hobby groups (Coef: -1.189, P < 0.001), engaging in sports groups (Coef: -0.945, P = 0.001), and volunteering (Coef: -1.957, P = 0.001) with a frequency of almost daily had a significantly lower frailty risk than participants who never engaging in those activities. The association between frequent engaging in hobby groups and physical frailty was strongest for unmarried than married older adults (Coef: -1.325, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Frequent social engagement might help to decrease the risk of frailty in the Chinese older population. This finding has important implications for public health policy and encourages the incorporation of a broad range of social engagement into the daily lives of older individuals. Specially, encouraging unmarried older adults to engage in intellectual activities, such as playing chess or Mahjong with others, may be an effective way to reduce physical frailty.

Currently applied diagnostic techniques depend on a timely laboratory report following PCR testing. However, the application of these tests is associated with inherent shortcomings due to the need for trained personnel, long-time centralized laboratories, and expensive instruments. Therefore, there is an interest in developing biosensing diagnostic frontiers that can help in eliminating these shortcomings with a relatively economical, easy-to-use, well-timed, precise and sensitive technology. This study reports the development of fabricated Q-tips designed to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples and contaminated non-absorbable surfaces. This colorimetric sensor is engineered to sandwich SARS-CoV-2 spike protein between the lactoferrin general capturing agent and the complementary ACE2-labeled receptor. The ACE2 receptor is decorated with an orange-colored polymeric nanoparticle to generate an optical visual signal upon pairing with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This colorimetric change of the Q-tip testing zone from white to orange confirms a positive result. The visual detection limit of the COVID-19 engineered colorimetric Q-tip sensor was 100 pfu/mL within a relatively short turnaround time of 5 min. The linear working range of quantitation was 10(3)C10(8) pfu/mL. The engineered sensor selectively targeted SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and did not bind to another coronavirus such as MERS-CoV, Flu A, or Flu B present on the contaminated surface. This novel detection tool is relatively cheap to produce and suitable for onsite detection of COVID-19 infection.","output":"A Portable Nanoprobe for Rapid and Sensitive Detection of SARS-CoV-2 S1 Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There have been few reports on children who developed common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in association with immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG2 deficiencies and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: Our patient experienced nephrotic syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1 virus infection at 5 years of age. A diagnosis of IgA and IgG2 deficiency and SLE was made on the basis of severe proteinuria, hematuria, hypocomplementemia, high anti-DNA antibody and antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, and malar rash. However, these clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory features disappeared after the administration of methylprednisolone pulse therapy and prednisolone. For the 5 years following the initial treatment for SLE, the patient experienced a number of infections and had a low serum total IgG level; she was eventually diagnosed with CVID. The administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was required to prevent subsequent infections, and no relapse of SLE was observed. CONCLUSION: We report the development of CVID in an IgA- and IgG2-deficient patient with SLE on the basis of multiple episodes of infection. To prevent the development of CVID in IgA- and IgG2-deficient patients with SLE, it is important to prevent immune dysregulation by the avoidance of infections through the use of IVIG therapy.","output":"Development of common variable immunodeficiency in IgA- and IgG2-deficient patients with systemic lupus erythematosus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Algal biofuels are a promising alternative to fossil fuels, but their widespread use is hindered by problems with mass production. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with specific light wavelengths could be used as an energy source for algal growth and lipid synthesis. In this study, the effects of light source on the biomass and lipid production of the aerial microalga Coccomyxa sp. KGU-D001 were evaluated using LEDs. The integration of two-phase cultures, including growth and lipid production under the stress of nitrate depletion, was assessed for efficient lipid production under liquid- or aerial-phase conditions. Different wavelengths of light (blue, green, and red) were tested under liquid- and aerial-phase conditions. Under aerial-phase culture, the fatty acid contents in biofilm reached 320 mg g DWC-1 with the red LEDs. In view of these findings, we describe a one-step culture method for growth and lipid accumulation in algal biofilm under aerial-phase culture with red LED irradiation. When Coccomyxa biofilm was cultured on wet cotton wool with BBM in a petri dish under the red LED, it was able to grow and accumulate lipids under the aerial-phase condition. Based on the results of this study, a potential method for a continuous biodiesel production system is proposed.","output":"Effects of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on lipid production of the aerial microalga Coccomyxa sp.

The assembly of NSP7, NSP8 and NSP12 proteins is highly dynamic in solution, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We report the crystal structure of the complex between NSP7 and NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2, revealing a 2:2 heterotetrameric form. Formation of the NSP7-NSP8 complex is mediated by two distinct oligomer interfaces, with interface I responsible for heterodimeric NSP7-NSP8 assembly, and interface II mediating the heterotetrameric interaction between the two NSP7-NSP8 dimers. Structure-guided mutagenesis, combined with biochemical and enzymatic assays, further reveals a structural coupling between the two oligomer interfaces, as well as the importance of these interfaces for the RdRP activity of the NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complex. Finally, we identify an NSP7 mutation that differentially affects the stability of the NSP7-NSP8 and NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complexes leading to a selective impairment of the RdRP activity. Together, this study provides deep insights into the structure and mechanism for the dynamic assembly of NSP7 and NSP8 in regulating the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with important implications for antiviral drug development.","output":"Two conserved oligomer interfaces of NSP7 and NSP8 underpin the dynamic assembly of SARS-CoV-2 RdRP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Aim. To estimate the fraction of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 attributable to chronic diseases due to poor nutrition and smoking in Mexico. Methods. We used data from the Mexican surveillance system of COVID-19. We considered six chronic diseases (obesity, COPD, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease) to define a multimorbidity variable: no diseases, 1 disease, 2 diseases, or 3 or more diseases. We calibrated the database using bias quantification methods to consider the undiagnosed cases of chronic diseases. To estimate the risks of hospitalization and death due to chronic diseases, we fitted Poisson regression models with robust standard errors, adjusting for possible confounders. Using these risks, we calculated attributable fractions using the population attributable fraction (PAF). Results. Chronic diseases accounted for to 25.4% (24.8%, 26.1%), 28.3% (27.8%, 28.7%) and 15.3% (14.9%,15.7%) of the hospitalizations among adults below 40 years, 40 to 59, and 60 years and older respectively (95% CI).

Demographic, knowledge and attitudes toward added sugar, dietary intake, and anthropometric data (i.e., height, weight, and waist circumference) were collected during face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: Approximately half of the students (n = 106; 55.8%) were aware of the health consequences of excessive intake of added sugar, but only 32.6% (n = 62) reported making an effort to reduce their added sugar intake. The data indicated that 8.42% of the students (n = 16) consumed carbonated soft drinks daily, 15.8% (n = 30) consumed fruit drinks daily, and 45.8% (n = 87) consumed sweets daily.

Given the high volume of metagenome sequences, there is a need for scalable frameworks to analyze and segment metagenome sequences from clinical samples, which can be highly imbalanced. There is an increased need for learning robust representations from metagenome reads since pathogens within a family can have highly similar genome structures (some more than 90%) and hence enable the segmentation and identification of novel pathogen sequences with limited labeled data. In this work, we propose Metagenome2Vec - a contextualized representation that captures the global structural properties inherent in metagenome data and local contextualized properties through self-supervised representation learning. We show that the learned representations can help detect six (6) related pathogens from clinical samples with less than 100 labeled sequences.

To infect enterocytes, both S glycoproteins and the viral envelope must resist degradation by proteases, low and high pH, and bile salts. One specific site on the S glycoprotein of bovine coronavirus must be cleaved by an intracellular protease or trypsin to activate viral infectivity and cell fusion. S glycoprotein binds to specific receptors on the apical membranes of enterocytes, and can undergo a temperature-dependent, receptor-mediated conformational change that leads to fusion of the viral envelope with host membranes to initiate infection.

DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. A geriatric hospital-based team acted as a consultant and coordinated the care of older people living in NHs from the hospital. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 630 patients aged 70 and older with Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19 living in 55 NHs. METHODS: A logistic regression was performed to analyze the factors associated with mortality. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves were applied according to mortality and its associated factors using the log-rank Mantel-Cox test. RESULTS: The diagnosis of COVID-19 was mainly made by clinical compatibility (N = 430). Median age was 87 years, 64.6% were women and 45.9% were transferred to be cared for at the hospital. A total of 282 patients died (44.7%) within the 30 days of first attention by the team. A severe form of COVID-19 occurred in 473 patients, and the most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (n = 332) and altered level of consciousness (n = 301). According to multiple logistic regression, male sex (P = .019), the Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) &#8805;6 (P = .004), dementia (P = .012), dyspnea (P < .001), and having a severe form of COVID-19 (P = .001), were associated with mortality, whereas age and care setting were not. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mortality of the residents living in NHs with COVID-19 was almost 45%. The altered level of consciousness as an atypical presentation of COVID-19 should be considered in this population. A severe form of the disease, present in more than three-quarters of patients, was associated with mortality, apart from the male sex, CFS &#8805;6, dementia, and dyspnea, whereas age and care setting were not. These findings may also help to recognize patients in which the Advance Care Planning process is especially urgent to assist in the decisions about their care.","output":"Clinical Characteristics, Frailty, and Mortality of Residents With COVID-19 in Nursing Homes of a Region of Madrid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, SARS, and MERS are featured by fibrinolytic dysfunction. To test the role of the fibrinolytic niche in the regeneration of alveolar epithelium, we compared the self-renewing capacity of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells and its differentiation to AT1 cells between wild type (wt) and fibrinolytic niche deficient mice (Plau?/? and Serpine1Tg). A significant reduction in both proliferation and differentiation of deficient AT2 cells was observed in vivo and in 3D organoid cultures. This decrease was mainly restored by uPA derived A6 peptide, a binding fragment to CD44 receptors. The proliferative and differential rate of CD44+ AT2 cells was greater than that of CD44? controls. There was a reduction in transepithelial ion transport in deficient monolayers compared to wt cells. Moreover, we found a marked suppression in total AT2 cells and CD44+ subpopulation in lungs from brain dead patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a mouse model infected by influenza viruses. Thus, we demonstrate that the fibrinolytic niche can regulate AT2-mediated homeostasis and regeneration via a novel uPA-A6-CD44+-ENaC cascade.","output":"Fibrinolytic niche is requested for alveolar type 2 cell-mediated alveologenesis and injury repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes and hyperglycemia are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID19 Subspecialty consultative resources to help front-line clinicians treat these conditions is often limited We implemented a Virtual Hyperglycemia Surveillance Service (VHSS) to guide glucose management in COVID19 patients admitted to our 1541-bed academic medical center","output":"A Single Virtual Consult Reduces Severe Hyperglycemia in Patients Admitted with COVID19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, we explored the individual and relational well-being of people confined together with their partners and/or children during the first 3 weeks of state-regulated lockdown.

However, the information on death cases and predictive methods are substantial lacking. We aimed to develop a nomogram, which was validated by both internal and external cohorts, for early predicting mortality in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on 1,540 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from two hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with in-hospital mortality. We investigated the mortality related risk factors and their weights, thereafter designed and validated a predictive nomogram model to facilitate early discrimination of in-hospital death. We assessed the nomogram performance by examining calibration (calibration plots and HosmerCLemeshow calibration test) and discrimination (AUROC). We also plotted survival curves and decision curves to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. Results: In the 1,540 patients from two centers, 248 cases died (16.1%). In the predictive nomogram calculated by a multivariate logistic regression analysis, eight independent risk factors associated mortality included age  60 years (odd ratio(OR) = 2.840;95%CI, 1.467C5.495;P = 0.002), respiratory rate  30 breaths per minute (OR = 3.308;95%CI, 1.408C7.770;P = 0.006), neutrophil count  7  10 9 /L (OR = 3.084;95%CI, 1.667C5.707;P < 0.001), lymphocyte count  0.8  10 9 / L (OR = 4.688;95%CI, 2.500-8.791;P < 0.001), d-dimer  1.5 g/mL(OR = 2.159;95%CI, 1.169C3.989;P = 0.014), lactate dehydrogenase  350U/L(OR = 4.385;95%CI, 2.299C8.362;P < 0.001), procalcitonin  0.1 ng/mL(OR = 4.972;95%CI, 2.537C9.746;P < 0.001), and presence of myocardial injury (OR = 2.289;95%CI, 1.260C4.160;P = 0.007) on admission. Calibration curves showed good fitting of the nomogram model with no statistical significance ( P = 0.740) by Hosmer-Lemeshow test. This predictive nomogram had better predictive ability than CURB-65 score in training set (AUROC = 0.956 vs 0.828, P < 0.001). The good predictive performance of the nomogram is suggested by calibration, discrimination, and survival curve analysis, whether in the training, internal or external validation set. The decision curve analysis showed that predicting mortality risk applying this nomogram would be better than having all patients or none patients. Conclusions: This nomogram is a reliable prognostic method that can accurately and early predict in-hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. It can guide clinicians to improve their abilities to evaluate patient prognosis, enhance patient stratification, make earlier and reasonable decisions.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for fast detection and clear visualization of infection is required. In the recent technological advancements, the fusion of deep learning classifiers and medical images provides more promising results corresponding to traditional RT-PCR testing while making detection and predictions about COVID-19 cases with increased accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed a deep transfer learning algorithm that accelerates the detection of COVID-19 cases by using X-ray and CT-Scan images of the chest. It is because, in COVID-19, initial screening of chest X-ray (CXR) may provide significant information in the detection of suspected COVID-19 cases. We have considered three datasets known as 1) COVID-chest X-ray, 2) SARS-COV-2 CT-scan, and 3) Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). In the obtained results, the proposed deep learning model can detect the COVID-19 positive cases in  2 seconds which is faster than RT-PCR tests currently being used for detection of COVID-19 cases. We have also established a relationship between COVID-19 patients along with the Pneumonia patients which explores the pattern between Pneumonia and COVID-19 radiology images.

The CDC, China, managed to track the source of infection to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2) that shares approximately 79.6% of its genome with SARS-CoV. The World Health Organization (WHO) initially declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and later characterized it as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Due to the novel nature of this virus, there is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19. Global efforts are underway to circumvent its further spread and treat COVID-19 patients through experimental vaccine formulations and therapeutic interventions, respectively. In the absence of any effective therapeutics, we have devised h bioinformatics-based approaches to accelerate global efforts in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 and to assist researchers in the initial phase of vaccine and therapeutics development. In this study, we have performed comprehensive meta-analyses and developed an integrative resource, CoronaVR (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/coronavr/). Predominantly, we identified potential epitope-based vaccine candidates, siRNA-based therapeutic regimens, and diagnostic primers. The resource is categorized into the main sections Genomes, Epitopes, Therapeutics, and Primers. The genome section harbors different components, viz, genomes, a genome browser, phylogenetic analysis, codon usage, glycosylation sites, and structural analysis. Under the umbrella of epitopes, sub-divisions, namely cross-protective epitopes, B-cell (linear/discontinuous), T-cell (CD4 +/CD8 +), CTL, and MHC binders, are presented. The therapeutics section has different sub-sections like siRNA, miRNAs, and sgRNAs. Further, experimentally confirmed and designed diagnostic primers are earmarked in the primers section. Our study provided a set of shortlisted B-cell and T-cell (CD4 +and CD8 +) epitopes that can be experimentally tested for their incorporation in vaccine formulations. The list of selected primers can be used in testing kits to identify SARS-CoV-2, while the recommended siRNAs, sgRNAs, and miRNAs can be used in therapeutic regimens.

Reports from earlier in the pandemic suggested that patients hospitalized for COVID19 are at particularly high risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). To estimate the incidences of PE during hospitalization for COVID19, we performed a rigorous systematic review of published literature. METHODS: We searched for case series, cohort studies and clinical trials from December 1, 2019 to July 13, 2020 that reported the incidence of PE among consecutive patients who were hospitalized for COVID19 in ICUs and in non-ICU hospital wards. To reflect the general population of hospitalized COVID19 patients, we excluded studies in which subject enrollment was linked to the clinical suspicion for venous thromboembolism (VTE). RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies were included in the analysis. The combined random effects estimate of PE incidence among all hospitalized COVID19 patients was 7.1% (95% CI: 5.2%, 9.1%). Studies with larger sample sizes reported significantly lower PE incidences than smaller studies (r(2) = 0.161, p = 0.036). The PE incidence among studies that included 400 or more patients was 3.0% (95% CI: 1.7%, 4.6%). Among COVID19 patients admitted to ICUs, the combined estimated PE incidence was 13.7% (95% CI: 8.0%, 20.6%). The incidence of ICU-related PE also decreased as the study sample sizes increased. The single largest COVID19 ICU study (n = 2215) disclosed a PE incidence of 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7%, 3.0%).

The symptoms can be nonspecific; therefore, it can be difficult to identify and treat the cause. However, an understanding of the specific immune defect, clinical parameters such as speed of onset, and radiological findings, allows the logical diagnostic and treatment plan to be made. Radiological findings can include consolidation, nodules, and diffuse changes such as ground glass and tree-in-bud changes. Common infections that induce these symptoms include bacterial pneumonia, invasive fungal disease, Pneumocystis jirovecii and respiratory viruses. These infections must be differentiated from inflammatory complications that often require immune suppressive treatment. The diagnosis can be refined with the aid of investigations such as bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT) guided lung biopsy, culture, and serological tests.

Likewise, institutions with internal funding were 3.88 times more likely to establish COVID-19 dedicated research (95% CI = 1.12C13.40;P &lt; 0.05). CTSAs were instrumental in securing funds and facilitating establishment of laboratory/clinical spaces for COVID-19 research. Workflow was modified to support contracting and IRB review at most institutions with CTSAs. To mitigate chaos generated by competing clinical trials, central feasibility committees were often formed for orderly review/prioritization.Conclusions:The lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic emphasize the pivotal role of CTSAs in prioritizing studies and establishing the necessary research infrastructure, and the importance of prompt and flexible research leadership with decision-making capacity to manage future pandemics.","output":"Prioritizing studies of COVID-19 and lessons learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indonesia, as the world does, is currently facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Due to the interrupted competition schedule and potentially decreased motivation, Paralympic athletes may be at risk for a highly disrupted training schedule, impacting their ability to prepare for the 2021 Games. OBJECTIVE Our purpose was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the training, diet, and fitness of Paralympic cyclists and triathletes. METHODS Twenty-four paracyclists and one paratriathlete (15 females and 10 males; age 37.6  9.3 years) completed two incremental exercise tests to assess sport-specific fitness and reported their training volume and intensity for a specified week prior to the pandemic (February) and again in March, April, and May (during pandemic). Participants also reported their dietary intake and sedentary screen time prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS The amount of time spent engaging in sedentary screen time increased from 4.5 to 6.1 h (p < .001). No effect of the pandemic was found for training volume (14.2 vs 12.5 h; p = .18), intensity (678 vs 650; p = .36), or dietary intake (p > .05). While fitness test duration was nominally increased for the second test (27.3 vs 27.9 min; p = .02), no difference was seen in fitness (average power output: 201 W vs 204 W; p = .5).

To elucidate the precise mechanism of leader-priming, we cloned and sequenced the 5-end of the mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. The 5-terminal sequences are identical to the leader sequences present at the 5-end of the subgenomic mRNAs. Two possible hairpin loop structures and an AU-rich region around the 3-end of the leader sequence may provide the termination site for leader RNA synthesis. The comparison of 5-end genomic sequences and the intergenic start sites for mRNA transcription revealed that there are homologous regions of 7C18 nucleotides at the putative leader/body junction sites. Some intergenic regions contain a mismatching nucleotide within this homologous region. We propose that free leader RNA binds to the intergenic region due to this homology and is cleaved at the mismatching nucleotide before serving as a primer. Thus, the free leader RNA species may be longer than the leader sequences in the subgenomic mRNAs and different mRNAs may have different leader/body junction sites.","output":"The 5-end sequence of the murine coronavirus genome: Implications for multiple fusion sites in leader-primed transcription"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the unsteady squeezing flow between circular parallel plates (USF-CPP) is investigated through the intelligent computing paradigm of LevenbergCMarquard backpropagation neural networks (LMBNN).

With recent post hoc analyses of large trials questioning the safety and efficacy of APAs in CKD, major gaps exist in our understanding of platelet aggregability and the effects of APAs on thrombosis and bleeding in CKD. Clinical practice guidelines are ambiguous about use of such agents in CKD patients, because patients with moderate to advanced CKD were systematically excluded from clinical trials of APAs. CKD patients experience excessive rates of cardiovascular thrombotic events, yet paradoxically are at higher risk for major bleeding while receiving APAs. Furthermore, observational studies suggest that CKD patients may exhibit poor response to APAs. High residual platelet aggregability, as determined by inhibition of platelet aggregation, is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. In addition, metabolism of certain APAs may be altered in CKD patients. It is, therefore, imperative to explore the mechanisms responsible for poor response to APAs in CKD patients in order to use these drugs more safely and effectively.

In this paper, we argue that such accounts are misguided. AI applications exist in a rich regulatory landscape, subject to multiple rules. To demonstrate our claim, we conduct two semi-fictional case studies under Finnish law. In the first case study, we chart the rules that currently would govern and impact AI tool use in recruitment. In the second case study, we map the legal framework for the Finnish COVID-19 contact tracing app. The article makes three contributions to the literature. First, the case studies provide ample evidence that the prevailing orthodoxy misstates the state of AI law. There is AI law on the books and existing laws have a profound impact on AI application design. Second, the mappings provide building material for developing a grounded theory framework for categorizing AI law and its types and modalities, allowing us to formulate a heuristic for understanding AI regulation. We argue that developers and AI application stakeholders should construe AI law as a complex stratigraphy consisting of five layers: data rules that regulate data use, application-specific AI rules that target specific AI applications or application domains, general AI rules that apply to a wide range of AI applications, application-specific non-AI rules that apply to specific activities but not to AI specifically and general non-AI rules that apply generically and across domains. Third, we provide guidance for practitioners for structuring AI compliance processes. We argue that practitioners should keep in mind that the rules and standards differ in their scopes, targets, certainty, and regulatory modalities. Consequently, understanding the AI regulatory landscape requires developing an understanding of multiple rule complexes, their dynamics, and regulatory modalities.

In response, the reconfiguration of health systems to encourage greater collaboration and integration has been promoted with a variety of collaborative shapes and forms being encouraged and developed. Despite this continued interest, evidence for success of these various arrangements is lacking, with the links between collaboration and improved performance often remaining uncertain. To date, many examinations of collaborations have been undertaken, but use of realist methodology may shed additional light on how and why collaboration works, and whom it benefits. METHODS: This paper seeks to test initial context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs) of interorganisational collaboration with the view to producing a refined realist theory. This phase of the realist synthesis used case study and evaluation literature; combined with supplementary systematic searches. These searches were screened for rigour and relevance, after which CMOCs were extracted from included literature and compared against existing ones for refinement, refutation, or affirmation. We also identified demi-regularities to better explain how these CMOCs were interlinked. RESULTS: Fifty-one papers were included, from which 338 CMOCs were identified, where many were analogous. This resulted in new mechanisms such as risk threshold and refinement of many others, including trust, confidence, and faith, into more well-defined constructs. Refinement and addition of CMOCs enabled the creation of a web of causality depicting how contextual factors form CMOC chains which generate outputs of collaborative behaviour. Core characteristics of collaborations, such as whether they were mandated or cross-sector, were explored for their proposed impact according to the theory. CONCLUSION: The formulation of this refined realist theory allows for greater understanding of how and why collaborations work and can serve to inform both future work in this area and the implementation of these arrangements. Future work should delve deeper into collaborative subtypes and the underlying drivers of collaborative performance.

COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide and reached HSCT centers in many countries. The first proven case of COVID-19 in Brazil was diagnosed in S?o Paulo by the end of February 2020. The Brazilian Society of Marrow Transplantation (SBTMO) promptly published local recommendations for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in HSCT centers. We describe the main clinical findings and outcomes of SARS CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in 22 HSCT recipients from two Brazilian HSCT centers, followed up for at least 14 days. Methods. The detection of SARS CoV-2 infection was performed by RT-PCR in all transplant candidates before admission, and in all HSCT recipients with respiratory symptoms. Other respiratory viruses were also investigated by direct fluorescent assay (DFA) or RT-PCR. COVID-19 was managed according to the SBTMO recommendations. Results. From March to June 2020, SARS CoV-2 infection was detected in 5 asymptomatic patients (29.4%) and COVID-19 was diagnosed in 17 HSCT recipients with respiratory symptoms (7 AUTO, 6 MRD, 5 MUD and 4 HAPLO) at a median of 94 days after HSCT (range -6 to +1,850). The asymptomatic cases at diagnosis remained so during follow-up. Two asymptomatic patients were receiving the conditioning regimen when SARS CoV-2 was diagnosed. The median age at diagnosis was 39,2 (1-72) years. Five patients were children (1-12 years) and 17 were adults (19-72 years). Eleven patients (50%) had comorbidities, the most frequent being diabetes and hypertension. Fever, cough and diarrhea were the symptoms more frequently observed and occurred in 13 (76.4%), 7 (41.2%), and 5 (29.4%) of the 17 symptomatic patients, respectively. Symptoms such as anosmia and dysgeusia, which have been frequently associated with COVID-19 were not observed in this series. Eleven of the symptomatic patients (64.7%) showed altered CT or X-ray at diagnosis. Glass ground opacities were the images more frequently seen (63.6%). The median lymphocyte count was 619.5 (0-2,604) /mL. C-reactive protein and d-dimer ranged from 0.65 to 339 ng/mL and from 0.39 to 4,530 mg/L, respectively. Four (18%) HSCT recipients died (1 AUTO, 2 HAPLO, 1 MRD). COVID-19 was the cause of death in two of them. In the remaining two HAPLO HSCT recipients, KPC co-infection followed by septic shock had a major role in patients death. Median age of patients who died was 39 (11-59) years, and two of them had comorbidities (hypertension and chronic lung disease). Conclusions. Symptoms of COVID-19 mimic other respiratory virus infections and specific diagnosis is mandatory. Interstitial pneumonia was frequent (around 65%). Clinical outcome of SARS Cov-2 infection or COVID-19 was moderate in the majority of the patients in the present series. However, the mortality rates observed in HSCT recipients (14.3% in AUTO; 20% in ALLO) were higher than in general population. Asymptomatic cases were seen in almost 30% of the patients, suggesting that frequent screening is necessary to control transmission in HSCT centers.

We aimed to analyse the use patterns of those substances and underlying motivations before and during the pandemic. METHODS: : A subsample of 1,231 users of stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA/ecstasy, cocaine), dissociative drugs (ketamine, dextromethorphan, PCP), and GHB/GBL was assessed from 30(th) April to 4(th) August 2020 as part of the Corona Drug Survey, a cross-sectional international online survey in five languages that included a total of 5,049 participants. The reported use of distinct substances and the underlying motivations were ascertained before (retrospectively) and during the pandemic. Furthermore, associations between drug use as a coping mechanism, pandemic-related stressors, and substance use were examined. RESULTS: : Regarding the reported frequency of use during the pandemic, 48.0C64.8% of the sample ceased or decreased, 11.9C25.5% maintained, and 23.6C29.1% increased their consumption. MDMA/ecstasy showed the strongest decrease and GHB/GBL and dissociatives the highest increase. Participants reported that price, quality, and supply were mostly unaffected by the pandemic. The most common motivations before and during the pandemic were mood-related factors, such as a desire to feel exhilarated, euphoric, high, or buzzed. The relevance of social purposes and mood-related motivators declined during the pandemic, whereas dealing with boredom increased.

Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated SARSCoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates the host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In the context of vaccine design, similar to many other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the glycan shield and the protein structure, stability, and dynamics. End-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which can be harnessed for vaccine development. In addition, a dynamic analysis of the main antibody epitopes is provided. Finally, beyond shielding, a possible structural role of N-glycans at N165 and N234 is hypothesized to modulate and stabilize the conformational dynamics of the spikes receptor binding domain, which is responsible for ACE2 recognition.

The research identifies the key questions that need to be resolved under each element of justice and the unfortunate limited timeframes for action. Critical justice areas include taxation, environmental impact assessments, waste management, social license to operate, and cross-border actions. Resolving these issues will directly address societal issues of inequality and ensure a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Already there is a global race for critical minerals, and justice needs a stronger role in its development based on evidence to-date.","output":"The role of justice in developing critical minerals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), driven by the obesity epidemic, has become the most common form of liver disease. Despite this, there is controversy regarding the prevalence and severity of NAFLD in obesity. Obesity-related factors, such as increasing adiposity, metabolic disease and inflammation, may influence prevalence. We therefore prospectively measured NAFLD prevalence in obesity and studied factors associated with NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS We recruited consecutive bariatric patients. Intraoperative liver biopsies were taken. The liver, adipose tissue and serum were collected to measure inflammation. Adipocyte cell size was measured. NAFLD severity was correlated to body mass index (BMI), metabolic health and adipose characteristics. RESULTS There were 216 participants; BMI 45.9  8.9 kg/m2, age 44.4  12.1 years, 75.5% female. Overall NAFLD prevalence was 74.1%, with 17.1% having non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and/or steatofibrosis. Odds of NASH/steatofibrosis increased independently with BMI category (odds ratio (OR) 2.28-3.46, all p < 0.05) and metabolic disease (OR 3.79, p = 0.003). These odds markedly increased when both super obesity (BMI > 50) and metabolic disease were present (OR 9.71, p < 0.001). NASH/steatofibrosis prevalence was significantly greater with diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Although greater visceral adipocyte hypertrophy was evident in NASH/steatofibrosis, there was no significant association between adipose inflammation and NASH/steatofibrosis. CONCLUSION NAFLD remains endemic in obesity; however, NASH/steatofibrosis are less common than previously reported. Worsening obesity and metabolic disease increase odds of NAFLD independently, with substantially compounded effect with both. These observations may help with risk stratification in obese populations. We were unable to delineate clear associations between adipose inflammation and NASH/steatofibrosis in this obese population.

The primary outcome was clinical ITP exacerbation defined as platelet count decrease requiring initiation/escalation of ITP treatment and/or new medical attention due to bleeding, within 3 months. Secondary outcome was any clinically relevant platelet decrease during the 3 months post-vaccination. The study included 93 ITP patients receiving 1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 22) or 3 (n = 69) vaccines. ITP exacerbation occurred in 2/93 (2.2%) patients following initial vaccination and in 3/69 (4.3%) following booster dose. Clinically relevant platelet decreases after initial doses occurred in 8/72 (11.1%) patients and in 8/39 (20.5%) after the booster. Clinical ITP exacerbation after booster doses did not follow clinical exacerbation after initial doses. Half of patients with clinically relevant platelet decreases after booster dose also had clinically relevant decreases following initial vaccination. We concluded that clinical ITP exacerbation is infrequent following Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical exacerbation after booster doses was not preceded by clinical exacerbation after initial doses.

It is a life-threatening condition exclusive to children with no effective treatment. Methods: In this study, we used system-level and vaccinomics approaches to design a polyvalent vaccine for RSV, which could stimulate the immune components of the host to manage this infection. Our framework involves data accession, antigenicity and subcellular localization analysis, T cell epitope prediction, proteasomal and conservancy evaluation, host-pathogen-protein interactions, pathway studies, and in silico binding affinity analysis. Results: We found glycoprotein (G), fusion protein (F), and small hydrophobic protein (SH) of RSV as potential vaccine candidates. Of these proteins (G, F, and SH), we found 9 epitopes for multiple alleles of MHC classes I and II bear significant binding affinity. These potential epitopes were linked to form a polyvalent construct using AAY, GPGPG linkers, and cholera toxin B adjuvant at N-terminal with a 23.9 kDa molecular weight of 224 amino acid residues. The final construct was a stable, immunogenic, and nonallergenic protein containing cleavage sites, TAP transport efficiency, posttranslation shifts, and CTL epitopes. The molecular docking indicated the optimum binding affinity of RSV polyvalent construct with MHC molecules (-12.49 and -10.48 kcal/mol for MHC classes I and II, respectively). This interaction showed that a polyvalent construct could manage and control this disease.

AIM: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of scoring systems such as emergency department triage early warning score (TREWS) and modified early warning score (MEWS) in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, PCR positive patients evaluated for COVID-19 and decided to be hospitalized were evaluated. During the first evaluation, MEWS and TREWS scores of the patients were calculated. Intensive care needs as well as 24-h and 28-day mortality rates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 339 patients were included in the study. While 30 (8.8%) patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit, 4 (1.2%) died in the emergency. The number of patients who died within 28 days was found to be 57 (16.8%). In 24-h mortality, the median MEWS value was found to be 7 (IQR 25C75) while the TREWS value was 11.5 (IQR 25C75). In the ROC analysis made for the diagnostic value of 28-day mortality of MEWS and TREWS scores, the area under the curve (AUC) for the MEWS score was found to be 0.833 (95% CI 0.777C0.888, p < 0.001) while it was identified as 0.823 (95% CI 0.764C0.882, p < 0.001) for the TREWS.

Although the capacity to present antigens other than the disease-specific antigen in the traditional vaccine composition provides a potential benefit by increasing its protective efficacy, many components that are not needed for the related disease are also transferred. These components can reduce vaccine activity by lowering immunity against protective antigens. The reasons such as the low effectiveness of traditional vaccines and the high cost of production and time-consuming reasons show that it is necessary to develop a new vaccine method for our world, which is struggling with epidemics almost every year. Among nucleic acids, mRNA has many advantages, such as genomic integration, induction of anti-DNA autoantibodies, and immune tolerance induced by long-term antigen expression. mRNA vaccines have become a therapeutic target for reasons such as efficacy, safety, fast and non-expensive production. The fact that mRNA triggers both humoral and cellular immunity and goes only to the cytoplasm, not to the nucleus, makes it highly efficient. The mRNA must cross the lipid bilayer barrier and entry to the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. There are two main ways of mRNA vaccine delivery for this: ex vivo loading of mRNA into dendritic cells (DCs) and direct injection of mRNA with or without a carrier. Studies continue to understand which delivery system is therapeutically more efficient. Preclinical and clinical trials showed that mRNA vaccines trigger a long-lasting and safe immune response.","output":"mRNA as a Therapeutics: Understanding mRNA Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"'Bentong' ginger is the most popular variety of Zingiber officinale in Malaysia.

As 'Bentong' ginger is less known for its micropropagation, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of Clorox (5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)) on explant surface sterilization, effects of plant growth regulators, and basal media on shoots' multiplication and rooting. The secondary metabolites and antioxidant activities of the micropropagated plants were evaluated in comparison with conventionally propagated plants. Rhizome sprouted buds were effectively sterilized in 70% Clorox for 30 min by obtaining 75% contamination-free explants. Murashige and Skoog (MS) supplemented with 10 M of zeatin was the suitable medium for shoot multiplication, which resulted in the highest number of shoots per explant (4.28).

An effective help to this end is granted by the analysis of deep sequencing data of viral samples, which are typically discarded after the creation of consensus sequences. Indeed, only with deep sequencing data it is possible to identify intra-host low-frequency mutations, which are a direct footprint of mutational processes that may eventually lead to the origination of functionally advantageous variants. Accordingly, a timely and statistically robust identification of such mutations might inform political decision-making with significant anticipation with respect to standard analyses based on consensus sequences.

The aim of this study was to characterize pharyngeal and esophageal pH-impedance reflux patterns in a group of patients with suspected laryngopharyngeal reflux and to determine predictive factors of response to proton pump inhibitors. METHODS Patients with chronic pharyngolaryngeal symptoms were evaluated with a symptom score questionnaire, laryngoscopy, and 24-hour pharyngeal and esophageal pH-impedance monitoring at baseline and after 8-week treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. Response to treatment was defined by a diminution of more than 50% of the score for the primary symptom. Reflux patterns and baseline impedance values were compared to those obtained in 46 healthy subjects. KEY RESULTS Twenty-four patients were included (17 women, median age 54 years), all previously refractory to antisecretory therapy. Symptom scores were 46 (32-62) and 40 (27-76) off and on therapy, respectively (P=.1). There was no significant difference between patients and controls for pH-impedance reflux parameters and baseline values off and on therapy in distal and proximal esophagus and in the pharynx. Median numbers of pharyngeal reflux were 0 and 0 off and on therapy, respectively. Only two patients were responders to treatment, both with excessive distal reflux but no pharyngeal reflux. Only one patient had abnormal pharyngeal reflux but did not respond to proton pump inhibitors.

In recent years, successful attempts to reduce the number of the traditionally used three ports have been reported. Specifically, two-port techniques, hybrid approaches, and single-port assisted techniques have been described. METHODS In this case series, the author describes for the first time a successful and uncomplicated true single-port appendectomy (TSPA) technique. Between July and December of 2007, 14 consecutive patients were assigned to undergo TSPA for presumed appendicitis at Yale-New Haven Hospital. The novel approach involves an innovative \\"puppeteer technique,\\" which uses a \\"pulley\\" in the form of an intraabdominally placed loop to the abdominal wall as an axle to elevate the appendix with a string. The thread is pulled by the surgeon extracorporeally, similar to a puppeteer moving the limbs of his or her puppets. RESULTS Of the 14 patients, 13 (8 women and 5 men) underwent a successful TSPA. One patient was converted to a two-port appendectomy. The average age of the patients was 37.5 years (range, 22-59 years), and the average body mass index (BMI) was 27.4 kg/m(2) (range, 19.4-39 kg/m(2)). The mean operative time was 87.5 min (range, 54-128 min). No major complications were observed. One minor postoperative complication occurred, involving urinary retention, which resolved within 24 h. CONCLUSIONS The novel \\"puppeteer technique\\" seems to be a safe and easily reproducible alternative to previous laparoscopic appendectomy techniques. It uses only one single 11-mm port without any additional skin incisions or transdermally traversing needles. It is performed entirely intracorporeally, resulting in presumably less postoperative pain and improved cosmesis. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to investigate this novel technique. The TSPA technique, the first of its kind in the treatment of appendicitis, minimizes the minimally invasive approach to a new level.","output":"True single-port appendectomy: first experience with the \\"puppeteer technique\\"."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health issues in family businesses and business families have been studied in multiple disciplines within the past three decades.

We show that IFN-/1 elicit different level of desensitisation from IFN-, where cells refractory to IFN-/1 are sensitive to IFN-, but not vice versa. We experimentally demonstrate that the underlying feedback mechanism involves regulation of STAT1 phosphorylation but is independent of new mRNA synthesis and cognate receptor expression. A new feedback model of the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity recapitulates experimental data and demonstrates JAK-STAT networks ability to decode relative changes of dose, timing, and type of temporal interferon stimulation.

Abnormalities in the chest computed tomography were detected in 22 cases (71%). Consolidation and architecture distortion were detected in 58.1% of patients; bilateral lesions and lower lobe infiltrates, each, was evident in 64.5% of patients, while the peripheral distribution of lesions was seen in 71% of the cases. Pleural thickening and effusion, each, was found in 51.6% of the patients. In this small case series, the presence of high ferritin was significantly associated with the bilaterality of the lesions. Elevated C-reactive protein was associated with the peripheral distribution of the lesions. Thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia were significantly correlated with the CT disease stage and CT severity score respectively. Conclusions. Although a few children in this group of MIS-C patients presented with respiratory manifestations, yet, most of them demonstrated significant radiological lung involvement, which necessitates a longer-term follow-up.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Pulmonary Computerized Imaging Findings of Critically Ill Egyptian Patients with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global death toll from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exceeded 2 million, and treatments to decrease mortality are needed urgently. OBJECTIVES: To examine the probabilities of a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality for remdesivir and systemic corticosteroids. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a probabilistic re-analysis of clinical trial data for corticosteroids and remdesivir in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using a Bayesian random effects meta-analytic approach. Studies were identified from existing meta-analyses performed by the World Health Organization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Posterior probabilities of an absolute decrease in mortality compared with control patients, by subgroups based on oxygen requirements, were calculated for corticosteroids and remdesivir. Probabilities of &#8805;1%, &#8805;2% and &#8805;5% absolute decrease in mortality were quantified. RESULTS: For patients needing mechanical ventilation, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 4% for remdesivir and 93% for corticosteroids. For patients needing supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 81% for remdesivir and 93% for dexamethasone. Finally, for patients who did not need oxygen support, the probability of &#8805;1% absolute decrease in mortality was 29% for remdesivir and 4% for dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a Bayesian analytic approach, remdesivir had low probability of achieving a clinically meaningful reduction in mortality, except for patients needing supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids were more promising for patients needing oxygen support, especially mechanical ventilation. While awaiting more definitive studies, this probabilistic interpretation of the evidence will help to guide treatment decisions for clinicians, as well as guideline and policy makers.","output":"Remdesivir and systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19: A Bayesian re-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronaviridae family includes the seven known human coronaviruses (CoV) that cause mild to moderate respiratory infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1) as well as severe illness and death (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Severe infections induce hyperinflammatory responses that are often intensified by host adaptive immune pathways to profoundly advance disease severity. Proinflammatory responses are triggered by CoV entry mediated by host cell surface receptors. Interestingly, five of the seven strains use three cell surface metallopeptidases (CD13, CD26, and ACE2) as receptors, whereas the others employ O-acetylated-sialic acid (a key feature of metallopeptidases) for entry. Why CoV evolved to use peptidases as their receptors is unknown, but the peptidase activities of the receptors are dispensable, suggesting the virus uses/benefits from other functions of these molecules. Indeed, these receptors participate in the immune modulatory pathways that contribute to the pathological hyperinflammatory response. This review will focus on the role of CoV receptors in modulating immune responses.","output":"Coronavirus Receptors as Immune Modulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Keloid is a benign skin tumor characterized by its cell hyperproliferative activity, invasion into normal skin, uncontrolled growth, overproduction and deposition of extracellular matrices and high recurrence rate after various therapies. Nintedanib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF, PDGF, FGF, and TGF- receptors with proved efficacy in anti-angiogenesis and in treating various types of cancers. In this study, we investigated the effects of nintedanib on keloid fibroblasts in both in vitro and ex vivo models. Keloid fibroblasts were prepared from 54 keloid scar samples in active stages collected from 49 patients. We found that nintedanib (1?4 M) dose-dependently suppressed cell proliferation, induced G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest, and inhibited migration and invasion of keloid fibroblasts. The drug also significantly inhibited the gene and protein expression of collagen I (COL-1) and III (COL-3), fibronectin (FN), and connective growth factor (CTGF), as well as the gene expression of other pathological factors, such as alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), FK506-binding protein 10 (FKBP10), and heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) in keloid fibroblasts. Furthermore, nintedanib treatment significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, ERK, STAT3, and Smad, enhanced endocytosis of various growth factor receptors. Using an ex vivo tissue explant model, we showed that nintedanib significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and collagen production. The drug also significantly disrupted microvessel structure ex vivo. In summary, our results demonstrate that nintedanib is likely to become a potential targeted drug for keloid systemic therapy.","output":"Nintedanib inhibits keloid fibroblast functions by blocking the phosphorylation of multiple kinases and enhancing receptor internalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19 has created a daunting scenario urging an immediate generation of therapeutic strategy. Interventions to curb the spread of viral infection primarily include setting targets against the virus. Here in this study we target S protein to obstruct the viral attachment and entry and also the M pro to prevent the viral replication. For this purpose, the interaction of S protein and M pro with phytocompounds, sanguinarine and eugenol, and their derivatives were studied using computational tools. It is evident from the docking studies that 8-Hydroxydihydrosanguinarine, a derivative of sanguinarine, exhibits maximum binding affinity with both the targets. The binding energies of the ligand with S protein and M pro scored to be Gb-9.4 Kcal/mol and Gb-10.3 Kcal/mol respectively. MD simulation studies depict that the phytocompound could effectively cause structural perturbations in the targets which would affect their functions. 8-Hydroxydihydrosanguinarine distorts the -helix in the secondary structure of M pro and RBD site of S protein. Protein-protein interaction study in presence of 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine (8-HDS) also corroborate the above findings which indicate that this polyphenol interfere in the coupling of S Protein and ACE2. The alterations in protonation of M pro suggest that the protein structure undergoes significant structural changes at neutral pH. ADME (Physicochemical, Lipophilicity, Water Solubility, Pharmacokinetics, Drug-likeness) property of 8- hydroxydihydrosanguinarine suggests that this could be a potential drug.

This has long been highlighted as integral to improving social care for the elderly. The COVID-19 pandemic experience reveals lessons and implications about the systemic absence of decent work in one place, Scotland, in care homes. The main lesson and implication is a need for change beyond the focus on levels of pay and systemic advocacy of decent work as it is conventionally understood. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected using qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 20 care workers in care homes.[AQ4] A range of care system institutional stakeholders was also interviewed. A range of care system institutional stakeholders was also interviewed. Findings: Decent work in social care may only be progressed to the extent that a culture change is achieved, transcending the institutional stasis about who owns and engages with progressing decent work. Research limitations/implications: This is a study in one place, Scotland, with a small sample of frontline care workers in care homes and representatives from a range of institutions. Practical implications: Effective culture change for decent work in care homes needs to be a higher research priority. More explicit culture policies can be a mechanism by which overall decent work and system change may be catalysed and sustainably secured together. Explicit culture change is here set out with respect to operational, institutional and national domains. Social implications: There needs to be social policy and political support for situating decent work to be part of a broader culture change around care work with the elderly. A culture-oriented change plan as well as new resourcing and structures can together ensure that the nadir of the pandemic experience was a historical turning point towards transformation rather than being just another low point in a recurring cycle.

Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of MR and vsWM training combined with number line (NL) training. Fifty-seven children, aged 6C7, performed 25 days of NL training combined with either vsWM or MR and participated in an Electroencephalography (EEG)-session in school to measure resting state activity and steady-state visual evoked potentials during a vsWM task before and after training. Fifty children, aged 6C7, received usual teaching and acted as a control group. Compared to the control group, both training groups improved on a combined measure of mathematics. Cognitive improvement was specific to the training. Significant pre-post changes in resting state-EEG (rs-EEG), common to both training groups, were found for power as well as for coherence, with no significant differences in rs-EEG-changes between the vsWM and MR groups. Two of the common rs-EEG changes were correlated with mathematical improvement: (1) an increase in coherence between the central frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe in frequencies ranging from 16 to 25 Hz, and (2) an increase in coherence between the left frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe ranging from 23 to 25 Hz. These results indicate that changes in fronto-parietal coherence are related to an increase in mathematical performance, which thus might be a useful measure in further investigations of mathematical interventions in children.","output":"Resting State EEG Related to Mathematical Improvement After Spatial Training in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute encephalitis syndrome(AES) represents long term public health challenge with recurrent seasonal outbreak in many districts of Bihar for the past two decades.

Within China, xenophobia has also been observed toward the people of Wuhan, the city where the first cases were identified. The relationship between disease threat and xenophobia is well established, but the reasons for this relationship are unclear. This study investigated the mediation role of perceived protection efficacy and moderation role of support seeking in the relationship between perceived COVID-19 risk and xenophobia within China. METHODS: An online survey was administered to a nationally representative sample (N = 1103; 51.7% women; ages 18 to 88) of Chinese adults during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed questionnaires about their perceived COVID-19 risk, perceived protection efficacy in reducing risk, support seeking, and xenophobic attitudes toward people of the Wuhan area. RESULTS: Regression based analyses showed that the perceived COVID-19 risk positively predicted xenophobia. Low perceived protection efficacy partly mediated the relationship between perceived COVID-19 risk and xenophobic attitudes, and this indirect effect was moderated by support seeking. Specifically, the indirect effect was weaker among individuals who sought more social support. CONCLUSIONS: Under disease threat, xenophobia can appear within a country that otherwise seems culturally homogeneous. This study extends the extant research by identifying a possible psychological mechanism by which individuals perception of disease threat elicits xenophobia, and by addressing the question of why this response is stronger among some people than others. Increasing the publics perceived efficacy in protecting themselves from infection, and encouraging support seeking, could reduce xenophobic attitudes.","output":"Does COVID-19 threat increase xenophobia?

Federal correctional institutions in Canada have increasingly treated OUD among correctional populations via opioid agonist treatment (OAT) - an evidence based pharmacotherapy that works to reduce drug use and related health harms. However, there is limited evidence regarding incarcerated individuals' experiences with institutional-based OAT, as well potential OAT-related community release prospects. This information is important for optimal treatment retention and improved health. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a longitudinal follow-up study examining OAT-related experiences among federally incarcerated individuals before and after community release. This article focuses on the baseline (pre-release) data. METHODS: This mixed-methods study examined OAT-related experiences and release prospects among n = 46 individuals scheduled for community release, recruited from seven federal prisons located in Ontario, Canada. Participants underwent a comprehensive interviewer-administered on-site assessment, including quantitative and qualitative items. Assessment data was furthermore linked to administrative correctional data. Data were analyzed using thematic qualitative and descriptive quantitative approaches. RESULTS: Participants had complex histories with opioid use including related negative health outcomes. Experiences with institutional OAT were divergent and provision was not standardized; those with OAT engagement pre-admission did not experience many challenges, whereas those initiating OAT during incarceration experienced barriers such as treatment waitlists and adverse process experiences. Most participants expressed a preference for buprenorphine-naloxone over methadone, but described difficulties accessing it. Participants were keen to transition into community-based treatment, yet envisaged prospective barriers and facilitators concerning successful reintegration and treatment continuity. CONCLUSIONS: Major barriers towards the current administration of OAT in federal correctional systems in Canada exist, including extensive waitlists, non-standardized practices, and challenges accessing preferred OAT formulations; this contributes to sub-optimal treatment. Eliminating waitlists, standardizing OAT provision, providing additional OAT options, and more comprehensive release planning may be essential for treatment retention and positive outcomes.","output":"Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) experiences and release plans among federally incarcerated individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) in Ontario, Canada: a mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the serious impact of border control measures during the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, new difficulties and challenges have been brought to the border lines of most countries and regions Focusing on the post-COVID global economic recovery, we develop a computing method for studying the health inspection process based on a three-color risk screening management mechanism at border crossing checkpoints In this article, to manage the cross-border risk efficiently during the epidemic prevention and control, we formulate a queueing model with hierarchical health inspection channels The structural characteristics and properties of this three-level queueing model are also analyzed by studying the health inspection process with risk classification Furthermore, we conduct a series of sensitivity analysis on several performance measures for the studied queueing system In the numerical results, we figure out the monotonicity, convexity and complicated patterns of the derived formulas","output":"A Three-Level Health Inspection Queue Based on Risk Screening Management Mechanism for Post-COVID Global Economic Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of the microbiome data holds great potential for elucidating the biological and metabolic functioning of living organisms and their role in the environment Metagenomic analyses have shown that humans, along with for example, domestic animals, wildlife and arthropods, are colonized by an immense community of viruses The current Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) heightens the need to rapidly detect previously unknown viruses in an unbiased way The increasing availability of metagenomic data in this era of next-generation sequencing (NGS), along with increasingly affordable sequencing technologies, highlight the need for reliable and comprehensive methods to manage such data In this article, we present a novel bioinformatics pipeline called LAZYPIPE for identifying both previously known and novel viruses in host associated or environmental samples and give examples of virus discovery based on it LAZYPIPE is a Unix-based pipeline for automated assembling and taxonomic profiling of NGS libraries implemented as a collection of C++, Perl, and R scripts","output":"Novel NGS pipeline for virus discovery from a wide spectrum of hosts and sample types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synthetic gene circuits allow us to govern cell behavior in a programmable manner, which is central to almost any application aiming to harness engineered living cells for user-defined tasks.

We evaluated 30 day mortality and thrombotic events relative to anticoagulation therapy and coagulation parameters in Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients in California's central valley. Methods: We identified 886 non-pregnant adults hospitalized at Community Medical Centers in the Central Valley of California with SARS-CoV2 infections from 3/1/20 to 9/1/20. We conducted manual chart review and excluded patients on long term anticoagulation prior to admission. We collected data on ethnicity, coagulation labs, thrombotic events and 30 day all-cause mortality outcomes. The distributions of variables were reviewed to detect illogical and out of range values. Differences in means of continuous variables were evaluated via the t-test. Differences in categorical variables were evaluated with chi square tests. All tests are two-sided and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among the 866 COVID positive patients, 568 (64%) were Hispanic and 318 (36%) were non-Hispanic. The gender distribution was equivalent with 57% males and 43% females. Hispanic patients were younger with a mean age of 56.1 years vs 63.2 years in non-Hispanics. Mean BMI was 32.7 for Hispanics and 30.5 for non-Hispanics (p<0.05). The risk factor assessment for severe COVID-19 infection revealed a history of thrombosis or thrombophilia, bleeding tendency, obesity, active cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, end stage renal disease, liver cirrhosis and immunosuppression, all of which were not statistically significant between Hispanics and non-Hispanics. However, chronic lung disease (p<0.05) and residing in a skilled nursing or long-term care facility (p<0.001) were statistically significant (Table 1). 16% of non-Hispanics had chronic lung disease vs 10.9% of Hispanics. Likewise, 10.4% of non-Hispanics inhabited care facilities compared to 3.9% of Hispanics. Review of initial CRP values exhibited statistical significance (p=0.017) amidst Hispanics at 145.3 and non-Hispanics at 124.8. Other labs including PT, INR, PTT, d-dimer, fibrinogen, platelets, ferritin and ESR were not statistically significant between ethnic groups. Mean hospital stay for Hispanics and non-Hispanics were analogous at 12.8 days and 12.9 days respectively. Intensive care unit admission rates were higher for Hispanics at 32.7% (186/568) in contrast to non-Hispanics at 28.3% (90/318) (p=0.171). Evaluation of 30 day mortality revealed that 14.2% (81/568) of Hispanic patients died compared to 17.9% (57/317) of non-Hispanic patients. (p=0.147). The bleeding rate was 4.8% in Hispanics and 3.8% in non-Hispanics. 59 (6.6%) patients experienced some form of thrombosis, which was dichotomized to show that 39 (6.8%) Hispanics and 20 (6.2%) non-Hispanics incurred thrombosis during hospitalization. 19.4% (18/93) of patients on therapeutic anticoagulation and 5.1% (34/657) of patients on prophylactic low dose anticoagulation developed thrombosis (P=0.00001). 30 day mortality was higher in patients receiving therapeutic vs low dose standard anticoagulation prophylaxis (20.4% Vs 14.5%. p=0.006). Thrombotic events transpired at 4.7% (22/464) in patients with initial d-dimer <2500 in comparison to 15.8% (19/120) of patients with values 2500 (p<0.001). Additionally, 30 day mortality was lower for patients with d-dimer < 2500 at 13.4% (62/464) than for patients with d-dimer  2500 at 30.8% (37/120) (p<0.001). Prothrombin time (PT) > 16 correlated with a higher incidence of thrombosis (17% vs 6.7%. p<0.001) and 30-day mortality (36% vs 15.9%. p <0.001). Similarly, 30 day mortality was increased in patients with ferritin > 1000 (22.7% vs 12.1%. p= 0.002). However, the same was not observed for ferritin levels and thrombosis. Conclusions: This study illuminates ethnic variances with respect to COVID-19 hospital outcomes. Hispanic patients were younger and had less risk factors for severe COVID-19 infections. Regardless of ethnic differences, incidence of thrombosis and 30 day mortality were similar. Despite sicker patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, the 30 day mortality and rate of thrombotic events remain higher among these patients. D-dimer  2500 and elevated PT were associated with higher rate of thrombosis and death.

RESULTS: A total of 396 survivors of ARDS provided data at 1 year after discharge from ICU. Fifty percent of 1-year survivors were hospitalized for 48 days or longer after discharge from ICU, with 10% spending more than six out of 12 months in stationary care. The duration of hospitalization increased significantly by the length of the initial ICU stay. All participants reported at least one outpatient visit (including visits to general practitioners), and 50% contacted four or more different medical specialties within the first year after discharge from ICU.

Students of vertebrate anatomy can especially benefit from practicing fabrication, or making, incorporating skills such as 3D digital modeling, 3D printing, and using familiar low-tech materials to construct informed replicas of animal anatomy. Student perceptions of active learning projects are shaped by motivation theories such as the expectancy-value theory and self-directed learning, both of which are briefly reviewed here. This paper offers inspiration and resources to instructors for establishing a makerspace in an anatomy lab and leveraging community partners to stimulate students to construct their own versions of nature's designs. Learning science in informal environments and specifically in makerspaces has been shown to promote equity and increase motivation to study science. Examples here emphasize accessibility for diverse learners, including strategies for instructors to ensure ease of student access to 3D technology. Scaffolding formative assessments builds student confidence and expertise, further closing opportunity gaps. Two specific cases are detailed where fabrication and the use of 3D digital models are used to augment student learning of vertebrate anatomy at a small liberal arts college. In a semester-long research project in an introductory biomechanics course, students investigate, write about, and build models of animal anatomy of their choice. They use simple materials, crafting supplies, household tools, and/or 3D printing to demonstrate structures of interest, enhancing understanding of the physical principles of animal form and function. Given increased availability of CT data online, students can download, analyze, and 3D print skeletal models of both common and endangered animals. Comparative anatomy students reported that they had increased motivation to study intricate skeletal anatomy simply by manipulating bones in a 3D software assignment.

Cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 varies from troponin rise or arrhythmia/myocarditis to fulminant cardiogenic shock. There is limited data on echocardiographic findings in such patients. We aimed to assess abnormal echocardiographic findings and contributory factors in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of COVID-19 positive patients who underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at Sandwell and West Birmingham (SWBH) NHS Trust between March 2020 and May 2020. Patients were compared based on TTE changes and divided into two groups (abnormal TTE and normal TTE). Results: 66 out of 463 patients with COVID-19 had a TTE. 46 patients (69.7%) had abnormal findings on their TTE. Tricuspid regurgitation was the most common abnormality observed (26 (56.5%) patients), followed by aortic regurgitation (13 (28.3%) patients) and mitral regurgitation (12 (26.1%) patients). Haemoglobin and LDH were predictors of abnormal TTE (Hb OR: 0.97, p = 0.049, LDH, OR: 1.00, p = 0.03).

This study aimed to define the clinical features and management of XGP, focusing on microbiological aspects and antibiotic therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 27 cases of XGP diagnosed between January 2001 and January 2020 to analyse their clinical and management characteristics. In addition, a literature review was conducted of XGP case series covering the period from 2000C2020. We searched PubMed for case series through April 2020 without language restrictions. Studies reporting case series of XGP (more than ten cases) were included if they were relevant to this study. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with XGP, and 26 of them were histologically proven to have XGP. A total of 81.5% of the patients were female and the mean age was 59.6 years (SD 19.2). The most frequent symptoms were flank pain (70.4%) and fever (59.3%), while 77.8% of patients had renal stones. Proteus mirabilis was detected in the urine culture in 18.5% of patients, followed by detection of Escherichia coli in 14.8% of patients. The computed tomography (CT) findings included perirenal (29.6%) or pararenal (29.6%) involvement in the majority of patients. Twenty-six patients underwent nephrectomy. Piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for treatment. The reported piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone resistance rates were 14.3% and 16.6%, respectively. Twenty-six case series were included in the literature review, reporting 693 cases in total. CONCLUSION: We found well-established characteristics of XGP patients among series in terms of previous history, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings, and operative and postoperative outcomes. It is important to know the clinical presentation and potential severity of XGP, as well as the most frequently involved microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles, to select the most appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Recently, it was demonstrated that ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) is a feasible and acceptable intervention with potential mental health benefits. However, its effect on mental health and ICU aftercare in COVID-19 ICU survivors is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of ICU-VR on mental health and on patients perceived quality of, satisfaction with, and rating of ICU aftercare among COVID-19 ICU survivors. METHODS: This was a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to either the ICU-VR (intervention) or the control group. All patients were invited to an COVID-19 post-ICU follow-up clinic 3 months after hospital discharge, during which patients in the intervention group received ICU-VR. One month and 3 months later (4 and 6 months after hospital discharge), mental health, quality of life, perceived quality, satisfaction with, and rating of ICU aftercare were scored using questionnaires. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients (median age 58 years; 63 males, 70%) were included. The prevalence and severity of psychological distress were limited throughout follow-up, and no differences in psychological distress or quality of life were observed between the groups. ICU-VR improved satisfaction with (mean score 8.7, SD 1.6 vs 7.6, SD 1.6 [ICU-VR vs control]; t(64)=C2.82, P=.006) and overall rating of ICU aftercare (mean overall rating of aftercare 8.9, SD 0.9 vs 7.8, SD 1.7 [ICU-VR vs control]; t(64)=C3.25; P=.002) compared to controls. ICU-VR added to the quality of ICU aftercare according to 81% of the patients, and all patients would recommend ICU-VR to other ICU survivors. CONCLUSIONS: ICU-VR is a feasible and acceptable innovative method to improve satisfaction with and rating of ICU aftercare and adds to its perceived quality. We observed a low prevalence of psychological distress after ICU treatment for COVID-19, and ICU-VR did not improve psychological recovery or quality of life.

To facilitate diagnosis of sHLH the HScore has been developed and validated. We set out to examine the prevalence of sHLH-like hyperinflammation in COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively examined HScore parameters in 626 COVID-19 cases admitted to our institute of which 567 were suitable for analysis and compared these to a cohort of confirmed infection associated sHLH cases. To account for missing data, we calculated the maximum possible HScore of the recorded parameters (%HScore). Results: Early measurement of HScore parameters (day -1 to 4 from diagnosis) strongly predicted the %HScore over the course of the admission (p <0.0001). The retrospective cohort of sHLH showed significantly higher %HScores as compared to COVID-19 (median 73.47 vs 18.13 respectively, p <0.0001). The overall prevalence of individuals with an 80% probability of sHLH in our COVID-19 cohort was 1.59% on admission and only rose to 4.05% during the whole disease course. In the small cohort with scores suggestive of sHLH, there was no excess mortality compared with the whole cohort. %HScores were higher in younger patients (p<0.0001) and did not reliably predict outcome at any cut-off value (AUROC 0.533, p=0.211; OR 0.99).

Cryo-electron microscopic analyses of EDF1 and its yeast homolog Mbf1 revealed a conserved 40S ribosomal subunit binding site at the mRNA entry channel near the collision interface. EDF1 recruits the translational repressors GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 to collided ribosomes to initiate a negative-feedback loop that prevents new ribosomes from translating defective mRNAs.

Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the major complications of COVID-19.

These uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to local and systemic tissue damage. In patients with severe COVID-19, eosinopenia and lymphopenia with a severe reduction in the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells are a common feature. COVID-19 severity hinges on the development of cytokine storm characterized by elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, IgG-, IgM- and IgA-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most patients, along with the viral RNA, forming the basis for assays that aid in patient diagnosis. Elucidating the immunopathological outcomes due to COVID-19 could provide potential targets for immunotherapy and are important for choosing the best clinical management by consultants. Currently, along with standard supportive care, therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 treatment involve the use of antiviral agents that interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle to prevent further viral replication and utilizing immunomodulators to dampen the immune system in order to prevent cytokine storm and tissue damage. While current therapeutic options vary in efficacy, there are several molecules that were either shown to be effective against other viruses such as HIV or show promise in vitro that could be added to the growing arsenal of agents used to control COVID-19 severity and spread.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): An overview of the immunopathology, serological diagnosis and management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is crucial to minimize the spread of the infection until effective drugs and vaccines are developed Therefore, close contact must be reduced to prevent human-to-human transmission We propose a simplified inexpensive system using a monocular camera combined with Raspberry Pi, a small single-board computer, to measure physical distancing and warn people of their proximity with others ? 2020 Owner/Author","output":"Physical distance monitoring system for COVID-19 using raspberry Pi and a monocular camera: Poster abstract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic increased economic, social, and health stressors for families, yet its impacts on families of youth with chronic conditions, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), are not well understood.

Strong SR may have protected youth with T1D from the impacts of pandemic-related stressors. This study compared youth and parent emotional functioning and T1D management before and after the pandemic's onset in relation to family pandemic-related stress and youth SR. METHODS Parents of youth with T1D (N = 88) and a subset of these youth (N = 43; Mean age 15.3 years [SD 2.2]) completed surveys regarding SR, stress, emotional functioning, and T1D-related functioning prior to and after March 2020.

METHODS: Three known individuals with PEG allergy and 3 healthy controls were recruited and evaluated for hypersensitivity to the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines, and to related compounds by skin testing and basophil activation, as measured by CD63 upregulation using flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine induced positive skin test results in patients with PEG allergy, whereas the result of traditional PEG skin testing was negative in 2 of 3 patients. One patient was found to be cosensitized to both the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines because of cross-reactive PEG and polysorbate allergy. The BNT162b2 vaccine, but not PEG alone, induced dose-dependent activation of all patients' basophils ex vivo. Similar basophil activation could be induced by PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin, suggesting that PEGylated lipids within nanoparticles, but not PEG in its native state, are able to efficiently induce degranulation.

The Austrian Competence and Service Agency for Self-help ?KUSS was created as part of the framework of the concept for public promotion of self-help. It developed an advanced training program for the systematic support of nationwide self-help organizations (NSHO). The article describes the conceptual development of an advanced training program and discusses how to deal with ambivalences arising in the process. METHOD Three training tracks were derived from the objectives of the concept for the public promotion of self-help (promoting the visibility of self-help organizations, strengthening self-help organizations in their activities, and patient participation). To determine the contents, the advanced training needs of NSHO were identified on the basis of process-produced data (including feedback forms), relevant literature, and the results of workshops with self-help representatives. An Internet search was conducted to build on existing offerings. The ?KUSS concept was developed in several workshops with representatives of self-help organizations and its contents and framework conditions were discussed. RESULTS Training Track 1 \\"Strengthening self-help activities\\" aims to strengthen the self-image of NSHO as a self-help organization and to support the implementation of activities with introductory seminars and additional workshops. Training Track 2 \\"Promoting cooperation\\" supports the meeting and dialogue between NSHO representatives and experts with expert dialogues and annual projects. Training Track 3 \\"Strengthening collective patient participation\\" prepares NSHO representatives for participation in health policy decision-making processes in a modular course. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS During the development process, ambivalences in a social, factual, time and space dimension were dealt with: On the social dimension, the aim was to take decisions regarding the objectives, form and content of the continuing education program as closely as possible to the participants and to offer low-threshold participation. On the factual level, the focus was on the competence of those affected and/or the transfer of competence for implementing activities. In terms of time, a balance had to be struck between the time resources available to the NSHO representatives and the time required to develop competence. In terms of space, on-site events were preferred to online events (before COVID-19). Finally, a different approach was chosen for each training track. For the further development of the advanced training program, a piloting and a participatory development with NSHO representatives is recommended.","output":"[Advanced training program seeking to strengthen nationwide self-help organizations: development of the ?KUSS advanced training concept]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Endpoint choice for randomized controlled trials of treatments for novel coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19) is complex. Trials must start rapidly to identify treatments that can be used as part of the outbreak response, in the midst of considerable uncertainty and limited information. COVID-19 presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks to over a month and can end in death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence about the clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating mortality are large and may be impractical, particularly given a multitude of putative therapies to evaluate. Furthermore, patient states in between \\"cure\\" and \\"death\\" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity scores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary measure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly given the variable time course of COVID-19. Outcomes measured at fixed time points, such as a comparison of severity scores between treatment and control at day 14, may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An endpoint such as time to improvement (or recovery) avoids the timing problem. However, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the ordinal scale to a binary state of \\"recovered\\" versus \\"not recovered.\\" METHODS We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent COVID-19 treatment trials. RESULTS Power for fixed time-point methods depends heavily on the time selected for evaluation. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical power, even when compared with a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal time. DISCUSSION Time-to-event analysis methods have advantages in the COVID-19 setting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in advance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may increase power for interim analyses.","output":"Endpoints for randomized controlled clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose an unsupervised deep learning method for atlas-based registration to achieve segmentation and spatial alignment of the embryonic brain in a single framework.

PURPOSE To evaluate the technical and clinical success of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in restoring patency of acutely and chronically thrombosed covered TIPS using the Aspirex?S and Rotarex?S system. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated mechanical thrombectomy-assisted revisions in five patients between January 2012 and April 2021. Two patients had to be revised twice due to recurrent occlusion. We designated thrombosis within 10 days after shunt creation or revision as acute. Insidious deterioration of portal hypertension related symptoms for at least 6-8 weeks was recorded in chronic cases. We treated four acute and three chronic occlusions. After transjugular lesion crossing, we performed two mechanical thrombectomy device passages. If indicated, balloon dilatation, covered stent placement, or variceal embolization were added. RESULTS The technical success rate was 100%. No procedure-related complications occurred. In one patient with acute decompensation of Budd-Chiari syndrome and acute-on-chronic liver failure, early re-thrombosis occurred twice with patency intervals of up to eight days. In contrast, stable patency was achieved in the other four patients with documented patency intervals of at least five months and improvement of portal hypertension-related symptoms, resulting in a patient based clinical success rate of 80%.

Predictive equations were derived from two multiple linear regression models, a comprehensive model (height(2)/resistance (RI), six anthropometric measurements) and a simple model (RI, height, weight). Their uncertainty was quantified by means of 10-fold cross-validation approach. Prediction error of FFM was 3.0% for both equations (root mean square error: 360 and 356 g, respectively). The derived equations produced BIA-based prediction of FFM and FM near DXA scan results. We suggest that the predictive equations can be applied in similar population samples aged 2-4 years.

Though preliminary research suggests feasibility and positive outcomes of telebehavioral health practice for people with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, there is limited research about implementation and effectiveness of this practice (Kasckow et al., 2014). This case series highlights the transition from in-person to telebehavioral health practice of a Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training for Schizophrenia group due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article summarizes: (a) the staff procedures needed to transition the group from in-person to telebehavioral health, (b) participant outcome data, (c) session attendance data, and (d) survey results from facilitators and participants about barriers and facilitators of the transition to telebehavioral health, and about how the virtual platform altered the therapeutic relationship and engagement. Participant outcome and engagement data suggest that, not only were two participants able to transition to telehealth and complete the program, but both participants also showed notable improvement in treatment engagement, goal progress, and skill acquisition. Surveys of six facilitators and one participant highlight how the transition to telebehavioral health had treatment advantages (e.g., therapeutic relationship, treatment engagement, group dynamics). Though survey results highlighted several implementation challenges in using the new virtual platform (e.g., technological connectivity, confidential space for engagement), no survey respondents reported that participation in this program resulted in harm to facilitators or participants. All facilitators and one participant agreed that the transition from in-person to virtual services was easy and reduced transportation barriers. Given the limited treatment engagement for this population (Lora et al., 2012) and the importance of early intervention to maximize clinical outcomes (Black et al., 2001; Bottlender et al., 2003), unanimous facilitator and participant report about improved patient attendance and participation in treatment after the transition to telebehavioral health was critically important.

METHODS: The authors performed a single-center retrospective case-control study. The outcome of interest was seizure associated with DBS implantation. Univariate analyses were performed using the Student t-test for parametric continuous outcomes. The authors used the Kruskal-Wallis test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for nonparametric continuous outcomes, chi-square statistics for categorical outcomes, and multivariate logistic regression for binomial variables. RESULTS: A total of 814 DBS electrode implantations were performed in 645 patients (478 [58.7%] in men and 520 [63.9%] in patients with Parkinson's disease). In total, 22 (3.4%) patients who had undergone 23 (2.8%) placements experienced seizure. Of the 23 DBS implantation-related seizures, 21 were new-onset seizures (3.3% of 645 patients) and 2 were recurrence or worsening of a prior seizure disorder. Among the 23 cases with postimplantation-related seizure, epilepsy developed in 4 (17.4%) postoperatively; the risk of DBS-associated epilepsy was 0.50% per DBS electrode placement and 0.63% per patient. Nine (39.1%) implantation-related seizures had associated postoperative radiographic abnormalities. Multivariate analyses suggested that age at surgery conferred a modest increased risk for postoperative seizures (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10). Sex, primary diagnosis, electrode location and sidedness, and the number of trajectories were not significantly associated with seizures after DBS surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures associated with DBS electrode placement are uncommon, typically occur early within the postoperative period, and seldom lead to epilepsy. This study suggests that patient characteristics, such as age, may play a greater role than perioperative variables in determining seizure risk. Multiinstitutional studies may help better define and mitigate the risk of seizures after DBS surgery.","output":"Incidence and risk factors for seizures associated with deep brain stimulation surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to analyze economic growth in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic by using the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with a comparison of the previous year in the same quarter (y-on-y) and also a comparison with the previous quarter (q-to-y). q).

Lebanese physicians were particularly at high risk of burnout since they confronted a mixture of overlapping crises. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of burnout among Lebanese physicians, to investigate its associated factors and to explore the combined effects of the pandemic and the economic crisis on burnout. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Lebanese physicians over December 2020 using a snowball sampling technique. Self-reported data were collected electronically through an anonymous questionnaire that included information on socio-demographic characteristics, work-related variables, and 4 scales: fear of COVID-19, threat perception, InCharge Financial Distress/Financial Well-Being, and the Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI). CBI scale cut-off score of 50 was used to evaluate the prevalence of burnout. Multivariable linear regression analyses were carried out to identify the factors associated with burnout. Results: A total of 398 physicians participated in the study. The majority of them were male (52.8%), married (60.1%), and aged between 40 and 49 years (43.2%). Burnout hits 90.7% of the Lebanese physicians where personal, work-related, and client-related burnout were detected among 80.4%, 75.63%, and 69.6% of them respectively. A strong association was found between the higher level of burnout and female gender, younger age, being single, having a dependent child, living with an elderly or having a family member with comorbidities, and insufficient sleeping hours. Physicians specialties, working in a public health facility, limited years of professional experience, lack of previous experience in pandemic and extensive working hours were also associated with increased burnout. Furthermore, low income, working in the frontline, higher threat perception, and fear of COVID-19 were contributing to higher burnout. However, financial wellbeing, altruism, having good health, and previous history of COVID-19 were significantly associated to lower burnout. The combined effect of threat perception and financial hardship significantly increased the level of burnout.

Parents are key decision-makers for whether their children will receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Objective: To estimate parents willingness to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19, and to investigate the predictors for their decision. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, ProQuest, and CINAHL from inception to August 11, 2021. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273125). We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity was very high. We used subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis to explore sources of heterogeneity. Results: We found 17 studies including 45,783 parents. The overall proportion of parents that intend to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 was 56.8% (95% confidence interval: 51.8-61.8%). Parents willingness ranged from 29% to 72.7%. Studies quality, sample size, data collection time, and the continent that studies were conducted did not affect the results. The main predictors of parents intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 were male gender, older age of parents and children, higher socio-economic status, white race, positive attitudes toward vaccination, higher levels of knowledge, and higher levels of perceived threat from the COVID-19, worry, fear, and anxiety. Conclusions: Parents willingness to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 is moderate and several factors affect this decision. Understanding parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy does help policymakers to change the stereotypes and establish broad community COVID-19 vaccination.

Interpretation of thyroid tests during illness, however, is hampered by changes occurring in the context of non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). In order to elucidate these findings, we studied thyroid function in carefully selected cohorts of COVID-19 positive and negative patients. DESIGN: Cohort observational study. METHODS: We measured TSH, FT4, T3 within 24 h of admission in 196 patients without thyroid disease and/or confounding medications. In this study, 102 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive; 41 admitted in the ICU, 46 in the ward and 15 outpatients. Controls consisted of 94 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients; 39 in the ICU and 55 in the ward. We designated the thyroid hormone patterns as consistent with NTIS, thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism. RESULTS: A NTIS pattern was encountered in 60% of ICU and 36% of ward patients, with similar frequencies between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (46.0% vs 46.8%, P = NS). A thyrotoxicosis pattern was observed in 14.6% SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients vs 7.7% in ICU negative (P = NS) and, overall in 8.8% of SARS-CoV-2 positive vs 7.4% of negative patients. In these patients, thyroglobulin levels were similar to those with normal thyroid function or NTIS. The hypothyroidism pattern was rare. CONCLUSIONS: NTIS pattern is common and relates to the severity of disease rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection. A thyrotoxicosis pattern is less frequently observed with similar frequency between patients with and without COVID-19. It is suggested that thyroid hormone monitoring in COVID-19 should not differ from other critically ill patients.","output":"Thyroid hormone alterations in critically and non-critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). It was initially detected in Wuhan, China and spread to other cities of China and all countries. It has caused many deaths and the number of infections became greater than 18 million as of 5 August 2020. This study aimed to analyze the situation of COVID-19 in Thailand and the challenging disease control by employing a dynamic model to determine prevention approaches. We employed a statistical technique to analyze the ambient temperature influencing the cases. We found that temperature was significantly associated with daily infected cases (p-value <0.01). The SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infectious and Recovered) dynamic approach and moving average estimation were used to forecast the daily infected and cumulative cases until 16 June as a base run analysis using STELLA dynamic software and statistical techniques. The movement of people, both in relation to local (Thai people) and foreign travel (both Thai and tourists), played a significant role in the spread of COVID-19 in Thailand. Enforcing a state of emergency and regulating social distancing were the key factors in reducing the growth rate of the disease. The SEIR model reliably predicted the actual infected cases, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.8. In case of moving average approach, RMSE values were 0.21, 0.21, and 0.35 for two, three and five days, respectively. The previous records were used as input for prediction that caused lower values of RMSE. Two-days and three-days moving averages gave the better results than SEIR model. The SEIR model is suitable for longer period prediction, whereas the moving average approach is suitable for short term prediction.

Previous studies have suggested a role for both N and hnRNP-A1 proteins in MHV RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether the two proteins can interact with each other. Here we employed a series of methods to determine their interactions both in vitro and in vivo. Both N and hnRNP-A1 genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and their interactions were determined with a GST-binding assay. Results showed that N protein directly and specifically interacted with hnRNP-A1 in vitro. To dissect the protein-binding domain on the N protein, 15 deletion constructs were made by PCR and expressed as GST fusion proteins. Two hnRNP-A1-binding sites were identified on N protein: site A is located at amino acids 1 to 292 and site B at amino acids 392 to 455. In addition, we found that N protein interacted with itself and that the self-interacting domain coincided with site A but not with site B. Using a fluorescence double-staining technique, we showed that N protein colocalized with hnRNP-A1 in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region, of MHV-infected cells, where viral RNA replication/transcription occurs. The N protein and hnRNP-A1 were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates of MHV-infected cells either by an N- or by an hnRNP-A1-specific monoclonal antibody, indicating a physical interaction between N and hnRNP-A1 proteins. Furthermore, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that N protein interacted with hnRNP-A1 in vivo. These results thus establish that MHV N protein interacts with hnRNP-A1 both in vitro and in vivo.","output":"The Nucleocapsid Protein of Coronavirus Mouse Hepatitis Virus Interacts with the Cellular Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1 in Vitro and in Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world in a short period of time and with a heterogeneous pattern.

The datasets collected from diverse sources were geocoded to make it geospatially compatible. A three-tiered framework was proposed to practically realize the impact of COVID-19 in a cartographic fashion.

Not much is known about the changes in public responses to containment measures from the initial outbreak to resurgence. Monitoring public responses is crucial to inform policy measures to prepare for COVID-19 resurgence. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess and compare public responses to containment measures during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: We curated all COVID-19-related posts from Sina Weibo (China's version of Twitter) during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in Beijing, China. With a Python script, we constructed subsets of Weibo posts focusing on 3 containment measures: lockdown, the test-trace-isolate strategy, and suspension of gatherings. The Baidu open-source sentiment analysis model and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, a widely used machine learning algorithm, were used to assess public engagement, sentiments, and frequently discussed topics on each containment measure. RESULTS: A total of 8,985,221 Weibo posts were curated. In China, the containment measures evolved from a complete lockdown for the general population during the initial outbreak to a more targeted response strategy for high-risk populations during COVID-19 resurgence. Between the initial outbreak and resurgence, the average daily proportion of Weibo posts with negative sentiments decreased from 57% to 47% for the lockdown, 56% to 51% for the test-trace-isolate strategy, and 55% to 48% for the suspension of gatherings. Among the top 3 frequently discussed topics on lockdown measures, discussions on containment measures accounted for approximately 32% in both periods, but those on the second-most frequently discussed topic shifted from the expression of negative emotions (11%) to its impacts on daily life or work (26%). The public expressed a high level of panic (21%) during the initial outbreak but almost no panic (1%) during resurgence. The more targeted test-trace-isolate measure received the most support (60%) among all 3 containment measures in the initial outbreak, and its support rate approached 90% during resurgence. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the initial outbreak, the public expressed less engagement and less negative sentiments on containment measures and were more supportive toward containment measures during resurgence. Targeted test-trace-isolate strategies were more acceptable to the public. Our results indicate that when COVID-19 resurges, more targeted test-trace-isolate strategies for high-risk populations should be promoted to balance pandemic control and its impact on daily life and the economy.","output":"Comparison of Public Responses to Containment Measures During the Initial Outbreak and Resurgence of COVID-19 in China: Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a pandemic disease of which the termination is not yet predictable.

We reviewed and analysed the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory features involving these cases. Age-tratification analysis was also implemented. RESULTS We analysed 96 confirmed cases. The patients had a mean age of 43 years, with six patients younger than 18 years and 14 patients older than 60 years. No significant gender difference was discovered. Co-morbidities were commonly observed in patients aged over 40 years. Twenty eight of the patients had travelled from Wuhan City, and 51 patients were infected through close contact. Familial clusters accounted for 48 of the cases. The mean incubation time was 7 days, and the symptoms were mainly fever, cough, fatigue, and sore throat. Lymphocytopenia was observed predominantly in patients aged over 60 years. Fifty five patients presented with bilateral pulmonary lesions. The radiological changes were typically distributed in the subpleural area, and pleural effusion rarely occurred.

We performed a retrospective case series analysis of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the hospital because of pneumonia. We recorded history, clinical parameters and medications. LUS was performed and scored in a standardized fashion by experienced operators, with evaluation of up to 12 lung fields, reporting especially on B-lines and consolidations. Results. We included 96 patients, 58.3% men, with a mean age of 65.9 years. Patients with a high-risk quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) were older and had worse outcomes, especially for the need for high-flow oxygen. B-lines and consolidations were located mainly in the lower posterior lung fields. LUS patterns for B-lines and consolidations were significantly worse in all lung fields among patients with high versus low qCSI. B-lines and consolidations were worse in the intermediate disease stage, from day 7 to 13 after onset of symptoms. While consolidations correlated more with inflammatory biomarkers, B-lines correlated more with end-organ damage, including extrapulmonary involvement. Conclusions. LUS patterns provide a comprehensive evaluation of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia that correlated with severity and dynamically reflect disease stage. LUS patterns may reflect different pathophysiological processes related to inflammation or tissue damage; consolidations may represent a more specific sign of localized disease, whereas B-lines seem to be also dependent upon generalized illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Lung Ultrasound Patterns and Clinical-Laboratory Correlates during COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Retrospective Study from North East Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we consider a single server queueing model with under general bulk service rule with infinite upper bound on the batch size which we call group clearance.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pretreated mCRC were centrally prescreened for MSS status and MGMT silencing (ie, lack of MGMT expression by immunohistochemistry plus MGMT methylation by pyrosequencing). Eligible patients received two priming cycles of oral temozolomide 150 mg/sqm once daily, days 1-5, once every 4 weeks (first treatment part) followed, in absence of progression, by its combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 8 weeks and nivolumab 480 mg once every 4 weeks (second treatment part). The primary end point was the 8-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate calculated from enrollment in patients who started the second treatment part, with  4 out of 27 subjects progression-free by the 8-month time point as decision rule. RESULTS: Among 716 prescreened patients, 204 (29%) were molecularly eligible and 135 started the first treatment part. Among these, 102 (76%) were discontinued because of death or disease progression on temozolomide priming, whereas 33 patients (24%) who achieved disease control started the second treatment part and represented the final study population. After a median follow-up of 23.1 months (interquartile range, 14.9-24.6 months), 8-month PFS rate was 36%.

Real-time PCR and western blotting revealed that NEAT1 and ARHGAP26 were upregulated, and miR-1277-5p was downregulated in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH cells in a certain of concentration- and time- dependent manner. MPP+ induced apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells, as evidenced by decreased cell viability and Bcl-2 expression, and elevated apoptosis rate and levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, which were examined by MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blotting. Moreover, commercial assay kits indicated that inflammatory response and oxidative stress were provoked in response to MPP+, due to promoted contents of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-, malondialdehyde, and lactate dehydrogenase, accompanied with suppressed superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels. Notably, MPP+-induced apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress in SK-N-SH cells were mitigated by NEAT1 knockdown and/or miR-1277-5p overexpression.

There is no trusted drug against the virus; hence, efforts are on discovering novel inhibitors for the virus. The entry of a SARS-CoV-2 virus particle into a host cell is initiated by its spike glycoprotein and host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interaction. Spike glycoprotein domains, namely, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Heptad Repeat (HR) domains, are essential for this activity. We have studied the impact of mutations such as A348T, N354D, D364Y, G476S, V483A, S494D in the RBD (319-591), and S939F, S940T, T941A, S943P (912-984) in the HR1 domains of spike glycoprotein. Summarily, we utilized the computational screening algorithms to rank the deleterious, damaging and disease-associated spike glycoprotein mutations. Subsequently, to understand the changes in conformation, flexibility and function of the spike glycoprotein mutants, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. The computational predictions and analysis of the MD trajectories suggest that the RBD and HR1 mutations induce significant phenotypic effects on the pre-binding spike glycoprotein structure, which are presumably consequential to its binding to the receptor and provides lead to design inhibitors against the binding.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

These plans' implementation was part of the usual logic of post-marketing surveillance of new and innovative health products. It was especially adapted to the context of post-marketing monitoring of drugs developed according to the usual scientific quality standards but in an accelerated schedule. In Europe, the reinforced surveillance system relies on the complementary strengths of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. If the performances of pharmacovigilance monitoring are incomparable for the detection of safety signals relating to rare events of atypical presentation, it needs to be completed with pharmacoepidemiology activities for more common events, either multifactorial or frequently classified as idiopathic. The pharmacoepidemiological monitoring developed in Europe was elaborated before the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccines where marketed, taking into account the lessons learned from the vaccination campaign against 2009 A (H1N1) influenza. It includes numerous academic studies as well as studies performed within vaccines risk management plans.

Although mechanistically similar, PutAs vary widely in domain architecture, oligomeric state, and quaternary structure, and these variations represent different structural solutions to the problem of sequestering a reactive metabolite. Here, we studied PutA from Corynebacterium freiburgense (CfPutA), which belongs to the uncharacterized 3B class of PutAs. A 2.7 ? resolution crystal structure showed the canonical arrangement of PRODH, l-glutamate--semialdehyde dehydrogenase, and C-terminal domains, including an extended interdomain tunnel associated with substrate channeling. The structure unexpectedly revealed a novel open conformation of the PRODH active site, which is interpreted to represent the non-activated conformation, an elusive form of PutA that exhibits suboptimal channeling. Nevertheless, CfPutA exhibited normal substrate-channeling activity, indicating that it isomerizes into the active state under assay conditions. Sedimentation-velocity experiments provided insight into the isomerization process, showing that CfPutA dimerizes in the presence of a proline analog and NAD+ These results are consistent with the morpheein model of enzyme hysteresis, in which substrate binding induces conformational changes that promote assembly of a high-activity oligomer. Finally, we used domain deletion analysis to investigate the function of the C-terminal domain.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the extent, nature and clinical impact of the use of telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it with the data in the same period of the 2 years before the outbreak. METHODS: We used deidentified electronic health records routinely collected from two UK mental health Foundation Trusts (Oxford Health (OHFT) and Southern Health (SHFT)) between January and September in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We considered three outcomes: (1) service activity, (2) in-person versus remote modalities of consultation and (3) clinical outcomes using Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) data. HoNOS data were collected from two cohorts of patients (cohort 1: patients with 1 HoNOS assessment each year in 2018, 2019 and 2020; cohort 2: patients with 1 HoNOS assessment each year in 2019 and 2020), and analysed in clusters using superclasses (namely, psychotic, non-psychotic and organic), which are used to assess overall healthcare complexity in the National Health Service. All statistical analyses were done in Python. FINDINGS: Mental health service activity in 2020 increased in all scheduled community appointments (by 15.4% and 5.6% in OHFT and SHFT, respectively). Remote consultations registered a 3.5-fold to 6-fold increase from February to June 2020 (from 4685 to a peak of 26 245 appointments in OHFT and from 7117 to 24 987 appointments in SHFT), with post-lockdown monthly averages of 23 030 and 22 977 remote appointments/month in OHFT and SHFT, respectively. Video consultations comprised up to one-third of total telepsychiatric services per month from April to September 2020.

In our university free clinic, medical students provide healthy lifestyle counselling using shared decision making to each patient at every clinic visit. OBJECTIVE Improve the efficacy of behaviour change interventions via increased patient responsiveness and adherence. METHODS The needs assessment demonstrated a subpar patient response rate to check-ins regarding behavioural change goals. In the first and second interventions, check-in message structure and contact schedule were varied to maximize patient responsiveness and goal achievement. RESULTS In the needs assessment, 58% of patients responded to follow-ups and 58% of patients accomplished their goal. The first intervention cycle resulted in an improvement of responsiveness to 70% and accomplishment of goals to 59%. The second intervention cycle resulted in an improvement of responsiveness to 78% and accomplishment of goals to 74%.

It has prompted regulatory authorities to consider new ways of working and introduced, amongst others, remote inspections to validate the integrity of the regulatory data submitted by companies; evaluate the quality of production and manufacturing sites, and to ensure the conformity with Good Regulatory Practices with the overall goal of guaranteeing patient safety during the crisis. Method We summarize and discuss remote inspection guidelines and other related information made available by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (Japan), the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK), and the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). We also analyse the impact of the pandemic on inspections conducted by the inspectorates of the EMA and the US FDA. Findings The regulatory authorities that we studied all recognized the importance of implementing regulatory policies on remote inspections in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote inspection guidelines from the five selected regulatory authorities aimed at mitigating the impact of pandemic but, while providing valuable advice to the pharma companies and being similar in intent, were not always aligned in terms of approach and solutions. Implications On-site inspections are likely to continue to be the norm and preferred standard for the foreseeable future. But the health authorities will need to further adopt a risk-based inspection approach and stimulate the increased uptake of inspection reliance as proposed by the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme not to overwhelm the pharma companies with repeat and redundant inspections. Remote inspections have proven to be a novel inspection tool, but it is important for health authorities to align on their approach on remote inspections in terms of methods applied and documentation requested.","output":"The utility of remote inspections during the COVID-19 health emergency and in the post-pandemic setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid and reliable health data on SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection among pregnant individuals are needed to understand the influence of the virus on maternal health and child development, yet the validity of self\\\\reported COVID\\\\19 testing and diagnosis remains unknown.

Although the field of asylum medicine is growing, access to these evaluations is still inadequate, particularly for those in United States immigration detention or other forms of custody, such as under the U.S. Migrant Protection Protocols or Remain in Mexico policy. Given advances in telehealth in recent years and growing evidence of similar outcomes with in-person management, it seems prudent to examine whether remote modalities may also be effective for conducting mental health asylum evaluations in hard-to-reach populations. METHODS: We analyzed the responses of 12 U.S. clinicians who conducted 25 cross-border remote mental health evaluations with clients in Mexico prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and completed a post-evaluation survey regarding their impressions and experiences of the remote encounter. Data were coded through a process of thematic analysis. RESULTS: The average evaluation time was 2.3 h, slightly shorter than might be expected from an in-person encounter. Five themes emerged from the coding process: rapport building, achieving overall goal, comparison of in-person vs. remote, technical issues, and coordination. Clinicians encountered a number of challenges including technical difficulties and a decreased ability to establish rapport. Nearly uniformly, however, clinicians noted that despite difficulties, they were able achieve the goals of the evaluation, including rapport building and diagnosis.

Our purpose was to evaluate whether mortality can be predicted from either of two lung ultrasound scoring systems (LUSS) as well as the potential association between lung lesions visualised by LUS and blood biomarkers. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study on 45 patients aged > 70 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. LUS was carried out at admission and on day 7, when the clinical course was favourable or earlier in case of worsening. Disease severity was scored by means of LUSS in 8 (LUSS8) and in 12 (LUSS12) quadrants. LUS and blood draw for inflammatory marker analysis were performed at the same time. RESULTS: LUSS8 vs LUSS12 predicted mortality in 93.3% vs 91.1% of the cases; their associated odds ratios (OR) were 1.67 (95% CI 1.20C2.31) and 1.57 (95% CI 1.10C2.23), respectively.

All groups were treated for 10 days. Blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical, molecular, and histological analyses. Treatment with CP led to deformations in the liver tissue that were associated with higher liver function markers (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase). Additionally, a disturbance in the redox balance was observed after CP exposure, as indicated by increased levels of oxidants, including malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, and the decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants, including glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. At the molecular level, CP treatment resulted in reduced expression of the Nrf2/ARE pathway and other genes related to this pathway, including NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit. CP also led to a hyper-inflammatory response in hepatic tissue, with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interlukin-1beta, and upregulation of nitric oxide synthase 2. CP also enhanced the immunoreactivity of the profibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta, in liver tissue. Upregulation of caspase 3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 were also observed in response to CP treatment. Treatment with allicin reversed the molecular, biochemical, and histological changes that occurred with CP exposure.

In Argentina, prevalence values of Cryptosporidium spp. and other enteropathogens such as group A rotavirus (RVA), bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC, endotoxin STa+), have been independently studied in different regions. However, an integrative epidemiological investigation on large-scale farms has not been carried out. In this study, fecal samples (n = 908) were randomly collected from diarrheic and healthy calves from 42 dairy farms, and analyzed for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp., RVA, BCoV, ETEC (STa+) and Salmonella spp. In all sampled dairy farms, dams had been vaccinated against rotavirus and gram-negative bacteria to protect calves against neonatal diarrhea. The proportion of calves shedding Cryptosporidium spp., RVA, and BCoV in animals younger than 20 days of age were 29.8%, 12.4% and 6.4%, and in calves aged between 21 and 90 days, 5.6%, 3.9%, and 1.8%, respectively. ETEC was absent in the younger, and occurred only sporadically in the older group (0.9%), whereas Salmonella spp. was absent in both. The observed sporadic finding or even absence of bacterial pathogens might be explained by the frequent use of parenteral antibiotics in 25.3% and 6.5% of the younger and the older group of calves, respectively, within 2 days prior to sampling and/or vaccination of dams against gram-negative bacteria. Diarrhea was observed in 28.8% (95% CI, 24.7-32.8%) of the younger calves and 11.7% (95% CI, 9.1-15.5%) of the older calves.

Based on its high prevalence and OR, our results strongly suggest that Cryptosporidium spp. is the principal causative factor for diarrhea in the group of neonatal calves, whereas RVA seems to play a secondary role in the etiology of diarrhea in the studied farms, with about three-times lower prevalence and a half as high OR. Furthermore, a coinfection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. and RVA of 3.7% was observed in the group of younger calves, which strengthens the assumption that these events are independent.

Hence, this study aimed to investigate the median recovery time from COVID-19, and its predictors among patients admitted to Amhara regional state COVID-19 treatment centers, Ethiopia. Methods. A facility-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted at Amhara regional state COVID-19 treatment centers from 13 March 2020 through 30 March 2021. Data were entered using EpiData version 3.1, and STATA version 14 was used for analysis. A KaplanCMeier curve was used to estimate survival time, and the Cox regression model was fitted to identify independent predictors. P value with 95% CI for the hazard ratio was used for testing the significance at alpha 0.05. Results. Six hundred twenty-two cases followed, and 540 observations developed an event at the end of the follow-up. The median time to recovery was 11 days with an interquartile range of 9C14 days. Most of the patients were recovered from COVID-19 between days seven and fourteen. In the first six days of admission, only 4.2% of cases had recovered, but by day 14, 73.8% had recovered.

The most notable changes include limiting on-site anatomy laboratory experiences and increasing virtual didactic anatomy sessions. By integrating a virtual 3D anatomy platform into a prosection driven lab curriculum, the possible quality impacts to anatomy medical education may be lessened and even improved.3-9 Materials and Methods First-year medical students at HWCOM (CO 2024) participated. Groups of 4-10 students rotated through six 20-minute stations. Two of the six 20-minute stations were facilitated by a fourth year medical teaching assistant (TA). In each station led by the TA, the TA utilized a didactic teaching model to teach select gastrointestinal and genitourinary anatomy and pathology topics using a prosected cadaver and prosected 3D virtual anatomy models on the Complete Anatomy application. The first ten to fifteen minutes of teaching involved using the prosected cadaver and the final five to ten minutes involved the 3D virtual prosected models. The 3D virtual prosected models were used to further explain anatomical features or pathologies identified on the cadaver. Prior to or after the station was completed, students rotated at the four 20-minute self-learning stations that contained plastinated models, plastic models, or wet organ specimens of gastrointestinal anatomy. At these stations, students completed a worksheet based on the lab objectives for gastrointestinal and genitourinary anatomy. A five-question end-of-course survey (5-point Likert Scale) will be administered to all first-year medical students who participated in the wet lab session. Results We expect the results of our end-of-course survey to support our hypothesis that the integrated didactic anatomy teaching model would improve first year medical students? understanding of the course material. Additionally, we expect the students to recommend incorporating the Complete Anatomy app with the prosected models for the first-year anatomy lab curriculum. Final data analysis of the variables will be completed after obtaining IRB exemption. Conclusion and Significance/Implication Despite the limitations to human anatomy medical education due to the COVID pandemic, we believe this novel integrated virtual 3D and cadaver prosection approach to the traditional anatomy curriculum will not only lessen the impacts to quality but also improve the baseline quality of anatomy medical education, become a permanent inclusion within our institution's curriculum, and serve as a model for novel approaches to first-year anatomy curriculum.","output":"Integration of 3D Anatomy Platforms and Cadaveric Prosections in the Age of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that emerged from Wuhan, China. Besides pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the disease leads to multisystem involvement in the form of myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoxemic brain injury, acute liver, and renal function impairment. There are also reports of cutaneous lesions in form of urticarial and maculopapular rashes, chilblain like fingers and toes (covid feet), livedoid vasculopathy, and chicken-pox like or varicelliform vesicles. Clinically, many of these skin lesions are likely secondary to occlusion of small to medium blood vessels due to microthrombi formation or due to viral laden antigen-antibody immune complexes; and same explanation may hold true for possible hypoxemic injury simultaneously occurring in other vital organs like lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. The histopathology, immunoflorescence and RT-PCR analysis of skin biopsies can provide useful insights for ascertaining the pathogenesis of this complex viral syndrome. Apparently, it is interplay of disarmed cellular immunity and over-activated humoral immunity that culminates in end-organ changes. The morbidity and mortality can be significantly reduced by upgrading the cellular immunity and downgrading the humoral response; along with prevention of hypoxemic and reperfusion injuries by using antivirals, immunomodulators, antioxidants, anti-platelets, and anticoagulants in judicious and phased manner.","output":"Unraveling the mystery of Covid-19 cytokine storm: From skin to organ systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease outbreak in December 2019 rapidly spread around the world with profound effects on healthcare systems. In March 2020, all elective surgery and elective outpatient clinics were cancelled in our institution, a regional hospital in Northern New South Wales, Australia. With regard to orthopaedic fracture clinics, a telehealth system was implemented on an emergency basis for patient and staff safety to prevent disease transmission. The aim of our study was to investigate whether rapid implementation of telehealth for orthopaedic fracture clinics resulted in an increase in complications. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all patients with orthopaedic fracture clinic appointments at a regional New South Wales hospital between 17 March and 8 May 2020 was undertaken. There were 191 patients, including 390 appointments of which 23.1% were conducted via telehealth, namely by phone call. Complications requiring phone calls to the orthopaedic team, presentations to the emergency department, admission to hospital or return to theatre, were recorded. RESULTS: There was no increase in complications following emergent implementation of telehealth for orthopaedic fracture clinic follow-up in our institution. Patients in the telehealth group were significantly older than those in the clinic group. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that application of telehealth fracture clinics in a regional Australian setting can be achieved without increasing complication rates and can be used to formulate a rapid telehealth implementation plan if a similar scenario occurs in the future.","output":"Safe and rapid implementation of telemedicine fracture clinics: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this study was to establish how reliable FISH CIC analysis using an IVD (in vitro diagnostic) commercial probe is.

This review is intended to provide a broad view of how nutrient inputs-from fertilizer and CAFOs-as well as atmospheric NH3 and greenhouse gas emissions, are changing regionally within the US and how these changes compare with nutrient inputs from human wastewater. Use of commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizer in the US, which now exceeds 12,000,000 metric tonnes (MT) continues to increase, at a rate of 60,000 MT per year, while that of phosphorus (P) has remained nearly constant over the past decade at around 1,800,000 MT. The number of CAFOs in the US has increased nearly 10% since 2012, driven largely by a near 13% increase in hog production. The annualized inventory of cattle, dairy cows, hogs, broiler chickens and turkeys is approximately 8.7 billion, but CAFOs are highly regionally concentrated by animal sector. Country-wide, N applied by fertilizer is about threefold greater than manure N inputs, but for P these inputs are more comparable. Total manure inputs now exceed 4,000,000 MT as N and 1,400,000 MT as P. For both N and P, inputs and proportions vary widely by US region. The waste from hog and dairy operations is mainly held in open lagoons that contribute to NH3 and greenhouse gas (as CH4 and N2O) emissions. Emissions of NH3 from animal waste in 2019 were estimated at > 4,500,000 MT. Emissions of CH4 from manure management increased 66% from 1990 to 2017 (that from dairy increased 134%, cattle 9.6%, hogs 29% and poultry 3%), while those of N2O increased 34% over the same time period (dairy 15%, cattle 46%, hogs 58%, and poultry 14%). Waste from CAFOs contribute substantially to nutrient pollution when spread on fields, often at higher N and P application rates than those of commercial fertilizer. Managing the runoff associated with fertilizer use has improved with best management practices, but reducing the growing waste from CAFO operations is essential if eutrophication and its effects on fresh and marine waters-namely hypoxia and harmful algal blooms (HABs)-are to be reduced.","output":"From hogs to HABs: impacts of industrial farming in the US on nitrogen and phosphorus and greenhouse gas pollution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy was one of the worst-affected European countries The rapid surge of cases and the limited capacity of intensive care unit departments have posed a serious threat to the Italian national health system In this paper we describe the first response and the main measures carried by Italian policy makers, as coordinated by a governmental committee of public health experts, which have succeeded in preventing the pandemic from turning into a disaster Early closure of the school, quarantine measures and lockdown were put in place and the response of the population has been good overall Despite the Italian health care system of universal coverage is considered the second-best in the world, during phase 1, the Italian decentralisation and fragmentation of health services probably restricted timely interventions and effectiveness In northern Italy, Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Piedmont, and Veneto, which reported most of the Italian cases, carried out different strategies against COVID-19, with great differences in testing, quarantine, and public health procedures The improvement of the epidemiological situation has allowed an easing of the restrictive measures, with a progressive restarting of work activities The government and technical-scientific bodies have prepared health strategies to support a possible second epidemic wave in the autumn","output":"Early COVID-19 pandemic response in Italy: Pros and cons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pannexin1 (PANX1) is a ubiquitously expressed, channel-forming protein found in a number of tissues thoughout the body (e.g. lung, vasculature, liver, central nervous system, immune system) that is important in many key physiological and immune responses.

Methods: In 104 patients, alexithymia was evaluated with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), depression with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and psychopathology with the Brief Symptom Inventory SCL-90 (SCL90). A psychopathology index that combines information from the BDI and SCL90 scales was constructed and the performance of the index with alexithymia was examined. Results: Female patients and active smokers score higher on BDI and SCL90 scales. Overweight patients tend to score arithmetically higher. The psychopathology index developed correlates significantly with age, DIF, DDF, and TAS-20. DIF, DDF, and TAS-20 are significant predictors of the psychopathology index.

In previous studies we could demonstrate that RIG-I activation induces an effective protective innate immunity against H1N1 influenza infection in vitro and in vivo. Here we analyzed the effect of prophylactic activation of RIG-I by its specific ligand 5'-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA) or of typeI/III interferons on SARS-CoV-2 infection in air-liquid interface cultivated primary nasal epithelial cells (PNEC) and Caco cells. MAVS-/- (downstream of RIG-I) deficient Caco-cells were used as a control. Viral replication was analyzed by plaque assay and qPCR. Furthermore, interferon-stimulated genes and ACE2/TMPRSS2 were determined on the transcriptional level and IP-10 protein was quantified in supernatants by ELISA. Upon transfection with 3pRNA at 6h prior to infection, Caco WT cells produced more than 8000 pg/ml IP-10. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 significantly decreased the average of 3pRNA-induced IP-10 production to 5000 pg/ml, whereas type I/III interferon and/or SARS-CoV-2 infection alone did not lead to relevant IP-10 production. 3pRNA pretreatment of Caco WT cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced virus replication at 48 h by an average of 91,4% . Pretreatment with type I and III interferon had little effect on virus replication. Analysis of viral RNA in RIG-I-pretreated cells revealed an average reduction of SARS-CoV-2- RNA by 40-fold. Results were also achieved in PNEC showing similar levels in reduction of viral replication and high levels of IP-10 production.

Three phenotypes were derived by non-supervised clustering analysis from whole population and classified as (A: severe, B: critical and C: life-threatening). The primary outcome was ICU mortality. We performed a Multivariate analysis after propensity score full matching (PS), Cox proportional hazards (CPH), Cox covariate time interaction (TIR), Weighted Cox Regression (WCR) and Fine-Gray analysis(sHR) to assess the impact of corticosteroids on ICU mortality according to the whole population and distinctive patient clinical phenotypes. Results: : A total of 2,017 patients were analyzed, 1171(58%) with corticosteroids. After PS, corticosteroids were shown not to be associated with ICU mortality (OR:1.0,95%CI:0.98-1.15).

We applied a systematic approach based on homology detection to create a comprehensive catalog of accessory proteins encoded by CoVs. Our analyses grouped accessory proteins into 379 orthogroups and 12 super-groups. No orthogroup was shared by the four CoV genera and very few were present in all or most viruses in the same genus, reflecting the dynamic evolution of CoV genomes. We observed differences in the distribution of accessory proteins in CoV genera. Alphacoronaviruses harbored the largest diversity of accessory ORFs, deltacoronaviruses the smallest. However, the average number of accessory proteins per genome was highest in betacoronaviruses. Analysis of the evolutionary history of some orthogroups indicated that the different CoV genera adopted similar evolutionary strategies. Thus, alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses acquired phosphodiesterases and spike-like accessory proteins independently, whereas horizontal gene transfer from reoviruses endowed betacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses with fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins. Finally, analysis of accessory ORFs in annotated CoV genomes indicated ambiguity in their naming. This complicates cross-communication among researchers and hinders automated searches of large datasets (e.g., PubMed, GenBank).

We hypothesized that IGI using wire-reinforced silicone (WRS) tube could achieve endotracheal intubation most rapidly and successfully. Methods In 23 emergency physicians, a prospective randomized crossover manikin study was conducted to examine the three intubation techniques using two kinds of endotracheal tubes. The primary outcome was the intubation time. The secondary outcome was the cumulative success rate for each intubation technique. A significant difference was considered when identifying p < 0.05 between two devices or p < 0.017 in post hoc analysis of the comparison among three devices. Results The mean intubation time using IGI was shorter (p < 0.017) than that of using IBRI and MCL in both endotracheal tubes (17.6 vs. 29.3 vs. 20.2 in conventional polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube; 14.6 vs. 27.4 vs. 19.9 in WRS tube; sec). There were no significant (p < 0.05) differences between PVC and WRS tubes for each intubation technique. The intubation time to reach 100% cumulative success rate was also shorter in IGI (p < 0.017) than that in IBRI and MCL in both PVC and WRS tubes. Conclusions IGI was an equally successful and faster technique compared with IBRI or MCL regardless of the use of PVC or WRS tube.

MERS-CoV encodes five accessory proteins. Some of them have been shown to interfere with host antiviral immune response. However, the roles of protein 8b in innate immunity and viral virulence was rarely studied. Here, we introduced individual MERS-CoV accessory protein genes into the genome of an attenuated murine coronavirus (Mouse hepatitis virus, MHV), respectively, and found accessory protein 8b could enhance viral replication in vivo and in vitro and increase the lethality of infected mice. RNA-seq analysis revealed that protein 8b could significantly inhibit type I interferon production (IFN-I) and innate immune response in mice infected with MHV expressing protein 8b. We also found that MERS-CoV protein 8b could initiate from multiple internal methionine sites and at least three protein variants were identified. Residues 1-23 of protein 8b was demonstrated to be responsible for increased virulence in vivo. In addition, the inhibitory effect on IFN-I of protein 8b might not contribute to its virulence enhancement as aa1-23 deletion did not affect IFN-I production in vitro and in vivo. Next, we also found that protein 8b was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi membrane in infected cells, which was disrupted by C-terminal region aa 88-112 deletion. This study will provide new insight into the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Multiple coronaviruses (CoV) cause severe respiratory infections and become global public health threats such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Each coronavirus contains different numbers of accessory proteins which show high variability among different CoVs. Accessory proteins are demonstrated to play essential roles in pathogenesis of CoVs. MERS-CoV contains 5 accessory proteins (protein 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 8b), and deletion of all four accessory proteins (protein 3, 4a, 4b, 5), significantly affects MERS-CoV replication and pathogenesis. However, whether ORF8b also regulates MERS-CoV infection is unknown. Here, we constructed mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) recombinant virus expressing MERS-CoV protein 8b and demonstrated protein 8b could significantly enhance the virulence of MHV, which is mediated by N-terminal domain of protein 8b. This study will shed light on the understanding of pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.","output":"The N-Terminal Region of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Accessory Protein 8b Is Essential for Enhanced Virulence of an Attenuated Murine Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has disproportionately placed women in academic science on the frontlines of domestic and clinical care compared to men.

We examine epidemiological evidence for this VOC having a transmission advantage from several perspectives. First, whole genome sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing provides an indication of changing prevalence of different genetic variants through time. Phylodynamic modelling additionally indicates that genetic diversity of this lineage has changed in a manner consistent with exponential growth. Second, we find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Third, we examine growth trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers at local area level across England, and show that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. Available SGTF data indicate a shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases. Fourth, we assess the association of VOC frequency with independent estimates of the overall SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number through time. Finally, we fit a semi-mechanistic model directly to local VOC and non-VOC case incidence to estimate the reproduction numbers over time for each. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage, with the estimated difference in reproduction numbers between VOC and non-VOC ranging between 0.4 and 0.7, and the ratio of reproduction numbers varying between 1.4 and 1.8. We note that these estimates of transmission advantage apply to a period where high levels of social distancing were in place in England; extrapolation to other transmission contexts therefore requires caution.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in England: Insights from linking epidemiological and genetic data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES No satisfactory biomarkers are currently available to screen for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Due to the similarity of symptoms between the two disease states, patients can be incorrectly diagnosed with the other ailment in areas with limited health resources. There is a dearth of knowledge of co-infection between COVID-19 and malaria from healthcare providers perspective. Hence, this study assessed the ability of primary healthcare workers to diagnose malaria infection correctly from COVID-19 infection. Methods : A multistage sampling technique was used to select health care workers who were directly involved in malaria case management at 261 government-owned primary health facilities in Oyo State. Socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, knowledge & practices, COVID-19 differential diagnosis and challenges that healthcare workers face regarding malaria diagnosis were obtained using a standardized electronic structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted on data collected and significant results were interpreted at a 5% level of significance. Results : A good percentage of the respondents (81.6%, 74.3%) had good knowledge about malaria and COVID-19 infection. However, the knowledge gained did not translate to practice, as majority (86.2%) of respondents had poor malaria diagnosis practices. Practices relating to COVID-19 differential diagnosis in 69.7% of respondents were also poor. Most of the respondents attributed poor practices to the unavailability of Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (mRDT), inadequate training and continuous capacity improvement. Only 12.3% of the respondents had any form of training on malaria diagnosis and treatment in the last five years. Conclusion: Harmonization of regular trainings and continuous on-the job capacity building is essential to improve case identification, diagnosis and management of both ailments.

Most studies have investigated short-term responses of organisms to unrealistically high concentrations of pesticides; however, chronic exposure to persistent low concentrations, which are more likely to occur in the environment, are rarely analyzed. Here, we tested the response of polyps of the Moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita, to environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine and the insecticide chlorpyrifos, individually and in combination, over nine weeks. We hypothesized that exposure to individual pesticides would reduce rates of asexual reproduction and alter polyps' metabolite profiles, and that the results would be more severe when polyps were exposed to the combined pesticides. Polyps survived and reproduced (through budding) in all treatments and no differences among treatments were observed. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy revealed no difference in profiles of polar metabolites of polyps exposed to the individual or combined pesticides.

Published reports cover a wide range of damages, from locomotive dysfunction caused by decreased physical activity to decreased cognitive function and changes in eating and oral functions, and further to decreased opportunities for social participation. Such damage can also lead to worsening of so-called frailty. Under this circumstance, orthopedic surgeons conducted a questionnaire survey to determine the physical changes observed after the start of the COVD-19 self-restraint period. In this article, we report findings of the survey, along with some literature considerations. METHODS: The survey was started two months after the state of emergency in Japan was lifted, July 20 to August 12, 2020 (16 days total). And the analysis was conducted by simple and cross tabulation. RESULTS: Valid responses to the questionnaire were obtained from 12,254 participants. Approximately 40% of the subjects felt a lack of physical strength (Corona stress), with the percentage peaking in high school, in the elderly it remained rather below average. On the other hand, locomotive dysfunction (Corona locomo) increased with age, independent of physical activity, and was not correlated with Corona stress.

At the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), the Office of Population Health and Accountable Care (OPHAC) employs health care navigators to help patients access and benefit from high-value care. In early 2020, facing COVID-19, UCSF leaders asked OPHAC to help patients and employees navigate testing, treatment, tracing, and returning to work protocols. OPHAC established a COVID hotline to route callers to the appropriate resources, but needed to increase the capacity of the navigator workforce. To address this need, OPHAC turned to UCSF's service learning program for undergraduates, the Patient Support Corps (PSC). In this program, UC Berkeley undergraduates earn academic credit in exchange for serving as unpaid patient navigators. In July 2020, OPHAC provided administrative funding for the PSC to recruit and deploy students as COVID hotline navigators. In September 2020, the PSC deployed 20 students collectively representing 2.0 full-time equivalent navigators. After training and observation, and with supervision and escalation pathways, students were able to fill half-day shifts and perform near the level of staff navigators. Key facilitators relevant to success reflected both PSC and OPHAC strengths. The PSC onboards student interns as institutional affiliates, giving them access to key information technology systems, and trains them in privacy and other regulatory requirements so they can work directly with patients. OPHAC strengths included a learning health systems culture that fosters peer mentoring and collaboration. A key challenge was that, even after training, students required around 10 h of supervised practice before being able to take calls independently. As a result, students rolled on to the hotline in waves rather than all at once. Post-COVID, OPHAC is planning to use student navigators for outreach. Meanwhile, the PSC is collaborating with pipeline programs in hopes of offering this internship experience to more students from backgrounds that are under-represented in healthcare. Other campuses in the University of California system are interested in replicating this program.

Seawater desalination accounts for about 61% of global desalination capacity, while brackish water desalination accounts for 30%. Membrane desalination, mainly using reverse osmosis (RO), accounts for ? of global desalination capacity, with the rest mostly used for thermal desalination using multi-stage flash distillation (MSF), and multi-effect distillation (MED). Despite the undeniable role of desalination for securing water supply in areas where natural freshwater supplies are scarce, desalination impacts the natural environment at different aspects. Environmental impacts (EIs) of the desalination process are different and vary significantly according to the nature of the utilized feedwater, the desalination technology in use, and the management of waste brine generated. In this work, the EIs of each desalination technology were thoroughly investigated, with careful consideration given to different feedwater qualities, and various brine management techniques. Although the different aspects of desalination EIs have been extensively studied in the literature, the literature lacks comprehensive reviews and summaries of all the associated EIs.

The budding compartment is thought to be determined by the accumulation of the two heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the Golgi. We recently mapped the retention signal for Golgi localization in one Bunyaviridae member (Uukuniemi virus) to the cytoplasmic tail of G1. We now show that a myc-tagged 81-residue G1 tail peptide expressed in BHK21 cells is efficiently targeted to the Golgi complex and retained there during a 3-h chase. Green-fluorescence protein tagged at either end with this peptide or with a C-terminally truncated 60-residue G1 tail peptide was also efficiently targeted to the Golgi. The 81-residue peptide colocalized with mannosidase II (a medial Golgi marker) and partially with p58 (an intermediate compartment marker) and TGN38 (a trans-Golgi marker). In addition, the 81-residue tail peptide induced the formation of brefeldin A-resistant vacuoles that did not costain with markers for other membrane compartments. Removal of the first 10 N-terminal residues had no effect on the Golgi localization but abolished the vacuolar staining. The shortest peptide still able to become targeted to the Golgi encompassed residues 10 to 40. Subcellular fractionation showed that the 81-residue tail peptide was associated with microsomal membranes. Removal of the two palmitylation sites from the tail peptide did not affect Golgi localization and had only a minor effect on the association with microsomal membranes. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that Golgi retention of the heterodimeric G1-G2 spike protein complex of Uukuniemi virus is mediated by a short region in the cytoplasmic tail of the G1 glycoprotein.","output":"Targeting of a short peptide derived from the cytoplasmic tail of the G1 membrane glycoprotein of Uukuniemi virus (Bunyaviridae) to the Golgi complex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world from every aspect.

Use of new technologies such as virtual and augmented reality are currently under investigation for their potential to provide exciting and engaging activities for older people in residential aged care facilities. However, there is limited evidence on whether these technologies can promote physical activity in a small group setting for people with cognitive impairment. Using mixed methods, we examined the use of a virtual cycling experience in a sample of 10 participants with cognitive impairment living in residential aged care facilities. In a randomised crossover design, participants engaged in a 25-minute, self-paced, facilitated seated virtual cycling experience and a time-matched seated physical activity session in groups of five. All participants completed a brief pre- and post-intervention mood questionnaire. Video analysis was used for both conditions to compare levels of environmental stimulation, apathy and engagement using both the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale and the Engagement of a Person with Dementia Scale. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews following the virtual cycling experience was also performed. No differences were observed between conditions for all outcomes except for environmental stimulation, where there was a lower response in the intervention than the control condition (p = 0.032). This was primarily driven by lower scores for the virtual cycling experience than control in physical accessibility (p = 0.012). Participants reported the virtual cycling experience to be immersive and challenging and reminisced about cycling earlier in life. The activity manager observed that the virtual cycling experience was an overall positive experience and emphasised benefits of safety screening and preparation prior to the activities.

Malaria cases and deaths may increase due to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in malaria-endemic countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This scoping review aims to summarize information on public health-relevant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria situation in SSA. METHODS: Review of publications and manuscripts on preprint servers, in peer-reviewed journals and in grey literature documents from 1 December, 2019 to 9 June, 2021. A structured search was conducted on different databases using predefined eligibility criteria for the selection of articles. RESULTS: A total of 51 papers have been included in the analysis. Modelling papers have predicted a significant increase in malaria cases and malaria deaths in SSA due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many papers provided potential explanations for expected COVID-19 effects on the malaria burden; these ranged from relevant diagnostical and clinical aspects to reduced access to health care services, impaired availability of curative and preventive commodities and medications, and effects on malaria prevention campaigns. Compared to previous years, fewer country reports provided data on the actual number of malaria cases and deaths in 2020, with mixed results. While highly endemic countries reported evidence of decreased malaria cases in health facilities, low endemic countries reported overall higher numbers of malaria cases and deaths in 2020.

Through medical records review, we confirmed that patients were positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or for COVID-19 exposure history within the 4 weeks before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS A total of 33 patients with severe MIS-C were included (21 male) with a median age of 9 years. The most common signs and symptoms during disease course were fever (100%) and abdominal pain (75.5%). Clinical features of 63.6% patients were consistent with Kawasaki disease/Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and 36.4% were consistent with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Myocardial dysfunction and/or coronary artery abnormalities were detected in 18 patients during the PICU stay. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were given to 33 patients. Anakinra was administered to 23 patients (69.6%). There was a significant increase in lymphocyte and platelet counts and a significant decrease in ferritin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin levels at the end of the first week of treatment in patients who were given biological therapy.

Several types of online mental health services were widely implemented for college students during the outbreak. This study investigated the relationship between college students mental health status and psychological help-seeking behavior to test the phases-decision-making model (PDM). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among college students in Guangdong Province using an online platform. In total, 4,164 students were assigned to the counseling group or non-counseling group according to whether they had sought psychological help because of the COVID-19 outbreak; the groups were matched based on age, sex, and grade. Demographics, perceived mental health, and experience with seeking psychological help were recorded. Fear, depression, and trauma were assessed by the COVID-19 Fear Screening Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Impact of Event Scale-6. RESULTS: The fear, depression, and trauma scores were significantly higher in the counseling group than in the non-counseling group (P(s) < 0.001). Fear (OR = 1.27, p < 0.001), depression (OR = 1.02, p = 0.032), trauma (OR = 1.08, p < 0.001), poor perceived mental health status (OR = 3.61, p = 0.001), and experience with seeking psychological help (OR = 7.06, p < 0.001) increased the odds of seeking psychological help. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, the rate of psychological help-seeking was still low, and college students in poor psychological condition sought psychological counseling more.

Diverting FW into the sewer system is considered promising to tackle the FW issue. However, the transformation of FW in sewers and its impact on the sewer process have not received adequate attention due to the overlooked sewer networks. In this study, a laboratory-scale sewer reactor system was established to investigate the transformation of FW and the production of sulfide and methane under anaerobic conditions. The transformation of FW in the sewer reactor could result in an increase in the substrate level through hydrolyzing and converting biodegradable substances into preferred substrates. Moreover, the generated substrates from the addition of FW were preferable for the metabolism of key microbes in sewer biofilms. As a result, methane production from the sewer reactor could be enhanced from the addition of FW, whereas sulfide production was not affected at a low sulfate concentration. The findings of this study suggest that the diversion of FW may exert an adverse impact on sewers and the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emission.

Itaconic acid is a naturally occurring compound with a Michael acceptor moiety, a key structural feature in several anticancer and antiviral drugs, responsible for the covalent binding of a drug to the cysteine residue of a specific protein. Aromatic parts of the hybrids also come from the substances reported as anticancer or antiviral agents. The synthetic route employed to access the amido-ester hybrids 2C13 used monomethyl itaconate or monomethyl itaconyl chloride and corresponding amines as the starting materials. Dimers 14 and 15 with two aminoindole or mefloquine moieties were prepared from itaconic acid and corresponding amino derivative, using standard coupling conditions (HATU/DIEA). All hybrids exerted anticancer effects in vitro against almost all the tumour cell lines that were evaluated (MCF-7, HCT 116, H460, LN-229, Capan-1, DND-41, HL-60, K-562, Z-138). Solid tumour cells were, in general, more responsive than the haematological cancer cells. The MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line appeared the most sensitive.

Screening is currently dependent on the interpretation of images captured by trained technicians. Inherent barriers of accessibility and affordability with this approach impede widespread success of retinopathy screening programs. Herein, we report our observations on the potential of a novel approach, Selfie Fundus Imaging (SFI), to enhance diabetic retinopathy screening. METHODS: The study was undertaken over a two-month period during COVID 19 lockdown. 60 diabetic patients participated in the study. Retinal images were captured using three different approaches, handheld smartphone-based photographs captured by patients themselves after a short video-assisted training session (SFI group), and smartphone-based photographs captured by a trained technician and photographs taken on desktop conventional digital fundus camera (Gold standard). Sensitivity and kappa statistics was determined for retinopathy and macular oedema grading. FINDINGS: Mean age of the study participants was 52.4 years  9.8 years and 78% were men. Of 120 images captured using SFI, 90% were centred-gradable, 8% were decentred-gradable and 2% were ungradable. 82% patients captured the image within a minute (majority by 31C45 s). The sensitivity of SFI to detect diabetic retinopathy was 88.39%. Agreement between SFI grading and standard fundus photograph grading was 85.86% with substantial kappa (0.77). For the detection of diabetic macular oedema, the agreement between SFI images and standard images was 93.67, with almost perfect kappa (0.91). CONCLUSION: Fundus images were captured by patients using SFI without major difficulty and were comparable to images taken by trained specialist. With greater penetrance, advances, and availability of mobile photographic technology, we believe that SFI would positively impact the success of diabetic retinopathy screening programs by breaking the barriers of availability, accessibility, and affordability. SFI could ensure continuation of screening schedules for diabetic retinopathy, even in the face a highly contagious pandemic.","output":"Selfie fundus imaging for diabetic retinopathy screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The threat from ransomware continues to grow both in the number of affected victims as well as the cost incurred by the people and organisations impacted in a successful attack. In the majority of cases, once a victim has been attacked there remain only two courses of action open to them; either pay the ransom or lose their data. One common behaviour shared between all crypto ransomware strains is that at some point during their execution they will attempt to encrypt the users' files. Previous research Penrose et al. (2013); Zhao et al. (2011) has highlighted the difficulty in differentiating between compressed and encrypted files using Shannon entropy as both file types exhibit similar values. One of the experiments described in this paper shows a unique characteristic for the Shannon entropy of encrypted file header fragments. This characteristic was used to differentiate between encrypted files and other high entropy files such as archives. This discovery was leveraged in the development of a file classification model that used the differential area between the entropy curve of a file under analysis and one generated from random data. When comparing the entropy plot values of a file under analysis against one generated by a file containing purely random numbers, the greater the correlation of the plots is, the higher the confidence that the file under analysis contains encrypted data.","output":"Differential Area Analysis for Ransomware Attack Detection within Mixed File Datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates how (i.e., through what mechanism) and when (i.e., under what conditions) goal-oriented self-regulation behaviors improve college students psychological well-being.

The dissemination of inaccurate information and the need for social isolation to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have shown a negative impact on the population, causing damage to mental health, with the appearance or worsening of symptoms of stress, fear, anxiety, and depression. Thus, the systematic review study is intended to gather evidence on the impact of information about COVID-19 on the mental health of the population. METHODS: This systematic review protocol is conducted using the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The review aims to include published studies that address the exposure of the general population to information about COVID-19, through observational and experimental studies, which consider the following outcomes: fear, stress, anxiety, and depression. Thus, a comprehensive research strategy will be conducted in the following databases: PubMed / Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Science Direct, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Two independent reviewers will perform all procedures, such as study selection, data collection, and methodological evaluation. Disagreements will be forwarded to a third reviewer.

A year of lockdown has changed the way of life in the city and negated its principal function as a place of various meetings and social interactions. The danger of long-term isolation and being cut-off from an urban lifestyle is not only a challenge facing individuals, but it also creates threats on various collective levels. Hindered interpersonal relations, stress, and the fear of another person lower the quality of life and may contribute to the development of mental diseases. Out of fear against coronavirus, part of the society has sought safety by moving out of the densely populated city centres. The dangerous results of these phenomena are shown by research based on the newest literature regarding the influence of COVID-19 and the lockdown on mental health, urban planning, and the long-term spatial effects of the pandemic such as the urban sprawl. The breakdown of the spatial structure, the loosening of the urban tissue, and urban sprawl are going to increase anthropopressure, inhibit access to mental health treatment, and will even further contribute to the isolation of part of the society. In addition, research has shown that urban structure loosening as a kind of distancing is not an effective method in the fight against the SARS-COV pandemic. Creating dense and effective cities through the appropriate management of development during and after the pandemic may be a key element that will facilitate the prevention of mental health deterioration and wellbeing.

The approach utilises extracting the main features, which consist of 3-valued features, via the time-series data for new cases, 28-day deaths and 60-day deaths. The experimental samples chosen rely on the the rolling sets of regional data vectors whose dimensions are all 7 days. These data sets are projected onto the 3-valued features to yield the vector rejections. Then the minimal features are thus extracted by the minimal total norms. Then we map out the traces of the similarities between all the extracted time-varying features. RESULTS Our findings, no matter in preliminary or follow-up study, clearly show there is no consistent and substantial shift in the 3-valued features even after the occurrence of this new variant - this might validate the efficacy of the current vaccines against this variant.

It is a source of significant morbidity and discomfort. The aim of the study is to compare the different haemostasis devices used in breast surgery, investigating the eventual superiority of an instrument among the others in terms of intraoperative and postoperative outcome, especially of seroma formation. METHODS Clinical cases of female patients undergone axillary lymph nodes dissection for local advanced breast cancer between January 2013 and July 2017 at the Surgery Unit of University of Campania \\"Luigi Vanvitelli\\" were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups, according to device utilized during surgery: Electrocautery, Harmonic Scalpel, LigaSure and Thunderbeat. All patients underwent II level axillary lymph nodes dissection associated to radical mastectomy or quadrantectomy. RESULTS One hundred consecutives patients were enrolled in the study. Intra-operative blood loss resulted statistically significant different (P < 0,01) between the Electrocautery group (94,7 ml) and the Thunderbeat group (57,2 ml), while the Harmonic Scalpel group and the Ligasure group, despite presented a lower amount of blood loss, did not differ significantly. Drainage volume resulted significantly lower (P = 0,002) in the comparison between the Electrocautery group and the Thunderbeat group; the Ligasure group and Harmonic Scapel group showed no difference between them and Electrocautery group. About the seroma formation, the Electrocautery group resulted affected by the highest seroma formation rate (64%).

Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs nonCintensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P < .001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P = .22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0  10(3) copies/m(3) (0.4  10(3) to 3.1  10(3) copies/m(3)) in clinical areas to 9.7  10(3) copies/m(3) (5.1  10(3) to 14.3  10(3) copies/m(3)) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9  10(3) to 40  10(3) copies/m(3) and 3.8  10(3) to 7.2  10(3) TCID50/m(3)), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 m; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 m. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered.","output":"Assessment of Air Contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in Hospital Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence links acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID\\\\19 with higher mortality and respiratory morbidity, but the relationship of AKI with cardiovascular disease outcomes has not been reported in this population.

However, much attention has not been given to its management. The present study sought to assess the healthcare waste management (HCWM) practices in the Tamale Central Hospital (TCH) by characterizing and measuring the quantities of waste generated and the associated implications. Observation of the value chain of healthcare waste management, waste quantification using a weighing scale (Top-pan-spring balance), and semi-structured interviews were used in the data collection. The study revealed that, except for sharps, there was no segregation of infectious and non-infectious waste, and healthcare waste was not treated before final disposal. The study showed that a daily record of 5.1 kg of sharps, 24.46 kg of infectious waste and 59.45 kg of general waste was generated. The maternity ward produced more general waste (14 kg), whereas the theatre generated the highest infectious waste (5.70 kg) and sharps (0.8 kg) daily. Generally, the maternity ward recorded the highest daily waste generation of 17.9 kg. The waste treatment method available in the hospital was incineration. However, the incinerator was found to be dysfunctional. Thus, an improvised method (dug pit) was used irrespective of the associated health and environmental implications. The study also revealed that the hospital did not quantify the amount of solid waste that was generated. Inadequate finance and lack of supervision were linked to the problem of poor healthcare waste management in the study area. Also, 82% of the workers mentioned that there was poor HCW segregation at the departments whereas 76% of the patients who received healthcare at the facility were unsatisfied with the HCWM practices. A strong linear relationship in the responses made was recorded. The healthcare waste management index showed that the HCWM practice at the facility was unsatisfactory as it was medium-ranked. The study, therefore, recommends that the hospital considers constructing an on-site waste treatment facility, segregate and quantify waste for effective allocation of resources for treating healthcare waste.","output":"Healthcare waste management in the Tamale Central Hospital, northern Ghana.

Such studies often fail to consider the hierarchical, spatial nature of such inequalities in their analysis, leading to the potential for bias and an inability to reach conclusions about the most appropriate structural levels for policy intervention. METHODS: We use publicly available population data on COVID-19-related mortality and all-cause mortality between March and July 2020 in England and Wales to investigate the spatial scale of such inequalities. We propose a multiscale approach to simultaneously consider three spatial scales at which processes driving inequality may act and apportion inequality between these. RESULTS: Adjusting for population age structure and number of local care homes we find highest regional inequality in March and June/July. We find finer grained within region inequality increased steadily from March until July. The importance of spatial context increases over the study period. No analogous pattern is visible for non-COVID-19 mortality. Higher relative deprivation is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality at all stages of the pandemic but does not explain structural inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Results support initial stochastic viral introduction in the South, with initially high inequality decreasing before the establishment of regional trends by June and July, prior to reported regionality of the second-wave. We outline how this framework can help identify structural factors driving such processes, and offer suggestions for a long-term, locally targeted model of pandemic relief in tandem with regional support to buffer the social context of the area.","output":"Interrogating structural inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in England and Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patients remains largely unknown, and the clinical value of antibody testing has not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (na? =a? 535) collected during hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with disease progress were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM, and IgG were 93.1%, 82.7%, and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might be due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion times for Ab, IgM, and then IgG were days 11, 12, and 4, respectively. The presence of antibodies wasa? <40% among patients within 1 week of onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM), and 79.8% (IgG) by day 15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detection significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (Pa? <a? .001), even in the early phase of 1 week from onset (Pa? =a? .007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (Pa? =a? .006).

However, much less attention has been paid to the differential effect of COVID-19 according to different personalities.

The UKHLS allows us to assess the mental health of the same respondent before and during the COVID-19 period based on their \\"Big Five\\" personality traits and cognitive skills. We find that during the COVID-19 period, individuals who have more extravert and open personality traits report a higher mental health deterioration, while those scoring higher in agreeableness are less affected. The effect of openness is particularly strong: One more SD predicts up to 0.23 more symptoms of mental health deterioration in the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) test during the COVID-19 period. In particular, for females, cognitive skills and openness are strong predictors of mental health deterioration, while for non-British White respondents, these predictors are extraversion and openness.

Host antiviral proteins play an important role in inhibiting viral proliferation. One of the isoforms of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), PABPC4, is an RNA-processing protein, which plays an important role in promoting gene expression by enhancing translation and mRNA stability. However, its function in viruses remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the host protein, PABPC4, could be regulated by transcription factor SP1 and broadly inhibits the replication of CoVs, covering four genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus) of the Coronaviridae family by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) protein through the autophagosomes for degradation. PABPC4 recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8/MARCHF8 to the N protein for ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated N protein was recognized by the cargo receptor NDP52/CALCOCO2, which delivered it to the autolysosomes for degradation, resulting in impaired viral proliferation. In addition to regulating gene expression, these data demonstrate a novel antiviral function of PABPC4, which broadly suppresses CoVs by degrading the N protein via the selective autophagy pathway. This study will shed light on the development of broad anticoronaviral therapies. IMPORTANCE Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause severe diseases in humans and animals, but none of the currently available drugs or vaccines can effectively control these diseases. During viral infection, the host will activate the interferon (IFN) signaling pathways and host restriction factors in maintaining the innate antiviral responses and suppressing viral replication. This study demonstrated that the host protein, PABPC4, interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) proteins from eight CoVs covering four genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus) of the Coronaviridae family. PABPC4 could be regulated by SP1 and broadly inhibits the replication of CoVs by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) protein through the autophagosomes for degradation. This study significantly increases our understanding of the novel host restriction factor PABPC4 against CoV replication and will help develop novel antiviral strategies.","output":"PABPC4 Broadly Inhibits Coronavirus Replication by Degrading Nucleocapsid Protein through Selective Autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with cardiovascular complications and coagulation disorders. Previous studies reported pulmonary embolism (PE) in severe COVID-19 patients. Aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of symptomatic PE in COVID-19 patients and to identify the clinical, radiological or biological characteristics associated with PE. PATIENTS/METHODS: We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study in 2 French hospitals. Controls were matched in a 1:2 ratio on the basis of age, sex and center. PE patients with COVID-19 were compared to patients in whom PE was ruled out (CTPA controls) and in whom PE has not been investigated (CT controls). RESULTS: PE was suspected in 269 patients among 1042 COVID-19 patients, and confirmed in 59 patients (5.6%). Half of PE was diagnosed at COVID-19 diagnosis. PE patients did not differ from CT and CTPA controls for thrombosis risk factors. PE patients more often required invasive ventilation compared to CTPA controls (odds ratio (OR) 2.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-5.84) and to CT controls (OR 8.07; 95% CI 2.70-23.82). PE patients exhibited more extensive parenchymal lesions (>50%) than CT controls (OR 3.90; 95% CI 1.54-9.94). D-dimer levels were 5.1 (95% CI 1.90-13.76) times higher in PE patients than CTPA controls.

The sensitivity of the protozoan to chloroquine depends on its ability to accumulate the drug in aquatic vacuolas. The medicine is also directly toxic to protozoa of the genus Entamoeba histolytica.

Despite the recent emergence of online portals for digital cultural services in many countries (such as virtual tours of art galleries and digitisation of cultural archives)? a shift which has accelerated in response to the Covid-19 epidemic, there remains a major literature gap around the value of digital culture. Failure to account for the value of digital archives risks sub-optimal allocation of resources to accessing and preserving these aspects of local cultural history. In response, we performed the first contingent valuation study to estimate willingness to pay for a free online film archive portal containing historical film footage for localities throughout the United Kingdom. Users were willing to pay an average hypothetical subscription for digital archive film services of 38.52/annum. Non-users in the general population were asked their willingness to pay a hypothetical annual donation to maintain free public access (4.68/annum on average). The results suggest that positive social value is gained from online access to digital archive film, and from knowing that the cultural heritage continues to be digitally accessible by the public for current and future generations. We outline how this evidence aligns with a theoretical framework of use and non-use value for digital goods and services extending beyond those who currently use the portal, to those introduced to it, and those in the general public who have never directly experienced the online archive service. We also report what we believe is the first application of Subjective Wellbeing analysis to engagement with a digital cultural service.

Since the current pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a great concern for everybody in the World, the frequently asked question is how and when the COVID-19 process will be concluded. The aim of this paper is to propose hypotheses in order to answer this essential question. As recently demonstrated, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome. Our main hypothesis is that the ultimate aim of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the incorporation to human genome and being an element of the intestinal virobiota. Materials and methods: We propose that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic incorporation to be a part of human virobiota is essentially based on three pathobiological phases which are called as the 'induction', 'consolidation', and 'maintenance phases'. The phase of 'recurrence' complicates any of these three disease phases based on the viral load, exposure time, and more contagious strains and/or mutants. We have performed the 'random walk model' in order to predict the community transmission kinetics of the virus. Results: Chimerism-mediated immunotherapy at the individual and community level with the help of vaccination seems to be the only option for ending the COVID-19 process. After the integration of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human genome via the induction, consolidation, and maintenance phases as an element of intestinal virobiota, the chimerism would be concluded. The 'viral load', the 'genomic strain of the SARS-CoV-2', and 'host immune reaction against the SARS-CoV-2' are the hallmarks of this long journey.

RESULTS: Compared to non-Black patients, Black patients had a higher prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, and were more likely to require renal replacement therapy (15.8% vs. 7.1%, P<0.001) and mechanical ventilation (37.2% vs. 26.6%, P<0.001) during their hospitalization. Mortality was similar between both groups (15.5% for Blacks vs. 14.0% for non-Blacks, P=0.49). Black patients were less likely to receive corticosteroids (44.9% vs 63.8%, P<0.001) or remdesivir (23.8% vs. 57.8%, P<0.001), and were less likely to be enrolled in COVID-19 clinical trials (15.3% vs. 28.2%, P<0.001). In adjusted analyses, Black race was associated lower levels of C-reactive protein and soluble urokinase receptor, and higher odds of death, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Differences in outcomes were not significant after adjusting for use of remdesivir and corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in outcomes of patients with COVID-19 may be related to differences in inflammatory response and differential use of therapies.","output":"Differences in Inflammation, Treatment and Outcomes between Black and non-Black Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To perform a scoped literature review on advantages of digital workflows in dentistry that could be widely adopted to address safety issues raised during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic Methods: Recent studies on any advantages of digital dentistry C as compared to conventional methods C that could help addressing the new safety demands for dental treatments that emerged due to the current pandemic were included PUBMED, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched for eligible articles published in the last five years The guidelines of PRISMA statement were followed during data extraction and evaluation Results: The present search strategy yielded 181 publications After application of exclusion criteria, a total of 34 studies were finally considered eligible to be discussed Among the most important advantages of digital dentistry that contribute to safety during the current pandemic are: reduced number of clinical appointments required, shorter chairside time, less invasive surgeries and safer procedures Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the findings observed herein suggest that the use of digital workflows in dentistry could lead to increased safety and reduced transmission of COVID-19 during the current pandemic ? 2020 All Rights Reserved","output":"Clinical relevance of Digital Dentistry during COVID-19 outbreak: a scoped review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of DNA in the cytosol is usually a sign of microbial infections, which alerts the host innate immune system to mount a defense response. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a critical cytosolic DNA sensor that elicits robust innate immune responses through the production of the second messenger, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which binds and activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING). However, cGAS binds to DNA irrespective of DNA sequence, therefore, self-DNA leaked from the nucleus or mitochondria can also serve as a cGAS ligand to activate this pathway and trigger extensive inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of the cGAS-STING pathway is responsible for a broad array of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recently, evidence has shown that self-DNA release and cGAS-STING pathway over-activation can drive lung disease, making this pathway a promising therapeutic target for inflammatory lung disease. Here, we review recent advances on the cGAS-STING pathway governing self-DNA sensing, highlighting its role in pulmonary disease.","output":"The cGAS-STING pathway: The role of self-DNA sensing in inflammatory lung disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a global impact.

However, preliminary diagnoses were based on clinical manifestations and conventional microbiological tests, which could later be proved wrong. In this case, we presented a patient whose initial diagnosis was lung abscess, but antibiotic treatments had no effect, and metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) indicated presence of neoplasm. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old female was diagnosed with lung abscess at three different health facilities. However, mNGS of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid did not support pulmonary infections. Rather, the copy number variation analysis using host DNA sequences suggested neoplasm. Using H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of lung biopsy, the patient was eventually diagnosed with lung squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: mNGS not only detects pathogens and helps diagnose infectious diseases, but also has potential in detecting neoplasm via host chromosomal copy number analysis.

Given this and the increased need for digital resources due to widespread COVID-19 lockdowns, it is necessary to assess the accessibility of digital fitness resources for people with disabilities. To investigate whether YouTube fitness content creators have made videos accessible to people with disabilities would be informative about access to PA during COVID-19 and could also provide insight into the feasibility of individuals who are disabled relying on YouTube for PA in a postCCOVID-19 world. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to ascertain if disability-friendly PA videos on YouTube are accessible through searching general fitness terms and whether a change in the availability of accessible fitness resources for people with disabilities occurred on YouTube between before and during the COVID-19 pandemic on Hospital/Medical Institutions, Individual(s), and Other(s) channels. Secondary aims are to investigate if different categories of YouTube channels produce more accessible fitness content and highlight any disparities in disability-friendly PA content on YouTube. METHODS: A cross-sectional text analysis of exercise-related YouTube videos was conducted. The authors used Python (version 3.0) to access the YouTube database via its data application programming interface. Terms pertaining to PA that were searched on YouTube were at-home exercise, exercise at home, exercise no equipment, home exercise, home-based exercise, no equipment workout, and workout no equipment. Various elements (eg, view count and content generation) of the videos published between January 1 and June 30, 2019 (n=700), were compared to the elements of videos published between January 1 and June 30, 2020 (n=700). To capture a broad idea of disability-friendly videos on YouTube, videos were labeled accessible if they were found in the first 100 video results and if their title, description, or tags contained the following terms: para, paralympic, adaptive, adapted, disabled, disability, differently abled, disability-friendly, wheelchair accessible, and inclusive. Each video and channel were categorized as Hospitals/Medical Institutions, Individuals, or Other(s). RESULTS: The analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in viewership of fitness content on YouTube (P=.001) and in fitness content generated by Hospitals/Medical Institutions (P=.004). Accessible terms applicable to people with disabilities had minimal appearances in 2019 (21 videos) and 2020 (19 videos). None of the top viewed fitness videos that populated on YouTube from 2019 or 2020 were accessible. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of accessible disability-friendly videos remains diminutive relative to the prevalence of disability in the general population, revealing that disability-friendly videos are seldom findable on YouTube. Thus, the need for disability-friendly fitness content to be easily searched and found remains urgent if access to digital fitness resources is to improve.","output":"The Accessibility of YouTube Fitness Videos for Individuals Who Are Disabled Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Application of a Text Analytics Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proses pembelajaran dalam jaringan atau daring selama pandemik COVID-19 menjadi salah perubahan utama pada kompetensi pedagogik yang harus dikuasai guru di sekolah dasar.

The first legal basis for an EU system of evaluating medical devices and approving their market access was the medical device directives, from the 1990s. Uncertainties about clinical evidence requirements, among other reasons, led to the EU Medical Device Regulation (2017/745) that has applied since May 2021.

A comparatively novel technique, non-surgical spinal decompression (NSD), is introduced, which uses a sensitive computerized feedback mechanism and decompresses the spinal nerve roots through segmental distraction. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of NSD therapy in addition to routine physical therapy on pain, lumbar range of motion (ROM), functional disability, back muscle endurance (BME), and quality of life (QOL) in patients with lumbar radiculopathy. Methods A total of sixty patients with lumbar radiculopathy were randomly allocated into two groups, an experimental (n = 30) and a control (n = 30) group, through a computer-generated random number table. Baseline values were recorded before providing any treatment by using a visual analogue scale (VAS), Urdu version of Oswestry disability index (ODI-U), modified-modified Schobers test (MMST), prone isometric chest raise test, and Short Form 36-Item Survey (SF-36) for measuring the pain at rest, functional disability, lumbar ROM, BME, and QOL, respectively. All patients received twelve treatment sessions over 4 weeks, and then all outcome measures were again recorded. Results By using the ANCOVA test, a statistically significant (p < 0.05) between-group improvement was observed in VAS, ODI-U, BME, lumbar ROM, role physical (RP), and bodily pain (BP) domains of SF-36, which was in favour of NSD therapy group.

The most frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were its neighborhood location (28.6%), easy and convenient scheduling (26.9%) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1%); approximately 99% reported having an overall positive experience, regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3% of clients reported that they were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood vaccination site, 98.4% of clients completed both vaccine doses, and 90.7% said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3% of vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated person (64.6% knew 3 or more). Among clients who received both vaccine doses (n=729), 91.0% said that after their vaccination experience, they had personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew (61.6% reached out to 3 or more) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0% of clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9% who reported 6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence.

A method was developed for qualitative and quantitative detection of the seminal cell-associated PRRSV RNA in relation to endogenous and exogenous reference RNAs. As endogenous control for one-step real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR UBE2D2 mRNA was selected. Particularly for the analysis of persistent infections associated with low copy numbers of PRRSV RNA, UBE2D2 mRNA is an ideal control due to its low expression in seminal cells and its detection in all samples analysed (n = 36). However, the amount of UBE2D2 mRNA in porcine semen varied (up to 106-fold), thus its use is limited to qualitative detection of PRRSV RNA. For quantitation, a synthetic, non-metazoan RNA was added to the RNA isolation reaction at an exact copy number. The photosynthesis gene ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) from Arabidopsis thaliana was used as an exogenous spike. Unexpectedly, PRRSV RNA was detected in a herd of specific pathogen-free (SPF) boars which were tested ELISA-negative for anti-PRRSV antibodies. Therefore, RT-PCR for seminal cell-associated PRRSV is a powerful tool for managing the SPF status during quarantine programs and for routine outbreak investigations.","output":"The use of endogenous and exogenous reference RNAs for qualitative and quantitative detection of PRRSV in porcine semen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are more at risk to contract SARS-CoV-2 and may develop many more severe complications, along with high mortality rates relative to the cancer-free population The outbreak of the epidemic was characterized by a high rate of infection from person to person, however medical systems remained fully functional Following most international guidelines, adaptations were made to the performance level of oncology treatments, and the service was to continue as usual Moreover, the corona virus epidemic era was characterized by new challenges such as emergency work schedules, additional hygiene measures and social distancing Furthermore, the medical staff used Personal Protection Equipment and resource preparedness for a larger outbreak and probable collapse of the health system Therefore, changes have been made in the form and delivery of patient care and treatments This article presents the work format employed in the Oncology Unit at Bnai Zion Medical Center during the COVID-19 epidemic The newly adjusted protocol included four areas: staff, patients, infrastructure and malignant disease types","output":"[Treatment of Oncology Patients during the Corona Virus Era]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES When patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome are moved out of an intensive care unit, the ventilator often requires changing. This procedure suppresses positive end expiratory pressure and promotes lung derecruitment. Clamping the endotracheal tube may prevent this from occurring. Whether or not such clamping maintains positive end-expiratory pressure has never been investigated. We designed a bench study to explore this further. HOW THE STUDY WAS DONE We used the Elysee 350 ventilator in 'volume controlled' mode with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, connected to an endotracheal tube with an 8 mm internal diameter inserted into a lung model with 40 ml/cmH2O compliance and 10 cmH2O/L/s resistance. We measured airway pressure and flow between the distal end of the endotracheal tube and the lung model. We tested a plastic, a metal, and an Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation clamp, each with an oral/nasal, a nasal, and a reinforced endotracheal tube. We performed an end-expiratory hold then clamped the endotracheal tube and disconnected the ventilator. We measured the change in airway pressure and volume for 30 s following the disconnection of the ventilator. RESULTS Airway pressure decreased thirty seconds after disconnection with all combinations of clamp and endotracheal tube. The largest fall in airway pressure (-17.486 cmH2O/s at 5 s and -18.834 cmH2O/s at 30 s) was observed with the plastic clamp combined with the reinforced endotracheal tube. The smallest decrease in airway pressure (0 cmH2O/s at 5 s and -0.163 cmH2O/s at 30 s) was observed using the Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation clamp with the nasal endotracheal tube. CONCLUSIONS Only the Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation clamp was efficient. Even with an Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation clamp, it is important to limit the duration the ventilator is disconnected to a few seconds (ideally 5 s).","output":"Does endo-tracheal tube clamping prevent air leaks and maintain positive end-expiratory pressure during the switching of a ventilator in a patient in an intensive care unit?

Therefore, the prevention and control of infectious diseases that have the potential of becoming global threats is a central priority of public health. However, the silent emergence and uncontrolled global spread of the novel virus called SARS-COV-2 has proven that neither governments nor healthcare systems are prepared to respond to a pandemic. As an example, the coming of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has not only disrupted economies and collapsed healthcare systems, but also filled hospitals and separated people from their families and work across the globe. While the outbreak originated in China, the pandemic's epicenter moved to the US, which has more cases than any country in the world (New York accounted for nearly more than one-third of the country's coronavirus infections). As the US continues to adapt its response to the evolving situation of the virus, the nation's coronavirus pandemic has highlighted many practical uses for blockchain-based applications. Motivated by this, we present a solution for fighting the coronavirus outbreak - and future pandemic outbreaks - in the US using IOTA and QR code technology. In this paper, we propose CoviReader: a decentralized healthcare management system that shares user's data anonymously. The system is built on the IOTA tangle platform and provides users detailed, unchangeable, and easy access to their personal information. CoviReader handles authentication, confidentiality, transparency and data sharing (with crucial considerations when revising confidential information). Users interact with IOTA's tangle via a mobile application which holds a FIREBASE database. The purpose of this short paper is to demonstrate a working prototype by which we assess and analyze strategies for mitigating the consequences of the COVID-19 health crisis in the US.","output":"CoviReader: Using IOTA and QR Code Technology to Control Epidemic Diseases across the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Meals are a major hurdle to glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our objective was to test a fully automated closed-loop control (CLC) system in the absence of announcement of carbohydrate ingestion among adolescents with T1D, who are known to commonly omit meal announcement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighteen adolescents with T1D (age 15.6  1.7 years; HbA1c 7.4  1.5%; 9 females/9 males) participated in a randomized crossover clinical trial comparing our legacy hybrid CLC system (Unified Safety System Virginia [USS]-Virginia) with a novel fully automated CLC system (RocketAP) during two 46-h supervised admissions (each with one announced and one unannounced dinner), following 2 weeks of data collection. Primary outcome was the percentage time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL (TIR) following the unannounced meal, with secondary outcomes related to additional continuous glucose monitoring-based metrics. RESULTS: Both TIR and time-in-tight-range 70-140 mg/dL (TTR) were significantly higher using RocketAP than using USS-Virginia during the 6 h following the unannounced meal (83% [interquartile range 64-93] vs. 53% [40-71]; P = 0.004 and 49% [41-59] vs. 27% [22-36]; P = 0.002, respectively), primarily driven by reduced time-above-range (TAR >180 mg/dL: 17% [1.3-34] vs. 47% [28-60]), with no increase in time-below-range (TBR <70 mg/dL: 0% median for both).

Most of companies or organizations can't afford it instead of a cheap forehead gun. Although forehead gun can precisely measure human body temperature, its inconvenient usage increases employees' loading. This paper presents the development of the low cost thermal imaging system. The system consists of PureThermal Mini/FLIR Lepton 3.5, Raspberry cam, and Raspberry pi 4. The PureThermal Mini is a thermal module with smart I/O. It has a FLIR Lepton3.5 thermal imager. The thermal imager can provide the system a thermal image with the resolution 160120. Currently, its price is around 15,000NTD. The resolution of the thermal image is quite low. In order to fit the need of the system, an image resize algorithm is applied to create a large size of thermal image for further application. About Raspberry Cam, it is a regular cam which can be directly installed on Raspberry Pi. Its resolution is up to 25921944 and its cost is about 1,500NTD. Its image can supply the system to deal with Artificial Intelligence process, such as human facial recognition. Raspberry Pi 4 is the core controller of system. It contains our developed Python program which is used to handle all of system processes. 3D printing is also applied to build the structure frames of the system. The cost of the developed system is less than 20,000NTD. It is capable of detecting more than two people simultaneously and automatically.

Because ACE-2 may be modulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), there is concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. AIM: This study sought to analyze the association of COVID-19 pneumonia with previous treatment with ACEIs and ARBs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 684 consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and tested by polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients were split into two groups, according to whether (group 1, n = 484) or not (group 2, n = 250) COVID-19 was confirmed. Multivariable adjusted comparisons included a propensity score analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 63.6  18.7 years, and 302 patients (44%) were female. Hypertension was present in 42.6% and 38.4% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.28).

These models are based on evidence that primarily originates from investigations in high-income countries, but it may be impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for microbiology and laboratory testing, imaging, and the use of diagnostic and prognostic models in patients with severe COVID-19 in LMICs. For diagnostic testing, where reverse transcriptionCPCR (RT-PCR) testing is available and affordable, we recommend using RT-PCR of the upper or lower respiratory specimens and suggest using lower respiratory samples for patients suspected of having COVID-19 but have negative RT-PCR results for upper respiratory tract samples. We recommend that a positive RT-PCR from any anatomical source be considered confirmatory for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but, because false-negative testing can occur, recommend that a negative RT-PCR does not definitively rule out active infection if the patient has high suspicion for COVID-19. We suggest against using serologic assays for the detection of active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection, until there is better evidence for its usefulness. Where available, we recommend the use of point-of-care antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection as an alternative to RT-PCR, only if strict quality control measures are guaranteed. For laboratory testing, we recommend a baseline white blood cell differential platelet count and hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver function tests and suggest a baseline C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin, prothrombin time (or other coagulation test), and D-dimer, where such testing capabilities are available. For imaging, where availability of standard thoracic imaging is limited, we suggest using lung ultrasound to identify patients with possible COVID-19, but recommend against its use to exclude COVID-19. We suggest using lung ultrasound in combination with clinical parameters to monitor progress of the disease and responses to therapy in COVID-19 patients.

Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, strict infection control measures were in force in long-term residential care in Germany that burdened staff and isolated residents socially. Both are considered risk factors for violence in long-term residential care. Questions: How does violence develop in nursing homes under pandemic conditions from the point of view of managers and how do strategies for preventing violence change? Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with staff in 43 nursing homes: 25 with service managers, 15 with nurse managers, 28 with nursing team leaders and 10 with registered nurses with extended tasks. The interviews were recorded as audio, transcribed and analysed in five steps following the \\"Thematic Framework Analysis\\". Results: The infection control measures were partly perceived as deprivation of freedom. Residents, relatives and staff partly reacted most with verbal violence. Nevertheless, the issue of violence was not a major concern for management and preventive measures were not carried out. Conclusions: The results show that strategies to prevent violence might not be sufficiently established in the institutions involved and would have to be adapted to the conditions of the pandemic. Further research is needed to evaluate infection control measures in their potential to increase the incidence of violence.","output":"Gewalt und Gewaltpr?vention in der station?ren Altenpflege w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has drastically changed how we live and work.

This deficit jeopardizes speech and language development, education, and social well-being. The lack of protocols for fitting bilateral cochlear implants and resources for spatial-hearing training contribute to these difficulties. Spatial hearing develops with bilateral experience. A large body of research demonstrates that sound localisation can improve with training, underpinned by plasticity-driven changes in the auditory pathways. Generalizing training to non-trained auditory skills is best achieved by using a multi-modal (audio-visual) implementation and multi-domain training tasks (localisation, speech-in-noise, and spatial music). The goal of this work was to develop a package of virtual-reality games (BEARS, Both EARS) to train spatial hearing in young people (8-16 years) with bilateral cochlear implants using an action-research protocol. The action research protocol used formalized cycles for participants to trial aspects of the BEARS suite, reflect on their experiences, and in turn inform changes in the game implementations. This participatory design used the stakeholder participants as co-creators. The cycles for each of the three domains (localisation, spatial speech-in-noise, and spatial music) were customized to focus on the elements that the stakeholder participants considered important. The participants agreed that the final games were appropriate and ready to be used by patients. The main areas of modification were: the variety of immersive scenarios to cover age range and interests, the number of levels of complexity to ensure small improvements were measurable, feedback, and reward schemes to ensure positive reinforcement, and an additional implementation on an iPad for those who had difficulties with the headsets due to age or balance issues. The effectiveness of the BEARS training suite will be evaluated in a large-scale clinical trial to determine if using the games lead to improvements in speech-in-noise, quality of life, perceived benefit, and cost utility. Such interventions allow patients to take control of their own management reducing the reliance on outpatient-based rehabilitation. For young people, a virtual-reality implementation is more engaging than traditional rehabilitation methods, and the participatory design used here has ensured that the BEARS games are relevant.","output":"Involving Children and Teenagers With Bilateral Cochlear Implants in the Design of the BEARS (Both EARS) Virtual Reality Training Suite Improves Personalization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marital stress and domestic violence is prevalent in every society around the world. It has become a major concern during the Covid-19 pandemic. Governments have resorted to lockdown measures in order to contain the pandemic. The pandemic has made the weaker and more vulnerable people in a household more exposed to abusive partners. Social isolation and home confinement have detrimental effects on one's mental and physical well-being. Women have been shown to be at a very high risk from violence during The Covid-19 pandemic. The research paper aims to understand the factors which compel women to stay in abusive and stressful marriages and the ways in which they can be empowered to lead their life with dignity and self-respect. The cultural contexts of most societies force women to stay in abusive marriages as the woman is often portrayed as the symbol of unity in families. Understanding the cultural bindings of women trapped in abusive households during the COVID-19 pandemic is a very crucial aspect as this can help in understanding the fear and apprehensions of women trapped in destructive marriages. This can be a key factor which can make it easier for support groups while providing counselling and other kinds of support to women trapped in abusive marriages.

In light of growing scientific interest in the treatment of this group, a multistakeholder think tank was convened to discuss the current state of knowledge, improve the care of these patients, and identify appropriate study populations for future observational and randomized trials in the field. Although recent epidemiologic studies in selected populations estimate that the prevalence of aTRH is 10% to 15% of hypertensive patients, further large-scale observational studies will be needed to better elucidate risk factors. To spur the development of therapies for aTRH, the development of an \\"aTRH\\" label for pharmacologic and device therapies with a developmental pathway including treatment added to the use of existing therapies is favored. Although demonstration of adequate BP lowering should be sufficient to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for therapies targeting aTRH, assessment of improvement in quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes is also desirable and considered in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services coverage decisions. Device trials under the aTRH label will need uniform and consistent processes for defining appropriate patient populations as well as postapproval registries assessing both long-term safety and duration of responses.

Since healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of acquiring and spreading MERS-CoV, we aimed to evaluate the perceived risk and anxiety level of HCWs in Saudi Arabia regarding MERS. METHODOLOGY An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was sent online to HCWs at King Khalid University Hospital in Saudi Arabia. The total knowledge and anxiety scores were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of high anxiety scores. RESULTS Of 591 (70%) HCWs that responded, 284 (55%), 164 (32%), and 68 (13.2%) were physicians, nurses, and technicians, respectively. Physicians obtained a lower median knowledge score (6/9) compared to other professions (7/9). The mean anxiety score was similar for physicians and other HCWs (3/5); however, non-physicians expressed higher levels of anxiety toward the risk of transmitting MERS-CoV to their families, with an anxiety score of 4/5. The ability of the virus to cause severe disease or death was the most frequently reported reason for worry by physicians (89.7%) and non-physicians (87.2%). Overall, 80% of physicians and 90% of non-physicians reported improvement in adherence to hand hygiene and standard precautions while in hospital (p = 0.002). Concern over transmitting MERS-CoV to family members was the most predictive factor for anxiety among non-physician HCWs. CONCLUSION A significant proportion of HCWs expressed anxiety about the risk of acquiring MERS-CoV infection.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a relation between the serostatus of 13 different viruses and parentally reported infections and IgE sensitization in 2-year-old children. To investigate whether there is an interaction between cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in relation to IgE sensitization. METHODS: A total of 246 infants were followed prospectively to 2 years of age with clinical examinations, skin prick test, and specific IgE analyses and through analysis of seropositivity against adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, CMV, EBV, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, and varicella-zoster virus. RESULTS: There was some evidence that IgE sensitization (24%) tended to be more common among children who were seropositive against few compared with children who were seropositive against many viruses, but this was not statistically significant, and there was no consistent trend across the groups. IgE sensitization was statistically significantly less prevalent at 2 years of age among infants who were seropositive against EBV but not other viruses (adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14-0.86). The interaction of seropositivity against both CMV and EBV antibodies indicated a further reduction in the risk for IgE sensitization (adjusted odds ratio for interaction, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.92), indicating effect modification associated with seropositivity against CMV.

HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more severe outcome, with the mortality rate going up to 30%. Though the virus usually causes sporadic infection, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-starved countries. No specific antiviral exists against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here, we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility of zinc salts acting on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts in inhibiting HEV replication, suggesting their possible therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern in resource-starved countries due to frequent outbreaks. It is also emerging as a health concern in developed countries owing to its ability to cause acute and chronic infection in organ transplant and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat HEV cases, there are known side effects and limitations of such therapy. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activity of viral RdRp is important because these findings pave the way to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients. Since zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy individuals and since high-dose zinc is used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, it may be possible to control HEV-associated health problems following a similar treatment regimen.","output":"Zinc Salts Block Hepatitis E Virus Replication by Inhibiting the Activity of Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a critically ill pregnant woman in the third trimester with severe pneumonia due to COVID-19 who presented to Xiaolan People's Hospital of Zhongshan in February 2020 The 32-year-old patient was admitted at 35+2 gestational weeks with a 4-day history of a sore throat and a fever for three hours The patient had been to Xiaogan City, Hubei Province, and the symptoms occurred during a period of self-isolation after back home The condition of the patient deteriorated rapidly, with left-sided chest and back pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, progressing to respiratory failure and septic shock 7 hours after her admission In view of her critical condition and a history of two previous cesarean sections, an emergency cesarean section was performed Blood gas analysis of the mother before the operation suggested respiratory failure, respiratory acidosis, and metabolic acidosis During the operation, a baby boy was born The Apgar score of the boy, birth weight of 2 700 g, was one at 1, 5, and 10 minutes despite the resuscitation efforts The neonate died after withdrawing treatment The patient was treated with tracheal intubation ventilator and other supportive treatments after the operation The result of the new coronavirus nucleic acid test, taken on admission, but which was reported after delivery, was positive The patient was transferred to the designated hospital for further treatment and was recovering with the withdrawal of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventilation at 26 and 36 days after surgery, respectively Copyright ? 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association","output":"A critically ill mother with COVID-19 in late pregnancy: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Multiple studies have been conducted to investigate Tocilizumab in patients with cOVID-19 pneumonitis.

Unfortunately, not all patients are candidates for aggressive surgical debulking. For these patients, pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy (PIPAC) has emerged as an alternative method for intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy administration. This report presents the design and implementation of the first phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PIPAC in the United States. METHODS This is an ongoing prospective phase 1 clinical trial of PIPAC for patients who have histologically confirmed ovarian, uterine, gastric, appendiceal, or colorectal cancer with PM and have progressed to at least one evidence-based chemotherapeutic regimen. The trial has two clinical arms. The patients in arm 1 have gynecologic and gastric malignancies treated with IP cisplatin and doxorubicin, and the arm 2 patients have colorectal and appendiceal malignancies treated with intravenous fluorouracil and leucovorin followed by IP oxaliplatin. All the patients are monitored for dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events. RESULTS Practical and technical considerations for the phase 1 PIPAC trial are presented. These considerations include patient selection, operating room setup, and technical details for successful aerosolized chemotherapy delivery.

There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. METHODS: A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. In addition, 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N = 164 individuals) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and neutralizing activity was determined. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 98.0% across 100 negative control individuals. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2.

High throughput sequencing technologies that capture genome and transcriptome information are key approaches to gain detailed mechanistic insights from infected cells. These techniques readily detect both pathogen and host-derived sequences, providing a means of studying host-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have reported the presence of host-virus chimeric (HVC) RNA in RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and interpreted these findings as evidence of viral integration in the human genome as a potential pathogenic mechanism. Since SARS-CoV2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm it does not have a nuclear phase in its life cycle. Thus, it is biologically unlikely to be in a location where splicing events could result in genome integration. Therefore, we investigated the biological authenticity of HVC events. In contrast to true biological events such as mRNA splicing and genome rearrangement events, which generate reproducible chimeric sequencing fragments across different biological isolates, we found that HVC events across >100 RNA-seq libraries from patients with COVID-19 and infected cell lines were highly irreproducible. RNA-seq library preparation is inherently error-prone due to random template switching during reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA. By counting chimeric events observed when constructing an RNA-seq library from human RNA and spike-in RNA from an unrelated species, such as fruit-fly, we estimated that a1% of RNA-seq reads are artifactually chimeric. In SARS-CoV2 RNA-seq we found that the frequency of HVC events was, in fact, not greater than this background \\"noise\\". Finally, we developed a novel experimental approach to enrich SARS-CoV2 sequences from bulk RNA of infected cells. This method enriched viral sequences but did not enrich for HVC events, suggesting that the majority of HVC events are, in all likelihood, artifacts of library construction. In conclusion, our findings indicate that HVC events observed in RNA-sequencing libraries from SARS-CoV2 infected cells are extremely rare and are likely artifacts arising from either random template switching of reverse-transcriptase and/or sequence alignment errors. Therefore, the observed HVC events do not support SARS-CoV2 fusion to cellular genes and/or integration into human genomes.ImportanceThe pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, are not fully understood. In particular, relatively little is known why some individuals develop life-threatening or persistent COVID-19. Recent studies identified host-virus chimeric (HVC) reads in RNA-sequencing data from SARS-CoV2 infected cells and suggested that HVC events support potential \\"human genome invasion\\" and \\"integration\\" by SARS-CoV2. This suggestion has fueled concerns about the long-term effects of current mRNA vaccines that incorporate elements of the viral genome. SARS-CoV2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that does not encode a reverse transcriptase and does not include a nuclear phase in its life cycle, so some doubts have rightfully been expressed regarding the authenticity of HVCs and the role played by endogenous retrotransposons in this phenomenon. Thus, it is important to independently authenticate these HVC events. Here we provide several evidences suggesting that the observed HVC events are likely artifactual.","output":"Host-virus chimeric events in SARS-CoV2 infected cells are infrequent and artifactual"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Oral Health (OH) is essential to general health and quality of life. It is affected by the individual's experiences and perceptions. Aim: To evaluate the effect of online Oral Health Education (OHE) programme on OH knowledge level on school students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: This interventional cross-sectional study was conducted virtually on school students in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia, between February 2021 and May 2021. The sample was based on non probability convenience sampling technique in which 489 students participated in the study. The electronic survey consisted of questions about demographics, school characteristics, and OH knowledge. Online OHE was conducted by dental students of Vision colleges via Zoom and Microsoft teams. Collected data were analysed using using IBM, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0, IL, USA. Comparison of differences in the mean knowledge scores across different variables was done using independent t-test for two means and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for more than two means. Linear regression analysis was used to analyse the association between knowledge and other variables in a multivariate environment, and presented by  coefficients and 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI). Significance level was set at p-value <0.05. Results: Online education had significantly increased the level of knowledge about OH compared to no education (: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.89, p-value=0.04). Students in public schools had significantly higher level of knowledge about OH compared to private schools (: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.10, 1.11, p-value=0.02).

These screening tests need to be highly specific and sensitive, and deliverable at the point-of-care. We evaluate here the sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed OnSite Dengue IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT). A retrospective double-blind study of the sensitivity and specificity of the OnSite Dengue IgG RDT was performed using a sample panel consisting of archived serum specimens collected during CYD-TDV clinical trials in Latin American and Asia, with the reference serostatus for each sample determined by an algorithm using measured dengue PRNT90, PRNT50, and NS1 IgG ELISA. An additional panel of dengue seronegative samples positive for other flaviviruses and infections was used to assess cross-reactivity. Samples were included from 579 participants; 346 in the specificity panel and 233 in the sensitivity panel. The OnSite dengue IgG RDT exhibited a specificity of 98.0% (95% CI = 95.9 to 99.2) and sensitivity of 95.3% (95% CI = 91.7 to 97.6). The sensitivity for samples exhibiting a multitypic immune profile (PRNT90-positive to >1 dengue serotype) was 98.8% while for monotypic immune samples (PRNT90-positive to a single dengue serotype) it was 88.1%. The OnSite dengue IgG RDT showed minimal to no cross-reactivity to related flaviviruses. These findings support the use of the OnSite dengue IgG RDT to determine dengue serostatus in CYD-TDV prevaccination screening. IMPORTANCE Dengue remains a significant public health issue, with over 5.2 million cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019. The tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) is currently licensed for use in those aged 9 years; however, vaccinees with no previous exposure to dengue experience an increased risk of hospitalized and severe dengue upon subsequent heterotypic infection. Consequently, WHO recommends screening for prior dengue infection before vaccination. Screening tests for previous infection need to be highly specific and sensitive, and deliverable at the point-of-care. High sensitivity ensures that the largest number of individuals with previous infection can be identified and vaccinated, while high specificity prevents the inadvertent vaccination of those without previous infection. This study of the OnSite Dengue IgG Rapid Test, which was explicitly developed to meet this need, found that it had both high specificity (98.0% [95% CI = 95.9 to 99.2]) and sensitivity (95.3% [95% CI = 91.7 to 97.6]).","output":"Performance Evaluation of a Dengue IgG Rapid Diagnostic Test Designed to Determine Dengue Serostatus as Part of Prevaccination Screening."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccination experience among United States-based dental professionals and students: to understand their beliefs, concerns, safety and confidence levels, and side effects experienced after vaccination; striving to boost vaccination acceptability to curtail the pandemic. METHODS: An observational survey study approved by The University of Texas Health San Antonio Institutional Review Board was distributed to members of the School of Dentistry community using Qualtrics XM software. The survey was completed anonymously. Data were analyzed using R statistical computing software, (2) test and Fishers Exact test. RESULTS: Over 80% of all participants felt moderately to very safe working after the COVID-19 vaccine was made available, and more than 75% were moderately to very confident that the vaccine can protect them during the pandemic. At least 35% were moderately to very concerned about immediate and long-term side effects of the vaccine; despite the concerns, 94% received the vaccine. Side effects were more common after the second dose of the vaccine. Most common side effects were injection site pain, and general side effects of fatigue/tiredness, headache, muscle/body ache, and chills/fever. 74% reported no effect of the vaccine on daily activities, and the severity of side effects no worse than mild (about 60%). CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the participants felt safe and confident that the vaccine would protect them against COVID-19 infection.

Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified the activation of two MYC controlled metabolic pathways; amino acid transport and glycolysis, both of which are critical for MAIT cell proliferation. Finally, we show that MYC expression in response to immune activation is diminished in MAIT cells isolated from people with obesity, resulting in defective MAIT cell proliferation and functional responses.

METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model from a United Kingdom NHS perspective, informed by published analyses of patient-level data. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of THA and TKA in adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis compared with having no arthroplasty surgery during the ten-year time horizon.

Furthermore, THA cost < 20,000/QALY for patients with OHS of &#8804; 45, while TKA was cost-effective for patients with OKS of &#8804; 43, since the small improvements in quality of life outweighed the cost of surgery and any subsequent revisions.

However, the precise mechanism by which these viral proteins trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. Here we show that influenza virus stimulates oxidized DNA release from macrophages. Ion channel activity of the M2 protein or mitochondrial localization of the PB1-F2 protein was required for oxidized DNA release. While the oxidized DNA enhanced influenza virus-induced IL-1 secretion, inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production by antioxidant Mito-TEMPO decreased the virus-induced IL-1 secretion. In addition, we show that influenza virus stimulates IL-1 secretion from macrophages in an AIM2-dependent manner.

During a five-month study period, from November 8, 2020 to April 11, 2021, viral loads in influent wastewater from each of New York City's 14 wastewater treatment plants were measured and compared to new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases for the populations in each corresponding sewershed, estimated from publicly available clinical testing data. We found significant positive correlations between viral loads in wastewater and new COVID-19 cases. The strength of the correlations varied depending on the sewershed, with Spearman's rank correlation coefficients ranging between 0.38 and 0.81 (mean = 0.55). Based on a linear regression analysis of a combined data set for New York City, we found that a 1 log(10) change in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater corresponded to a 0.6 log(10) change in the number of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in a sewershed. An estimated minimum detectable case rate between 2-8 cases per day/100 000 people was associated with the method limit of detection in wastewater. This work offers a preliminary assessment of the relationship between wastewater monitoring data and clinical testing data in New York City. While routine monitoring and method optimization continue, information on the development of New York City's wastewater monitoring program may provide insights for similar wastewater-based epidemiology efforts in the future.","output":"Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater during New York City's second wave of COVID-19: sewershed-level trends and relationships to publicly available clinical testing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease has significantly impacted medical education, including removing trainees from clinical environments, transitioning didactic sessions to virtual platforms, and necessitating creative solutions to provide interactive learning opportunities in a virtual, socially distant setting. Human gross anatomy education, with its emphasis on hands\\\\on, team\\\\based, active learning by body donor dissection, has been particularly impacted by these transitions. Dissection is considered the best practice for learning gross anatomy and has been shown to enhance learning over non\\\\dissection\\\\based methods. At the Medical College of Wisconsin, team\\\\based, body donor dissections are the basis for the Clinical Human Anatomy course. However, the pandemic necessitated changes to the format of laboratory activities.

This provided an opportunity to directly compare the effect of different laboratory instructional modalities on student performance within a single course. All first\\\\year medical students were enrolled in the same Clinical Human Anatomy course, attended identical didactic sessions, and were assessed by identical examinations that included lecture\\\\based questions as well as laboratory image\\\\based questions. As the semester progressed and coronavirus disease case numbers rose, students were offered two options for completing laboratory instruction: (1) continue dissections in socially distant pairs or (2) transition to a virtual lab format. The virtual lab format included a self\\\\directed module which guided students through the dissections they would have done in person. Each module consisted of a PowerPoint presentation that incorporated interactive software (3D4Medical Complete Anatomy) and dissection images. The self\\\\directed modules were followed by interactive Zoom sessions, wherein faculty reviewed a prosection and posed clinically relevant questions to the meeting attendees. Students who opted for the virtual lab format were able to review dissections in\\\\person on their own time or with a tutor. Likewise, students who opted to continue dissection had access to the virtual modules and recordings of the Zoom sessions. Comparison between students completing labs virtually or in\\\\person showed no difference in aggregate performance on examinations. This study examined medical knowledge and did not investigate other competencies impacted by lab activities (teamwork, dealing with death, and the first patient experience).

Here, we validated and investigated the usefulness of measuring serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the iFlash3000 CLIA analyzer. We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The repeatability and within-laboratory precision were obviously good in validations, following to the CLSI document EP15-A3. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and 55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases.

Female shrimp showed high levels of initial aggression that quickly decreased over time, suggesting the formation of a dominance hierarchy. The dominance hierarchy between groups of females appeared linear, with shrimp at five distinct ranks in most replicates and higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked ones. Dominance was significantly correlated with cheliped size but not body size, suggesting that larger chelipeds in female P. pugio may have evolved as a tool to establish dominance, perhaps to gain access to shelter in salt marshes, seagrass beds, or oyster reefs. Grass shrimp are preyed upon by a wide range of estuarine fish, and females are especially vulnerable; so securing access to shelter may provide a major selective advantage, with the dominance hierarchy evolving to save energy through a long-term reduction in fighting over resources.","output":"Linear Dominance Hierarchies in Female Grass Shrimp Palaemon pugio."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In-depth study of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome has uncovered many mutations, which have replaced the lineage that characterized the first wave of infections all around the world.

The Th17 cytokine profile was evaluated in a pilot study of respiratory virus infections. METHODS: Consecutive patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection visiting the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital during the winter influenza season of 2014 to 2015 were evaluated. CLART PneumoVir kit, (GENOMICA, Madrid, Spain) was used for viral detection of all known respiratory viruses. Th17 cytokine profile was evaluated with the MILLIPLEX MAP Human TH17 Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Correlation of the TH17 profile with viral detection was performed with univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Seventy\\\\six patients were evaluated (median age 56 years, 51.3% female); a respiratory virus was identified in 60 (78.9%) patients; 45% had confirmed influenza.

Moreover, human freedom, including freedom of intellectual inquiry, is agreed on all hands to be an intrinsic human good. Accordingly, there is a presumption in favour of allowing research in the biological sciences, as there is in other areas of human knowledge. In short, research in the biological sciences is morally permissible, absent special considerations in relation to specific kinds of such research. What, if any, research in the biological sciences is morally impermissible? Research in the biological sciences undertaken for the purpose of weaponising biological agents so that they can be used to kill or cause illness in human populations is presumably morally impermissible, whether the research in question is undertaken by state actors, (non-state) terrorist groups, criminal organisations or malevolent individuals. So much is proclaimed in the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), notwithstanding the fact that arguments have been used from time to time to justify the use of biological weapons in the context of a just war. It has been argued, for example, that some biological weapons are more humane than some conventional weapons. It has also been argued that biological weapons development during peacetime may play an important role in deterrence [79]. It is not within the scope of this report to discuss the moral complexities arising from the use of various forms of weaponry, albeit this is an important and somewhat neglected topic. However, we note that, in so far as biological weapons are a species of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), there is a general moral objection to their development and use, namely, that inevitably they target civilian populations and not merely combatants. As such, they violate the so-called jus in bello condition of just war theory; the condition that, among other things, gives expression to the moral principle of civilian immunity in war.","output":"Experiments of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Extended-release buprenorphine (XR) is indicated for pain management in rodents, but little is known about its use in mice.

Methods Mice (n = 44) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: (a) saline (1 ml/kg SC, once); (b) sustained release buprenorphine (Bup-SR, 1 mg/kg SC, once); (c) low dose extended-release buprenorphine (XR-lo, 3.25 mg/kg SC, once); (d) high dose extended-release buprenorphine (XR-hi, 6.5 mg/kg SC, once). On days -1, 0 (4 hours), 1, 2, and 3, mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities were evaluated, and plasma buprenorphine concentrations were measured. Results Mechanical (days 0-2) and thermal (days 0-1) hypersensitivities were observed in the saline group. Bup-SR, XR-lo, and XR-hi attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity on days 0, 1, and 2. None of the treatment groups, except XR-Lo on day 0, attenuated thermal hypersensitivity on days 0 or 1. Plasma buprenorphine concentration peaked at 4 hours (day 0) in all treatment groups and remained greater than 1 ng/mL on days 0-2. No abnormal clinical observations or gross pathologic findings were seen in any groups.

Here, we determine how women in Malawi prepare for pregnancy and factors associated with pregnancy preparation. METHODS: We used data from a previous cohort study comprising 4,244 pregnant mothers, recruited between March and December 2013 in Mchinji district, Malawi. Associations of pregnancy preparation with socio-demographic and obstetric factors were tested for using mixed effects ordinal regression, with the likelihood ratio and Wald's tests used for variable selection and independently testing the associations. RESULTS: Most mothers (63.9%) did not take any action to prepare for their pregnancies. For those who did (36.1%), eating more healthily (71.9%) and saving money (42.8%) were the most common forms of preparation. Mothers who were married (adjusted odds-ratio (AOR 7.77 (95% CI [5.31, 11.25]) or with no or fewer living children were more likely to prepare for pregnancy (AOR 4.71, 95% CI [2.89,7.61]. Mothers with a period of two to three years (AOR 2.51, 95% CI [1.47, 4.22]) or at least three years (AOR 3.67, 95%CI [2.18, 6.23]) between pregnancies were more likely to prepare for pregnancy than women with first pregnancy or shorter intervals.

Due to lack of school and daycare exposure, we evaluated a larger than usual number of patients with periodic fevers without any known infectious contacts. Based on this observation, we conducted an analysis of all suspected cases of periodic fevers seen at our institution during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to prior seasons. METHODS: The clinical charts were queried for all patients presenting to any Lurie Childrens Hospital outpatient specialty clinic or laboratory with ICD diagnosis code of MO4.1 and MO4.8 (all recurrent and periodic fever syndromes) from June 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020, and compared to similar months the previous 2 years (2018 and 2019). Each patient chart was reviewed by the lead investigator to verify all new diagnoses of PFAPA. The number of new patients with PFAPA diagnosis were tallied and analyzed. Statistical comparisons were made using Kruskal-Wallis tests for monthly distributions in different years. RESULTS: We noted a significant increase in patients with new PFAPA diagnosis between June through August 2020 compared to similar months in 2018 and 2019 (Figure1). Experienced pediatric infectious disease physicians and rheumatologists diagnosed majority of the cases. During these months, a monthly median (IQR) of 13 (11.5, 14.5) patients were diagnosed among different Lurie specialty clinics, which is more than 2.5 folds increase in new PFAPA patients from the previous two years which were about 5 (3.5, 6) (Figure 2).

The median age at time of the SARS-CoV infection was 70 years (25-92). The most common cancer type was breast cancer (n = 40). The majority of the patients had stage IV disease. Half of the patients had two or more comorbidities. The majority of the patients (78%) presented with COVID-19 symptoms. More than 77% of the patients were hospitalized and 6% were admitted to intensive care units. Overall, 104 patients have documented resolution of the infection. Fifty-seven patients (33%) have died. In 29 cases (17%), the cause of death was directly correlated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Factors significantly correlated with the risk of death were the following: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS), age, presence of two or more comorbidities, presence of dyspnoea, COVID-19 phenotype &#8805; 3, hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate reported in this confirms the frailty of this population. These data reinforce the need to protect patients with cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Epidemiology and clinical course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in cancer patients in the Veneto Oncology Network: The Rete Oncologica Veneta covID19 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of TriBAFF-CAR-T cells on hematological tumor cells. METHODS: TriBAFF-CAR-T and CD19-CAR-T cells were co-cultured with BAFFR-bearing B-cell malignancies at different effector/target ratios to evaluate the anti-tumor effects. In vivo, TriBAFF-CAR-T and CD19-CAR-T cells were intravenously injected into Raji-luciferase xenograft mice. CD19 antigens losing lymphoblasts was simulated by Raji knocking out CD19 (CD19(KO)) to investigate the effect of TriBAFF-CAR-T cells on CD19(KO) Raji. RESULTS: Both TriBAFF-CAR-T and CD19-CAR-T cells significantly induced the lysis of Raji, BALL-1, and Jeko-1. Moreover, when CD19-CAR-T cells specifically caused the lysis of K562 with overexpressed CD19, the lethal effect of TriBAFF-CAR-T cells was also specific for BAFFR-bearing K562 with increasing levels of interleukin-2 and INF-. The TriBAFF-CAR-T have the same effect with CD19-CAR-T cells in treating Raji xenofraft mice. TriBAFF-CAR-T cells also have great effect in CD19(KO) Raji cells.

In the COVID-19 era, due to the health system's focus on the COVID-19 epidemic, the national TB control program received less attention, leading to a worsening of the global TB epidemic. In this study, we will review the characteristics of TB patients coinfected with COVID-19. Material and Methods: Using Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases, a systematic search was performed. Case reports and case series on TB/COVID-19 coinfection published from January 1, 2019 to February 24, 2021 were collected. There were no limitations regarding publication language. Results: Eleven case series and 20 case reports were identified from 18 countries, with the majority them being from India (N = 6) and China (N = 4). Overall, 146 patients (114 men and 32 women) coinfected with TB and COVID-19 enrolled. Smoking (15.1%), diabetes (14.4%), and hypertension (8.9%) were the most frequent comorbidities among these patients. The COVID-19 patients with TB mainly suffered fever (78.8%), cough (63.7%), and respiratory distress (22.6%). Hydroxychloroquine (64.0%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (39.5%) were the most common treatments for them. The mortality rate was 13.0% and the rate of discharged patients was 87.0%. Conclusion: Global prevalence of COVID-19-related deaths is 6.6%. Our results showed that 13.0% of patients with TB/COVID-19 died. Thus, this study indicated that coinfection of TB and COVID-19 can increase the mortality. The respiratory symptoms of TB and COVID-19 are very similar, and this causes them to be misdiagnosed. In addition, TB is sometimes diagnosed later than COVID-19 and the severity of the disease worsens, especially in patients with underlying conditions. Therefore, patients with TB should be screened regularly in the COVID-19 era to prevent the spread of the TB/COVID-19 coinfection.","output":"Clinical Characteristics, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Mortality Rate of TB/COVID-19 Coinfectetd Patients: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine if Aquablation therapy can maintain its effectiveness in treating men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with large\\\\volume (80C150 cc) prostates at 3 years. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred one men with moderate\\\\to\\\\severe BPH symptoms and prostate volumes between 80 and 150 cc were enrolled in a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, international clinical trial in late 2017. Baseline, procedural, and follow\\\\up parameters were recorded at baseline and scheduled postoperative visits. IPSS, Qmax, and treatment failure are reported at 3 years. RESULTS: The mean prostate volume was 107 cc (range 80C150). Mean IPSS improved from 23.2 at baseline to 6.5 at 3 years (16.3\\\\point improvement, p < 0.0001). Mean IPSS quality of life improved from 4.6 at baseline to 1.1 at 3 years (improvement of 3.4 points, p < 0.0001). Maximum urinary flow increased from 8.7 to 18.5 cc/s.

Unfortunately, people commonly use these platforms to share misinformation which can influence other people adversely. The spread of misinformation is unavoidable in an extraordinary situation like Covid-19, and the consequences can be dreadful. This paper proposes a two-step ranking-based misinformation detection (RMiD) technique. Firstly, a novel ranking-based approach leveraging the scalable information retrieval infrastructure is applied to detect misinformation from a huge collection of unlabelled tweets based on a related but very small labelled misinformation data set. Secondly, the identified misinformation tweets are represented as a coupled matrix tensor model and Nonnegative Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization is applied to learn their spatio-temporal topic dynamics. The experimental analysis shows that RMiD is capable of detecting misinformation with better coverage and less noise in comparison with existing techniques. Moreover, the coupled matrix tensor representation has improved the quality of topics discovered from unlabelled data up to 4% by leveraging the semantic similarity of terms in labelled data.","output":"Identifying Covid-19 misinformation tweets and learning their spatio-temporal topic dynamics using Nonnegative Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Clinical validation of a bioluminescence imaging system (Cis) as measured by the level of agreement between clinician visual and tactile assessment of carious lesion presence and activity and the presence/absence of elevated luminescence on a tooth surface determined from intraoral image mapping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a regulatory clinical study designed in consultation with the FDA. The design was a prospective, five\\\\investigator, nonrandomized, post\\\\approval, clinical study utilizing the Cis to provide images of elevated calcium ion concentration (indicative of active demineralization) on tooth surfaces via use of a photoprotein. Imaged teeth were identified as sound or having active lesions. Images were scored independently for luminescence. RESULTS: A total of 110 participants aged 7C74 years were imaged. Of the 90 teeth assessed as sound, 88 were deemed to show no luminescence by the reviewing investigator, a negative percentage agreement of 97.8% (significantly >50% agreement [p < .0001]; one\\\\sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9220). Of the 86 teeth initially assessed as having an active lesion, 78 were deemed to show luminescence by the reviewing investigator, a positive percentage agreement of 90.7% (significantly >50% agreement [p < .0001]; 97.5% CI: 0.8249). There were no patient\\\\related adverse events.

Despite much being known about the utility of making these measurements in large wastewater treatment plants, little is known about the correlation with finer geographic resolution, such as those obtained through sewershed sub-area catchments. This study aims to identify community wastewater surveillance characteristics between sewershed areas that affect the strength of the association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in a metropolitan area. For this, wastewater from 17 sewershed areas were sampled in Louisville/Jefferson County, Kentucky (USA), from August 2020 to April 2021 (N = 727), which covered approximately 97% of the county's households. Solids were collected from the treatment plants from November 2020 to December 2020 (N = 42). Our results indicate that the sewersheds differ in SARS-CoV-2 trends;however, high pairwise correlation spatial trends were not observed, and the mean SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations of smaller upstream community sewershed areas did not differ from their respective treatment centers. Solid samples could only be collected at treatment plants, therefore not allowing us to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 abundance as a function of the sewershed scale. The population size sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 concentration detection is non-linear: at low population levels the measures are either too sensitive and generate a high level of variability, or at high population levels the estimates are dampened making small changes in community infection levels more difficult to discern. Our results suggest selecting sampling sites that include a wide population range. This study and its findings may inform other system-wide strategies for sampling wastewater for estimating non-SARS-CoV-2 targets.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance in wastewater as a function of distinct urban sewershed size"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During New Zealand's first outbreak in early 2020 the Southern Region had the highest per capita SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. PCR testing was initially limited by a narrow case definition and limited laboratory capacity, so cases may have been missed. Objectives: To evaluate the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assay, alongside spike-based assays, and to determine the frequency of antibodies among PCR-confirmed and probable cases, contacts, and higher risk individuals in the Southern Region of NZ. Study design: Pre-pandemic sera (n=300) were used to establish assay specificity and sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=78) to establish sensitivity. For prevalence analysis, all samples (n=1214) were tested on the Abbott assay, and all PCR-confirmed cases (n=78), probable cases (n=9), and higher risk individuals with grey-zone (n=14) or positive results (n=11) were tested on four additional SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. Results: The median time from infection onset to serum collection for PCR-confirmed cases was 14 weeks (range 11-17 weeks). The Abbott assay demonstrated a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI, 98.2%-99.99%) and a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI, 66.0%-85.7%). Spike-based assays demonstrated superior sensitivity ranging 89.7-94.9%. Nine previously undiagnosed sero-positive individuals were identified, and all had epidemiological risk factors. Conclusions: Spike-based assays demonstrated higher sensitivity than the Abbott IgG assay, likely due to temporal differences in antibody persistence.

Numerous studies in adults have been carried out and describe obesity as an independent risk and prognostic factor for the severity of COVID-19. This study aims to systematically review the literature on the relation between weight excess and the severity of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Methods This systematic review was developed following the PRISMA standards (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis). The literature search was performed in September 2020, in the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)), Web of Science, BVS/LILACS and SciELO. Registration on the PROSPERO platform (International Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews) can be found under the registration number: CRD42021230686. Results Of the 667 selected articles, 11 were included according to all agreed criteria, most of them being unicentric and American. In assessing the risk of bias and quality, following the criteria of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, eight studies achieved scores higher than 7. Only 5 studies sought to assess obesity and its relation with worse outcomes (such as need for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), tracheostomy, hospital readmission and mortality), and out of these, only one article demonstrated this comorbidity as a prognostic factor for worse evolution of the COVID picture. Conclusions Few studies in the literature seek to assess excess weight and its relation with worse outcomes of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Taking into account that there is already scientific evidence on this subject in adult patients, it is necessary to carry out more research in the pediatric age group.","output":"Weight excess association with severity in children and adolescents with COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sport has been heavily impacted by the pandemic for over a year with restrictions and closures of facilities.

A sample of 1051 older athletes, 523 women and 528 men, aged from 35 to 88 years, from Australia, Canada, Europe, and the USA provided responses to an online survey conducted in June 2021. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to examine age, gender, and regional differences about motivation, barriers, and pandemic impact on sport and physical activities. Participants showed enthusiasm for the opportunity to compete despite health challenges with increasing age but faced barriers due to access to training facilities and qualified coaches even before the pandemic. The oldest athletes had the greatest reduction in physical activities during the pandemic. Weightlifters had the opportunity to compete in virtual competitions and 44% would like to see some of these continued in the future, especially women.

This study aims to understand the impact of integrated plastic surgery residency program social media on the 2020 to 2021 applicants' evaluation of prospective programs, particularly during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS An optional 20-item online survey was sent to integrated plastic surgery residency applicants applying to the authors' program. RESULTS Surveys were sent to 300 integrated plastic surgery residency applicants with an average of 168 responses (56% response rate). Social media resources included official residency program website (87.1%), Instagram (70.2%), and Doximity (46.8%). The most frequently used resource by applicants was the official residency program website (43.9%); Instagram was the second most frequently used (40.2%) followed by Doximity (8.3%). Most respondents agreed that social media was an effective means to inform applicants (66.1%), and it positively impacted their perception of the program (64.8%). The cited benefits were helping the program exhibit its culture and comradery among residents, faculty, and staff (78.4%). Among applicants, 73.6% noted that it had a significant impact on their perceptions of programs. Most respondents truncated their planned plastic surgery subinternships, completing 1 instead of 3 planned subinternships because of coronavirus disease 2019 limitations. CONCLUSIONS During the 2020 to 2021 plastic surgery application cycle, applicants used social media accounts of plastic surgery residency programs to inform and educate themselves about prospective programs. This study suggests that investing resources into a social media residency accounts is a meaningful pursuit for integrated plastic surgery programs and is an important aspect in today's recruitment.","output":"The Effects of Website and Social Media Presence of Integrated Plastic Surgery Residency Programs on Prospective Applicants: An Analysis During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has focussed public attention on the management of communicable disease like never before. Surveillance, contact tracing, and case management are recognised as key components of outbreak prevention. Development of guidance for COVID-19 has drawn from existing management of other communicable diseases, including Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD). IMD is a rare but severe outcome of Neisseria meningitidis infection that can be prevented through vaccination. Cases still occur sporadically, requiring ongoing surveillance and consistent management. To this end, national and international public health agencies have developed and published guidance for identification and management of IMD cases. AIM: To assess national and international guidelines for the public health management of IMD, with a focus on the recommendations for identification and management of close contacts to IMD cases. METHODS: Guidelines from six national and international public health agencies were assessed using a modified version of the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument in four key domains: stakeholder involvement, developmental rigour, clarity, and applicability. A direct comparison of terminology and recommendations for identification and management of close contacts to IMD cases was also conducted. RESULTS: Guidelines from Europe and the United Kingdom rated most highly using the AGREE II Instrument, both presenting a clear, critical assessment of the strength of the available evidence, and the risks, costs, and benefits behind recommendations for management of close contacts. Direct comparison of guidelines identified inconsistencies in the language defining close contacts to IMD cases. CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between guidelines could be due to limited evidence concerning mechanisms behind disease transmission, along with the lack of a consistent process for development and review of guideline recommendations. COVID-19 management has demonstrated that international collaboration for development of public health guidance is possible, a practice that should be extended to management of other communicable diseases.","output":"Lessons for and from the COVID-19 pandemic response  An appraisal of guidance for the public health management of Invasive Meningococcal Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We demonstrated the optical trapping-induced formation of a single large disc-like assembly (50 m in diameter) of polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs) (100 nm in diameter) at a solution surface. Different from the conventional trapping behavior in solution, the assembly grows from the focus to the outside along the surface and contains needle structures expanding radially in all directions. Upon switching off the trapping laser, the assembly disperses and needle structures disappear, while the highly concentrated domain of the NPs is left for a while. The single assembly is quickly restored by switching on the laser again, where the needle structures are also reproduced but in a different way. When a single 10 m PS microparticle (MP) is trapped in the NP solution, a single disc-like assembly containing needle structures is similarly prepared outside the MP. Based on backscattering imaging and tracking analyses of the MP at the solution surface, it is proposed that scattering and propagation of the trapping laser from the central part of the NP assembly or the MP lead to this new phenomenon.","output":"Anomalously Large Assembly Formation of Polystyrene Nanoparticles by Optical Trapping at the Solution Surface."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Results from two studies involving challenge with respiratory syncytial viruses showed that volunteers who developed colds were more sensitive to a visually distracting pattern presented prior to virus challenge than were volunteers who did not get a cold.

Here, we are given a social network, a seed-set of agents for each opinion, and two thresholds for each agent. The first threshold represents the willingness of an agent to adopt an opinion if the agent has no opinion at all, while the second threshold states for willingness to acquire second opinion. The goal is to add as few agents as possible to the initial seed-sets such that, once the process started with these seed-sets stabilizes, each agent has either both opinions or none. We show that the problem is NP-hard. Further, we investigate the complexity from the parameterized point-of-view. The problem is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size. The problem remains W[1]-hard even for the combination of parameters the solution size and treewidth of the network even if all thresholds are at most 3, or the activation process stabilizes within 4 rounds. On the other hand, the problem is FPT when parameterized by the number of rounds, maximum threshold, and treewidth. This algorithm applies also for combined parameter treedepth and maximum threshold. Finally, we show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by vertex cover number of the input network alone.

Several lines of evidence suggest these networks can be fine-tuned by the largest family of TE controllers, the KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs). One tissue permissive for TE transcriptional activation (termed transposcription) is the adult human brain, however comprehensive studies on the extent of this process and its potential contribution to human brain development are lacking. In order to elucidate the spatiotemporal transposcriptome of the developing human brain, we have analysed two independent RNA-seq datasets encompassing 16 distinct brain regions from eight weeks post-conception into adulthood. We reveal an anti-correlated, KZFP:TE transcriptional profile defining the late prenatal to early postnatal transition, and the spatiotemporal and cell type specific activation of TE-derived alternative promoters driving the expression of neurogenesis-associated genes. We also demonstrate experimentally that a co-opted antisense L2 element drives temporal protein re-localisation away from the endoplasmic reticulum, suggestive of novel TE dependent protein function in primate evolution.

These infections are interesting systems to study mechanisms which could be relevant for the pathogenesis of certain human diseases. One major factor influencing the outcome of infection is related to the virus. To understand the virological basis for neurovirulence we compared JHM-virus isolates with different biological properties. JHM-Wt causes only acute disease, JHM-Ts43 a demyelinating encephalomyelitis and a virus shedded from persistently infected cells (JHM-Pi) is not virulent at all. The spread of these viruses in glial cell cultures reflects their different neurovirulence for animals. The peplomer E2 of these viruses reveals structural and antigenic differences. We characterised the epitopes of E2 with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Four epitopes are associated with regions important for neutralisation, cell fusion and attachment. More than five epitopes are not related to such functions. Epitopes differ in their location and accessibility on the E2 protein subunits between JHM-Wt, JHM-Ts43 and JHM-Pi. To identify epitopes in regions important for pathogenesis, we performed animal studies with variants selected by monoclonal antibodies. Variants changed in a defined epitope (E2-Ba) induce in Balb/c mice a chronic disease. Variants changed in only one of the other three neutralisation epitopes induce acute disease. These results support and extend the observation that the peplomer protein E2 is a major determinant for virulence and antigenic variability of coronaviruses 1,4,5,6,8,10,17,19,22,23. Increasing evidence had been obtained that certain structural features of this protein are important for the cell tropism of the virus. Furthermore, this protein influences strongly the type and specificity of immune responses against viral and host antigens. The highly advanced knowledge on structure and replication of coronaviruses will be of great value to analyze further mechanisms leading to inflammatory demyelinating diseases associated with a persistent virus infection.","output":"Coronavirus JHM induced demyelinating disease: specific domains on the E2-protein are associated with neurovirulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrated the need for accurate and fast diagnosis methods for emergent viral diseases. Soon after the emergence of COVID-19, medical practitioners used X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of patients' lungs to detect COVID-19. Machine learning methods are capable of improving the identification accuracy of COVID-19 in X-ray and CT images, delivering near real-time results, while alleviating the burden on medical practitioners. In this work, we demonstrate the efficacy of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, trained with a combination of deep convolutional and handcrafted features extracted from X-ray chest scans. We use this combination of features to discriminate between healthy, common pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients. The performance of the combined feature approach is compared with a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) and the SVM trained with handcrafted features. We find that combining the features in our novel framework improves the performance of the classification task compared to the independent application of convolutional and handcrafted features.

However, its role in cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload is still elusive. We aimed to examine the role of sFRP2 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by aortic banding (AB), the expression of sFRP2 was downregulated in the hypertrophic ventricle. Adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) was injected through the tail vein to overexpress sFRP2 in the mouse myocardium. Overexpression of sFRP2 alleviated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as identified by the reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, heart weight/body weight ratio, and left ventricular (LV) collagen ratio. Additionally, sFRP2 decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by pressure overload. Western blot showed that sFRP2 prevented the expression of active -catenin. The Wnt/-catenin agonist LiCl (1 mmol/kg) abolished the inhibitory effects of sFRP2 on cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased cross-sectional area and LV collagen ratio and the deterioration of echocardiographic data. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that decreased sFRP2 levels were observed in failing mouse hearts. Overexpression of sFRP2 attenuated myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis induced by hypertrophic stimuli by inhibiting the Wnt/-catenin pathway. We revealed that sFRP2 may be a promising therapeutic target for the development of cardiac remodeling.

However, little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with neurological disorders. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 and its effect on neurological symptoms in patients with preexisting neurological disorder and COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) and medRxiv databases for reports of patients with both preexisting neurological disorders and COVID-19. Studies reporting data on changes in the symptoms of preexisting neurological disorders and/or the severity of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles with 2278 patients with preexisting neurological disorder and COVID-19 were identified. Of 232 patients, 74 (31.9 %) showed exacerbation of preexisting neurological symptoms of dementia (55/92; 59.5 %), Parkinson's disease (10/17; 58.8 %), epilepsy (1/1; 100 %), and unspecified neurological disorders (8/106; 7.5 %).

When testing two benchmark datasets, RPI369 and RPI2241, the combined method (CTF+CGR) showed some superiority compared with four existing tools. Especially on RPI2241, the CTF+CGR method improved prediction accuracy (ACC) from 0.91 (the best record of all published works) to 0.95.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of liquidity risk and credit risk management on accounting and market performances of banks operating in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel data regression analysis on a sample of 51 listed commercial banks operating in 10 MENA countries during the period 2010C2018. Findings: The results show that credit risk management does not affect the accounting performance of banks, while it has a non-linear, convex relationship with market performance. Surprisingly, liquidity risk management is not a significant driver for either performance measure in studied banks. However, when a bank combines credit risk management with liquidity risk management efforts, liquidity risk management actions return significant results on both performances, illustrated by an inverted U-shaped relationship. In addition, this study examines the joint impact of both risks on bank performance. This study reveals that accounting and market performances are differently affected by joint risk management efforts. Their impact depends on the combination of risk management ratios upon which banks choose to focus their efforts. Practical implications: The findings help bankers and regulators further consider non-linearities and offer them new tools for managing the impact of credit and liquidity risk interactions towards achieving more financial stability.

This study proposed a possible estimating equation for clinical use of high antibody titer convalescent plasma. METHODS A total of 38 patients were recruited in the Guanggu District Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province from March 1 to 30, 2020. COVID-19 convalescent plasma was collected and high-titer (1:640) anti-S-RBD units used. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid viral load was measured 24 h before and 72 h after convalescent plasma infusion. RESULTS Convalescent plasma therapy was associated with reduced viral load in patients with moderate and severe severity. The viral negative rate at 72 h was 65.8%. The disappearance of viral nucleic acid in study patients was positively correlated with infuscate antibody titer and volume (r = 0.3375, p = 0.04). A possible estimation equation was as follows: Log10 (Reduction in viral load) = 0.18 + 0.001  (Log2 S-RBD antibody titer  Plasma infusion volume) (r = 0.424, p = 0.009). In a single case, the viral nucleic acid persisted 14 days after the fourth plasma infusion. CONCLUSIONS This study proposes a potential dose-response equation that adds a convenient way to estimate the dose of convalescent plasma product. It is beneficial to facilitate the rational allocation of plasma with high antibody titers and provide an individualised use strategy for convalescent plasma therapy.","output":"A possible dose-response equation: Viral load after plasma infusion in COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in convalescent plasma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concept of endoscopic lumen apposition has seen a dramatic shift in the last several decades.

In this study, we demonstrated that FXR expression was downregulated in colon cancer tissues and decreased expression of FXR predicted a poor prognosis. Knockdown of FXR promoted colon cancer cell growth and invasion in vitro, and facilitated xenograft tumor formation and distant metastasis in vivo, whereas ectopic expression of FXR had the reserved change. Mechanistic studies indicated that FXR exerted its tumor suppressor functions by antagonizing Wnt/-catenin signaling. Furthermore, we identified an FXR/-catenin interaction in colon cancer cells. The FXR/-catenin interaction impaired -catenin/TCF4 complex formation. In addition, our study suggested a reciprocal relationship between FXR and -catenin, since loss of -catenin increased the transcriptional activation of SHP by FXR.

To impart principles of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) and infection prevention and control (IPC), we developed a curriculum tailored to the diverse aptitudes of learners at our medical center. METHODS. We integrated case-based modules, group learning activities, smartphone applications (apps), decision support tools, and prescription audit and feedback into curricula of the medical school, medicine residency program, infectious diseases (ID) fellowship program, and hospital medicine program operations. Interventions were implemented in 2012C2016 using a quasi-experimental before-and-after study design, and this was assessed using pre- and postintervention surveys or audit of antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS. Over 180 medical students participated in the AS and IPC seminars. After smartphone app introduction, 69% reported using the app as their preferred source of antibiotic information. Approximately 70% of students felt comfortable prescribing antibiotics for a known infection compared with 40% at baseline (P = .02), and approximately 83% were able to identify the appropriate personal protective equipment for specific scenarios. Approximately 99% agreed that they have a role in promoting patient safety and preventing healthcare-associated infections as medical students. At 20 months, appropriateness of trainee antibiotic prescriptions increased by 20% (P < .01). Almost all ID fellows indicated that the AS and IPC seminar was a vital training supplement. Uptake of internist antibiotic recommendations using AS decision support tools was approximately 70%. CONCLUSIONS.

Despite the current declining numbers globally, the direct effects of the pandemic on institutional practices and on personal stress and coping mechanisms remains unknown. The aims of this study were to assess the effect of the pandemic on daily scheduling and work balances, its effects on stress, and to determine compliance with guidelines and to assess whether quarantining has led to other areas of increased productivity METHODS: A trans-Atlantic convenience sample of paediatric urologists was created in which panellists (Zoom) discussed the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual units, as well as creating a questionnaire using a mini-Delphi method to provide current semi-quantitative data regarding practice, and adherence levels to recently published risk stratification guidelines. They also filled out a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire to assess contemporary pandemic stress levels. RESULTS: There was an 86% response rate from paediatric urologists. The majority of respondents reported near complete disruption to planned operations (70%), and trainee education (70%). They were also worried about the effects of altered home-lives on productivity (90%), as well as a lack of personal protective equipment (57%). The baseline stress rate was measured at a very high level (PSS) during the pandemic.

The CSC concept has been discussed in the literature more than a decade. This study aims to find out the theoretical roots of CSC by analyzing scholarly articles in literature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses document cocitation analysis for reaching this aim. After retrieving data from Web of Science database, this paper explores data set by considering used references of these publications and clusters them based on their title terms and visualizes them by using cosine similarity index. Findings: This paper concludes that CSC is mainly discussed along with sustainability, sustainable supply chains and green supply chains, where the focus is integrating circular economy principles to supply chain management (SCM). On the other hand, although resiliency is an essential characteristic of SCM, contribution of CSC to supply chain resilience is neglected in the literature. Research limitations/implications: CSC will gain importance in near future to increase national/firm productivity, and findings of this paper will give researchers insights for furthering their studies. Social implications: To avoid supply chain and market collapse caused by natural disruptions, supply chain resilience is of paramount importance.

METHODS: In this narrative review, after an overview of brain neurophysiology and function, as common substrates to understand the relationship between delirium and physical function, we explore the scientific evidence in: (1) physical dysfunction as a risk factor for delirium; (2) physical dysfunction as a symptom of delirium and (3) functional consequences related to delirium. Later, we analyze the physical therapy as one of the main strategies in multicomponent interventions to prevent delirium, by examining intervention studies including rehabilitation, which have shown to be effective in managing delirium. Finally, we analyze how frailty, delirium and physical exercise interact with each other. RESULTS: This review confirms the close relationship between delirium and physical dysfunction; therefore, it is not surprising that physical exercise is widely used in delirium preventive strategies. Although delirium is catalogued as a neurocognitive disorder, scientific evidence shows that it is also a motor disorder, which is to be expected, since a vast body of literature already supports an interaction between motor and cognitive function.

Increase in volume of distribution attributable to ECMO was demonstrated for nine (56%) drugs: cefotaxime, gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, micafungin, levetiracetam, clonidine, midazolam, and sildenafil (range: 23-345% increase relative to non-ECMO controls), which may suggest the need for higher initial dosing. Decreased volume of distribution was reported for two drugs: acyclovir and ribavirin (50 and 69%, respectively). Decreased clearance was reported for gentamicin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, bumetanide, and ranitidine (range: 26-95% decrease relative to non-ECMO controls). Increased clearance was reported for caspofungin, micafungin, clonidine, midazolam, morphine, and sildenafil (range: 25-455% increase relative to non-ECMO controls). Conclusions: There were substantial pharmacokinetic alterations in 70% of drugs studied in children on ECMO. However, studies evaluating pharmacokinetic changes of many drug classes and those that allow direct comparisons between ECMO and non-ECMO patients are still lacking. Systematic evaluations of pharmacokinetic alterations of drugs on ECMO that incorporate multidrug opportunistic trials, physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, and other methods are necessary for definitive dose recommendations.

Thrombocytopenia and thromboembolic complications are a composite factor associated with critical COVID-19 and increased mortality. Immune-inflammation-mediated destruction, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection per se and increased consumption are proposed to be responsible for thrombocytopenia. Multiple concomitant conditions or results caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are high risk factors for thrombosis. Recently, platelet activation and platelet-mediated immune inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection were also found to be the contributors to the thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. In addition to thrombus scoring system, D-dimer is an excellent indicator for monitoring thrombosis. COVID-19 patients with high risk for thrombosis should be subjected to early thromboprophylaxis, and prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time should not be a barrier to the use of anticoagulation therapies in the control of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rev Bras Med Fam Comunidade.

During the initial phases of infection the virus causes pauci-inflammatory alveolar and interstitial edema that result in imaging abnormalities dominated by ground glass opacities (GGO). Severe SARS cases can develop radiologic and pathologic findings of diffuse alveolar damage. Although radiologic evidence of acute bronchiolitis is absent, SARS-CoV also infects ciliated airway epithelium, probably accounting for respiratory transmissibility of the virus. Radiologic recovery from SARS can be complete, but computed tomography images often show persistent GGO and reticular opacities, some of which reflect pathologic findings of fibrosis. Long-term follow-up imaging of survivors shows gradual decrease of GGO and reticulation with persistent air trapping in some patients.

The word 'epidemic' has the potential to lead to chaotic, unreasoned responses to health problems, especially when used by journalists. Nigeria like other poor resource countries is equally affected by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Standardization and proper documentation of the mortality of the COVID-19 in the poor-resource countries will help in managing other disease outbreaks in future. This paper calls for improvement in capturing of these data for better planning in the future. AREAS COVERED: Quality data is very essential for policy makers to appreciate any disease condition. In order to present a comprehensive picture of COVID-19 mortality, the deaths were broadly grouped into two as follows: direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths. Most of the current reported deaths seem to be direct deaths. EXPERT OPINION: We propose that for better estimation and standardization, verbal autopsy could be used to differentiate direct/indirect COVID deaths. At full development, this model could be applied to other diseases, outbreaks, or pandemics. The disease surveillance officers, and other health workers can be trained in this regard as well as scaling up the e-surveillance of the DSNOs.","output":"Call for proper documentation of COVID-19 deaths in poor resource setting: a necessity for management of future occurrences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder, may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19.

Background. SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has had a great impact worldwide and its mortality has been reported to be higher in patients with haematological malignancies. However, description of its effects and outcomes among recipient of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is scarce. Objectives. To describe the characteristics, treatment and outcome of COVID-19 in recipients of HSCT reported to the Madrid registry of COVID-19 (HEMATO-MADRID COVID-19 registry). Results. Data of 842 patients from 23 hospitals with haematological malignancies and COVID-19 infection were reported in the Madrid registry between March and June 2020. Among those, 87 (10.3%) patients were HSCT recipients: 58 auto-HSCT and 29 allo-HSCT (7 of them from matched related donor (MRD), 12 matched unrelated donor (MUD) and 10 haplo-HSCT). Characteristics of the population are described in Table 1. Median age at COVID-19 infection was 61 years (IQR, 53-67) and 35 patients (40%) were female. Recipients of auto-HSCT with COVID-19 were older and showed a trend towards a higher incidence of arterial hypertension (28% vs 10%, p=0.067) without statistical differences in other comorbidities; active disease requiring treatment at COVID-19 diagnosis was more frequent in auto-HSCT recipients (65% vs. 21%, p<0.001). Median time from transplant to COVID19 infection was shorter in allo-HSCT patients (32 vs. 19 months, p=0.043). Nearly 40% of allo-recipients had active GVHD at COVID-19 debut, including pulmonary GVHD. A total of 63 (72%) patients required hospital admission and 13 patients (15%) received intensive care support. Allo-recipients showed a trend towards a higher need of hospital admission (79% vs. 68%, p=0.081). Most patients received anti-viral treatment with either hydroxichloroquine (47 patients, 54%), lopinavir/ritonavir (34 patients, 39%), remdesivir (5, 4%) and/or other treatments including azythromicin or interferon. 23 patients (26%) received anticytokine treatment with tocilizumab (15, 17%) and/or anakinra (8, 9%) and 27 patients (31%) received steroids. The overall response rate to treatment and supportive care was 80% in both groups. After a median follow-up of 50 days after the infection debut, overall-survival at day 50 was 84% for auto and 82% for allo-HSCT recipients (p=0.915). However, global mortality rate among the complete observation period was significantly higher in allo-recipients (24% vs. 17%, p <0.001). Conclusion. In our multicentric experience in a high COVID-19 impacted area, the median time of COVID-19 infection presentation was relatively late in transplanted patients, however shorter in allo-transplanted patients. COVID-19 related mortality was high in HSCT recipients, significantly higher in allo-transplanted patients. Factors associated to this higher mortality should be further investigated to promptly identify high-risk patients since the pandemic is still highly active worldwide.

We tested the hypothesis that a combination of these risk factors, a 'double low', is associated with death and major complications after cardiac surgery. Methods We used data from 8239 cardiac surgical patients from two US hospitals. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and a composite of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. We examined whether patients who had a case-averaged double low, defined as time-weighted average BIS and MAP (calculated over an entire case) below the sample mean but not in the reference group, had increased risk of the primary outcomes compared with patients whose BIS and/or MAP were at or higher than the sample mean. We also examined whether a prolonged cumulative duration of a concurrent double low (simultaneous low MAP and BIS) increased the risk of the primary outcomes. Results Case-averaged double low was not associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality {odds ratio [OR] 1.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-3.18] vs reference; P =0.01} or the composite of in-hospital mortality and morbidity [OR 1.47 (95% CI 0.98-2.20); P =0.01] after correction for multiple outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS An intensive research effort was carried out on prosthetics that are commercially available worldwide. We conducted a search of the medical literature and companies' websites to find the weights and thicknesses of commercially available prosthetics. Where these data were lacking, we contacted manufacturers directly in order to render the research more complete. A total of 166 products were considered for classification based on biomaterial properties. Among these, a homogeneous group of 80 polypropylene monofilament knitted or woven prosthetics was selected for classification based on weight. Weights were provided for 70 prosthetics (87%), and both the weight and thickness was provided for 40 prosthetics (50%). RESULTS Classification based on weight: Ultra-light <35 g/m(2), Light 35 < 70 g/m(2), Standard 70 < 140 g/m(2), Heavy 140 g/m(2). Classification based on biomaterial composition: simple (prosthetics made of one pure biomaterial); composite (prosthetics made of two or more different layers); combined (prosthetics made of two materials knitted or woven together); and biologic.

Currently available influenza vaccines are designed to protect against four influenza viruses: A(H1N1)pdm09 (the 2009 pandemic virus), A(H3N2), B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage. Most influenza viruses detected this season have been A(H3N2) (2). With the exception of the 2020-21 season, when data were insufficient to generate an estimate, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine at preventing laboratory-confirmed, mild/moderate (outpatient) medically attended acute respiratory infection (ARI) each season since 2004-05. This interim report uses data from 3,636 children and adults with ARI enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network during October 4, 2021-February 12, 2022. Overall, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended outpatient ARI associated with influenza A(H3N2) virus was 16% (95% CI = -16% to 39%), which is considered not statistically significant. This analysis indicates that influenza vaccination did not reduce the risk for outpatient medically attended illness with influenza A(H3N2) viruses that predominated so far this season. Enrollment was insufficient to generate reliable VE estimates by age group or by type of influenza vaccine product (1). CDC recommends influenza antiviral medications as an adjunct to vaccination; the potential public health benefit of antiviral medications is magnified in the context of reduced influenza VE. CDC routinely recommends that health care providers continue to administer influenza vaccine to persons aged 6 months as long as influenza viruses are circulating, even when VE against one virus is reduced, because vaccine can prevent serious outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death) that are associated with influenza A(H3N2) virus infection and might protect against other influenza viruses that could circulate later in the season.","output":"Interim Estimates of 2021C22 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness  United States, February 2022"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Scientific innovation is often achieved through the intersection of ideas from different fields.

DESIGN The study was planned prospectively and observationally. SETTING The study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS Coronavirus disease 2019 patients older than 18 years old, polymerase chain reaction test positive, with signs of pneumonia on tomography, and hospitalized were included in the study. ICU need, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in-hospital mortality were considered as primary endpoints. INTERVENTIONS Blood samples were taken from patients three times for angiotensin II levels. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Angiotensin II levels were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The SPSS 24.0 program (Statistics Program for Social Scientists, SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to analyze the data. A total of 112 patients were included in the study, of which 63.4% of the patients were men. The serum angiotensin II levels were statistically significantly lower in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with the healthy control group (p < 0.001). There was no statistical significance between the serum angiotensin II levels measured at three different times (p > 0.05). The serum angiotensin II levels of the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were found to be statistically significantly lower than those without acute respiratory distress syndrome in three samples collected at different clinical periods (p < 0.05). The angiotensin II levels of the patients who required admission to the ICU at all three times of blood sample collection were found to be statistically significantly lower than those who did not (p < 0.05).

Objectives: To estimate the proportion of the population that was seropositive, identify factors associated with seropositive outcome, and approximate the proportion of residents that were asymptomatic. Methods: Seroconversion rates (IgG) were measured in a representative sample of over 17,000 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services. Direct standardization was used to estimate the seropositive rates for COVID-19 infection for members of the HMO. Rates were adjusted for sensitivity and specificity of the testing products used. In addition to blood sampling, respondents were asked to complete a digital survey regarding potential exposures and symptoms experienced. Results: It was estimated that 1.9% of the adult HMO population was seropositive 4 months after the first infected person was identified in the country. Seroconversion was associated with travel abroad and exposure to infected individuals. Loss of smell and taste, fever, cough, and fatigue are associated with infection. Of those found to be seropositive for COVID-19, 160 (59%) had a prior negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or no PCR test at all.

Otherwise, as IL-6 signaling negative regulator sIL-6R genetically increased, the risk of COVID-19 decreased using Weighted median (Beta = -0.038, p = 0.001;OR = 0.963) and Inverse variance weighted (IVW) (Beta = -0.028, p = 0.010;OR = 0.973). The result was further proven by other COVID-19 GWAS datasets and MR analysis methods including MR Egger, Simple mode, and Weighted mode. Conclusions: Our analysis suggested the causal link between genetically increased IL-6 signaling and increased risk of COVID-19. Thus, inhibition of IL-6 may be value treatment of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Mendelian Randomization Study on Causal Association of IL-6 Signaling with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a formulation of the SEIR concept that represents the evolution of an epidemic under the assumption of homogeneity and uniformity of the microscopic parameters: rate of infection, incubation and recovery/removal times. Non-homogeneities in the basic parameters are easily included by integration for arbitrary distributions of incubation and removal times, recovering the classical SEIR model under the assumption of exponential distributions. We compare the solution to these equations, uSEIR, to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases with the uSEIR solution. Furthermore a family of asymptotic solutions of the uSEIR equations is found in terms of a logistic curve, which after a non-universal time shift, fits extremely well all the microdynamical simulations. A link to software packages for the numerical solution of the uSEIR equations is provided.","output":"A simple formulation of non-Markovian SEIR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: The assessment of severity and prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection on admission is paramount to better triage the patient and predict the in-hospital mortality. Herein, we aim to evaluate the prognostic value of SOFA, qSOFA and mSOFA scores on the need of mechanical ventilation and outcome. We also hope to use the scoring system to better classify the different stages of disease in relation with the serology (IgM/IgG). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital between 10/1/2020 to 2/28/2021. Inclusion criteria was a well defined clinical outcome i.e., survived or expired and available serology. Demographics, and lab data were reviewed. Simple t-test was used for continuous variables and chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Univariate analysis was used to identify the potential predictive value of SOFA, qSOFA and mSOFA for the need of mechanical ventilation and outcome. GraphPad PRISM was used for all analysis. RESULTS: A total of 202 patients were included during the study period. Majority were latinx and black. Diabetes and hypertension were the most common comorbidities. High SOFA, qSOFA and mSOFA score were significantly associated with risk of mechanical ventilation (Log-likelihood ratio of 31.15, 11.24 and 42.45 respectively with p-value of <0.0001, 0.008 and <0.0001 respectively) and in-patient mortality (Log-likelihood ratio of 35.92, 7.12 and 47.42 respectively with p-value of <0.0001, 0.0076 and <0.0001 respectively). When comparing these scoring systems, mSOFA was better in mechanical ventilation prediction (AUC 0.8483) and mortality prediction (AUC 0.8882) as compared to SOFA and qSOFA. We further classified the patients into different stages of disease based on serology to determine a difference in the scoring system. 47 patients were classified into pre-cytokine storm stage with both IgM and IgG negative;116 patients into cytokine storm stage with IgM positive and 39 patients in post-cytokine storm stages with IgM negative and IgG positive. When comparing scores with different stages of the disease, patients in the pre-cytokine storm stage exhibited significantly higher scores. The significantly higher score in the pre-cytokine storm stage may help to predict the need of mechanical ventilation and mortality in this subgroup. Studies with larger sample size are required to evaluate the correlation between higher scores in the pre-cytokine storm stage with the need of mechanical ventilation and in-patient mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the role of SOFA, qSOFA and mSOFA scores to predict the need of mechanical ventilation and in-patient mortality. Larger prospective studies will be required to correlate these findings. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study shows the use of mSOFA and SOFA scores at admission on predicting the use of mechanical ventilation and outcome in different stage of the disease.

Existing surveillance provides a proxy of the COVID-19 caseload and mortalities; however, these measures make it difficult to identify the dynamics of the pandemic and places where outbreaks are likely to occur. Moreover, existing surveillance techniques have failed to measure the dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide additional surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission to track changes in the speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence in the transmission of the pandemic more accurately than existing metrics. METHODS: Through a longitudinal trend analysis, we extracted COVID-19 data over 45 days from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to monitor the daily number of cases in the LAC as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the LAC between September 30 and October 6, 2020, and between October 7 and 13, 2020. RESULTS: The LAC saw a reduction in the speed, acceleration, and jerk for the week of October 13, 2020, compared to the week of October 6, 2020, accompanied by reductions in new cases and the 7-day moving average. For the week of October 6, 2020, Belize reported the highest acceleration and jerk, at 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, which is particularly concerning, given its high mortality rate. The Bahamas also had a high acceleration at 1.5. In total, 11 countries had a positive acceleration during the week of October 6, 2020, whereas only 6 countries had a positive acceleration for the week of October 13, 2020. The TAC displayed an overall positive trend, with a speed of 10.40, acceleration of 0.27, and jerk of -0.31, all of which decreased in the subsequent week to 9.04, -0.81, and -0.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Metrics such as new cases, cumulative cases, deaths, and 7-day moving averages provide a static view of the pandemic but fail to identify where and the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 infects new individuals, the rate of acceleration or deceleration of the pandemic, and weekly comparison of the rate of acceleration of the pandemic indicate impending explosive growth or control of the pandemic.

This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of dental anatomy education through a CBCT technology tool, through teachers' and students' perspectives, adjusted according to the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. A cohort study and longitudinal exploratory analysis were performed. Forty undergraduate first-year dental students, from the University of Coimbra in Portugal, were selected as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two different teaching methods were applied during an identical time-period: face-to-face lectures complemented by physical models (T1 cohort) and webinar lectures complemented by CBCT images (T2 cohort). Learning outcomes were then studied according to theoretical and spatial orientation contexts. A self-reported survey that focused on students' satisfaction, stress, and support was studied. Both teaching methods were analyzed with paired sample student's t-test and Pearson Correlation Confidence intervals 95% with P < 0.05. Furthermore, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used for self-reported satisfaction survey validity and reliability analysis. The learning outcomes between T1 and T2 cohorts were statistically significant, (P < 0.001) corresponding to differences with a large effect degree (r > 0.60). Students' satisfaction, as measured on a six-point Likert scale, was positively influenced by the webinar lectures supplemented with CBCT images (T2 cohort) in a learning context (4.95  0.5) and future applications (5.92  0.27).

This approach was then used with the data related to COVID-19 to calculate early-death weeks associated with COVID-19 in France, the UK and the USA. RESULTS: As of week 20 of 2021, the rate of the total number of early-death weeks per the population of the USA is nearly two times compared to that of France and the UK, with 0.004% to 0.0021 and 0.0023%, respectively. The average numbers of early-death weeks after converting to units of years are 1.2, 1.0 and 1.3 years in France, the UK and the USA, respectively.

The main challenges in this area include, on the one hand, a search for savings of energy consumed, and, on the other hand, a reduction in pollution resulting from the use of transport or heat or energy sources. Cities and metropolises will become green only when they manage to cope with these problems. The article aims at showing various facets of sustainable smart city management. With relations, information and knowledge gaining importance as the key organisational resource, cities have become, as organisations, an essential element of contemporary societies and organisations. In recent times, the harmful emissions from heating installations have drawn the attention of the public opinion in Poland. Polish municipalities distribute heat which mostly comes from local, most often district heating systems where energy is generated on a wide scale from coal combustion. This study compares the results of an air quality survey and those of a case study to assess the potential for the implementation of an automated heat control system in cities. On the basis of solutions implemented in the Warsaw Metropolis, the possibility of their implementation in the Upper Silesian (GZM) and Pozna Metropolises, too, was also assessed. Throughout Poland, there is a large potential for the application of innovative smart technologies in district heating systems to reduce the levels of harmful emissions. These reductions, which are still possible, could translate into a significant improvement in the attractiveness and competitiveness of municipalities.

Microscopic observations revealed that mannitol treatment induced crumpled inner membrane, an increase in periplasmic space, uneven cell surface with outer membrane vesicles, disruption of membrane structures, release of intracellular matter including chlorophylls, and eventual cell lysis in strain NIES-298, which differed from the previously proposed cell death modes.

The uPAR primary ligand is the serine protease urokinase (uPA), converting plasminogen into plasmin, a broad spectrum protease, active on most extracellular matrix components. Besides uPA, the uPAR binds specifically also to the matrix protein vitronectin and, therefore, is regarded also as an adhesion receptor. Complex formation of the uPAR with diverse transmembrane proteins, including integrins, formyl peptide receptors, G protein-coupled receptors and epidermal growth factor receptor results in intracellular signalling. Thus, the uPAR is a multifunctional receptor coordinating surface-associated pericellular proteolysis and signal transduction, thereby affecting physiological and pathological mechanisms. The uPAR-initiated signalling leads to remarkable cellular effects, that include increased cell migration, adhesion, survival, proliferation and invasion. Although this is beyond the scope of this review, the uPA/uPAR system is of great interest to cancer research, as it is associated to aggressive cancers and poor patient survival. Increasing evidence links the uPA/uPAR axis to epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a highly dynamic process, by which epithelial cells can convert into a mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore, many reports indicate that the uPAR is involved in the maintenance of the stem-like phenotype and in the differentiation process of different cell types. Moreover, the levels of anchor-less, soluble form of uPAR, respond to a variety of inflammatory stimuli, including tumorigenesis and viral infections. Finally, the role of uPAR in virus infection has received increasing attention, in view of the Covid-19 pandemics and new information is becoming available.

Health Information Exchange (HIE) solutions have been shown to be effective in supporting patient care, however, user adoption often varies among users and care settings. This service evaluation aimed to measure user acceptance of HIE and explore barriers and facilitators to its wider uptake. METHODS: A mixed-method study design was used. A questionnaire was developed using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and administered to HIE users to assess technology acceptance. Pearson Chi(2) tests were used to examine differences in acceptance between user groups and care settings. Web-based, semi-structured interviews were conducted drawing on the Normalisation Process Theory to explore barriers and facilitators to adoption. Interview data were analysed thematically using the Framework Approach. RESULTS: A total of 105 HIE users completed the survey and another 12 participated in the interviews. Significant differences were found in HIE acceptance between users groups and care settings, with high adopters demonstrating higher acceptance and social care users showing lower acceptance. Participants identified several drivers to adoption, including increased information accessibility, better care coordination, informed decision-making, improved patient care, reduced duplication of procedures, and time and cost savings. However, they also highlighted a number of barriers, such as lack of awareness about the solution and its value, suboptimal communication strategies, inadequate training and lack of resources for knowledge dissemination, absence of champions to support the implementation, lack of end-user involvement in the implementation and evaluation of HIE, unclear accountability and responsibility for the overall success of the programme, and patient confidentiality concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Working to better engage stakeholders, considering the needs of users from different care settings, providing users with training resources and support to increase their knowledge and confidence in using the system, developing implementation strategies to seek user feedback and monitor performance, and using communication strategies to increase awareness of the product and its value, can help improve uptake and adoption of HIE.

Irregular corneal shape parameters' correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were determined in order to understand which corneal slope parameter has the strongest correlation with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. RESULTS: Parameters characterising the corneal surface's correlations with contrast sensitivity were from r = 0.25 (p = 0.03) at 3 cpd to r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd for the highest elevation and from r = 0.33 (p = 0.09) at 5 cpd to r = 0.40 (p < 0.01) at 11 cpd for the lowest elevation in all subjects together, while for visual acuity the parameters were r = 0.30 (p < 0.01) for the highest elevation and r = 0.21 (p = 0.06) for the lowest elevation in all subjects together. The correlation between contrast sensitivity and the highest and lowest corneal point in all measured cornea was stronger for subjects with a peripheral corneal apex than for those with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, contrast sensitivity displayed a strong correlation with slope in the central part of the cornea (with a radius of 1 mm) ranging from 0.48 (p < 0.01) at 3 cpd to 0.61 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd. CONCLUSION: Contrast sensitivity has a higher correlation with corneal shape parameters than with visual acuity. Subjects with a peripheral corneal apex had stronger correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity than did subjects with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, the strongest correlation was for contrast sensitivity and elevation (slope) in the region within a 1 mm radius of the corneal centre in the opposite direction of the keratoconus apex (direction (ax) CB).","output":"The impact of irregular corneal shape parameters on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the consistency of causal statements in the abstracts of observational studies published in The BMJ. Design: Research on research study. Data source: All cohort or longitudinal studies describing an exposure-outcome relationship published in The BMJ during 2018. We also had access to the submitted papers and reviewer reports. Main outcome measures: Proportion of published research papers with 'inconsistent' use of causal language in the abstract. Papers where language was consistently causal or non-causal were classified as 'consistently causal' or 'consistently not causal', respectively; those where causality may be inferred were classified as 'suggests causal'. For the 'inconsistent' papers, we then compared the published and submitted version. Results: Of 151 published research papers, 60 described eligible studies. Of these 60, we classified the causal language used as 'consistently causal' (13%), 'suggests causal' (35%), 'inconsistent' (20%) and 'consistently not causal'(32%). The majority of the 'Inconsistent' papers (92%) were already inconsistent on submission. The inconsistencies found in both submitted and published versions was mainly due to mismatches between objectives and conclusions. One section might be carefully phrased in terms of association while the other presented causal language. When identifying only an association, some authors jumped to recommending acting on the findings as if motivated by the evidence presented. Conclusion: Further guidance is necessary for authors on what constitutes a causal statement and how to justify or discuss assumptions involved.

We assessed attitudes toward influenza and COVID-19 vaccines and the relation between hesitancy to influenza vaccine and hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: A structured questionnaire administered during September 2020 to a representative sample of the Jewish Israeli population assessed attitudes and acceptance of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. Factors for vaccine hesitancy were determined using logistic regression. Questionnaires were administered prior to the release of clinical data regarding efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines and prior to vaccine rollout. RESULTS: We approached 10,625 people, of these 2,080 responded (19%), and 2,024 completed the questionnaire (97.3%), 64.9% aged 15C64 years and 35.1% aged 65 years. 37% had co-morbidities. 43.5% experienced financial deterioration due to the pandemic. 65.9% received influenza vaccine 1 time in the past. Influenza vaccination rates were higher in the elderly (81.8%). Reasons for influenza vaccine hesitancy were opinions that the vaccine is ineffective (27.1%), and fear of side effects (29.3%). 8.2% of people aged 16C64 and 13.8% of people aged65 refused to be vaccinated at least once over the course of ones lifetime. Percent of responders willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were higher than percent of responders willing to receive the influenza vaccine both in people aged 16C64 years (942 (72.3%) vs. 38.4%, respectively) and in people 65 years and older (84.0% vs. 76.8%, respectively). Hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccine was associated with hesitancy towards other vaccines. Only 26.8% would participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. CONCLUSIONS: Willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine was higher than willingness to receive influenza vaccine. The results point to areas of fear from influenza vaccines side effects and lack of knowledge regarding influenza vaccines effectiveness that can be addressed to increase acceptance. Hesitancy towards other vaccines was associated with hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Attitudes towards influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic among a representative sample of the Jewish Israeli population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article looks at the rise of the conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rapid diagnosis kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. STUDY DESIGN: Three monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein were used to develop an antigen-antibody-based immunochromatographic kit to detect SARS-CoV-2. These assays were evaluated using nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients suspected of having COVID-19. RESULTS: These assays detected recombinant SARS-CoV-2a?N protein at concentrations >0.2a?ng/mL within 10a?min after protein loading, but did not detect the N proteins of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 299E (HCoV-229E) and other pathogens causing respiratory infections.

SSA countries bear significantly high proportions of TB and HIV cases reported worldwide, compared to countries in the West. Whilst COVID-19 epidemiology appears to vary across Africa, most countries in this region have reported relatively lower-case counts compared to the West. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional burden to already overstretched health systems in SSA, which, among other things, have been focused on the longstanding dual epidemics of TB and HIV. As with these dual epidemics, inadequate resources and poor case identification and reporting may be contributing to underestimations of the COVID-19 case burden in SSA. Modelling studies predict that the pandemic-related disruptions in TB and HIV services will result in significant increases in associated morbidity and mortality over the next five years. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with TB and HIV are associated with increased mortality risk in SSA. However, predictive models require a better evidence-base to accurately define the impact of COVID-19, not only on communicable diseases such as TB and HIV, but on non-communicable disease comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess morbidity and mortality data among both adults and children across the African continent, paying attention to geographic disparities, as well as the clinical and socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in the setting of TB and/or HIV.","output":"Minimizing the Impact of the Triple Burden of COVID-19, Tuberculosis and HIV on Health Services in sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 first spread from Wuhan, China in December 2019 but it has already created one of the greatest pandemic situations ever witnessed. According to the current reports, a situation has arisen when people need to understand the importance of social distancing and take enough precautionary measures more seriously. Maintaining social distancing and proper hygiene, staying at isolation or adopting the self-quarantine strategy are some common habits which people should adopt to avoid from being infected. And the growing information regarding COVID-19, its symptoms and prevention strategies help the people to take proper precautions. In this present study, we have considered a SAIRS epidemiological model on COVID-19 transmission where people in the susceptible environment move into asymptotically exposed class after coming contact with asymptotically exposed, symptomatically infected and even hospitalised people. The numerical study indicates that if more people from asymptotically exposed class move into quarantine class to prevent further virus transmission, then the infected population decreases significantly. The disease outbreak can be controlled only if a large proportion of individuals become immune, either by natural immunity or by a proper vaccine. But for COVID-19, we have to wait until a proper vaccine is developed and hence natural immunity and taking proper precautionary measures is very important to avoid from being infected. In the latter part, a corresponding optimal control problem has been set up by implementing control strategies to reduce the cost and count of overall infected individuals. Numerical figures show that the control strategy, which denotes the social distancing to reduce disease transmission, works with a higher intensity almost after one month of implementation and then decreases in the last few days. Further, the control strategy denoting the awareness of susceptible population regarding precautionary measures first increases up to one month after implementation and then slowly decreases with time. Therefore, implementing control policies may help to reduce the disease transmission at this current pandemic situation as these controls reduce the overall infected population and increase the recovered population.","output":"Modelling the role of optimal social distancing on disease prevalence of COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors have withdrawn this preprint due to author disagreement.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the chiropractic profession: a cross-sectional survey on opinions, professional changes, and personal hardships of U.S. chiropractors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Memory T cells resulting from primary dengue virus (DENV) infection are hypothesized to influence the clinical outcome of subsequent DENV infection. However, the few studies involving prospectively collected blood samples have found weak and inconsistent associations with outcome and variable temporal trends in DENV-specific memory T cell responses between subjects. This study used both ex-vivo and cultured ELISPOT assays to further evaluate the associations between DENV serotype-cross-reactive memory T cells and severity of secondary infection. Using ex-vivo ELISPOT assays, frequencies of memory T cells secreting IFN- in response to DENV structural and non-structural peptide pools were low in PBMC from multiple time points prior to symptomatic secondary DENV infection and showed a variable response to infection. There were no differences in responses between subjects who were not hospitalized (NH, n=6) and those who were hospitalized with dengue hemorrhagic fever (hDHF, n=4). In contrast, responses in cultured ELISPOT assays were more reliably detectable prior to secondary infection and showed more consistent increases after infection. Responses in cultured ELISPOT assays were higher in individuals with hDHF (n=8) compared to NH (n=9) individuals before the secondary infection, with no difference between these groups after infection. These data demonstrate an association of pre-existing DENV-specific memory responses with the severity of illness in subsequent DENV infection, and suggest that frequencies of DENV-reactive T cells measured after short-term culture may be of particular importance for assessing the risk for more severe dengue disease.","output":"Longitudinal Analysis of Dengue Virus-Specific Memory T Cell Responses and Their Association With Clinical Outcome in Subsequent DENV Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teachers and students are adjusting to an ever-changing world and so the field of teaching must readjust as well.

Increasingly, it is becoming clear that childcare centers must be (at least partially) operational in order to further mitigate the socially debilitating challenges related to pandemic induced closures. However, proposals to safely reopen childcare while limiting COVID-19 outbreaks remain understudied, and there is a pressing need for evidence-based scrutiny of the plans that are being proposed. Thus, in order to support safe childcare reopening procedures, the present study employed an agent-based modeling approach to generate predictions surrounding risk of COVID-19 infection and student-days lost within a hypothetical childcare center hosting 50 children and educators. Based on existing proposals for childcare and school reopening in Ontario, Canada, six distinct room configurations were evaluated that varied in terms of child-to-educator ratio (15:2, 8:2, 7:3), and family clustering (siblings together vs. random assignment). The results for the 15:2 random assignment configuration are relevant to early childhood education in Ontario primary schools, which require two educators per classroom. High versus low transmission rates were also contrasted, keeping with the putative benefit of infection control measures within centers, yielding a total of 12 distinct scenarios. Simulations revealed that the 7:3 siblings together configuration demonstrated the lowest risk, whereas centres hosting classrooms with more children (15:2) experienced 3 to 5 times as many COVID-19 cases. Across scenarios, having less students per class and grouping siblings together almost always results in significantly lower peaks for number of active infected and infectious cases in the institution. Importantly, the total student-days lost to classroom closure were between 5 and 8 times higher in the 15:2 ratios than for 8:2 or 7:3. These results suggest that current proposals for childcare reopening could be enhanced for safety by considering lower ratios and sibling groupings.","output":"Model-based projections for COVID-19 outbreak size and student-days lost to closure in Ontario childcare centres and primary schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nine out of 10 constitutions contain explicit emergency provisions, intended to help governments cope with extraordinary events that endanger many people or the existence of the state.

We find that the more advantages emergency constitutions confer to the executive, the higher the number of people killed as a consequence of a natural disaster, controlling for its severity. As this is an unexpected result, we discuss a number of potential explanations, the most plausible being that governments use natural disasters as a pretext to enhance their power. Furthermore, the easier it is to call a state of emergency, the larger the negative effects on basic human rights.

This investigation aims to probe the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of Maltoamide F. METHODS: The possible toxicity of Maltoamide F was evaluated by an acute toxicity test. To assess the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of Maltoamide F on rats, the models of carrageenan-caused paw edema, xylene-induced ear edema, arachidonic-acid- (AA-) induced ear edema, formalin-caused plantar edema, and cotton-pellet-induced granuloma were established. Levels of TNF-, PGE-2, and IL-6 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Maltoamide F was safe at oral doses of 1C10 mg/kg for rats. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) notably reduced carrageenan-induced edema percentage of paws in rats and decreased levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF- in homogenates of foot tissues. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) reduced levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF- in foot tissues of formalin-induced rats. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) repressed AA-induced increase of ear thickness in rats and reduced levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF- in homogenates of ear tissues. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) reduced xylene-induced weight of ear edema in rats and reduced levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF- in homogenates of ear tissues. Maltoamide F (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) reduced levels of PGE-2, IL-6, and TNF- in homogenates of cotton ball granuloma of cotton-pellet-induced rats.

After 8 weeks, the rats were decapitated, and their muscle tissues were removed. Expression levels of Caspase-3, Caspase-6, Bax, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin 1 alpha (IL1-) and Bcl-2 proteins in muscle tissue were determined by western blotting method. Histopathological analyses were also performed on the muscle tissue. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) analyses were determined by a spectrophotometer. According to the obtained results, Bcl-2, TNF- and IL1- protein expression was increased in damage groups compared to the control and royal jelly groups, while Caspase-3, Caspase-6 and Bax protein expression levels decreased in damage groups. MDA level increased in damage groups compared to the control and royal jelly groups, while CAT and GSH levels increased with royal jelly application in royal jelly-given group in comparison to the flouride-exposed group.

METHODS: The study was a one-arm feasibility study including family caregivers of newly diagnosed patients with hematological cancer (n = 26) and caregiver ambassadors who were family caregivers of previously treated patients as peer supporters (n = 17). The one-on-one peer support intervention consisted of three components: a caregiver ambassador preparatory course; 12 weeks of one-on-one peer support, and caregiver ambassador network meetings. RESULTS: Family caregivers reported high satisfaction with the delivery and flexibility of one-on-one peer support and improved in most psychosocial outcomes over time. Telephone and text messages were the most used form of contact between the peers. Caregiver ambassadors reported high satisfaction with the preparatory course and used the available support from the network meetings. No adverse events were reported.

How the host immune system senses and responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unresolved. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the innate immune response through the cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the cellular level of 23-cGAMP associated with STING activation. cGAS recognizes chromatin DNA shuttled from the nucleus as a result of cell-to-cell fusion upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further demonstrate that the expression of spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 from host cells is sufficient to trigger cytoplasmic chromatin upon cell fusion. Furthermore, cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway, but not MAVS-mediated viral RNA sensing pathway, contributes to interferon and pro-inflammatory gene expression upon cell fusion. Finally, we show that cGAS is required for host antiviral responses against SARS-CoV-2, and a STING-activating compound potently inhibits viral replication. Together, our study reported a previously unappreciated mechanism by which the host innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection, mediated by cytoplasmic chromatin from the infected cells. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway may offer novel therapeutic opportunities in treating COVID-19. In addition, these findings extend our knowledge in host defense against viral infection by showing that host cells self-nucleic acids can be employed as a danger signal to alarm the immune system.","output":"Sensing of cytoplasmic chromatin by cGAS activates innate immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: South Korea faced the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak for the first time in 2015, which resulted in 186 infected patients and 39 deaths.

Methods: In total, 300 nurses from three of 15 isolation hospitals in South Korea were invited to participate. We collected data pertaining to PTSD, turnover intention, supervisor support, work-related factors, and socio-demographic factors through a structured survey distributed to the nurses at the hospitals after the outbreak.

Findings: Of the 147 participants, 33.3% were involved in the direct care of the infected patients, whereas 66.7% were involved in the direct care of the suspected patients. More than half (57.1%) of the nurses experienced PTSD, with 25.1% experienced full PTSD and 32.0% with moderate or some level of PTSD. The mean score of turnover intention was 16.3, with the score range of 4 to 20. The multiple regression analysis revealed that PTSD was positively associated with turnover intention, and supervisor support had a strong buffering effect. Conclusion/Application to Practice: These findings confirmed that after a fatal infectious disease outbreak like MERS, nurses experience high level of PTSD and show high intention to leave.

The authors examined the effects of anesthesia and hypercapnia on swallowing-breathing coordination. METHODS In a randomized controlled crossover study, general anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane was titrated using an up-down method to identify the threshold for suppression of the motor response to electrical stimulation of the forearm. Additional measurements included bispectral index, genioglossus electromyogram, ventilation (pneumotachometer), and hypopharyngeal pressure. During wakefulness and at each level of anesthesia, carbon dioxide was added to increase the end-tidal pressure by 4 and 8 mmHg. A swallow was defined as increased genioglossus activity with deglutition apnea and an increase in hypopharyngeal pressure. Spontaneous swallows were categorized as physiological (during expiration or followed by expiration) or pathological (during inspiration or followed by an inspiration). RESULTS A total of 224 swallows were analyzed. Anesthesia increased the proportion of pathological swallows (25.9% vs. 4.9%) and decreased the number of swallows per hour (1.73.3 vs. 28.022.3) compared to wakefulness. During anesthesia, hypercapnia decreased hypopharyngeal pressure during inspiration (-14.13.7 vs. -8.72 mmHg) and increased minute ventilation, the proportion of pathological swallows (19.1% vs. 12.3%), and the number of swallows per hour (5.517.0. vs. 1.35.5). CONCLUSIONS Anesthesia impaired the coordination between swallowing and respiration. Mild hypercapnia increased the frequency of swallowing during anesthesia and the likelihood of pathological swallowing.

The aim of this paper is to describe the protocols adopted and to evaluate their impact during the acute phase of Coronavirus spread, focusing on the management of elective and urgent/emergent surgery, outpatients activity, and also health staff preservation from intra-hospital Coronavirus disease 2019 infection. METHODS Several measures were progressively adopted in the Padova University Hospital to front the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, with a clear strong asset established by 9 March 2020, after the Northern Italy lockdown. Since this date, the Vascular Surgery Unit started a \\"scaled-down\\" activity, both for elective surgical procedures and for the outpatient Clinical activities; different protocols were developed for health preservation of staff and patients. We compared a two months period, 30 days before and 30 days after this time point. In particular, emergent vascular surgery was regularly guaranteed as well as urgent surgery (to be performed within 24 h). Elective cases were scheduled for \\"non-deferrable\\" pathology. A swab test protocol for COVID-19 was applied to health-care professionals and hospitalized patients. RESULTS The number of urgent or emergent aortic cases remained stable during the two months period, while the number of Hospital admissions via Emergency Room related to critical limb ischemia decreased after national lockdown by about 20%. Elective vascular surgery was scaled down by 50% starting from 9 March; 35% of scheduled elective cases refused hospitalization during the lockdown period and 20% of those contacted for hospitalization where postponed due to fever, respiratory symptoms, or close contacts with Coronavirus disease 2019 suspected cases. Elective surgery reduction did not negatively influence overall carotid or aortic outcomes, while we reported a higher major limb amputation rate for critical limb ischemia (about 10%, compared to 4% for the standard practice period). We found that 4 out of 98 (4%) health-care providers on the floor had an asymptomatic positive swab test. Among 22 vascular doctors, 3 had a confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 infection (asymptomatic); a total of 72 swab were performed (mean = 3.4 swab/person/month) during this period; no cases of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (deaths or requiring intensive care treatment) infection were reported within this period for the staff or hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS Elective vascular surgery needs to be guaranteed as possible during Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The number of truly emergent cases did not reduce, on the other side, Emergency Room accesses for non-emergent cases decreased.

We have plenty of data about the clinical features of the disease's acute phase, while little is known about the long-term consequences on survivors. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We aimed to review systematically emerging evidence about clinical and functional consequences of Covid-19 pneumonia months after hospital discharge. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Current evidence supports the idea that a high proportion of Covid-19 survivors complain of symptoms months after the acute illness phase, being fatigue and reduced tolerance to physical effort the most frequently reported symptom. The strongest association for these symptoms is with the female gender, while disease severity seems less relevant. Respiratory symptoms are associated with a decline in respiratory function and, conversely, seem to be more frequent in those who experienced a more severe acute pneumonia. Current evidence highlighted a persistent motor impairment which is, again, more prevalent among those survivors who experienced a more severe acute phase of the disease. Additionally, the persistence of symptoms is a primary determinant of mental health outcome, with anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress symptoms being commonly reported in Covid-19 survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Current literature highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to Coronavirus Disease 19 since the sequelae appear to involve different organs and systems.

Exponential law is utilized to present the existence and uniqueness of solutions using the fixed-point theory. The fractional stochastic approach is adopted to examine the same model to explore the random effect. Numerical simulations are used to support the theoretical results and the simulation results suggest that the increase of comorbidity development and the fractional-order derivative factor simultaneously increases the prevalence of the infection and the spread of the disease.

METHODS A detailed search of the scientific literature and narrative review was performed. RESULTS Headache in IIH is driven by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and reduction of ICP has been reported in some studies to reduce headache. Despite resolution of papilledema and normalization of raised ICP, a majority suffer persistent post-IIH headache. The lack of evidence-based management approaches leaves many untreated. Where clinicians attempt to manage IIH headache, they use off-label therapies to target the prevailing headache phenotype. A recent prospective open-label study demonstrated the effective use of a calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody therapy in IIH for persistent post-IIH headache. CONCLUSIONS There is overwhelming evidence of the headache burden in IIH. Studies are required to investigate the biological foundations of headache related to ICP and to develop treatments specifically directed to manage headache in IIH.","output":"Headache attributed to idiopathic intracranial hypertension and persistent post-idiopathic intracranial hypertension headache: A narrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo assess myocarditis and pericarditis reporting rate as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines authorized in Europe. MethodsData on myocarditis and pericarditis related to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (period: January 1, 2021 - February 11, 2022) were collected from the EudraVigilance database and combined with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Controls (ECDC) vaccination tracker database. The reporting rate was expressed as 1 million individual vaccinated-days with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and an observed-to-expected (OE) analysis was performed to check if there was an excess risk for myocarditis or pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. ResultsThe reporting rate of myocarditis per 1 million individual vaccinated-days in the study period was 17.27 (95% CI, 16.34-18.26) for the CX-024414 vaccine and 8.44 (95% CI, 8.18-8.70) for TOZINAMERAN vaccine. The reporting rate for pericarditis per 1 million individual vaccinated-days in the study period was 9.76 (95% CI, 9.06-10.51) for the CX-024414 vaccine and 5.79 (95% CI, 5.56-6.01) for TOZINAMERAN vaccine. The OE analysis showed that both vaccines produced a myocarditis standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) greater than 1, with the CX-024414 vaccine having a greater SMR than TOZINAMERAN. The SMR for pericarditis was greater than 1 when considering the lowest background incidence, but smaller than 1 when considering the highest background incidence. ConclusionsOur results suggest an excess risk of myocarditis following the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, but the relationship between pericarditis and mRNA COVID-19 vaccine remains unclear. KEY MESSAGESO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSCases of myocarditis and pericarditis were identified following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in Europe. This study needed to be done to quantify the elevated risk, if any, of myocarditis and pericarditis 28 days following Tozinameran and CX-024414 vaccination among Europeans. What this study addsThis study identifies an excess risk of myocarditis following the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, but not for pericarditis. When considering the lowest background incidence rate, the results showed a pericarditis SMR greater than 1, and when the highest background incidence was considered, TOZINAMERAN showed a smaller than 1 SMR. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe study helps inform healthcare professionals and laypeople of the COVID-19 vaccinations risks and benefits and, therefore, post-vaccination clinical practice.","output":"A pharmacoepidemiological study of myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Proper social participation and involvement in the daily activities of life increases the feeling of attachment, and increases a person's sense of worth, belonging, and dependence on society. Lack of social communication leads to anxiety, loneliness, depression, panic, mental. While COVID-19 has become a pandemic, public health measures to cut off human-to-human transmission may include quarantine and social isolation. Due to social distancing and quarantine practices, people's participation in many areas of social life and daily activities has been disrupted. The purpose of this study is to provide insight into the effects of the Covid 19 epidemic on integration into home activities, integration into the community and integration into productive activities, and overall determination of social participation during this epidemic.MethodsIn June 2020, the Social Integration Questionnaire (CIQ), which measures integration at home, integration in the community, and integration into purposeful and productive activities, was transcribed with the required demographic information in a web-based format. A total of 461 people (mean age 36.865.8 years) completed the social integration questionnaire in a cross-sectional study. The effects of Covid-19 on social interaction were then calculated by analyzing CIQ scores before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 and the data were analyzed using SPSS software version 22.ResultsComparing the participants score in the Community Integration Questionnaire before and after the COVID-19 pandemic showed that COVID-19 reduced home integration (from 4.69092.84 to 3.59382.80 , t= 11.151 p <0.000), social integration (from 8.65291.98 to 6.11502.10, t= 25.440, p <0.000), integration into productive and purposeful activities (from 5.31451.70 to 3.50982.02, t= 23.226, p <0.000) and total CIQ test score (from 18.65844.02 to 13.21854.56 , t= 29.022, p <0.000).

Membrane compartments comprise the system limiting cells (one or two membranes in bacteria, a unique plasma membrane in eukaryotes) and a variety of internal vesicular, subspherical, tubular, or reticulated organelles. In eukaryotes, the internal membranes comprise on the one hand the general endomembrane system, a dynamic network including organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the nuclear envelope, etc. and also the plasma membrane, which are linked via direct lateral connectivity (e.g. between the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear outer envelope membrane) or indirectly via vesicular trafficking. On the other hand, semi-autonomous organelles, i.e. mitochondria and chloroplasts, are disconnected from the endomembrane system and request vertical transmission following cell division. Membranes are organized as lipid bilayers in which proteins are embedded. The budding of some of these membranes, leading to the formation of the so-called lipid droplets (LDs) loaded with hydrophobic molecules, most notably triacylglycerol, is conserved in all clades. The evolution of eukaryotes is marked by the acquisition of mitochondria and simple plastids from Gram-positive bacteria by primary endosymbiosis events and the emergence of extremely complex plastids, collectively called secondary plastids, bounded by three to four membranes, following multiple and independent secondary endosymbiosis events. There is currently no consensus view of the evolution of LDs in the Tree of Life. Some features are conserved; others show a striking level of diversification.

This study aimed to examine the association between sexual identity and depression, and the potential mediating role of HIV-related stigma and moderating role of age. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 203 MSM living with HIV in Guangxi, China. Participants provided information on sexual identity, depression, HIV-related stigma, and background information. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and path analysis were applied to examine our hypotheses. Bivariate analysis demonstrated that participants who self-identified as gay reported a lower level of HIV-related stigma and depression. Path analysis revealed an insignificant direct effect of identifying as gay on depression. Yet, the indirect pathway was significant, with identifying as gay being associated with a lower level of HIV stigma and thus a lower level of depression. This indirect effect was moderated by age. The conditional indirect effect was significant in the younger group yet ceased in the older group. The study provided information to better understand the effect of sexual identity on mental health among stigmatized sexual and gender minorities by highlighting the mediating effect of HIV-related stigma and the protective effect of age. Interventions targeting mental health of MSM living with HIV might consider placing greater emphasis on addressing HIV-related stigma among younger MSM.","output":"HIV-Related Stigma, Sexual Identity, and Depressive Symptoms Among MSM Living With HIV in China: A Moderated Mediation Modeling Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Teledermatology is an alternative medical science that allows evaluation of patient's clinical information over a distance without requiring face-to-face examination.

The WHO has declared it a pandemic. In this regard, various researchers are working to develop a procedure or medications to control and cure it. For this, mathematical models have been developed to understand the transmission dynamics of the disease. Since the disease is transmitted from person to person, experts advise to keep social distance and to avoid unnecessary migration so that transmission may be reduced. This chapter is devoted to population dynamical models of fractional order and fuzzy population models to investigate COVID-19. Investigation of the proposed models corresponding to different values of migration of healthy and infected populations is carried out using different techniques. Also some existence results are established by using a fixed point theory approach and nonlinear analysis. Moreover, some semianalytical results related to approximate solution of both proposed models are investigated by using Laplace transform coupled with the Adomian decomposition method.

Due to the high metabolic rates during exercises, supplying sufficient ventilation in these places is essential and extremely important especially given the risk of infectious respiratory diseases like COVID-19. Traditional ventilation control methods rely on a single CO(2) sensor (often placed at return air duct), which is often difficult to reflect the human metabolic rates accurately, and thus can hardly control the infection risk instantly. Thus, to ensure a safe and healthy environment in places with high metabolism, a real-time metabolism-based ventilation control method is proposed. A computer vision algorithm is developed to monitor human activities (regarding human motion amplitude and speed) and an artificial neural network is established for metabolic prediction. Case studies show that the proposed metabolism-based ventilation control method can reduce the infection probability down to 4.3-6.3% while saving 13% of energy in comparison with the strategy of fixed-fresh-air ventilation. In the development of healthy and sustainable society, gymnasiums and alike exercise places are essential and the proposed ventilation control method is a promising solution to decrease the risk of COVID-19 while preserving features of energy saving and carbon emission reduction.","output":"Metabolism-based ventilation monitoring and control method for COVID-19 risk mitigation in gymnasiums and alike places"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious type of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has rapidly become a global pandemic.

Several studies have shown that demyelination in MS is caused by proinflammatory mediators and nitric oxide (NO), which is released by perivascular infiltrates and/or activated glial cells. Both endogenous NO released by microglia and astrocytes; and NO generated from exogenous NO donors are known to induce oligodendrocytes death. However, the molecular mechanism of oligodendroglial death is poorly understood. Here we explore the role of NO in modulating the expression of myelin-specific genes that leads to oligodendroglial death. We investigated the effect of NO on the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and proteolipid protein (PLP) in human primary oligodendrocytes. Combination of IFN- and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or double stranded RNA in the form of polyIC induced the production of NO and decreased the expression of myelin gene in human fetal mixed glial cultures. Either a scavenger of NO (PTIO) or an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (L-NIL) abrogated (LPS+IFN-)- and polyIC-mediated suppression of myelin genes in human mixed glial cells. The role of NO was further corroborated by the inhibition of myelin gene expression in purified human oligodendroglia by several NO donors including SNP, NOC-7, SIN-1, and SNAP.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH During custody in France, a medical consultation is provided for any patient who requests it. In the Paris area, this consultation is carried out by a practitioner in forensic medicine, based in a general hospital. Usually, most medical consultations for patients in custody take place directly in police stations. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the authors chose to suspend this activity, asking law enforcement to bring patients directly to their hospitals. Patients presenting with severe infections or indicative symptoms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection and a comorbidity are tested for COVID-19. Such patients remain hospitalized until results of the test are received. If the result is positive, they are hospitalized for the length of their custody. If sent to prison, they are transferred to a medical facility in detention. FINDINGS From the onset of the outbreak, the authors observed increased pressure from law enforcement to obtain medical information. According to the French Code of Medical Ethics, no medical information should be disclosed regarding the authors' patients' medical situations. The authors are also concerned about sending a potentially infected patient back to a police station, to prison or to his/her home.

Acute tubular injury is common, although it is often mild, despite markedly reduced kidney function. Systemic haemodynamic instability very likely contributes to tubular injury. Despite descriptions of COVID-19 as a cytokine storm syndrome, levels of circulating cytokines are often lower in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with causes other than COVID-19. Tissue inflammation and local immune cell infiltration have been repeatedly observed and might have a critical role in kidney injury, as might endothelial injury and microvascular thrombi. Findings of high viral load in patients who have died with AKI suggest a contribution of viral invasion in the kidneys, although the issue of renal tropism remains controversial.

Brain arterial remodeling stands out as a novel investigational target to understand the role of HIV in cerebrovascular and neurocognitive outcomes. We therefore conducted a review of publications in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library, from inception to April 2021. We included search terms such as HIV, cART, brain, neuroimmunity, arterial remodeling, cerebrovascular disease, and neurocognitive disorders. The literature shows that, in the post-cART era, PLWH continue to experience an increased risk of stroke and neurocognitive disorders (albeit milder forms) compared to uninfected populations. PLWH who are immunosuppressed have a higher proportion of hemorrhagic strokes and strokes caused by opportunistic infection and HIV vasculopathy, while PLWH on long-term cART have higher rates of ischemic strokes, compared to HIV-seronegative controls. Brain large artery atherosclerosis in PLWH is associated with lower CD4 nadir and higher CD4 count during the stroke event. HIV vasculopathy, a form of non-atherosclerotic outward remodeling, on the other hand, is associated with protracted immunosuppression. HIV vasculopathy was also linked to a thinner media layer and increased adventitial macrophages, suggestive of non-atherosclerotic degeneration of the brain arterial wall in the setting of chronic central nervous system inflammation. Cerebrovascular architecture seems to be differentially affected by HIV infection in successfully treated versus immunosuppressed PLWH. Brain large artery atherosclerosis is prevalent even with long-term immune reconstitution post-cART. HIV-associated changes in brain arterial walls may also relate to higher rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, although milder forms are more prevalent in the post-cART era. The underlying mechanisms of HIV-associated pathological arterial remodeling remain poorly understood, but a role has been proposed for chronic HIV-associated inflammation with increased burden on the vasculature. Neuroimaging may come to play a role in assessing brain arterial remodeling and stratifying cerebrovascular risk, but the data remains inconclusive. An improved understanding of the different phenotypes of brain arterial remodeling associated with HIV may reveal opportunities to reduce rates of cerebrovascular disease in the aging population of PLWH on cART.","output":"Role of Brain Arterial Remodeling in HIV-Associated Cerebrovascular Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted acute rehabilitation delivery by challenging the reliance on in-person care and the standard practice of delivering separate physical and occupational therapy services. Healthcare systems are rapidly developing innovative models of care that provide essential acute rehabilitation services while mitigating viral spread. We present two case reports to illustrate how we used technology and COVID-19 specific decision-making frameworks to deliver acute rehabilitation. METHODS: We iteratively developed two decision-making models regarding care delivery and discharge planning in the context of the challenges to delivering care in a pandemic. We leveraged use of video communication systems installed in all COVID-19 rooms to reduce the number of in-room providers and frequency of contact. Two patients were admitted to the hospital with symptomatic COVID-19 (males, ages 65 and 40 years). RESULTS: With the use of video communication system and the decision-making frameworks for care delivery and discharge planning, we avoided 7 in-person sessions. Both patients demonstrated functional gains and were discharged home. CONCLUSION: The two case reports highlight the innovative use of a technology and COVID-19 specific decision-making processes to provide patient-centered care given the challenges to care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In our previous study, two homologous (54) factors, RpoN1 and RpoN2, were identified in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causative agent of bacterial leaf blight in rice. However, their functional roles, i.e., whether they exert combined or independent effects, remain unknown. In the current study, rpoN1 or rpoN2 deletion in Xoo significantly disrupted bacterial swimming motility, flagellar assembly, and virulence. Transcriptome analysis led to the identification of 127 overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulated by both RpoN1 and RpoN2. Furthermore, GO and KEGG classification demonstrated that these DEGs were highly enriched in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and c-di-GMP pathways. Interestingly, ropN1 deletion decreased ropN2 transcription, while rpoN2 deletion did not affect ropN1 transcription. No interaction between the rpoN2 promoter and RpoN1 was detected, suggesting that RpoN1 indirectly regulates rpoN2 transcription. In addition, RpoN1-regulated DEGs were specially enriched in ribosome, carbon, and nitrogen metabolism pathways. Besides, bacterial growth was remarkably repressed in rpoN1 but not in rpoN2.

However, limited literature has investigated the role of the P2X7 receptor in lipid metabolism during adipocyte differentiation. This study sought to explore the regulatory roles of P2X7 in adipocytes. This study utilized the in vitro 3T3-L1 differentiation model. Lipid accumulation, intracellular triglyceride, and extracellular glycerol were determined. The selective P2X7 agonist BzATP and antagonist A438079 were administered to investigate the functions of P2X7. We found that the expression of P2X7 and the lipid accumulation increased during adipocyte differentiation from D0 to D4. When administered at D0/D2, A438079 attenuated, while BzATP enhanced the degree of lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation. Neither did BzATP and A438079 administration affect the expression of PPAR and C/EBP genes that increased at D4. In addition, both intracellular triglyceride and extracellular glycerol levels at D4 were reduced by A438079 treatment and enhanced by BzATP administration. When administered at stage 2 of adipocyte differentiation, BzATP consistently enhanced lipid accumulation and intracellular triglyceride and extracellular glycerol levels without affecting mRNA and protein levels of PPAR and C/EBP that increased at D4. However, treating A438079 or BzATP at D4 did not affect intracellular triglyceride formation and extracellular glycerol release in differentiated adipocytes at D7. Notably, BzATP administration at stage 2 exerted a concentration-dependent inhibition on the enhanced expression of PRDM16, PGC-1, and UCP-1 at D4. Furthermore, BzATP administration at D0/D2 inhibited the protein and mRNA levels of sirtuin-3/5 at D4.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed health insurance claims for patients from all 50 US states who receive health insurance through their employers. Changes in use of preventive services, nonelective care, elective procedures, prescription drugs, in-person office visits, and telemedicine visits were examined during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 relative to existing trends in 2019 and 2018. Disparities in the association of the pandemic with health care use based on patients zip codeClevel race and income were also examined. RESULTS: Data from 5.6, 6.4, and 6.8 million US individuals with employer-sponsored insurance in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, were analyzed. Patient demographics were similar in all 3 years (mean [SD] age, 34.3 [18.6] years in 2018, 34.3 [18.5] years in 2019, and 34.5 [18.5] years in 2020); 50.0% women in 2018, 49.5% women in 2019, and 49.5% women in 2020).

Use of telemedicine services increased by 227.9 (95% CI, 221.7 to 234.1) per 10 000 persons and 641.6 (95% CI, 635.5 to 647.8) per 10 000 persons. Patients living in zip codes with lower-income or majority racial/ethnic minority populations experienced smaller reductions in in-person visits (80% racial/ethnic minority zip code: 200.0 per 10 000 [95% CI, 128.9-270.1]; 79%-21% racial/ethnic minority zip code: 54.2 per 10 000 [95% CI, 33.6-74.9]) but also had lower rates of adoption of telemedicine (80% racial/ethnic minority zip code: ?71.6 per 10 000 [95% CI, ?87.6 to ?55.5]; 79%-21% racial/ethnic minority zip code: ?15.1 per 10 000 [95% CI, ?19.8 to ?10.4]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of a large US population with employer-sponsored insurance, the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with dramatic reductions in the use of preventive and elective care. Use of telemedicine increased rapidly but not enough to account for reductions in in-person primary care visits.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Contact lists of 5 North American HNC advocacy groups. METHODS: A 14-question survey was distributed to the contact lists of 5 HNC advocacy groups evaluating patient and survivor needs and concerns related to their cancer care and COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 171 respondents, with 75% in the posttreatment period. The most common concern was contraction of COVID-19 (49%). More patients in active treatment preferred in-person visits than those in the early (5 years) and late (>5) survivorship period (72% vs 61% vs 40%, P < .001). A higher percentage of late survivors preferred virtual visits (38% vs 28%, P = .001). In total, 91 (53.2%) respondents sought emotional support outside of immediate family and friends. This included cancer support groups (36.2%), the medical team (29.7%), and other sources outside of these (34.1%), including faith-based organizations and online communities. A higher proportion of women than men (62% vs 41%, P = .001) were seeking emotional support outside of immediate family and friends. CONCLUSIONS: During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with HNC who were actively undergoing treatment had increased need for support resources and preferred in-person provider visits.

The application of the forecasting artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential of deal with dynamical behavior of time-series like of COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition (VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three, and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states, with a high number of cases up to April 28th, 2020.

This, together with challenges in access to trained specialists, has led to a growing need for an integrated wireless remote care platform for neuromodulation devices. In March of 2021, we launched the first neuromodulation device with an integrated remote programming platform. Here, we summarize the biodesign steps taken to identify the unmet patient need, invent, implement, and test the new technology, and finally gain market approval for the remote care platform. Specifically, we illustrate how agile development aligned with the evolving regulatory requirements can enable patient-centric digital health technology in neuromodulation, such as the remote care platform. The three steps of the biodesign process applied for remote care platform development are: (1) Identify, (2) Invent, and (3) Implement. First, we identified the unmet patient needs through market research and voice-of-customer (VOC) process. Next, during the concept generation phase of the invention step, we integrated the results from the VOC into defining requirements for prototype development. Subsequently, in the concept screening phase, ten subjects with PD participated in a clinical pilot study aimed at characterizing the safety of the remote care prototype. Lastly, during the implementation step, lessons learned from the pilot experience were integrated into final product development as new features. Following final product development, we completed usability testing to validate the full remote care system and collected preliminary data from the limited market release experience. The VOC data, during prototype development, helped us identify thresholds for video quality and needs priorities for clinicians and patients. During the pilot study, one subject reported anticipated remoteCcare-related adverse events that were resolved without sequelae. For usability analysis following final product development, the failure rates for task completion for both user groups were about 1%. Lastly, during the initial 4 weeks of the limited market release experience, a total of 858 remote care sessions were conducted with a 93% success rate. Overall, we developed a remote care platform by adopting a user-centric approach.

Negative samples from 2391 individuals representative of the Israeli population, and 698 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients, collected between March and May 2020, were analyzed. Findings: Immunoassays sensitivities between 81.5%-89.4% and specificities between 97.7%-100% resulted in a profound impact on the expected Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in low (<15%) prevalence scenarios. No meaningful increase was detected in the false positive rate in children compared to adults. A positive correlation between disease severity and antibody titers, and no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks after PCR positivity was observed. We identified a subgroup of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (~5% of patients), who remained seronegative across a wide range of antigens, isotypes, and technologies. Interpretation: wThe commercially available automated immunoassays exhibit significant differences in performance and expected PPV in low prevalence scenarios. The low false-positivity rate in under 20's suggests that cross-reactive immunity from previous CoV strains is unlikely to explain the milder disease course in children.

Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill.

Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a prototypic form of CSS that develops in the context of rheumatic diseases, particularly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The treatment of MAS relies heavily upon corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors, which have proven to be lifesaving therapies in MAS, as well as in other forms of CSS.

Patients with 18 years or older, presenting two or more anterior pituitary deficiencies associated or not with diabetes insipidus (DI), were included, while patients with hypopituitarism due to Acromegaly or Cushing's disease were excluded. RESULTS: We studied 99 hypopituitary patients (52 males, mean age 50.1  16.3 years, mean age at diagnosis 33.7  17.6 years) who have been followed for a mean time of 15.9  10.1 years. Hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and non-tumoral etiologies were observed in 53.4% and 46.6% of the cases, respectively. FSH/LH, GH, TSH, ACTH deficiency and DI was present in 99%, 98.6%, 96%, 81.8%, and 23.2%, respectively. The prevalence of MetS was 39.4% and was significantly higher in patients older than 50 years (p = 0.02), overweight/obese (p < 0.001), with hypopituitarism diagnosed in adult life (p = 0.02), who did not replace GH (p = 0.004) and in smokers (p = 0.007).

Included study characteristics were tabulated and described by narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 16 cohort studies, and 9 case studies were included. No RCTs showed statistically significant improvements in health outcomes. Five cohort studies showed improvement in at least one health outcome associated with target attainment. However, there was a high risk of bias in all studies for health outcomes. One study assessed the impact of penicillin TDM on AMR and found that improved target attainment was associated with suppression of resistance. No studies found a detrimental effect of penicillin TDM. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence to suggest that TDM improves health outcomes, however neither health outcomes nor impact on AMR were adequately addressed. Variations in TDM implementation meant that a meta-analysis was not suitable. Penicillin TDM needs standardization, however there is currently no clear evidence of optimal conditions. Suitably powered studies are required to resolve the ambiguity surrounding the impact of TDM on clinical outcomes, including AMR.

The methodology of this work is qualitative research, exploratory type, being carried out from a didactic sequence developed in two meetings remotely, due to the scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. The target audience of this research is a group of students aged 15-17 years from a public school in Fortaleza - CE, Brazil. In summary, it is pointed out that the intuitive reasoning categories mobilized from the use of GeoGebra have great potential to stimulate the evolution of the student's geometric thinking, through the development of perception, intuition and geometric visualization. ? 2021 University of Helsinki.

The risk of more severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is higher in males and steeply raised with age but also increased by the presence of chronic comorbidities. Among the latter, early reports suggested that arterial hypertension associates with higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, more severe course and increased COVID-19-related deaths. Furthermore, experimental studies suggested that key pathophysiological hypertension mechanisms, such as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), may play a role in COVID-19. In fact, ACE2 (angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2) is the pivotal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells and provides thus a link between COVID-19 and RAS. It was thus anticipated that drugs modulating the RAS including an upregulation of ACE2 may increase the risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and poorer outcomes in COVID-19. Since the use of RAS-blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, represents the backbone of recommended antihypertensive therapy and intense debate about their use in the COVID-19 pandemic has developed. Currently, a direct role of hypertension, independent of age and other comorbidities, as a risk factor for the SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome, particularly death, has not been established. Similarly, both current experimental and clinical studies do not support an unfavorable effect of RAS-blockers or other classes of first line blood pressure lowering drugs in COVID-19. Here, we review available data on the role of hypertension and its management on COVID-19. Conversely, some aspects as to how the COVID-19 affects hypertension management and impacts on future developments are also briefly discussed. COVID-19 has and continues to proof the critical importance of hypertension research to address questions that are important for global health.","output":"Hypertension, a Moving Target in COVID-19: Current Views and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dermatomyositis (DM) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by pathognomic lesions in skin and skeletal muscle including lymphocytic infiltrates.

Proteomics encompasses the study of proteins expressed by a population of cells, and evaluates changes in protein expression, post-translational modifications, protein interactions, protein structure and splice variants, all of which are imperative for a complete understanding of protein function within the cell. From the outset, proteomics has been used to compare the protein profiles of cells in healthy and diseased states and as such can be used to identify proteins associated with disease development and progression. These candidate proteins might provide novel targets for new therapeutic agents or aid the development of assays for disease biomarkers.

Moreover, wastewater-based epidemiology could be a predictor of the virus rate of spread to alert on new outbreaks. To assist in epidemiological surveillance, this work introduces a simple, low-cost and affordable electrochemical sensor to specifically detect N and ORF1ab genes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The proposed sensor works based on screen-printed electrodes acting as a disposable test strip, where the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reaction takes place. Electrochemical detection relies upon methylene blue as a redox intercalator probe, to provide a diffusion-controlled current encoding the presence and concentration of RT-LAMP products, namely amplicons or double-stranded DNA. We test the performance of the sensor by testing real wastewater samples using end-point and time course measurements. Results show the ability of the electrochemical test strip to specifically detect and quantify RT-LAMP amplicons below to ~ 2.5  10(?6) ng/L exhibiting high reproducibility. In this sense, our RT-LAMP electrochemical sensor is an attractive, efficient and powerful tool for rapid and reliable wastewater-based epidemiology studies.","output":"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based electrochemical sensor for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Tuberculosis is still a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with high proportion of smear- and culture- negative incidences worldwide. The conventional diagnostic tests are time-consuming and have a low sensitivity. Digital PCR is a novel technology which can detect target sequences with relatively low abundance and obtain the absolute copy numbers of the targets. METHODS We assessed the accuracy of dPCR in TB diagnosis using more than 250 specimens, and for the first time, we selected M.tuberculosis-specific IS1081 in addition to widely used IS6110 as the amplification targets for dPCR. The quantification of target DNA was calculated using QuantaSoft Version 1.7.4.0917 (BioRad), and SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS IS6110-dPCR was more sensitive than IS1081, with the sensitivity and specificity accounting for 40.6 and 93.4% respectively. When we classified the TB patients by personal factors for high copy number of M.tuberculosis derived DNA in plasma: bilateral TB, extrapulmonary TB and disseminated TB, the sensitivity of both IS6110- and IS1081- dPCR was the highest in patients with disseminated TB (IS6110, 100%; IS1081, 68.8%), while their sensitivity was a bit higher in patients with extrapulmonary TB (IS6110, 50.0%; IS1081, 39.3%) than that in bilateral TB (IS6110, 43.3%; IS1081, 33.3%). Compared with traditional TB diagnostic tests, joint detection IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR was not as sensitive as smear microscope or mycobacterial culture, but it was higher than IS6110 qPCR (p < 0.05) and was able to detect 47.4% of smear-negative TB patients. CONCLUSION Our study suggested that plasma IS6110-dPCR is a rapid, moderate accurate and less-invasive method to detect M.tuberculosis DNA in plasma of TB patients and IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR has a potential to aid diagnosis of smear-negative TB.","output":"Evaluation of digital PCR assay in detection of M.tuberculosis IS6110 and IS1081 in tuberculosis patients plasma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Since late 2019, three accumulations of severe COVID-19 infections (the so-called infective waves) led to a fulminant increase in hospitalized patients,Therapy with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) was used since the early beginning of the pandemic in therapy-refractory cases,However, potential developments in vv-EMCO therapy still need to be proven,Method:Between 2020 and 2021 a total of 60 patients were treated with vv-ECMO for severe COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome in our department,The patients were prospectively enrolled into a database and subsequent retrospectively reviewed,Patients were divided concerning the date of vv-ECMO onset into three groups (03/2020-09/2020: 1,wave,n=11;10/2020-02/2021: 2,wave,n=23;03/2021-08/2021: 3,wave,n=26),Results:Table 1shows the detailed pre-A nd peri-interventional data of the three study groups,From the first to the third wave, patients seemed to be younger, more likely to be female as well as more likely obese,While patients of the first wave regularly developed acute kidney failure, these adverse event was seldom in the second and third wave (p=0.01),In contrast to that, other device-related complications such as stroke, bleeding or visceral ischemia did not differ between the three waves,Most apparent changes during the pandemic were prolonged ECMO support duration (1,wave: 8.52.1, 2,wave: 54.0122.7, 3,wave: 28.018.6), ECMO weaning rate (1,wave: 18.2%, 2,wave: 39.1, 3,wave: 44.0%) and in-hospital mortality (1,wave: 81.8%, 2,wave: 69.6, 3,wave: 56.0%), although none of these effects reached statistical significance,Conclusion:Although our data cover only a small study population, we observed clear trends toward younger and heavier patients during the pandemic,Most likely, due to a learning effect, support duration of ECMO patients distinctly increased during the pandemic,Subsequently, weaning and survival also increased.","output":"Developments in Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Therapy-Refractory COVID-19 Infections since the Beginning of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Bier anemic spots, cyanosis, and urticaria-like eruption (BASCULE) syndrome is an underreported pediatric vascular disorder from the group of acrosyndromes. In children, these include paroxysmal acrosyndromes (Raynauds phenomenon and chilblain-like lesions), permanent acrosyndromes (acrocyanosis), and transient acrosyndromes, in which their pathogeneses are associated with virus infections, Epstein-Barr virus, and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2, respectively. METHODS: We reported a case of BASCULE syndrome associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and provided a narrative review of case reports describing the BASCULE syndrome in children. Moreover, we presented the results of a prospective practice survey that we performed in the French medical community. RESULTS: A 14-years-old boy reported pruritic erythrocyanic lesions on the lower limbs, which occurred whenever he was in a standing position and fully resolved when he laid down. He reported asthenia and cramps. He presented a typical BASCULE syndrome associated with POTS confirmed by a tilt-test. Physical and vascular examinations were within the normal range. We identified 12 case reports, describing 21 pediatric cases since 2016. Most patients were adolescents between 12 and 19 years of age or were newborns. Furthermore, 20% of cases in the literature have presented POTS or orthostatic intolerance. Our survey among 95 French physicians confirmed that BASCULE syndrome is an underdiagnosed and under recognized disease in the general pediatric practice, at least in France. Among these physicians, 65% had already encountered patients with similar symptoms, but only 30% declared that they had knowledge of the BASCULE syndrome. CONCLUSION: The under-recognition of the clinical manifestations leads the patients to consult emergency rooms, with multiple unnecessary investigations performed. Therefore, we suggest that the diagnosis of BASCULE syndrome is based on clinical observations, without the need for laboratory tests, to avoid unnecessary health costs. We suggest physicians to perform a tilt-test when POTS is suspected.","output":"Case Report, Practices Survey and Literature Review of an Under-Recognized Pediatric Vascular Disorder: The BASCULE Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While many countries are preparing to face the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported cases in Africa remain low.

An intricate system of well-studied import machinery facilitates the import of mitochondrial proteins. In addition, folding of the newly synthesized proteins takes place in a busy environment. A system of folding helper proteins, molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, are present to maintain proper conformation and thus avoid protein aggregation and premature damage. The components of the import machinery are well characterised, but the targeting signals and how they are recognised and decoded remains in some cases unclear. Here we provide some detail on the types of targeting signals involved in the protein import process. Furthermore, we discuss the very elaborate chaperone systems of the intermembrane space that are needed to overcome the particular challenges for the folding process in this compartment. The mechanisms that sustain productive folding in the face of aggregation and damage in mitochondria are critical components of the stress response and play an important role in cell homeostasis.","output":"Protein import in mitochondria biogenesis: guided by targeting signals and sustained by dedicated chaperones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disparate effect on African Americans and Latino groups.

The researchers supporting the use of these medications believe ACE2 functional blockers may block cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus improve patient outcomes.

To this end, this in silico study tried to identify potential proinflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs) produced by the action of the elastase released in neutrophil-extracellular traps over SARS-CoV-2 particles. We found nine potential PIPs exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2, showing homology against T cell recognition epitopes. Moreover, 78 percent of these exclusive PIPs were found produced by the enzymatic cleavage on the spike glycoproteins, suggesting that high PIP concentrations might be released following SARS-CoV-2 huge replication rate. Therefore, these PIPs might play a role in the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in some patients. Highlights Nine potential PIPs were predicted exclusive from the SARS-CoV-2.

We have developed a brief behavioral intervention that aims to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events but has only been delivered face-to-face so far. After digitalizing the intervention materials, the intervention was delivered digitally to target users (health care staff) for the first time. The adaption for staff's working context in a hospital setting used a co-design approach. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this mixed method exploratory pilot study with health care staff who experienced working in the pandemic were to pilot the intervention that we have digitalized (for remote delivery and with remote support) and adapted for this target population (health care staff working clinically during a pandemic) to explore its ability to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events and improve related symptoms (eg, posttraumatic stress) and participant's perception of their functioning, and to explore the feasibility and acceptability of both the digitalized intervention and digitalized data collection. METHODS: We worked closely with target users with lived experience of working clinically during the COVID-19 pandemic in a hospital context (registered nurses who experienced intrusive memories from traumatic events at work; N=3). We used a mixed method design and exploratory quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: After completing the digitalized intervention once with remote researcher support (approximately 25 minutes) and a brief follow-up check-in, participants learned to use the intervention independently. All 3 participants reported zero intrusive memories during week 5 (primary outcome: 100% digital data capture). Prior to study inclusion, two or more intrusions in the week were reported preintervention (assessed retrospectively). There was a general pattern of symptom reduction and improvement in perceived functioning (eg, concentration) at follow-up. The digitalized intervention and data collection were perceived as feasible and rated as acceptable (eg, all 3 participants would recommend it to a colleague). Participants were positive toward the digital intervention as a useful tool that could readily be incorporated into work life and repeated in the face of ongoing or repeated trauma exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention when delivered remotely and adapted for this population during the pandemic was well received by participants. Since it could be tailored around work and daily life and used preventatively, the intervention may hold promise for health care staff pending future evaluations of efficacy. Limitations include the small sample size, lack of daily intrusion frequency data in the week before the intervention, and lack of a control condition. Following this co-design process in adapting and improving intervention delivery and evaluation, the next step is to investigate the efficacy of the digitalized intervention in a randomized controlled trial.","output":"Digitalizing a Brief Intervention to Reduce Intrusive Memories of Psychological Trauma for Health Care Staff Working During COVID-19: Exploratory Pilot Study With Nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The literature on China's social media foreign propaganda mostly focuses on text-format contents in English, which may miss the real target and the tool for analysis.

Results: Among the total of 62 respondents, a mean of 17 was obtained on the EPDS which is more than the cutoff value. FCV-19S and CDAS did not show extreme results except for few cases. The breastfeeding questionnaire suggested that most women are afraid of transmitting the infection to their newborns and they lack the knowledge about the importance of breast milk in warding off other infections. Also, women found it difficult to take care of their newborns on their own.

This study explores whether stress-related biomarkers cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) measured in hair samples of chronic tinnitus patients change after compact multimodal tinnitus-specific cognitive behavioral therapy. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, hair-cortisol and hair-BDNF levels, self-reported tinnitus-related distress (Tinnitus Questionnaire; TQ), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Questionnaire; PSQ-20) were assessed before and 3 months after 5 days of treatment in N = 80 chronic tinnitus patients. Linear mixed-effects models with backward elimination were used to assess treatment-induced changes, and a cross-lagged panel model (structural equation model) was used for additional exploratory analysis of the temporal associations between TQ and hair-BDNF. RESULTS: At follow-up, a reduction in TQ (p < 0.001) and PSQ-20 scores (p = 0.045) was observed, which was not influenced by baseline hair-cortisol or hair-BDNF levels. No changes in biomarker levels were observed after treatment. The exploratory analysis tentatively suggests that a directional effect of baseline TQ scores on hair-BDNF levels at follow-up (trend; p = 0.070) was more likely than the opposite directional effect of baseline hair-BDNF levels on TQ scores at follow-up (n.s.). DISCUSSION: While the treatment effectively reduced tinnitus-related distress and perceived stress in chronic tinnitus patients, this effect was not mirrored in biological changes. However, the lack of changes in hair-cortisol and hair-BDNF levels might have been influenced by the treatment duration, follow-up interval, or confounding medical factors, and therefore must be interpreted with caution. The relationship between tinnitus-related distress and hair-BDNF levels should be explored further to obtain a better understanding of stress-related effects in chronic tinnitus.","output":"Psychological Treatment Effects Unrelated to Hair-Cortisol and Hair-BDNF Levels in Chronic Tinnitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to explore how returning to teaching during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic impacted teachers' stress and anxiety. Specifically, the study investigated how teachers' anxiety changed during the first month of school. Additionally, the study explored the association of teachers' stress and anxiety and predictor variables for changes in teacher anxiety while teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study included 329 elementary teachers from across the United States who completed a survey during the first week of October 2020. The results found that most teachers saw no change or an increase in anxiety during the first month. Significant predictors of increased teacher anxiety included stress and communication within the school, with virtual instruction teachers having the most increase in anxiety. In comparison, the no change in anxiety group included significant predictors of stress, virtual instruction, and communication within the school. The present study provides applicable information to schools and districts as there is limited empirical research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teachers. Teachers are working as frontline workers during the pandemic; thus, schools and districts need to monitor teacher stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide the necessary support.

However, many surgical providers may be unfamiliar with telehealth. This study evaluates the perspectives of surgical providers practicing telehealth care during COVID-19 to help identify targets for surgical telehealth optimization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single tertiary care center with telehealth capabilities, all department of surgery providers (attending surgeons, residents, fellows, and advanced practice providers) were emailed a voluntary survey focused on telehealth during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U analyses were performed as appropriate on responses. Text responses were thematically coded to identify key concepts. RESULTS: The completion rate was 41.3% (145/351). Providers reported increased telehealth usage relative to the pandemic (p<0.001). Of respondents, 80% (116/145) had no formal telehealth training. Providers estimated that new patient video visits required less time than traditional visits (p=0.001). Satisfaction was high for several aspects of video visits. Comparatively lower satisfaction scores were reported for the ability to perform physical exams (sensitive and non-sensitive) and to break bad news. The largest barriers to effective video visits were limited physical exams (55.6%; 45/81) and lack of provider or patient internet access/equipment/connection (34.6%; 28/81). Other barriers included ineffective communication and difficulty with fostering rapport. Concerns regarding video-to-telephone visit conversion were loss of physical exam/verbal cues (34.3%; 24/70), less personal interactions (18.6%; 13/70), and reduced efficiency (18.6%; 13/70). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth remains a new experience for surgical providers despite its expansion.

Past studies have not disentangled 2 mechanisms thought to underlie socioeconomic inequalities in health, differential exposure and differential vulnerability, that have different policy implications. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent to which the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and all-cause mortality can be decomposed into a direct effect of SES, indirect effects through lifestyle factors (differential exposure), and joint effects of SES with lifestyle factors (differential vulnerability). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide, population-based cohort study used the cross-sectional US National Health Interview Survey linked to the National Death Index. Civilian, noninstitutionalized US adults aged 25 to 84 years were included from the 1997 to 2014 National Health Interview Survey and were followed up until December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from May 1 to October 31, 2021. A causal mediation model using an additive hazard and marginal structural approach was used. EXPOSURES: Both SES (operationalized as educational attainment) and lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and physical inactivity) were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Time to all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Participants included 415 764 adults (mean [SD] age, 49.4 [15.8] years; 55% women; 64% non-Hispanic White), of whom 45% had low educational attainment and 27% had high educational attainment. Participants were followed up for a mean (SD) of 8.8 (5.2) years during which 49 096 deaths (12%) were observed. Low educational attainment (compared with high) was associated with 83.6 (men; 95% CI, 81.8-85.5) and 54.8 (women; 95% CI, 53.4-56.2) additional deaths per 10 000 person-years, of which 66% (men) and 80% (women) were explained by lifestyle factors. Inequalities in mortality were primarily a result of greater exposure and clustering of unhealthy lifestyle factors among low SES groups; with some exceptions among women, little evidence of differential vulnerability was identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, differential exposure to lifestyle risk factors was an important mediator of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality. Public health interventions are needed, particularly among low SES groups, to address smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol use, and the socioenvironmental contexts within which these risk factors develop.","output":"Educational Attainment and Lifestyle Risk Factors Associated With All-Cause Mortality in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Engulfed by the grave consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a better understanding of the unique pattern of viral invasion and virulence is of utmost importance Angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a key component in COVID-19 infection Expressed on cell membranes in target pulmonary and intestinal host cells, ACE2 serves as an anchor for initial viral homing, binding to COVID-19 spike-protein domains to enable viral entry into cells and subsequent replication Viral attachment is facilitated by a multiplicity of membranal and circulating proteases that further uncover attachment loci Inherent or acquired enhancement of membrane ACE2 expression, likely leads to a higher degree of infection and may explain the predisposition to severe disease among males, diabetics, or patients with respiratory or cardiac diseases Additionally, once attached, viral intracellular translocation and replication leads to depletion of membranal ACE2 through degradation and shedding ACE2 generates Ang 1-7, which serves a critical role in counterbalancing the vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, and pro-coagulant effects of ACE-induced Ang II Therefore, Ang 1-7 may decline in tissues infected by COVID-19, leading to unopposed deleterious outcomes of Ang II This likely leads to microcirculatory derangement with endothelial damage, profound inflammation, and coagulopathy that characterize the more severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection Our understanding of COVID-ACE2 associations is incomplete, and some conceptual formulations are currently speculative, leading to controversies over issues such as the usage of ACE inhibitors or Ang-receptor blockers (ARBs) This highlights the importance of focusing on ACE2 physiology in the evaluation and management of COVID-19 disease","output":"ACE2, COVID-19 Infection, Inflammation, and Coagulopathy: Missing Pieces in the Puzzle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The explosion of the pandemic and the need for social distancing has meant that robotics has more and more space in our daily lives The Coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) presents us with a challenge that we are currently facing, and which globally highlights our fragility This fragility and consequent loneliness is perceived more and more every day;that implies the importance of using new technologies able to cope with a new aspect that had not been thought of so far, but which is now dictated by the pandemic consequences As a result, these new issues brought by the pandemic imply an increasing need to make robots more and more intelligent and empathic with human beings ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Robots against the Coronavirus: The need for a new generation of robots to help global society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose: While impacts of the pandemic on family well-being have been documented in the literature, little is known about the psychological challenges faced by children and their parents as schools reopen after mandated closures.

A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. We first considered historical data for Australia before it eliminated COVID-19 (equivalent to an outbreak generating 74 new cases/day) and one flight per day to NZ with no interventions in place. This gave a median time to an outbreak of 0.2 years (95% range of simulation results: 3 days to 1.1 years) or a mean of 110 flights per outbreak. However, the combined use of a pre-flight PCR test of saliva, three subsequent PCR tests (on days 1, 3 and 12 in NZ), and various other interventions (mask use and contact tracing) reduced this risk to one outbreak after a median of 1.5 years (20 days to 8.1 years). A pre-flight test plus 14 days quarantine was an even more effective strategy (4.9 years; 2,594 flights). For a much lower prevalence (representing only two new community cases per week in the whole of Australia), the annual risk of an outbreak with no interventions was 1.2% and had a median time to an outbreak of 56 years. In contrast the risks associated with travellers from Japan and the United States was very much higher and would need quarantine or other restrictions. Collectively, these results suggest that multi-layered interventions can markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus via air travel into a COVID-19-free nation. For some low-risk source countries, there is the potential to replace 14-day quarantine with alternative interventions.

Data was collected 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post discharge or initial evaluation in clinic. 28% of patients were antibody positive, 55.6% experienced fatigue, 50% experienced shortness of breath or cough, 50% experienced brain fog,33% chest pain and 44.4% experienced anxiety and/or depression. CONCLUSION: Early identification of patients and comprehensive protocols may facilitate return to normalcy for children with lingering somatic symptoms worsened by impact of social isolation, economic stresses, lost parental jobs, and food insecurity among many other contributing factors. Further research is needed to determine why children of certain ethnicities are impacted differently. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"1191.

Currently, researchers are focusing on vaccine development and the search for an effective strategy to control the infection source. This work designed a detection platform based on Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) by introducing acetonitrile and calcium ions into the silver nanoparticle reinforced substrate system to realize the rapid detection of novel coronavirus. Acetonitrile may amplify the calcium-induced hot spots of silver nanoparticles and significantly enhanced the stability of silver nanoparticles. It also elicited highly sensitive SERS signals of the virus. This approach allowed us to capture the characteristic SERS signals of SARS-CoV-2, Human Adenovirus 3, and H1N1 influenza virus molecules at a concentration of 100 copies/test (PFU/test) with upstanding reproduction and signal-to-noise ratio. Machine learning recognition technology was employed to qualitatively distinguish the three virus molecules with 1000 groups of spectra of each virus. Acetonitrile is a potent internal marker in regulating the signal intensity of virus molecules in saliva and serum. Thus, we used the SERS peak intensity to quantify the virus content in saliva and serum. The results demonstrated a satisfactory linear relationship between peak intensity and protein concentration. Collectively, this rapid detection method has a broad application prospect in clinical diagnosis of viruses, management of emergent viral infectious diseases, and exploration of the interaction between viruses and host cells.","output":"Rapid detection of viruses: Based on silver nanoparticles modified with bromine ions and acetonitrile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cervical cancer is the most common malignant tumor in females worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with the occurrence of cervical cancer. Thus, developing an effective and low-cost vaccine against HPV infection, especially in developing countries is an important issue. In this study, a novel HPV L1-E7 fusion multiepitope construct designed by immunoinformatics tools was expressed in bacterial system. HEK-293T cells-derived exosomes were generated and characterized to use as a carrier for crocin and curcumin compounds. The exosomes loaded with crocin and curcumin compounds as a chemotherapeutic agent (ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin) were used along with the L1-E7 polypeptide for evaluation of immunological and anti-tumor effects in C57BL/6 mouse model. In vitro studies showed that ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin were not cytotoxic at a certain dose, and they could enter tumor cells. In vivo studies indicated that combination of the L1-E7 polypeptide with ExoCrocin or ExoCurcumin could produce a significant level of immunity directed toward Th1 response and CTL activity. These regimens showed the protective and therapeutic effects against tumor cells (the percentage of tumor-free mice: ~100%). In addition, both ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin represented similar immunological and anti-tumor effects. Generally, the use of exosomal crocin or curcumin forms along with the L1-E7 polypeptide could significantly induce T-cell immune responses and eradicate tumor cells.","output":"Synergistic effects of exosomal crocin or curcumin compounds and HPV L1-E7 polypeptide vaccine construct on tumor eradication in C57BL/6 mouse model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections are an important and often unrecognized component of disease in immunocompromised patients.

However, alcohol alone lacks the required antimicrobial persistence to provide for the sustained periods of skin antisepsis desired in the clinical environment. Therefore, alcohol-based products must have a preservative agent such as iodine/iodophor compounds, chlorhexidine gluconate, or zinc pyrithione, to extend its antimicrobial effects. Iodine, iodophors, and chlorhexidine gluconate are well-characterized antimicrobials and preservatives. The thrust of our effort was to examine the characteristics of the lesser-known zinc pyrithione and to evaluate its utility as a preservative in the formulation of alcohol-based products for skin antisepsis. This work includes a literature review of current zinc pyrithione applications in drugs and cosmetics, a safety and toxicity evaluation, consideration of the proposed mechanisms of antimicrobial action, in vitro and in vivo efficacy data, and a discussion of the mechanisms that confer the desired antimicrobial persistence. In addition, alcohol-based, zinc pyrithione-preserved, commercially available products of skin antisepsis are compared with other commercially available antimicrobials used for skin antisepsis and with additional alcohol-based products with different preservatives. The authors' conclusion is that zinc pyrithione is not only a safe and effective antimicrobial but that its use in certain alcohol-based formulations results in antimicrobial efficacy exceeding that of iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate.","output":"Zinc pyrithione in alcohol-based products for skin antisepsis: Persistence of antimicrobial effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of residential centers and the fragility of the population that lives there.

In this study, a large-scale online survey was conducted in Japan to explore the determinants of infection preventive behaviors. In addition, this survey collected data on various attitudes and behaviors in this pandemic situation, including optimistic/pessimistic views and information dissemination behavior on social networking sites (SNS). The results showed that the infection risk perception of self and others were both associated with the preventive behaviors, but the social pressure was not. The results were unclear in regard to optimistic/pessimistic views for infection risk perception and prospect for the end of coronavirus outbreak. Surprisingly, information spreading via SNS was negatively associated with knowledge of COVID-19, which calls attention to the credibility of information on SNS. In addition, subjective evaluation of achievement in regard to preventive behaviors was higher for self than for other people. This suggests that a self-enhancement tendency may contribute to the evaluation of preventive behaviors.

Based on their Dual Process Model (DPM), Stroebe and Schut have identified pandemic-specific risk factors for poor bereavement outcomes and categorised these in terms of disruptions to loss-oriented and restoration-oriented coping processes which grieving people naturally oscillate between. Loss-oriented coping involves focussing on ones loved one and their death, while restoration-oriented coping involves continuing with daily life and distracting oneself from ones grief.AimsTo explore and describe bereavement experiences during the pandemic, relating our findings to the constructs of the DPM.MethodTwo independent online surveys were disseminated UK-wide via social media platforms and community and charitable organisations. They captured end-of-life and bereavement experiences (to all causes of death) from March 2020 to January 2021. Free-text data were analysed thematically, using the DPM as an analytic lens.ResultsSix main themes were identified: troubled and traumatic deaths;disrupted mourning, memorialisation and difficulties in death-related administration;mass bereavement, media and societal responses and the ongoing threat of the virus;grieving and coping (alone and with others);workplace and employment difficulties;and accessing health and social care support. Examples of loss-oriented stressors were being unable to visit or say goodbye and restricted funeral and memorialisation practices, leading to guilt and anger. Restoration-oriented stressors included severely restricted social networks and support systems, which affected peoples ability to cope.ConclusionThese results highlight significant disruptions to end-of-life, death and mourning practices, as well as usual coping mechanisms and support systems, during the Covid-19 pandemic.

METHODS: An online survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1509 adults residing in Korea, from November 2 to 5, 2020. The degree of agreement with resource allocation principles in the context of the medical resource constraints precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic was examined. The results were then compared with ethicists recommendations. We also examined whether the perceived severity of COVID-19 explained differences in individual preferences, and by doing so, whether perceived severity helps explain discrepancies between public preferences and ethicists recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, the public of Korea agreed strongly with the principles of save the most lives, Koreans first, and sickest first, but less with random selection, in contrast to the recommendations of ethicists. Save the most lives was given the highest priority by both the public and ethicists. Higher perceived severity of the pandemic was associated with a greater likelihood of agreeing with allocation principles based on utilitarianism, as well as those promoting and rewarding social usefulness, in line with the opinions of expert ethicists. CONCLUSIONS: The general public of Korea preferred rationing scarce medical resources in the COVID-19 pandemic predominantly based on utilitarianism, identity and prioritarianism, rather than egalitarianism. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for discrepancies between public preferences and ethicists recommendations.","output":"Public Preferences for Allocation Principles for Scarce Medical Resources in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Korea: Comparisons With Ethicists Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic severely limited collaboration among musicians in rehearsal and ensemble performance, and demanded radical shifts in collaborative practices. Understanding the nature of these changes in music creators' patterns of collaboration, as well as how musicians shifted prioritizations and adapted their use of the available technologies, can offer invaluable insights into the resilience and importance of different aspects of musical collaboration. In addition, assessing changes in the collaboration networks among music creators can improve the current understanding of genre and style formation and evolution. We used an internet survey distributed to music creators, including performers, composers, producers, and engineers, all active before and during the pandemic, to assess their perceptions of how their music, collaborative practice, and use of technology were impacted by shelter-in-place orders associated with Covid-19, as well as how they adapted over the course of the pandemic. This survey was followed by Zoom interviews with a subset of participants. Along with confirming previous results showing increased reliance on nostalgia for musical inspiration, we found that participants' collaborative behaviors were surprisingly resilient to pandemic-related changes. In addition, participant responses appeared to be driven by a relatively small number of underlying factors, representing approaches to musical collaboration such as musical extroversion or musical introversion, inspiration clusters such as activist musicking, and style or genre clusters.","output":"Collaborating in Isolation: Assessing the Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Patterns of Collaborative Behavior Among Working Musicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 50-year-old woman with underlying end stage renal disease on hemodialysis developed large isolated staphylococcal infective endocarditis over the left ventricular outflow tract when she had pneumonia, without apparent valvular involvement.

Methods We collected daily numbers of COVID-19 cases in 202 locations in 8 countries. We matched meteorological data from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. We used a time-frequency approach to examine the possible association between meteorological conditions and basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19. We determined the correlations between meteorological factors and R0 of COVID-19 using multiple linear regression models and meta-analysis. We further validated our results using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) metapopulation model to simulate the changes of daily cases of COVID-19 in China under different temperatures and relative humidity conditions. Principal results Temperature did not exhibit significant association with R0 of COVID-19 (meta p = 0.446). Also, relative humidity (meta p = 0.215), wind speed (meta p = 0.986), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (meta p = 0.491) were not significantly associated with R0 either. The SEIR model in China showed that with a wide range of meteorological conditions, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases would not change substantially.

The reduction in case volume, transition to remote learning, lack of sports coverage opportunities, and decreased clinical interactions have had an immediate effect on orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: Our purpose was to gauge the response to the pandemic from a sports medicine fellowship education perspective. We hypothesized that (1) the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant change in training programs, (2) in-person surgical skills training and didactic learning would be substituted with virtual learning, and (3) hands-on surgical training and case numbers would decrease and the percentage of fellows graduating with skill levels commensurate with graduation would decrease. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: In May 2020, a survey was sent to the fellowship directors of all 90 orthopaedic sports medicine fellowships accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education; it included questions on program characteristics, educational lectures, and surgical skills. A total of 37 completed surveys (41%) were returned, all of which were deidentified. Responses were compiled and saved on a closed, protected institutional server. RESULTS: In a majority of responding programs (89%), fellows continued to participate in the operating room. Fellows continued with in-person clinical visits in 65% of programs, while 51% had their fellows participate in telehealth visits. Fellows were redeployed to help triage and assist with off-service needs in 21% of programs compared with 65% of resident programs having residents rotate off service. Regarding virtual education, 78% of programs have used or are planning to use platforms offered by medical societies, and 49% have used or are planning to use third-party independent education platforms. Of the 37 programs, 30 reported no in-person lectures or meetings, and there was a sharp decline in the number of programs participating in cadaver laboratories (n = 10; 27%) and industry courses (n = 6; 16%). CONCLUSION: Virtual didactic and surgical education and training as well as telehealth will play a larger role in the coming year than in the past. There are effects to fellows exposure to sports coverage and employment opportunities.

Methods: From October 2019 to March 2020, vaccination status of 1219 patients (males n = 571, aged 5C107 years; median, 50 years) hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) was assessed. The patients were tested for influenza viruses and their subtypes by RT PCR. Sequencing of the HA gene was performed. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza subtypes was estimated by the test negative design. Results: A total of 336 (27.5%) patients were influenza-positive, with influenza B/Victoria accounting for 49.7% (n = 167), followed by influenza A/H1N1 (47.6%; n = 155) and influenza A/H3N2 (4.4%; n = 15). About 6.8% and 8.6% of the influenza-positive and influenza-negative patients, respectively, had been vaccinated. Adjusted VE for any influenza strain was 13% (95% CI ?42 to 47), which for influenza B was 0%.

This review examines the burden of antimicrobial resistance in solid organ transplant recipients and identifies opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship. RECENT FINDINGS: Antimicrobial resistance has been identified to be the leading cause of death globally. Multidrug-resistant pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus affects liver and lung recipients, causing bacteremia, pneumonia, and surgical site infections. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci is a nosocomial pathogen primarily causing bacteremia in liver recipients. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens present urgent and serious threats to transplant recipients. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae commonly cause bacteremia and intra-abdominal infections in liver and kidney recipients. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, mainly K. pneumoniae, are responsible for infections early-post transplant in liver, lung, kidney, and heart recipients. P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii continue to be critical threats. While there are new antimicrobial agents targeting resistant pathogens, judicious prescribing is crucial to minimize emerging resistance. The full implications of the COVID-19 global pandemic on antimicrobial resistance in transplant recipients remain to be understood. Currently, there are no established standards on the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship interventions, but strategies that leverage existing antimicrobial stewardship program structure while tailoring to the needs of transplant recipients may help to optimize antimicrobial use.

Coordinated antimicrobial stewardship interventions in collaboration with appropriate expertise in transplant and infectious diseases may mitigate against such threats.","output":"Challenges of Antimicrobial Resistance and Stewardship in Solid Organ Transplant Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sewage can be used to determine the scale of COVID-19 outbreak.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive nitazoxanide (500 mg) or placebo, 3 times daily, for 5 days, and were followed for 14 days. The primary outcome was intensive care unit admission due to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included clinical improvement, hospital discharge, oxygen requirements, death, and adverse events within 14 days. RESULTS: Of the 498 patients, 405 (202 in the nitazoxanide group and 203 in the placebo group) were included in the analyses. Admission to the intensive care unit did not differ between the groups (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.68 [0.38C1.20], p = 0.179); death rates also did not differ. Nitazoxanide improved the clinical outcome (2.75 [2.21C3.43], p < 0.0001), time to hospital discharge (1.37 [1.11C1.71], p = 0.005), and reduced oxygen requirements (0.77 [0.64C0.94], p = 0.011). C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin levels were lower in the nitazoxanide group than the placebo group on day 7. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Nitazoxanide, compared with placebo, did not prevent admission to the intensive care unit for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia.

The authors analyzed outcomes and complications following use of a synthetic or biological mesh for abdominal reinforcement following initial harvest or secondary repair of a bulge or hernia. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of all patients (n = 818) who had abdominal flap-based breast reconstruction between 1995 and 2011. Ninety-seven patients met inclusion criteria; 61 had synthetic mesh and 36 had biological mesh (porcine acellular dermal matrix). Complications and outcomes were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine contributing factors and differences between cohorts. RESULTS Overall complication rates for the synthetic and biological cohorts were 6.5 and 5.5 percent (p = 0.61), respectively, with slightly higher bulge rates in patients with synthetic compared with biological mesh (18 percent versus 8.3 percent; p = 0.25). Complication rates in primary and secondary placement of synthetic mesh were 5 and 7.3 percent, respectively; bulge rates were 15 and 19.5 percent, respectively. Complication rates in primary and secondary placement of biological mesh were 6.3 and 0 percent, respectively; bulge rates were 9.4 and 0 percent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Synthetic and biological mesh reconstruction for primary abdominal repair and secondary contouring have similar, low complication rates. Postoperative abdominal wall laxity and bulge occurred in an equal distribution following unilateral or bilateral flap reconstruction. Early investigation demonstrates that porcine acellular dermal matrix is as effective as synthetic mesh for abdominal wall reinforcement and repair, with limited morbidity associated with each.

The results reveal that cattle traders were negatively affected by COVID-19 in many ways including reduction in cattle sales, erosion in operating capital, and failure to sell animals while others have diversified or moved to other businesses. Twenty-five per cent of the cattle traders did not sell any animal during the lockdown. A majority of these were from Karamoja (43%) compared to those in Teso sub-region. The decline in cattle sales was significantly higher in Karamoja than in Teso sub-region. However, their recovery was significantly higher in Karamoja than in Teso sub-region because traders in Teso greatly diversified to other economic activities compared to traders in Karamoja sub-region. The traders who lost capital were mainly in Teso sub-region (63%). As expected, there was a sharp decline in the number of cattle buyers from markets outside the study area, mainly from Juba, Kampala, Busia, and Kenya. Coping strategies by cattle traders included crop cultivation (80%), burning charcoal (15%), selling food items (8%), and boda-boda riding (12%), while others did not engage in any economic activity (25%). To mitigate against the pandemic, traders were observing some of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) such as wearing face masks (76.1%), handwashing (19.3%), sanitising (2.3%), and social distancing (2.3%). Traders from Karamoja performed poorly in both diversification and mitigation measures. Based on our findings, recommendations to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on cattle traders include offering loans to cattle traders through their Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA), reducing transaction costs, offering mobile phones especially for Karamoja traders, and promoting the adoption of enforcing SOPs to reduce the need for lockdowns and cattle market closures which are detrimental to pastoral livelihood.","output":"The impacts of COVID-19 on cattle traders and their response in agro-pastoral and pastoral regions in Uganda: A case of Karamoja and Teso cattle traders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Lifestyle factors of children and adolescents mental health problems are an emerging health issue in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there is a lack of studies on lifestyle factors in LMICs. This study examined the socioeconomic and lifestyle factors associated with mental health problems among school-age children in Mongolia. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 4th-year students at public elementary schools in one district in Ulaanbaatar. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and a self-administrated socioeconomic and lifestyle questionnaire were completed by participants guardians. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of the 2301 children surveyed, 1694 without missing responses were included in the analysis. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.64 (1.29C2.10)], low maternal education [AOR 1.89 (1.16C3.05)], short sleep [AOR 1.41 (1.10C1.80)], no physical activity [AOR 1.31 (1.03C1.67)], and long screen time (AOR 1.53 (1.20C1.94)) were associated with high risk of mental health problems. Low maternal education, low household income, no physical activity habit, and long screen time were associated with internalising problems. Meanwhile, male gender, low maternal education, and long screen time were associated with externalising problems.

In the process of tomato production, it will encounter abiotic stress, such as low temperature, drought, and high salt, and biotic stress, such as pathogen infection, which will seriously affect the yield of tomato. Calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) is a class of major calcium signal receptor which has an important regulatory effect on the perception and decoding of calcium signals. CDPK plays a key role in many aspects of plant growth, such as the elongation of pollen tubes, plant growth, and response to biotic and abiotic stress. While some studies have concentrated on Arabidopsis and pepper, Solanum habrochaites is a wild species relative of cultivated tomato and there is no report on CDPK in Solanum habrochaites to date. Using tomato genomic data, this study identified 33 members of the CDPK gene family. Evolutionary analysis divides family members into four Asian groups, of which the CDPK family members have 11 gene replication pairs. Subcellular location analysis showed that most proteins were predicted to be located in the cytoplasm, and less protein existed on the cell membrane. Not all CDPK family members have a transmembrane domain. Cis regulatory elements relating to light, hormones, and drought stress are overrepresented in the promoter region of the CDPK genes in Solanum habrochaites. The expression levels of each gene under biotic stress and abiotic stress were quantified by qRT-PCR. The results showed that members of the CDPK family in Solanum habrochaites respond to different biotic and abiotic stresses. Among them, the expression of ShCDPK6 and ShCDPK26 genes change significantly. ShCDPK6 and ShCDPK26 genes were silenced using VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing), and the silenced plants illustrated reduced stress resistance to Botrytis cinerea, cold, and drought stress. The results of this study will provide a basis for the in-depth study of the CDPK gene family in Solanum habrochaites, laying the foundation for further analysis of the function of the gene family.","output":"Identification of CDPK Gene Family in Solanum habrochaites and Its Function Analysis under Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines injectable Opioid Agonist Treatment (iOAT), in which patients suffering from long-term, treatment refractory opioid use disorder (OUD) are prescribed injectable diacetylmorphine, the active ingredient of heroin.

SETTING Representatives from hospital and a range of community health and care settings. PARTICIPANTS Medical, pharmacy and nursing professionals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Good practice recommendations based on published evidence and the experience of prescribers in Scotland. RESULTS The findings of 88 uncontrolled, observational studies of variable quality were considered alongside a survey of over 200 prescribers. No national or international guidelines were identified. Antibiotic use towards the end of life was common but practice was highly variable. The potential harms associated with giving antibiotics tended to be less well considered than the potential benefits. Antibiotics often extended the length of time to death but this was sometimes at the cost of higher symptom burden. There was strong consensus around the importance of effective communication with patients and their families and making treatment decisions aligned to a patient's goals and priorities. CONCLUSIONS Good practice recommendations were agreed with focus on three areas: making shared decisions about future care; agreeing clear goals and limits of therapy; reviewing all antibiotic prescribing decisions regularly.

METHODS We conducted a multi-institutional, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial across four university programs; three had pediatric and adolescent gynecology rotations, and two had pediatric and adolescent gynecology fellowship-trained faculty. Applying permutated block randomization, residents were randomized to no intervention or completion of a validated eLearning module on prepubertal bleeding. All residents subsequently completed a pediatric and adolescent gynecology-related knowledge assessment that queried understanding of prepubertal bleeding and an objective structured clinical examination that assessed history collection, performance of a prepubertal genital examination, vaginal culture, and vaginoscopy for a pediatric patient. Objective structured clinical examinations were videotaped and reviewed by two faculty, blinded to randomization group; interrater reliability score was 97%. We calculated descriptive frequencies and compared randomization groups using  analyses and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables, and median tests for continuous variables; a value of P<.05 was considered significant. RESULTS From July 2018 to June 2019, we invited 115 residents to participate; 97 (83%) completed both objective structured clinical examination and follow-up knowledge assessments. Most were female (91%) and the majority reported limited pediatric and adolescent gynecology didactic or clinical experience, with 36% reporting prior didactics on prepubertal vaginal bleeding and 33% reporting prior exposure to the prepubertal genital examination.

The current study, conducted at a hospital in the United Kingdom, evaluated the effectiveness of these primes, both in isolation and in combination, at the entry way to four separate wards, over a longer duration than the previous work. Methods A crossover randomized controlled trial was conducted. Four wards were allocated for 6 weeks of observation to each of four conditions, including control, olfactory, visual, or both (i.e., olfactory and visual combined). It was hypothesized that hand hygiene compliance would be greater in all priming conditions relative to the control condition. The primary outcome was whether people used the gel dispenser when they entered the wards. After the trial, a follow up survey of staff at the same hospital assessed the barriers to, and facilitators of, hand hygiene compliance. The trial data were analyzed using regression techniques and the survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results The total number of individuals observed in the trial was 9,811 (female = 61%), with similar numbers across conditions, including control N = 2,582, olfactory N = 2,700, visual N = 2,488, and both N = 2,141.

First, we observe differences in mutational signals for geospatially separated populations such as the prevalence of A23404G in CA versus NY and WA. We show that the feedback between macrolevel dynamics and the viral population can be captured employing a transfer entropy framework. Second, we observe complex interactions within mutational clades. Namely, when C14408T first appeared in the viral population, the frequency of A23404G spiked in the subsequent week.

These observations indicate that macrolevel sociobehavioral measures have an impact on the viral genomics and may be useful for the dashboard-like tracking of its evolution. Finally, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is a genetically robust organism, our findings suggest that we are dealing with a high degree of adaptability. Owing to its ample spread, mutations of unusual form are observed and a high complexity of mutational interaction is exhibited.","output":"Multiscale Feedback Loops in SARS-CoV-2 Viral Evolution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and to date presence of the virus has been recorded in 215 countries contributing 0.43 million of death. The role of blood groups in susceptibility/resistance to various infectious diseases has been reported. However, the association of blood groups with susceptibility to COVID-19 infections or related death are limited. In the present report, we performed an epidemiological investigation in the Indian population to decipher the importance of blood groups concerning susceptibility or mortality in COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods: Data on COVID-19 infection and mortality was obtained from the website of the Government of India. Prevalence of ABO blood groups in different states and union territories of India were searched using different databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Relevant articles were downloaded, and data were extracted. Spearmans rank coefficient analysis was employed to study the correlation between blood group frequencies and COVID-19 infection or mortality rate. Results: A significant inverse correlation was observed between the frequency of O blood group and the COVID-19 mortality rate (Spearman r = -0.36, P=0.03), indicating a possible protective role of O blood group against COVID-19 related death. In contrast, the prevalence of blood group B was positively correlated with COVID-19 death/million (Spearman r = 0.67, P<0.0001), suggesting B blood type as a deleterious factor in COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: ABO blood group system is associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Blood group O may protects, and subjects with blood type B could be susceptible to COVID-19 mortality. However, further studies on COVID-19 infected patients in different population are required to validate our findings.","output":"ABO blood group system is associated with COVID-19 mortality: An epidemiological investigation in the Indian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presently the world is passing through a critical phase due to the prevalence of the Novel Corona virus, 2019-nCoV or COVID-19, which has been declared a pandemic by WHO.

Casearia sylvestris is a plant used topically in different communities in Brazil, to treat wounds or promote cutaneous healing. To evaluate the topical anti-inflammatory activity for the crude hydroalcoholic extract of Casearia sylvestris (HCE-CS) in the models of single or multipe administration of chroton oil to induce ear edema in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental study using male Swiss mice (25-35g) kept under constant conditions in the Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience (LaNEx)-UNISUL. Edema was induced in both models, respectively, by the single or multiple application of croton oil (CO, 2.5%, in 20l) on the external surface of the ear. The different groups of animals (n= 8) received different treatments: vehicle, dexamethasone (DEXA) or different doses of HCE-CS. Edema was evaluated macroscopically for 6 h (early edema) or 8 days (late edema) after the first application of the CO and immediately after the animals were submitted to euthanasia for the collection of the samples (treated ears). For early edema, the tissue was biochemically evaluated for myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and levels of nitrite/nitrate. In the late edema model, the ears were histologically evaluated for general morphometry, degranulated and non-degranulated mast cells, as well as acanthosis. RESULTS: Topic treatment with HCE-CS significantly reduced the early and late edema, as well as MPO activity and tissue levels of nitrite/nitrate. Finally, in the late edema model there was a lower density of degranulated mast cells in relation to the vehicle treated group and decreased thickness of the epidermis (acanthosis). CONCLUSION: These results suggest a possible benefit of topical treatment with HCE-CS in inflammatory conditions of the skin.","output":"Macroscopic, biochemical and hystological evaluation of topical anti-inflammatory activity of Casearia sylvestris (Flacourtiaceae) in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardio-oncology is a field dedicated to the prevention, diagnosis, and management of cardiovascular disease in cancer patients before, during, and after cancer therapy.

This study aimed to investigate the changes in sleep and napping habits in Brazilian adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A sample of 259 high school adolescents (mean age = 15.5 years) reported sleep and napping habits by means validated questionnaires in both baseline year (March-June 2019) and during COVID-19 lockdown (July 2020). RESULTS: The tendency to eveningness was higher and daytime sleepiness was reduced during the social isolation. Time in bed (TIB) increased by more than 2 hours and sleep onset time was delayed during the pandemic. More adolescents reported getting enough TIB during the pandemic. Moreover, sleepiness during remote classes was reduced compared to that reported during traditional classes one year before. The nap habit decreased during the pandemic compared to the baseline year. DISCUSSION: The lack of early wake-up pressure to attend school in the morning could explain the sleep improvements perceived during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The aim of this study was to identify health profiles and the COVID-19 pandemic related factors associated with fear, depression, anxiety and changes in sleep pattern in adults in Nigeria. Methods The data for this analysis was extracted from a cross-sectional online survey that collected information about mental health and well-ness from a convenience sample of adults 18 years and above resident in Nigeria from July to December 2020. Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous, closed-ended online questionnaire that solicited information on sociodemographic profile, health profiles (high, moderate and low COVID-19 infection risk profile) including HIV status, COVID-19 status, and self-reported experiences of fear, anxiety, depression and changes in sleep patterns. Results In total, 4,439 participants with mean age of 38.3 (11.6) years responded to the survey. Factors associated with higher odds of having COVID-19 related fear were health risk (p < 0.05);living with HIV (AOR: 3.88;95% CI: 3.22C4.69);having COVID-19 symptoms but not tested (AOR: 1.61;95% CI: 1.30C1.99);having a friend who tested positive to COVID-19 (AOR: 1.28;95% CI: 1.07C1.53) and knowing someone who died from COVID-19 (AOR: 1.43;95% CI: 1.24C1.65). The odds of feeling anxious was significantly higher for those with moderate or low health risk profile (p < 0.05);living with HIV (AOR: 1.64;95% CI: 1.32C2.04);had a friend who tested positive for COVID-19 (AOR: 1.35;95% CI: 1.08C1.68) or knew someone who died from COVID-19 (AOR: 1.53;95% CI: 1.28C1.84).

The main outcome of the study were to better characterize the clinical features and the treatment response of PIMS-TS and to explore its relationship with KD determining whether KD and PIMS are two distinct entities. METHODS: The Rheumatology Study Group of the Italian Pediatric Society launched a survey to enroll patients diagnosed with KD (Kawasaki Disease Group - KDG) or KD-like (Kawacovid Group - KCG) disease between February 1st 2020, and May 31st 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, treatment information, and patients' outcome were collected in an online anonymized database (RedCAP?). Relationship between clinical presentation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was also taken into account. Moreover, clinical characteristics of KDG during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (KDG-CoV2) were compared to Kawasaki Disease patients (KDG-Historical) seen in three different Italian tertiary pediatric hospitals (Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS \\"Burlo Garofolo\\", Trieste; AOU Meyer, Florence; IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa) from January 1st 2000 to December 31st 2019. Chi square test or exact Fisher test and non-parametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test were used to study differences between two groups. RESULTS: One-hundred-forty-nine cases were enrolled, (96 KDG and 53 KCG). KCG children were significantly older and presented more frequently from gastrointestinal and respiratory involvement. Cardiac involvement was more common in KCG, with 60,4% of patients with myocarditis. 37,8% of patients among KCG presented hypotension/non-cardiogenic shock. Coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) were more common in the KDG. The risk of ICU admission were higher in KCG. Lymphopenia, higher CRP levels, elevated ferritin and troponin-T characterized KCG. KDG received more frequently immunoglobulins (IVIG) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (81,3% vs 66%; p = 0.04 and 71,9% vs 43,4%; p = 0.001 respectively) as KCG more often received glucocorticoids (56,6% vs 14,6%; p < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 assay more often resulted positive in KCG than in KDG (75,5% vs 20%; p < 0.0001). Short-term follow data showed minor complications. Comparing KDG with a KD-Historical Italian cohort (598 patients), no statistical difference was found in terms of clinical manifestations and laboratory data. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection might determine two distinct inflammatory diseases in children: KD and PIMS-TS. Older age at onset and clinical peculiarities like the occurrence of myocarditis characterize this multi-inflammatory syndrome. Our patients had an optimal response to treatments and a good outcome, with few complications and no deaths.","output":"Defining Kawasaki disease and pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome-temporally associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy: results from a national, multicenter survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extraordinary demands of managing the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the world's ability to care for patients with thoracic malignancies.

The objective of this research is to determine the cost-effectiveness of continuing to vaccinate all with a quadrivalent cell-based vaccine (QIVc) compared to returning to an at-risk only policy after the pandemic resolves. Methods: A dynamic transmission model, calibrated to match infection data from the UK, was used to estimate the clinical and economic impact of vaccination across 10 influenza seasons. The base case effectiveness of QIVc was 63.9% and the list price was GBP 9.94. Results: Vaccinating 50% of all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc reduced the average annual number of clinical infections (?682,000), hospitalizations (?5800) and deaths (?740) in the UK. The base case incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (ICER) of all compared to at-risk only was GBP6000 (NHS perspective). When the cost of lost productivity was considered, vaccinating all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc became cost-saving. Conclusion: Vaccinating all 50- to 64-year-olds with QIVc is likely to be cost-effective.

RESULTS: 35 relevant studies reporting 3979 patients with hip fracture in the current ongoing pandemic, out of which 692 patients were COVID -19 positive. Twenty studies reported mortality and other relevant statistics on hip fracture patients with and without COVID 19 (4123 hip fracture patients in the year 2020C21, out of which 560 had or were suspected of having COVID -19). A meta-analysis of mortality statistics in patients with and without COVID revealed increased odds of mortality among COVID patients [odds ratio (OR) 6.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.09, 7.83] and meta-analysis on the subgroup of surgically treated patients also showed markedly increased mortality risk among those with COVID-19 (OR) 5.99, 95% CI [3.88,9.24]. CONCLUSION: The mortality risk is markedly increased in hip fracture with concomitant COVID -19 compared to those without it. This increased risk persisted in those managed surgically. It could be due to the inflammation induced by the fracture or surgery for fracture fixation, further exacerbating inflammation, leading to cytokine storm.

Due to exposure to heavy IS, intestinal transplant (ITx) recipients may be at particular high risk for severe COVID-19. COVID-19 and its potential gastroenterological manifestations have not been reported after isolated ITx. Case Description: A 41-year-old female ITx recipient was hospitalized because of dehydration and electrolyte disturbances during the second European COVID-19 wave in November 2020. One year earlier, she had undergone an intestinal re-transplantation for chronic allograft enteropathy, 14 years after first ITx for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. IS consisted of Tacrolimus, Azathioprine, and low-dose corticosteroids. On admission, her COVID-19 PCR was negative. Six days after admission, she tested positive on a screening COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR swab. At that time, she was asymptomatic and had normal inflammatory markers and a normal chest X-ray. Azathioprine was temporarily halted, and Tacrolimus slightly raised. Prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administered because of elevated D-dimers. One week after the positive test, she developed anosmia, mild dyspnea and a mild increase in CRP (25mg/L) was seen. Remdesivir was started at 200mg and continued at 100mg/day for 5 days. She presented a high stomal output 2 days in a row. An ileoscopy and biopsy showed no signs of infection or rejection. She was discharged after 4 weeks and remains in good health since then. Discussion: Despite presenting a mild form of COVID-19 infection, we preventively treated our ITx patient with LMWH and Remdesivir. Like for other solid organ Tx, azathioprine was temporarily halted/reduced. A transient increase in stomal output was observed but without proven rejection or infection.

We found that about three-quarters of the patients under active anticancer treatments experienced mild to moderate adverse effects (AEs) related to COVID-19 vaccines. Patients enrolled in early-phase trials or receiving experimental immunotherapy agents did not experience worse AEs related to the vaccine than patients with cancer not enrolled in these trials, receiving approved drugs. The safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines in patients enrolled in early-phase clinical trials, including those treated with new immune checkpoint inhibitors, does not seem to differ from that of the general population of patients with cancer. Our data support the current vaccine prioritization of all cancer patients with active treatment and calls for data sharing from vaccinated patients enrolled in early-phase clinical trials. ABSTRACT: Pivotal trials of COVID-19 vaccines did not include cancer patients, with questions remaining about their safety and efficacy in this population. Patients enrolled in early-phase clinical trials receive novel treatments with unknown efficacy and safety profiles. Studies on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in these patients are urgently required. This is a retrospective, real-world, cohort study of patients receiving anticancer treatments and COVID-19 vaccines between 1 February and 25 June 2021 at the Division of New Drugs Development for Innovative Therapies of the European Institute of Oncology. One hundred thirteen patients were enrolled, 40 in early-phase clinical trials, and 20 under novel immunotherapy agents. Nearly three-quarters of the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) after the first dose (1D) (74.3%) and second dose (2D) (72.6%). Most of the AEs were local (67.3% 1D and 61.9% after 2D), while 31.8% (1D) and 38.1% (2D) of the patients had systemic AEs. No AEs above grade 2 were observed. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccines appear to be safe in patients enrolled in early-phase clinical trials, including patients receiving novel immunotherapy compounds. All cancer patients should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of ongoing treatments or enrollment in early-phase trials.","output":"Safety of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines in Patients with Cancer Enrolled in Early-Phase Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has imposed a challenge on human health worldwide, and vaccination represents a vital strategy to control the pandemic. To date, multiple COVID-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization, including inactivated vaccines, adenovirus-vectored vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. These vaccines have different technical principles, which will necessarily lead to differences in safety and efficacy. Therefore, we aim to implement a systematic review by synthesizing clinical experimental data combined with mass vaccination data and conducting a synthesis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Compared with other vaccines, adverse reactions after vaccination with inactivated vaccines are relatively low. The efficacy of inactivated vaccines is approximately 60%, adenovirus-vectored vaccines are 65%, and mRNA vaccines are 90%, which are always efficient against asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, severe or critical hospitalization, and death. RNA-based vaccines have a number of advantages and are one of the most promising vaccines identified to date and are particularly important during a pandemic. However, further improvements are required. In time, all the antibody levels weaken gradually, so a booster dose is needed to maintain immunity.

Methods and Results: Included were 14,159 participants of the Kailuan study with assessment of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) from 2010 to 2015, and free of diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease at baseline. FBG and baPWV were repeatedly measured at baseline and follow-ups. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident diabetes across baseline baPWV groups: <1,400 cm/s (ref), 1,400 {less than or equal to} baPWV < 1,800 cm/s, and {greater than or equal to}1,800cm/s. Path analysis was used to analyze the possible temporal causal relationship between baPWV and FBG, among 8,956 participants with repeated assessment of baPWV and FBG twice in 2010-2017. The mean baseline age of the observed population was 48.3{plus minus}12.0 years. During mean 3.72 years of follow-up, 979 incident diabetes cases were identified.

The Japan Triage and Acuity Scale (JTAS) is frequently used for emergency patients, and the ESI has not been evaluated against the JTAS in Japan. This study aimed to examine the decision accuracy of the ESI for simulated clinical scenarios among nursing specialists in Japan compared with the JTAS. METHOD: A parallel group randomized trial was conducted. In total, 23 JTAS-trained triage nurses from 10 Japanese emergency departments were randomly assigned to the ESI or the JTAS group. Nurses independently assigned triage categories to 80 emergency cases for the assessment of interrater agreement. RESULTS: Interrater agreement between the expert and triage nurses was &#954;a?=a?0.82 (excellent) in the ESI group and &#954;a?=a?0.74 (substantial) in the JTAS group. In addition, interrater agreement by acuity was level 2a?=a?0.42 (moderate) in the ESI group and level 2a?=a?0.31 (fair) in the JTAS group. Interrater agreement for triage decisions was classified in a higher category in the ESI group than in the JTAS Scale group at level 2.

However, public interest and demand for telehealth during the pandemic remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: We used an infodemiological approach to estimate the worldwide demand for telehealth services during COVID-19, focusing on the 50 most affected countries and comparing the demand for such services with the level of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure available. METHODS: We used Google Trends, the Baidu Index (China), and Yandex Keyword Statistics (Russia) to extract data on worldwide and individual countries' telehealth-related internet searches from January 1 to July 7, 2020, presented as relative search volumes (RSV; range 0-100). Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from the World Health Organization. Individual countries' ICT infrastructure profiles were retrieved from the World Economic Forum Report. RESULTS: Across the 50 countries, the mean RSV was 18.5 (SD 23.2), and the mean ICT index was 62.1 (SD 15.0). An overall spike in worldwide telehealth-related RSVs was observed from March 11, 2020 (RSV peaked to 76.0), which then tailed off in June-July 2020 (mean RSV for the period was 25.8), but remained higher than pre-March RSVs (mean 7.29). By country, 42 (84%) manifested increased RSVs over the evaluation period, with the highest observed in Canada (RSV=100) and the United States (RSV=96). When evaluating associations between RSV and the ICT index, both the United States and Canada demonstrated high RSVs and ICT scores (&#8805;70.3). In contrast, European countries had relatively lower RSVs (range 3.4-19.5) despite high ICT index scores (mean 70.3). Several Latin American (Brazil, Chile, Colombia) and South Asian (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) countries demonstrated relatively higher RSVs (range 13.8-73.3) but low ICT index scores (mean 44.6), indicating that the telehealth demand outstrips the current ICT infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: There is generally increased interest and demand for telehealth services across the 50 countries most affected by COVID-19, highlighting the need to scale up telehealth capabilities, during and beyond the pandemic.","output":"Telehealth Demand Trends During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Top 50 Most Affected Countries: Infodemiological Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 restrictions have led to an unprecedented global hiatus in anthropogenic activities, providing a unique opportunity to assess human impact on biological systems. Here, we describe how a national network of acoustic tracking receivers can be leveraged to assess the effects of human activity on animal movement and space use during such global disruptions. We outline variation in restrictions on human activity across Australian states and describe four mechanisms affecting human interactions with the marine environment: (1) reduction in economy and trade changing shipping traffic;(2) changes in export markets affecting commercial fisheries;(3) alterations in recreational activities;and (4) decline in tourism. We develop a roadmap for the analysis of acoustic tracking data across various scales using Australia's national Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Animal Tracking Facility as a case study. We illustrate the benefit of sustained observing systems and monitoring programs by assessing how a 51-day break in white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) cage-diving tourism due to COVID-19 restrictions affected the behaviour and space use of two resident species. This cessation of tourism activities represents the longest break since cage-diving vessels started day trips in this area in 2007. Long-term monitoring of the local environment reveals that the activity space of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) was reduced when cage-diving boats were absent compared to periods following standard tourism operations. However, white shark residency and movements were not affected. Our roadmap is globally applicable and will assist researchers in designing studies to assess how anthropogenic activities can impact animal movement and distributions during regional, short-term through to major, unexpected disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The power of national acoustic tracking networks to assess the impacts of human activity on marine organisms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The silica nanoparticles, in a first approximation, mimic virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) particles. The setup is used to evaluate different tissues, nowadays, in times of the coronavirus pandemic, commonly used as facemasks, with regard to their particle retention capability. The setup enables adjusting different breathing scenarios by adjusting the gas flow speed and, thereby, to compare the filter performance for these scenarios. The effective penetration of particles can be monitored via fluorescence intensity measurements and is visualized via scanning electron micrographs and photographs under UV light. Ultimately, a strong increase of particle penetration in various mask materials as function of flow speed of the droplets is observed and an ultimate retention is only observed for FFP3 and FFP2 masks.

Furthermore, this research investigated the association of parental warmth and teacher warmth using a person-centered approach with adolescents' subjective well-being on the whole sample, and examined its conditional processes by ascertaining the moderating role of openness to experience and left-behind status in this association. A total of 246 left-behind youth (53.6% girls; Mage = 15.77; SD = 1.50) and 492 socio-demographically matched, non-left-behind peers (55.1% girls; Mage = 15.91; SD = 1.43) was involved in this study. During school hours, these adolescents were uniformly instructed to complete a set of self-report questionnaires. The results from ANCOVA exhibited no significant differences in subjective well-being between these two groups of youth. Moreover, four warmth profiles were revealed: congruent low, congruent highest, congruent lowest, and incongruent moderate, and youth within the congruent highest profile were more likely than the other three profiles to report higher subjective well-being. Additionally, moderation analyses demonstrated that high openness was one protective factor for subjective well-being, when left-behind youth perceived the lowest levels of parental warmth and teacher warmth congruently. These findings indicate that left-behind youth may not be psychologically disadvantaged in terms of positive psychosocial outcomes, such as subjective well-being, and school activities or social initiatives emphasizing openness to experience would be essential for them to facilitate positive adaptive patterns after parental migration.","output":"Openness to Experience Moderates the Association of Warmth Profiles and Subjective Well-Being in Left-Behind and Non-Left-Behind Youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this communication, we present arguments for androgen sensitivity as a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity. The androgen sensitivity model explains why males are more likely to develop severe symptoms while children are ostensibly resistant to infection. Further, the model explains the difference in COVID-19 mortality rates among different ethnicities. Androgen sensitivity is determined by genetic variants of the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor regulates transcription of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is required for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. TMPRSS2 primes the Spike protein of the virus, which has two consequences: diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and activating SARS-CoV-2 for virus-cell fusion. Genetic variants that have been associated with androgenetic alopecia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome could be associated with host susceptibility. In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to severe symptoms. Androgen sensitivity is a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity.

First, we analyzed recruitment of microbes through analysis of 16S rDNA enrichment in greenhouse cultured sugarcane seedlings growing in field soil. Then, plant-associated microbes were isolated and assayed for beneficial activity, first in greenhouse experiments, followed by field trials for selected microbial strains. The promising beneficial microbe SRB-109, which quickly colonized both roots and shoots of sugarcane plants, significantly promoted sugarcane growth in field trials, nitrogen and potassium acquisition increasing by 35.68 and 28.35%, respectively.

Moreover, they present role models for communities with regards to attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Hence, hesitancy of HCWs towards vaccination can crucially affect the efforts aiming to contain the pandemic. Previously published studies paid little attention to HCWs in Arab countries, which have a population of over 440 million. Objectives: To assess the rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside Arab countries, and their perceived barriers towards vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on an online survey was conducted from 14C29 January 2021, targeting Arabic-speaking HCWs from all around the world. Results: The survey recruited 5708 eligible participants (55.6% males, 44.4% females, age 30.6  10 years) from 21 Arab countries (87.5%) and 54 other countries (12.5%). Our analysis showed a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside of Arab countries (25.8% and 32.8%, respectively). The highest rates of hesitancy were among participants from the western regions of the Arab world (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria). The most cited reasons for hesitancy were concerns about side effects and distrust of the expedited vaccine production and healthcare policies. Factors associated with higher hesitancy included age of 30C59, previous or current suspected or confirmed COVID-19, female gender, not knowing the vaccine type authorized in the participants country, and not regularly receiving the influenza vaccine. Conclusion: This is the first large-scale multinational post-vaccine-availability study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among HCWs. It reveals high rates of hesitancy among Arab-speaking HCWs. Unless addressed properly, this hesitancy can impede the efforts for achieving widespread vaccination and collective immunity.","output":"Hesitancy of Arab Healthcare Workers towards COVID-19 Vaccination: A Large-Scale Multinational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Small group learning (SGL) is a main learning strategy in the study of bioscience subjects in nursing schools. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated Norwegian nursing students responses to the student-centered SGL approach in the study of anatomy and physiology (A&P) and tried to determine what aspects educators should improve regarding the use of SGL in the study of biosciences. METHODS: A descriptive questionnaire survey was conducted to evaluate Norwegian nursing students responses and experiences, for example, motivation, performance, satisfaction, and effectiveness of this new SGL strategy in the study of human A&P. RESULTS: Nursing students showed a high motivation and varied experience, for example, different attendance rates, satisfaction, and effectiveness in response to the student-centered SGL strategy in the study of human A&P. In addition, some students reported a low completion rate of assigned work for each SGL session. Additional concerns were collected in the open-end survey section. Subsequent thematic analysis of these comments identified that SGL arrangement and teacher tutorials were the main themes that needed to be improved in future SGL practice.

METHODS: The hospital notes of 18 PLWH hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively reviewed alongside data concerning their HIV demographics from an established HIV Database. RESULTS: The majority (16/18) had positive PCR swabs for SARS-CoV-2, and two had negative swabs but typical COVID-19 imaging and history. Most were male (14/18, 78%), median age 63 years (range 47C77 years). Two-thirds were migrants, nine (50%) of Black, Asian and minority ethnicity (BAME). All were diagnosed with HIV for many years (range 8C31 years), and all had an undetectable HIV viral load (<40 copies/mL). The median CD4 prior to admission was 439 (IQR 239C651), and 10/16 (63%) had a CD4 nadir below 200 cells/mm(3). Almost all (17/18) had been diagnosed with at least one comorbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 prior to admission. 3/18 patients died. None received mechanical ventilation.

Several animal models of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been developed and applied to antiviral research. In this study, two lethal mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 variants (BMA8 and C57MA14) with different virulence were generated from different hosts, which are characterized by high viral replication titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract, pulmonary pathology, cytokine storm, cellular tropism, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia. Two variants exhibit host genetics-related and age-dependent morbidity and mortality in mice, exquisitely reflecting the clinical manifestation of asymptomatic, moderate, and severe COVID-19 patients. Notably, both variants equally weaken the neutralization capacity of the serum derived from COVID-19 convalescent, but the C57MA14 variant showed a much higher virulence than the BMA8 variant in vitro. Q489H substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of BMA8 and C57MA14 variants results in the receptors of SARS-CoV-2 switching from human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (mACE2). Additionally, A22D and A36V mutation in E protein were first reported in our study, which potentially contributed to the virulence difference between the two variants. Of note, the protective efficacy of the novel bacterium-like particle (BLP) vaccine candidate was validated using the BMA8- or C57MA14-infected aged mouse model.

METHODS: We performed validation studies according to Commission of Office Laboratories Accreditation guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections; evaluated concordance with molecular and other serologic testing; and evaluated seroconversion. RESULTS: The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other acute respiratory virus infections.

A total of 73 patients with TAAAs were enrolled in the case group, and 219 sex-matched subjects without TAAAs were included in the control group. We then examined the relationship between HHcy and TAAAs by logistic regression models and subgroup as well as interaction analyses. RESULTS: Serum total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations and the proportion of HHcy were significantly higher in the patients with TAAAs than in those without TAAAs (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the multivariate logistic regression models indicated that participants with HHcy had a 2.14-fold higher risk of TAAAs than those with a normal serum tHcy level (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.00C4.56). Similarly, each 1 mol/L increase in the serum tHcy concentration was associated with a 4% higher risk of TAAAs (adjusted OR, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.00C1.07). Subgroup analyses indicated that HHcy tended to be associated with a greater risk of TAAAs in all stratified subgroups (adjusted ORs > 1).

Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and Other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To validate the PICTURE model's ability to predict unexpected deterioration in general ward and COVID-19 patients, and to compare its performance with the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), an existing model which has recently been assessed for use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to EDI and NEWS scores for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death). Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. RESULTS: In non-COVID-19 general ward patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) per observation, compared to the EDI's 0.763 (0.746 - 0.781) (n = 21,740, P < 0.001). In patients testing positive for COVID-19, PICTURE again outperformed the EDI with an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.849 (0.820 - 0.878) compared to the EDI's 0.803 (0.772 - 0.838) (n = 607, P < 0.001). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). CONCLUSIONS: The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering potential incipient waves of COVID-19 infections.

Upon the arrival of military medical assets to the Javits Convention Center in NYC, the planned mission to care for non-SARS-CoV-2 patients was immediately changed to manage patients with (SARS-CoV-2)COVID-19 and their comorbid conditions.Healthcare professionals from every branch of the uniformed services, augmented by state and local resources, staffed the Javits New York Medical Station (JNYMS) from April 2020. METHODS: The data review reported aggregated summary statistics and participant observations collected by N.Y. State and U.S. military officials. RESULTS: During the 28 days of patient intake at the JNYMS, 1,095 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were transferred from NYC hospitals to the JNYMS. At its peak, the JNYMS accepted 119 patients in a single day, had a maximum census of 453, and had a peak intensive care unit census of 35. The median length of stay was 4.6 days (interquartile range: 3.1-6.9 days). A total of 103 patients were transferred back to local hospitals, and there were 6 deaths, with an overall mortality rate of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3-1.2). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the care provided at the JNYMS. Within 2 weeks, this multi-agency effort was able to mobilize to care for over 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 patients with varying degrees of illness in a 1-month period. This was the largest field hospital mobilization in the U.S. medical history in response to a non-wartime pandemic. Its success with huge patient throughput including disposition and low mortality relieved critical overcrowding and supply deficiencies throughout NYC hospitals.

Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock, and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus, we demonstrate that, in addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage to the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and RaTG13 identified distinct tropisms, with the 2 human viruses being more closely aligned. Finally, using bioinformatics, structural data, and targeted mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues within the SpikeCACE2 interface, which may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock, and wildlife.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has a broad tropism for mammalian ACE2 proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic may have altered visitation patterns to parks, with potential effects on human health.

We describe a case of cardiogenic shock with extensive workup ruling out COVID vaccine induced myocarditis. Case: 42-year-old female who drinks 5 Monster energy drinks and 3-4 cups of coffee daily presented to the hospital with palpitations two weeks following her mRNA COVID vaccine. EKG showed atrial tachycardia with heart rates of 160 beats per minute. Adenosine and Lopressor were administered resulting in hemodynamic instability requiring norepinephrine. An echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 15%. Right heart catheterization was performed, and the cardiac index was 1.22 L/min/m2, systemic vascular resistance was 1918 dynes*sec*cm-5 and wedge pressure was 31 mm Hg. The patient was started on nitroprusside, furosemide, and milrinone drips and she began to improve. The patient was adamant the vaccine is what triggered her heart failure and extensive testing was performed to rule out COVID vaccine induced myocarditis. Workup showed normal coronary arteries and no evidence of infiltrative disease or myocarditis on cardiac MRI. The etiology was from tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy triggered by excessive stimulants and the patient had successful atrial tachycardia ablation of the right superior pulmonary vein. She was discharged on medical therapy for heart failure and advised to stop drinking energy drinks. Decision-making: Once the patient did not respond to the rate controlling agents an echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction. Right heart catheterization confirmed cardiogenic shock and nitroprusside and milrinone were started to help reduce afterload and improve contractility. Workup to exclude COVID induced myocarditis lead to the diagnosis of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy and atrial tachycardia ablation was performed. Conclusion: We report a case of cardiogenic shock with workup diagnosing tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy induced from a combination of excessive monster energy drinks and coffee.

Yet, the settings, goals, scale, and key features of these programs are not widely known. OBJECTIVE To identify and synthesize research on in-service nurse mentoring programs. METHODS We reviewed nurse mentoring research from six databases. Studies either referred explicitly to in-service nurse mentoring programs, were reviews of such programs, or concerned nurse training/education in which mentoring was an essential component. RESULTS We included 69 articles from 11 countries, published from 1995 to 2019. Most articles were from high-income countries (n = 46) and in rural areas (n = 22). Programs were developed to strengthen clinical care (particularly maternal and neonatal care), promote evidence-based practice, promote retention, support new graduate nurses, and develop nurse leaders. Of the articles with sufficient data, they typically described small programs implemented in one facility (n = 23), with up to ten mentors (n = 13), with less than 50 mentees (n = 25), meeting at least once a month (n = 27), and lasting at least a year (n = 24). While over half of the studies (n = 36) described programs focused almost exclusively on clinical skills acquisition, many (n = 33) specified non-clinical professional development activities. Reflective practice featured to a varying extent in many articles (n = 29). Very few (n = 6) explicitly identified the theoretical basis of their programs. CONCLUSIONS Although the literature about in-service nurse mentoring comes mostly from small programs in high-income countries, the largest nurse mentoring programs in the world are in low- and middle-income countries. Much can be learned from studying these programs in greater detail. Future research should analyze key features of programs to make models of mentoring more transparent and translatable. If carefully designed and flexibly implemented, in-service nurse mentoring represents an exciting avenue for enhancing the role of nurses and midwives in people-centered health system strengthening.

The situation has recently deteriorated even further because of social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently several harm reduction organizations have started to provide some harm reduction services via online platforms by web outreach. However, little is known on how online outreach services are organized and implemented. Drawing on the example of St. Petersburg-based NGO Humanitarian Action we explored web outreach work in Telegram instant messenger. Methods 4 semi-structured interviews with the NGO staff and 301 cases of web outreach work with PWUD comprised the dataset. The process of web outreach, service provision to PWUD, and PWUDs needs were thematically analyzed. Results Three stages of the process of web outreach work were determined: clients initiating communication, NGO workers addressing clients needs, and NGO workers receiving clients feedback. Communication proceeded either in group chat or in direct messages. Challenges in addressing clients needs happened when clients turned for help in nighttime, sent recorded voice messages, sent unclear messages, and/or were unwilling to transition to telephone communication. All web outreach workers reported receiving only positive feedback on their work. PWUDs needs were categorized into two major themes, depending on whether they can be addressed fully or partially online. In cases of online only provision of services, web outreach workers helped PWUD treat minor injection drug use complications, obtain verified harm reduction information and receive general psychological support. In instances of partial online services provision, PWUD were assisted in getting treatment of severe injection drug use complications, overdoses, and in accessing offline medical, psychological, social, legal and harm reduction services. Conclusions Our research demonstrated that web outreach work is a convenient tool for delivering some harm reduction services to PWUD either partially or completely online and recruiting new clients (including hard-to-reach PWUD that avoid attending brick-and-mortar facilities). It indicates that harm reduction organizations should consider incorporating online harm reduction services into their activities. However, more research is needed to explore relative advantages and disadvantages of online harm reduction services delivery.","output":"Harm reduction via online platforms for people who use drugs in Russia: A qualitative analysis of web outreach work"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION A low-vision assessment (LVA) is central to developing a vision rehabilitation plan. However, access to LVAs is often limited by the quantity and geographic distribution of low-vision providers, as well as patient-centred transportation challenges. A tablet-based LVA tool kit, delivered virtually, has the potential to overcome many of these barriers. The purpose of this research was to validate a key component of the tablet-based tool kit - a commercially available iPad visual acuity (VA) test (Eye Chart Pro) iPad app - in a low-vision population. METHODS Participants with low vision (n = 26) and those who were normally sighted (n = 25) underwent VA testing with both the iPad VA test application and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The VA data were compared using a t-test, linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the mean absolute difference in VA (log of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)=0.11; p = 0.82). Eye Chart Pro and Standard ETDRS Chart measures were also not significantly different (p = 0.98). However, there were significant differences between test methods in the low-vision group and the normally sighted group (p > 0.0001 and p = 0.007, respectively). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias (difference) of -0.0005 logMAR between methods, and 95% limits of agreement of 0.298 and -0.299 logMAR.

OBJECTIVE To contrast treatment outcomes of left unilateral (LUL) and SBL protocols. METHODS Registry data were collected at 111 practice sites. Of 10,099 patients, 3,871 comprised a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) sample, defined as a primary MDD diagnosis, age 18, and PHQ-9 completion before TMS and at least one PHQ-9 assessment after baseline. The mITT sample received high frequency (10 Hz) LUL TMS exclusively (N = 3,327) or SBL TMS in at least 90% of sessions (N = 544). Completers (N = 3,049) were responders or had received 20 sessions and had an end of acute treatment PHQ-9 assessment. To control for site effects, a Matched sample (N = 653) included Completers at sites that used both protocols. To control for selection bias, the SBL group was also compared to a Restricted LUL group, drawn from sites where no patient switched to SBL after substantial exposure to LUL TMS. Secondary analyses were conducted on CGI-S ratings. RESULTS The LUL group had superior outcomes compared to the SBL group for multiple PHQ-9 and CGI-S continuous and categorical measures in the mITT, Completer and Matched samples, including in the specified primary analyses. However, outcome differences were not observed when comparing the Restricted LUL and SBL groups. Within SBL protocols, the LUL-RUL order had superior outcomes compared to the RUL-LUL order in all CGI-S, but not PHQ-9, measures. CONCLUSIONS While limited by the naturalistic design, there was no evidence that SBL TMS was superior to LUL TMS. The sequential order of RUL TMS followed by LUL TMS may have reduced efficacy compared to LUL TMS followed by RUL TMS.","output":"Comparison of clinical outcomes with left unilateral and sequential bilateral Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatment of major depressive disorder in a large patient registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the current status of grief counseling of clinicians from five coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) designated hospitals in Wuhan and to provide reference for hospital management","output":"A survey of grief counseling of clinicians from coronavirus disease 2019 designated hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various disasters either man made or natural have necessitated people around the world to adopt ad-hoc practices in managing or mitigating the aftermath of the disaster.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person physical activity opportunities were limited. This paper describes a telephone-based physical activity support strategy among racially/ethnically diverse patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adult patients at a large, Federally Qualified Health Center with an on-site exercise facility referral were eligible to transition to telephone support with personal fitness advisors during the pandemic stay-at-home orders. Baseline surveys assessed physical activity and environmental characteristics; follow-up phone calls used motivational interviewing and physical activity goal setting strategies. From March 23-July 23, 2020, 72 patients participated in 270 phone calls, or 3.8 (2.1) calls per participant. Participants were, on average, aged 51.3 (11.6) years, 87.5% female, 31.9% Hispanic/Latino, and 47.2% non-Hispanic Black. Patients meeting physical activity guidelines pre-pandemic reported more planned exercise (100.0% vs. 55.3%; p<0.001), exercise days at home (5.0 vs. 1.7; p<0.001), and accomplishment of personal physical activity goals (57.0% vs. 39.7%; p = 0.11) than patients not meeting guidelines pre-pandemic. Patients with a home treadmill participated in twice the rate of calls compared to those without (RR = 2.22; 95%CI:1.35,3.64), but no other home environmental characteristics predicted participation rate. Pre-pandemic physical activity behavior appeared to predict pandemic physical activity and telephone-based physical activity support was effective for maintaining physical activity for some participants.

COVID-19 Ag Card in a high-throughput, drive-through, free community testing site in Massachusetts (MA) using anterior nasal (AN) swab RT-PCR for clinical testing.Methods: Individuals presenting for molecular testing in two of seven lanes were offered the opportunity to also receive BinaxNOW testing. Dual AN swabs were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic children ( 18 years) and adults. BinaxNOW testing was performed in a testing pod with temperature/humidity monitoring. One individual performed testing and official result reporting for each test, but most tests had a second independent reading to assess inter-operator agreement. Positive BinaxNOW results were scored as faint, medium, or strong. Positive BinaxNOW results were reported to patients by phone and they were instructed to isolate pending RT-PCR results. The paired RT-PCR result was the reference for sensitivity and specificity calculations.Results: Of 2482 participants, 1380 adults and 928 children had paired RT-PCR/BinaxNOW results and complete symptom data. 974/1380 (71%) adults and 829/928 (89%) children were asymptomatic. BinaxNOW had 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.0- 99.3) sensitivity and 100% (98.6-100.0) specificity in adults within 7 days of symptoms, and 84.6% (65.1-95.6) sensitivity and 100% (94.5-100.0) specificity in children within 7 days of symptoms. Sensitivity and specificity in asymptomatic adults were 70.2% (56.6-81.6) and 99.6% (98.9-99.9), respectively, and in asymptomatic children were 65.4% (55.6-74.4) and 99.0% (98.0-99.6), respectively. By cycle threshold (Ct) value cutoff, sensitivity in all subgroups combined (n=292 RT-PCR-positive individuals) was 99.3% with Ct 25, 95.8% with 30, and 81.2% with 35. Twelve false positive BinaxNOW results (out of 2308 tests) were observed; in all twelve, the test bands were faint but otherwise normal, and were noted by both readers. One invalid BinaxNOW result was identified. Inter-operator agreement (positive versus negative BinaxNOW result) was 100% (n = 2230/2230 double reads). Each operator was able to process 20 RDTs per hour. In a separate set of 30 specimens (from individuals with symptoms 7 days) run at temperatures below the manufacturer's recommended range (46-58.5F), sensitivity was 66.7% and specificity 95.2%.Conclusions: BinaxNOW had very high specificity in both adults and children and very high sensitivity in newly symptomatic adults. Overall, 95.8% sensitivity was observed with Ct  30. These data support public health recommendations for use of the BinaxNOW test in adults with symptoms for 7 days without RT-PCR confirmation. Excellent inter-operator agreement indicates that an individual can perform and read the BinaxNOW test alone. A skilled laboratorian can perform and read 20 tests per hour.

Many studies reported that the COVID-19 lockdown impacted PM2.5, SO2, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), etc. VOCs play important roles in the production of ozone and PM2.5. Ambient VOCs in Xiong'an were measured from December 25, 2019 to January 24, 2020 (prior to epidemic prevention, P1) and from January 25, 2020 to February 24, 2020 (during epidemic prevention, P2) through a VOCs online instrument. In the study, VOCs characteristics and ozone generation potential (OFP) of ambient VOCs were analyzed, and source apportionment of VOCs were analyzed by using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). The results showed that (TVOCs) during epidemic prevention and control was 45.110-9, which was approximately half of that before epidemic prevention and control (90.510-9). The chemical composition of VOCs showed significant changes after epidemic prevention and control, the contribution rate of alkanes increased from 37.6% to 53.8%, and the contribution rate of aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons decreased from 13.3% and 12.0% to 7.5% and 7.8%, respectively. Aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, and OVOCs decreased by more than 60%. Seven types of the top ten species were the same before and during the epidemic prevention and control, mainly low-carbon alkanes, olefins, aldehydes, and ketones. Dichloromethane, trichloromethane, and BTEXs decreased significantly. The OPP was 566 gm-3 and 231 gm-3 in P1 and P2, respectively. The OPP of VOCs decreased by more than 30%. The proportion of OFP contribution of aromatic hydrocarbons decreased significantly after the epidemic prevention and control, and the proportion of OFP contribution of alkanes and alkynes increased significantly. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was then applied for VOCs sources apportionment. Six sources were identified, including background sources, oil-gas volatile sources, combustion sources, industrial sources, solvent use sources, and vehicle exhaust sources. The results showed that after the epidemic prevention and control, the contribution rate of solvent use sources to TVOCs decreased from 24% to 9%. The contribution rates of background sources, oil-gas volatile sources, and combustion sources increased from 13%, 34%, and 24% to 6%, 14%, and 13%, respectively. The relative contributions of vehicle exhaust sources before and after epidemic prevention and control were 21% and 18%, respectively. The observation points were affected by the emission of VOCs from paroxysmal industrial sources before the epidemic prevention and control. The emission was stopped after the epidemic prevention and control, and its contribution rate was reduced from 22% before the epidemic prevention and control to 1%. The concentrations of industrial sources, solvent sources, motor vehicle tail gas sources, and combustion sources decreased by 97%, 82%, 61%, and 15%, respectively, after the epidemic prevention and control. The concentration of background sources remained stable, and the concentration of oil and gas volatile sources increased by 7%.

Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 was confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms) and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications. Logistic regression was used to explore risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis. RESULTS: The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Risk factors for higher mortality of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.04, 1.15] per year increase; P = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.24]; P = 0.043). Insulin usage (aOR 3.58 [95% CI 1.37, 9.35]; P = 0.009) was associated with poor prognosis. Clinical outcomes of those who use an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker (ARB) were comparable with those of patients who do not use ACEI/ARB among COVID-19 patients with diabetes and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: C-reactive protein may help to identify patients with diabetes who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization. Older patients with diabetes were prone to death related to COVID-19. Attention needs to be paid to patients with diabetes and COVID-19 who use insulin.

It begins with the proposition that recent historical events of global significance such as the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic of 2020, and the extreme weather events of 2021, were widely predicted and foreseen in the media by way of political reporting as much as popular social and natural science reporting in the years and decades prior. The same tropes were also present in the plotlines of popular literature, television, and film during that period. The central argument of the paper is that before media pundits and policy-makers expressed their surprise at the fragility of the Rule of Law in the unprecedented ascent of Trump, the lethal capacity and transmissibility of a novel coronavirus, and the sudden arrival of climate change in the daily lives of North Americans and Europeans, the spectre of these menaces had already penetrated our collective conscious in a way that ought to have changed outcomes. Neil Postmans conceptualization of the present epoch as Technopoly is a means of explaining how, despite ample warnings, we were not ready for much. Technopoly refers to the historical present as the historical moment in which the technocratic capacity of individuals, states, and markets to respond to existential problems is hindered by information overload, e.g., the threat to the Rule of Law presented by an outgoing American President who refuses to accept the verdict of the electorate;the threat to public health posed by persistent vaccine misinformation and inequitable global vaccine distribution;and, the threat posed to our collective habitat by extreme climate events. The paper concludes that fiction is a powerful potential antidote to the numbing effects of information overload in Technopoly if it is treated seriously as a source of normative authority rather than dismissed as pure diversion.","output":"Toward a Post-Apocalyptic Rule of Law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: It has been extensively highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 affects the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) and the angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 receptors play the most important role in the presentation of the COVID-19 disease 2-5 The ACE2 is type I membrane protein expressed on endothelial cells in the kidney, heart, gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and, importantly, lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells, which are particularly prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection As SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus, and its cardiovascular complications and the underlying pathology is still emerging However, it is accepted that the virus affects the total vasculature in the human body and this infection becomes a highly accelerated process for the target organ damage In the case of acute cardiological manifestation, it is termed as Acute COVID-19 Cardiovascular Syndrome (ACovCS) by the American Heart Association's white paper 6 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has published a detailed review paper 7 on the involvement of various cardiovascular target organs in COVID-19 disease This review clearly establishes a close two-way relationship between COVID-19 disease and all cardiovascular diseases (CVD) The prognosis is even worse in patients with preexisting cardiovascular system involvement Cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 is seen as a key manifestation The best way to assess endothelial dysfunction is an assessment of its clinical manifestation, i e , an increase in arterial stiffness There have been multiple in vitro and in vivo studies that have shown that the vascular endothelium is an important factor in setting the vascular tone and endothelial dysfunction leads to arterial stiffness 8 Arterial stiffness and enhanced wave reflections are markers of cardiovascular disease and independent predictors of cardiovascular risk 9-12 Stiffening of the large arteries and enhanced wave reflections lead to increased left ventricular (LV) afterload, disturbed coronary perfusion, and mechanical fatigue of the arterial wall 13 The relationship between systemic inflammation and arterial stiffness is well established in the literature 14 The cause-and-effect relationship that acute systemic inflammation leads to deterioration of large-artery stiffness Findings in study15 on induced inflammation have shown that an acute inflammation caused a temporary increase in central blood pressure and arterial stiffness in terms of pulse wave velocity This implies the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with acute systemic inflammation in the COVID-19 COVID-19 diseaserelated worldwide research and proposed mechanisms pointed to pathophysiological involvement of endothelial dysfunction and arterial wall compromise However, there was no empirical evidence of the functional compromise of arterial walls Hence, a study was urgently needed to study an increase in arterial stiffness in COVID-19 patients due to systemic inflammation to stratify the risk and mitigate further cardiovascular damage with guided therapeutic treatment based on the severity of arterial stiffness This pressing need is justified by a comprehensive review article16 published after the present study was envisaged We hope that the findings from our study will fulfill the need to a large extent Objectives: Primary objective: To study if the measurement of arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity in mild-moderate and a severe group of COVID-19 patients can stratify cardiovascular risk Secondary objective: To determine if initial measurements and subsequent changes in arterial stiffness can project the future course of the COVID-19 patient and hence predict the grade of clinical management a confirmed COVID-19 patient would require Materials and methods: The present prospective nonrandomized observational study {titled -

Previous research, however, suggests a possible mechanism through which grocery taxes may adversely affect health. Our objectives are to document the spatial and temporal variation in grocery taxes and to empirically examine the statistical relationship between county-level grocery taxes and obesity and diabetes. METHODS: We collect and assemble a novel national dataset of annual county and state-level grocery taxes from 2009 through 2016. We link this data to three-year, county-level estimates based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on rates of obesity and diabetes and provide a nation-wide spatial characterization of grocery taxes and these two health outcomes. Using a county-level fixed effects estimator, we estimate the effect of grocery taxes on obesity and diabetes rates, also controlling for a subset of potential confounders that vary over time. RESULTS: We find a 1 percentage point increase in grocery taxes is associated with 0.588 and 0.215 percentage point increases in the county-level obesity and diabetes rates. CONCLUSION: Counties with grocery taxes have increased prevalence of obesity and diabetes. We estimate the economic burden of increased obesity and diabetes rates resulting from grocery taxes to be $5.9 billion.

Although proprioceptive feedback is crucial for accurate motor control, little is known about how downstream circuits transform limb sensory information to guide motor output. Here we investigate neural circuits in Drosophila that process proprioceptive information from the fly leg. We identify three cell types from distinct developmental lineages that are positioned to receive input from proprioceptor subtypes encoding tibia position, movement, and vibration. 13B neurons encode femur-tibia joint angle and mediate postural changes in tibia position. 9A neurons also drive changes in leg posture, but encode a combination of directional movement, high frequency vibration, and joint angle. Activating 10B neurons, which encode tibia vibration at specific joint angles, elicits pausing in walking flies. Altogether, our results reveal that central circuits integrate information across proprioceptor subtypes to construct complex sensorimotor representations that mediate diverse behaviors, including reflexive control of limb posture and detection of leg vibration.","output":"Central processing of leg proprioception in Drosophila"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The index case of COVID-19 in Sabzevar, Khorasan Razavi Province in northeastern Iran, was an 80-year-old man with a history of psycho-neurological illness and acute respiratory clinical symptoms, and a history of travel to areas with confirmed COVID-19 cases in Gorgan City.

The cumulative effect of these efforts is unknown. OBJECTIVE To assess how the increase in depressive symptoms with residency has shifted over time and to identify parallel trends in factors that have previously been associated with resident physician depression. DESIGN Repeated annual cohort study. SETTING U.S. health care organizations. PARTICIPANTS First-year resident physicians (interns) who started training between 2007 and 2019. MEASUREMENTS Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) assessed at baseline and quarterly throughout internship. RESULTS Among 16 965 interns, baseline depressive symptoms increased from 2007 to 2019 (PHQ-9 score, 2.3 to 2.9; difference, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3 to 0.8]). The prevalence of baseline predictors of greater increase in depressive symptoms with internship also increased across cohorts. Despite the higher prevalence of baseline risk factors, the average change in depressive symptoms with internship decreased 24.4% from 2007 to 2019 (change in PHQ-9 score, 4.1 to 3.0; difference, -1.0 [CI, -1.5 to -0.6]). This change across cohorts was greater among women (4.7 to 3.3; difference, -1.4 [CI, -1.9 to -0.9]) than men (3.5 to 2.9; difference, -0.6 [CI, -1.2 to -0.05]) and greater among nonsurgical interns (4.1 to 3.0; difference, -1.1 [CI, -1.6 to -0.6]) than surgical interns (4.0 to 3.2; difference, -0.8 [CI, -1.2 to -0.4]). In parallel to the decrease in depressive symptom change, there were increases in sleep hours, quality of faculty feedback, and use of mental health services and a decrease in work hours across cohorts. The decrease in work hours was greater for nonsurgical than surgical interns. Further, the increase in mental health treatment across cohorts was greater for women than men. LIMITATION Data are observational and subject to biases due to nonrandom sampling, missing data, and unmeasured confounders, limiting causal conclusions.

ENDS are popular among adolescents, and chemical flavorants are an increasing concern due to the growing use of zero-nicotine flavored e-liquids. Despite this, little is known regarding the effects of ENDS flavorants on vaping-related behavior. Following previous studies demonstrating the green apple flavorant, farnesol, enhances nicotine reward and exhibits rewarding properties without nicotine, this work focuses on the green apple flavorant, farnesene, for its impact on vaping-related behaviors. Using adult C57BL/6J mice, genetically modified to contain fluorescent nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and farnesene doses of 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg/kg, we observed farnesene-alone produces reward-related behavior in both male and female mice. We then performed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and observed farnesene-induced inward currents in ventral tegmental area (VTA) putative dopamine neurons that were blocked by the nAChR antagonist, DhE. While the amplitudes of farnesene-induced currents are 30% of nicotine's efficacy, this indicates the potential for some ENDS flavorants to stimulate nAChR function. Additionally, farnesene enhances nicotine's potency for activating nAChRs on VTA dopamine neurons. This may be due to changes in nAChR stoichiometry as our data suggests a shift toward high-sensitivity 42 nAChRs. Consequently, these data show that the green apple flavorant, farnesene, causes reward-related behavior without nicotine through changes in nAChR stoichiometry that results in an enhanced effect of nicotine on VTA dopamine neurons. These results demonstrate the importance of future investigations into ENDS flavorants and their effects on vaping-related behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Although combustible cigarette use has decreased by 11% in America over the past two decades, the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has increased by 135% and 218% among high school and middle school students, respectively, in the last two years alone (Cullen et al., 2018; 2019). Due to the fact that most ENDS users vape flavored nicotine products and the growing use of zero-nicotine flavored e-liquids, it raises the questions of how chemical flavorants alter nicotine addiction and if they increase abuse liability themselves. We show that one chemical flavorant and odorant of green apple, farnesene, causes reward-related behavior on its own. These results increase our understanding on how flavorants promote neurological changes and affect nicotine addiction.","output":"Green apple e-cigarette flavorant farnesene triggers reward-related behavior by promoting high-sensitivity nAChRs in the ventral tegmental area."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the initial 41 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus published in Lancet, elevated blood IL-10 cytokine data from these patients and four healthy subjects were presented as argument to not consider immunosuppressive therapy We propose this is an erroneous interpretation of the cytokine measures, as parallel increases in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines indicate an intact immune axis and do not diminish the potential role of immunosuppression We show data in healthy control subjects strong correlations between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and immunosuppressive therapies should be considered in 2019 novel coronavirus cases Funding: This study was funded by NIH K01AG42498 (WW) and R01AG54046 (WTH) The funders have no role in the data analysis or manuscript preparation Declaration of Interest: WTH has served as a consultant to ViveBio LLC, Biogen Inc , and AARP Inc ;received research support from Fujirebio USA;and has a patent on CSF-based diagnosis of FTLD-TDP (assigned to Emory University)","output":"Caution on Plasma Cytokine Findings in 2019 Novel Coronavirus Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this present age of globalization, the logistics and transportation industry has become an integral part of most businesses/firms as it is aimed at ensuring the effective movement of people, distribution of goods and services from one location to another on time.

Viewed through the lens of particle-based simulations of flow, the practice of social distancing corresponds to a (significant) increase in an internal length scale of the flow, namely, the radius within which particles (pedestrians) strongly repel fellow particles. In this study, we report the results of two-dimensional pedestrian dynamics simulations modeling pedestrian counter-flows under confinement, in which individual pedestrians are described as active particles that aim to maintain a target speed while avoiding collisions. By systematically varying two quantitiesthe pedestrian density and the degree of social distancingwe compute fundamental diagrams for confined and socially distanced pedestrian flows, which show average pedestrian speed as a function of density and social distancing. These results reveal the sensitive dependence of average velocity on both independent variables, including a social distancing-induced jamming transition.

Further, there remain countries in the early phase of outbreak with zero or limited number of cases in southern hemisphere countries. In those countries at risk of future outbreak, ascertaining whether cases are imported or the result of local secondary transmission is important for government to shape appropriate public health strategies. Objective: To develop a method to estimate timing of infection establishment, which helps differentiate imported and autochthonous cases. Design, Setting and Participants: Of the first 18 cases reported in Singapore, 12 were used in our study (1 case with insufficient data and 5 on anti-viral treatment were excluded from the analysis). The viral load data from these initial cases considered imported due to their travel history to Wuhan were analyzed. Another viral load data from 3 cases reported from Zhuhai, China, for whom exposed day were known, were also analyzed to determine the viral load threshold for infection establishment. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test. Main Outcomes and Measures: The timing of infection establishment of each case was assessed by analysing viral load data after symptom onset using a within-host viral dynamics model for SARS-CoV-2. Estimated timing of infection will indicate whether cases are imported or autochthonous transmission within Singapore. Results: Six among the 12 cases were clearly imported cases, whereas we could not rule out the possibility of secondary transmission for the rest of 6 cases, which collectively evidenced ongoing transmission in Singapore. For the 6 cases who could be the results of secondary transmission, further investigation to identify the source of infection within Singapore should be warranted (i.e., contact tracing). Conclusions and Relevance: In an early phase of outbreak due to entrance or re-entrance of the virus to countries/communities, collecting viral load data over time from cases from symptom onset is highly recommended, because viral load data are valuable to infer the timing of infection and distinguish between imported cases and ongoing local transmission.","output":"Inferring Timing of Infection Using Within-host SARS-CoV-2 Infection Dynamics Model: Are \\"Imported Cases\\" Truly Imported?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study aimed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of hospitalized patients with common coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).

Patients in group LR were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg, twice a day, while patients in group LR+Ar were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice a day and arbidol 200 mg three times a day for at least 3 days. Data from these patients were collected from electronic medical record management system. RESULTS 73 patients were divided into two groups: group LR (34 cases) and group LR+Ar (39 cases), according to the antiviral agents. The overall cure rate of COVID-19 in group LR+Ar and group LR were 92.3% and 97.1%, respectively, with no significant difference (p = 0.62). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol led to a median time of hospital stay that was shorter by 1.5 days than in group LR (12.5 days vs. 14 days). The percentages of -COVID-19 RNA clearance was 92.3 in group LR and 97.1 in group LR+Ar which was similar to the cure rate. The median time to nucleic acid turning negative = (date of first negative PCR test) - (date of last positive PCR test) was 8.0 days in both groups with no significant difference (p = 0.59). Treatment of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol did not significantly accelerate main symptom improvement and promote the image absorption of pulmonary inflammation. CONCLUSION No benefit was observed in the antiviral effect of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol compared with lopinavir-ritonavir alone in the hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: From the beginning of August 2021 to the end of October 2021, the brain (18)F-FDG PET scans of patients referred for suspected neurological long COVID with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively reviewed in three French nuclear medicine departments (143 patients; 47.4 years old  13.6; 98 women). Experienced nuclear physicians from each department classified brain (18)F-FDG PET scans according to the same visual interpretation analysis as being normal, mildly to moderately (or incompletely) affected, or otherwise severely affected within the previously reported long-COVID hypometabolic pattern. RESULTS: On the 143 brain (18)F-FDG PET scans performed during this 3-month period, 53% of the scans were visually interpreted as normal, 21% as mildly to moderately or incompletely affected, and 26% as severely affected according to the COVID hypometabolic pattern. On average, PET scans were performed at 10.9 months from symptom onset ( 4.8). Importantly, this specific hypometabolic pattern was similarly identified in the three nuclear medicine departments. Typical illustrative examples are provided to help nuclear physicians interpret long-COVID profiles. CONCLUSION: The proposed PET metabolic pattern is easily identified upon visual interpretation in clinical routine for approximately one half of patients with suspected neurological long COVID, requiring special consideration for frontobasal paramedian regions, the brainstem and the cerebellum, and certainly further adapted follow-up and medical care, while the second half of patients have normal brain PET metabolism on average 10.9 months from symptom onset.","output":"Visual interpretation of brain hypometabolism related to neurological long COVID: a French multicentric experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New data on bat ectoparasites from Mindoro Island, Philippines are reported.

Results: a total of 480 and 680 participants were sampled at onset and two months later respectively. Of the 26 indicators of knowledge assessed, 22 (84.61%) showed significant increase (p<0.05) with the most significant changes observed with the symptoms, mode of transmission and prevention of the disease. The overall proportion of people with correct knowledge moved from 9.1% at onset to 41.4% two months after.

METHODS A cross-sectional was study performed at 4 emergency departments of Puerto Rico's metropolitan area, between June 2014 and May 2015. We included children younger than 24 months, with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis, who were born and living in Puerto Rico at the time of recruitment. A physician-administered questionnaire inquiring about the patient's medical, family, and social history and a bronchiolitis severity assessment were performed. Daily weather conditions were monitored, and aeroallergens were collected with an air sample and precision weather station within the metropolitan area to evaluate environmental factors. RESULTS We included 600 patients for 12 months. More than 50% of the recruited patients had a previous episode of bronchiolitis, of which 40% had been hospitalized. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 18.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2-36.5), male sex (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), history of asthma (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 3.6-22), allergic rhinitis (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.4), and smoke exposure by a caretaker (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4) were predictors of bronchiolitis episodes. Bronchiolitis episodes were associated with higher severity score (P = 0.040), increased number of atopic factors (P < 0.001), and higher number of hospitalizations (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study identifies Puerto Rican children who may present a severe clinical course of disease without traditional risk factors.

Moran's I and LISA clustering analysis indicated that Sao Paulo City is a significant hotspot for both the confirmed cases and deaths, whereas other cities across the State could be considered colder spots. Bivariate Moran's I also showed that the population density is a key indicator for the number of deaths, whereas the number of hospital beds is less related, implying that the fatality depends substantially on the actual patient's condition.

AIM: The aim of the present study is to analyse the development of nurse practitioner students self-assessed clinical competence from the beginning of their education to after completion of their clinical studies. DESIGN: The study involved the application of a longitudinal survey design adhering to STROBE guidelines. METHODS: The participants consisted of 36 registered nurses from a nurse practitioner programme at a Norwegian university. The Professional Nurse Self-Assessment Scale II was used for data collection during the period August 2015 to May 2020. RESULTS: The students developed their clinical competence the most for direct clinical practice. Our findings are inconclusive in terms of whether the students developed clinical competence regarding consultation, coaching and guidance, and collaboration. However, they do indicate a lack of development in some aspects of clinical leadership. The students with the lowest level of clinical competence developed their clinical competence regarding direct clinical practice significantly more than the students with the highest level of clinical competence. The differences between students with high and low levels of clinical competence were levelled out during their education. Thus, the students as a whole became a more homogenous group after completion of their clinical studies. Previous work experience in primary healthcare was a statistically significant, yet minor, predictor of the development of clinical competence. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the students developed their clinical competence for direct clinical practice in accordance with the intended learning outcomes of the universitys Masters programme and international standards for nurse practitioners. It is imperative that the clinical field supports nurse practitioners by facilitating extended work-task fits that are appropriate to their newly developed clinical competence.

METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study, guided by constructivist grounded theory principles, of 17 emerging experts in the field of academic social media. We engaged in a snowball sampling technique and conducted a series of semi-structured interviews. The analytic team consisted of a diverse group of researchers with a range of experience in social media. RESULTS: Understanding the strengths of various platforms was deemed to be of critical importance across all the participants.

However, it appears that severe maternal COVID-19 may have been associated with extremely preterm delivery, based on observed histologic chorioamnionitis. This is the first reported case of an extremely preterm infant born to a mother with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who required intubation, and was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma, inhaled nitric oxide, and prone positioning for severe hypoxemic respiratory failure prior to and after delivery of this infant. The infant remains critically ill with severe respiratory failure on high-frequency ventilation, inotropic support, hydrocortisone for pressor-resistant hypotension, and inhaled nitric oxide for severe persistent pulmonary hypertension with a right to left shunt across the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. Pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant should take all precautions to minimize exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to decrease adverse perinatal outcomes.","output":"Extremely Preterm Infant Born to a Mother With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in well-being and an increase in mental health problems were registered in medical and psychotherapeutic practices, counseling centers, and clinics. According to previous studies, younger people and women seemed to be particularly affected. The aim of this study was to describe mental health problems of students and to draw consequences for the further handling of pandemics and other crises. METHOD: Students at the University of Heidelberg, a typical German full university, were surveyed online using internationally comparable screening instruments like the Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). In addition, the students had the opportunity to describe in a narrative form their well-being and to make suggestions how to improve their situation. RESULTS: Out of a population of 27,162 students who were contacted by email, 2,137 students completed the questionnaire. The salient finding is that according to the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, 72.2% of the respondents feel seriously impaired in their well-being. This corresponds to the finding that 75.8% of the respondents in the PHQ-D show indications of at least one syndrome diagnosis. Depression was found in 41.8% of the respondents in the PHQ-D. Indications of moderate to severe and severe depressive syndromes were present in 31.8%. Signs of somatoform syndromes are found in 25.4% and of anxiety syndromes in 20.0%. 1,089 students gave narrative reports on how they were feeling and made suggestions for improvement. About 75% reported severely reduced well-being. Their main complaints were loneliness and depression and lack of recognition for their specific academic and life situation during the pandemic. By far, the largest proportion of students supposed that their mental health issues were caused and/or intensified by the pandemic-related social contact restrictions. The vast majority of them made reasonable suggestions for controlled relaxation of contact restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Students suffer severely from the pandemic-related social restriction. In respect to future pandemic outbreaks or other crises leading to social isolation, the dramatic consequences of social lockdowns should be taken into account. Under pandemic conditions, we especially should support persons lacking social networks.","output":"Well-Being and Mental Health of Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, the capacity of healthcare systems across continents has been strained and put to the test with the emergence of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The timely need to ensure the availability of healthcare facilities to isolate and manage the surge in COVID-19 cases without overwhelming existing hospital capacity has posed challenges in many countries. In this paper, we discuss the conceptualisation, preparations and operationalisation of a community healthcare facility that was set up within a short time frame to attend to the convalescent needs of a large number of COVID-19 patients in the early phase of handling the pandemic. In the first month of operations, we monitored a total of 2129 clinical encounters, with the majority of patients between 17-35 years of age and between day 2 to day 6 of illness upon admission. Overall, there was a good outcome for the patients, with only 2.3% requiring transfer back to restructured hospitals. There was also no mortality. We hope that the sharing of our experiences of the challenges and learning lessons gleaned may be useful to guide individuals in planning for the future preparedness of healthcare systems in managing pandemics.","output":"Experience from a Multi-Disciplinary Team Against COVID-19: A Healthcare Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Correspondence to Dr Surinder S Rana, PGIMER, Chandigarh 160012, India;drsurinderrana@gmail.com We read with interest the article by Mcleod et al 1 describing the use of a specially designed novel acrylic box (endoscopy box;EBOX) for performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as well as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the current era of COVID-19 pandemic.1 We congratulate the authors for designing this enclosure that has potential of mitigating risk of transmission of infections via air droplets during endoscopy. Endoscopy can generate aerosols because of coughing or retching and it has demonstrated that COVID-19 virus can remain viable in aerosols for hours.2 An experimental study using transparent aerosol box for endotracheal intubation demonstrated that simulated cough caused contamination of only inner surface of box and operators gloves and gowned forearms whereas without aerosol box simulated cough resulted in widespread contamination.3 Using similar analogy, EBOX designed by authors also resulted in limited contamination during endoscopy especially of key areas such as exposed neck of the endoscopist. The experimental study by Canelli et al generated more droplets as compared with aerosols and their method of detection could not identify small quantities of infectious material.3 Therefore, these protective enclosures are not a replacement for standard protective precautions but an adjunct to standard protective equipment and practices.4 Also, ERCP is an advanced procedure that involves lot of dexterity and unrestricted movements of duodenoscope.

Presently, measurement of blood glucose is a factor for concern mostly when treating individuals with diabetes. Significance of blood glucose measurement in prognosis of non-diabetic and hospitalized patients is not clear. METHODS: A systematic search of literature published in the Electronic databases, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed using following keywords; blood glucose, hospital admissions, critical illness, hospitalizations, cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality. This literature search was largely restricted to non-diabetic individuals. RESULTS: Blood glucose level, even when in high normal range, or in slightly high range, is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized patients. Further, even slight elevation of blood glucose may increase mortality in patients with COVID-19. Finally, blood glucose variability and hypoglycemia in critically ill individuals without diabetes causes excess in-hospital complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: In view of these data, we emphasize the significance of blood glucose measurement in all patients admitted to the hospital regardless of presence of diabetes. We propose that blood glucose be included as the \\"fifth vital sign\\" for any hospitalized patient.","output":"Blood glucose levels should be considered as a new vital sign indicative of prognosis during hospitalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was first identified in 2003 when it caused an epidemic of fatal human pneumonia cases that rapidly spread to multiple countries from an epicenter in Hong Kong. The outbreak was eventually controlled by quarantine measures but not before it had caused many fatalities. The original zoonotic source of the SARS virus that caused the outbreak is still unknown but is suspected to be bats. Attempts were made to develop a prophylactic vaccine but the SARS epidemic was over before any vaccines could be tested for human efficacy. As will be discussed in this chapter, coronavirus vaccines present many challenges including low and rapidly waning immunity and the fact that coronavirus vaccines, particularly when formulated with Th2-biased alum adjuvants, can exacerbate coronavirus infection-associated eosinophilic lung immunopathology. Fortunately, this problem can be avoided by formulation of coronavirus vaccines with Th1-type adjuvants that enhance T cell IFN- responses, such as, delta inulin or TLR agonists. Hence, appropriate adjuvant selection is vitally important for the development of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines. This chapter will describe the current state of development of SARS vaccines, the issue of coronavirus-associated eosinophilic lung immunopathology and how adjuvants can be used to reduce the risk of this complication.","output":"SARS coronavirus infections of the lower respiratory tract and their prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS OF THE STUDY To evaluate post-operative complications and the recurrence rate after repair of large ventral incisional hernia with an open technique using intraperitoneal composite mesh and an associated aponeurotic overlay.

METHODS: IVH was induced in 1-day-old (P1) Wistar rats by left periventricular injection of clostridium collagenase (PVCC). At P6, P14, and P45 IVH-BD (area of damage, motor and cognitive deficits, Lactate/N-acetylaspartate ratio), white matter injury (WMI: ipsilateral hemisphere and corpus callosum atrophy, oligodendroglial population and myelin basic protein signal reduction), blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction (occludin and Mfsd2a expression, Gadolinium leakage) and inflammation (TNF, TLR4, NFkB, and MMP9 expression; immune cell infiltration), excitotoxicity (Glutamate/N-acetylaspartate), and oxidative stress (protein nitrosylation) were assessed. Sham animals were similarly studied. RESULTS: IVH-BD leads to long-term WMI, resulting in motor and cognitive impairment, thus reproducing IVH-BD features in ELBWN. BBB dysfunction with increased permeability was observed at P6 and P14, coincident with an increased inflammatory response with TLR4 overexpression, increased TNF production, and increased immune cell infiltration, as well as increased excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: This model reproduced some key hallmarks of IVH-BD in ELBWN. Inflammation associated with BBB dysfunction appears as relevant therapeutic target to prevent IVH-BD-induced WMI. IMPACT: Paraventricular injection of clostridium collagenase (PVCC) to 1-day-old Wistar rats uniquely reproduced the neuroimaging, histologic and functional characteristics of intraventricular hemorrhage-induced brain damage (IVH-BD) in extremely low birth weight newborns (ELBWN). PVCC-induced IVH triggered a prolonged inflammatory response associated with blood-brain barrier increased permeability, which in turn facilitates the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Thus, PVCC led to white matter injury (WMI) resulting in long-term motor and cognitive impairment. This model offers a valuable tool to obtain further insight into the mechanisms of IVH-BD in ELBWN and proposes some key therapeutic targets.","output":"Intraventricular hemorrhage induces inflammatory brain damage with blood-brain barrier dysfunction in immature rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"H2 has shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant ability in many clinical trials, and its application is recommended in the latest Chinese novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) treatment guidelines.

The abundance of research has also made it possible to produce several systematic reviews and meta-analyzes. All the studies retrieved in these reviews, however, were cross-sectional. Depressive symptoms and anxiety in HCWs were compared to normal values, administrative staff, or external sample; moreover, some studies had no control group. No longitudinal study has been produced so far. Some studies had negative results. Overall, there is still little evidence of an increase in mental health problems and sleep disturbances in HCWs during the outbreak. To fill this gap, we investigated the mental health of workers who have been monitored for many years in an Italian local health unit. Mental health was investigated with standardized questionnaires. 82 HCWs who tested positive at the COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab, 152 exposed workers who tested negative and 361 unexposed controls participated in the survey. Anxiety was reported by 16.6% of COVID-19 cases and depression by 20.3%, with a significant increase in the estimated risk (OR = 4.3; CI95%=2.4-7.4 for anxiety, OR = 3.5; CI95% =2.0-6.0 for depression). In test-positive cases, sleep was a significant moderating factor in the relationship between occupational stress or PJ and anxiety. Exposed, negative HCWS also had an increased OR for anxiety (1.84, CI95% 1.1-3.1) and depression (2.2 CI95% 1.4-3.5). The frequency of anxiety and depression disorders in the population examined was not higher than that recorded in the years preceding the epidemic during periodic occupational health checks in the workplace. Mental health support and organizational interventions must mainly concern workers with positive tests and should also tend to improve sleep quality. KEY MESSAGES: Health care workers who have had unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients, and even more those who have contracted the infection, have sleep problems, anxiety and depression. The psychological support intervention for health care workers should include the promotion of sleep hygiene.","output":"COVID-19 and staff mental health: is there an evidence?

SST courses using cadavers have been performed to advance a surgeon's techniques without any risk to patients. One important factor for improving SST is the suitability of specimens, which depends on the embalming method. In addition, the infectious risk and cost involved in using cadavers are problems that need to be solved. Six cadavers were embalmed by 3 methods: formalin solution, Thiel solution (TS), and SSS methods. Bacterial and fungal culture tests and measurement of ranges of motion were conducted for each cadaver. Fourteen surgeons evaluated the 3 embalming methods and 9 SST instructors (7 trauma surgeons and 2 orthopedists) operated the cadavers by 21 procedures. In addition, ultrasonography, central venous catheterization, and incision with cauterization followed by autosuture stapling were performed in some cadavers. The SSS method had a sufficient antibiotic effect and produced cadavers with flexible joints and a high tissue quality suitable for SST. The surgeons evaluated the cadavers embalmed by the SSS method to be highly equal to those embalmed by the TS method. Ultrasound images were clear in the cadavers embalmed by both the methods. Central venous catheterization could be performed in a cadaver embalmed by the SSS method and then be affirmed by x-ray. Lungs and intestines could be incised with cauterization and autosuture stapling in the cadavers embalmed by TS and SSS methods. Cadavers embalmed by the SSS method are sufficiently useful for SST. This method is simple, carries a low infectious risk, and is relatively of low cost, enabling a wider use of cadavers for SST.","output":"Saturated salt solution method: a useful cadaver embalming for surgical skills training."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, there are no specific and efficient vaccines or drugs for COVID-19, particularly in severe cases.

One novel aspect of this study focuses on the potential application of personalized medicine in treating severe cases of COVID-19. However, it is theoretical, as any real-world examples of the use of genuinely personalized medicine have not existed yet. Nevertheless, we know that stem cells, especially MSCs, have immune-modulatory effects and can be stored for future personalized medicine applications. This theory has been conjugated with some evidence that we review in the present study. Besides, we discuss the importance of personalized medicine and its possible aspects in COVID-19 treatment, then review the cell-based therapy studies for COVID-19 with a particular focus on stem cell-based therapies as a primary personalized tool medicine.

WLB can be divided into work interference with personal life (WIPL) and personal life interference with work (PLIW). This study aimed to investigate longitudinal associations between WIPL, PLIW and work ability outcomes. METHODS: In this cohort study, 224 employees in the energy and water sector in Sweden were followed-up over 2 years. Three questions derived from the Work Ability Index were used for measuring work ability outcome: current work ability compared with lifetime best; work ability regarding physical; and mental demands. Logistic regression models were used to analyse longitudinal associations between work ability and WIPL and WIPL respectively, controlling for workplace (company), position at work, experience of leadership quality, demographics, and work ability. RESULTS: Work ability compared to lifetime best were associated with WIPL in the adjusted logistic regression models (odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15C2.73), and PLIW (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.66C6.74).
