In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) were immunodeficiency (188%), kidney disease (166%), neurological disease (103%), dyspnea (86%), pneumopathy (55%), O2 saturation <95% (53%), respiratory discomfort (49%), age (36%), sore throat (31%), and sex (0.5%). There was a 5% increase in the chance of death for each year of life. CONCLUSION: Heart disease and Diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities, but did not indicate an increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age, sex, sore throat, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort, O2 saturation <95%, neurological disease, pneumopathy, immunodeficiency, and kidney disease were significantly associated with risk of death from COVID-19.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 1544 Brazilians aged 60 years and over with laboratory evidence for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies. CONCLUSION: Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.","output":"Conservative management of early-onset severe preeclampsia: comparison between randomized and observational studies a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.","output":"Update of transmission modelling and projections of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis in the Mandoul focus, Chad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell markers also changes during gestation, according with the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. A better knowledge of stem/progenitor cells of preterms will allow neonatologists to boost preterm organ maturation, favoring the differentiation of the multiple cells types that characterize each organ in at term neonates.","output":"Stem/progenitor cells in fetuses and newborns: overview of immunohistochemical markers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of alcohol based hand sanitisers globally.

The case group included patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the control group was randomly sampled from the general Korean population in the National Health Insurance Service database by matching sex, age, and region of residence. Conditional logistic regression models were used to investigate whether the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was affected by smoking status. RESULTS: A total of 4,167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 20,937 matched controls were enrolled. The proportion of ex-smokers and current smokers was 26.6% of the total participants. In multivariate analysis, smoking was not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56, confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.62). When ex-smokers and current smokers were analysed separately, similar results were obtained (current smoker OR = 0.33, CI = 0.28-0.38; ex-smoker OR = 0.81, CI = 0.72-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that smoking may not be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

As a downstream component of SIRT-1, NF-B is one of the important signaling pathways that regulate the inflammatory response.

Currently, nucleic-acid detection and immunoassay methods are among the most popular means for quickly identifying viral infection directly from source. Nucleic acid-based detection generally offers high sensitivity, but can be time-consuming, costly, and require trained staff. The use of isothermal-based amplification systems for detection could aid in the reduction of results turnaround and equipment-associated costs, making them appealing for point-of-use applications, or when high volume/fast turnaround testing is required. Alternatively, immunoassays offer robustness and reduced costs. Furthermore, some immunoassay formats, such as those using lateral-flow technology, can generate results very rapidly. However, immunoassays typically cannot achieve comparable sensitivity to nucleic acid-based detection methods. Alongside these methods, the application of next-generation sequencing can provide highly specific results.

This report details a case of complicated brucellosis with infective spondylitis in a 48-year-old male construction worker recently returned from Iraq. Infection with B. melitensis was confirmed using 16s rRNA sequencing and omp31 gene analysis. The patient was successfully treated using a combination of rifampin, doxycycline, and streptomycin, in accordance with WHO guidelines. This is the first reported case of complicated brucellosis with infective spondylitis in Korea caused by B. melitensis originating from Iraq.","output":"An Imported Case of Brucella melitensis Infection in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum La prise en charge des pathologies du sommeil a t fortement impacte par lpidmie de COVID-19.

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis from a national multicenter cross-sectional study performed in 10 cities, from June to August, 2020, in Brazil. Interviewed postpartum women, without medical or obstetrical comorbidities, were included in the present subanalysis. A structured questionnaire and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were applied. RESULTS: Out of the 1,662 women, 763 (45.9%) met the criteria for the current analysis and 16.1% presented with moderate and 11.5% with severe maternal anxiety. Moderate or severe maternal anxiety was associated with high school education (odds ratio [OR]:1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.04-2.40). The protective factor was cohabiting with a partner (OR: 0.46; 95%CI: 0.29-0.73). There was a positive correlation between the total BAI score and receiving information about care in the pandemic (rpartial 0.15; p < 0.001); concern about vertical transmission of COVID-19 (rpartial 0.10; p = 0.01); receiving information about breastfeeding (rpartial 0.08; p = 0.03); concerns about prenatal care (rpartial 0.10; p = 0.01), and concerns about the baby contracting COVID-19 (rpartial 0.11; p = 0.004). The correlation was negative in the following aspects: self-confidence in protecting from COVID-19 (rpartial 0.08; p = 0.04), having learned (rpartial 0.09; p = 0.01) and self-confidence in breastfeeding (rpartial 0.22; p < 0.001) in the context of the pandemic.

The study aimed to develop an evidence-based CPG for the treatment of AR in children with TCM. Systematic literature research, expert questionnaire, and clinical evaluation after three rounds of surveys were adopted to form recommendations for treating children with AR using the Delphi method. Depending on the clinical manifestations, we finally recommended two decoctions with two Chinese patent medicines for an acute attack of AR and two decoctions for a chronic period of AR. For the acute attack of AR in children, Xinyi Qingfei decoction, Wenfei Zhiliu decoction, Xinqin granules, and Xinyi Biyan pills were suggested, whereas for the chronic period of AR, Buzhong Yiqi and Jingui Shenqi decoctions were recommended. The four external treatment methods suggested for the prevention and care of AR were body acupuncture, moxibustion, auricular point pressing, and acupoint application.

The Achilles heel of industrial hemp is its association with marijuana. Industrial hemp from the Cannabis sativa L. plant is reported to be one of the strongest natural multipurpose fibers on earth. The Cannabis plant is a vigorous annual crop broadly separated into two classes: industrial hemp and marijuana. Up until the eighteenth century, hemp was one of the major fibers in the United States. The decline of its cultivation and applications is largely due to burgeoning manufacture of synthetic fibers. Traditional composite materials such as concrete, fiberglass insulation, and lumber are environmentally unfavorable. Industrial hemp exhibits environmental sustainability, low maintenance, and high local and national economic impacts. The 2018 Farm Bill made way for the legalization of hemp by categorizing it as an ordinary agricultural commodity. Unlike marijuana, hemp contains less than 0.3% of the cannabinoid, (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive compound which gives users psychotropic effects and confers illegality in some locations. On the other hand, industrial hemp contains cannabidiol found in the resinous flower of Cannabis and is purported to have multiple advantageous uses. There is a paucity of investigations of the identity, microbial diversity, and biochemical characterizations of industrial hemp. This review provides background on important topics regarding hemp and the quantification of total tetrahydrocannabinol in hemp products. It will also serve as an overview of emergent microbiological studies regarding hemp inflorescences.

However, the impacts of perceived social isolation depending on different clinical stages of AD have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of perceived social isolation or loneliness on brain structure and future cognitive trajectories in patients who are living with or are at risk for AD. A total of 176 elderly patients (mean age of 78 years) who had complaint of memory problems (39 subjective cognitive decline [SCD], 53 mild cognitive impairment [MCI], 84 AD) underwent structural MRI and neuropsychological testing. Loneliness was measured by one binary item question Do you often feel lonely?. Voxel-based morphometry was conducted to evaluate regional gray matter volume (rGMV) difference associated with loneliness in each group. To evaluate individual differences in cognitive trajectories based on loneliness, subgroup analysis was performed in 51 patients with AD (n = 23) and pre-dementia status (SCD-MCI, n = 28) using the longitudinal scores of Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive component-Japanese version (ADAS-Jcog). Whole brain VBM analysis comparing lonely to non-lonely patients revealed loneliness was associated with decreased rGMV in bilateral thalamus in SCD patients and in the left middle occipital gyrus and the cerebellar vermal lobules I ? V in MCI patients. Annual change of ADAS-Jcog in patients who reported loneliness was significantly greater comparing to these non-lonely in SCD-MCI group, but not in AD group.

In these high-income countries, compared with the general population refuge women have higher prevalence of mental illness. Thus, this review was conducted to examine the barriers to and facilitators of access to mental health services for refugee women in high-income countries for refugee resettlement. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases for research articles written in English with qualitative component. The last search date was on March 14, 2020. A narrative synthesis was conducted to gather key synthesis evidence. Refugee women (aged 18 and older) that could receive mental health services were included. Men and women under non-refugee migrant legal status were excluded. Studies were evaluated studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) qualitative checklist. RESULTS Of the four databases searched, 1258 studies were identified with 12 meeting the inclusion criteria. Three studies were cross-sectional by design, eight studies used a qualitative approach and one studies used mixed approach. The major barriers identified were language barriers, stigmatization, and the need for culturally sensitive practices to encourage accessing mental health care within a religious and cultural context. There were several studies that indicated how gender roles and biological factors played a role in challenges relating to accessing mental health services. The major facilitators identified were service availability and awareness in resettlement countries, social support, and the resilience of refugee women to gain access to mental health services. CONCLUSION This review revealed that socio-economic factors contributed to barriers and facilitators to accessing mental health among women refugees and asylum seekers. Addressing those social determinants of health can reduce barriers and enhance facilitators of access to mental health care for vulnerable populations like refugee women. A key limitation of the evidence in this review is that some data may be underreported or misreported due to the sensitive and highly stigmatizing nature of mental health issues among refugee populations.

The therapeutic effect of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy is not obvious. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an ideal modality to fight cancer, and the nature of photosensitizer limits its application in clinical therapy. The aim of this study was to explore a novel mode of drug delivery for the intervention of bile duct cancer. METHODS: Oxaliplatin and photosensitizer HCE6 were loaded with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) to synthesize Oxaliplatin/HCE6-MSNs (OH-MSNs); the structure of OH-MSNs was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), the drug release rate was detected by high performance liquid chromatography; the cellular activity, apoptosis level, and the expression levels of intracellular apoptosis and autophagy-related factors of OH-MSNs on cholangiocarcinoma cells were observed by CCK-8, flow cytometry, colony formation assay, and Western blot; the effects of OH-MSNs on cholangioma growth were observed by mouse tumor formation, immunohistochemistry, and tissue Tunel staining. RESULTS: The release of OH-MSNs to Oxaliplatin was enhanced under acidic conditions; compared with Oxaliplatin or O-MSNs, OH-MSNs showed more potent killing effects against cholangiocarcinoma cells (P<0.05), and exerted notably inhibitory effects on the activity of cholangiocarcinoma cells (P<0.05), promoted their apoptosis (P<0.05), and greatly facilitated the expression of pro-apoptotic factors and autophagic factors in cholangiocarcinoma cells (P<0.05), and markedly inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic factors and autophagic inhibitory factors (P<0.05); moreover, OH-MSNs could significantly suppress the growth of mouse cholangiocarcinoma (P<0.05) and induce apoptosis of tumor cells compared with Oxaliplatin or O-MSNs (P<0.05).

No studies have assessed the effect of IP. We wished to determine the distribution of IP optometrists and associated hospital referral rates across Scotland. METHODS: In 2019, FOI requests (General Optical Council and NHS Education Scotland) identified all registered IP optometrists in Scotland and their registered postcodes. Data regarding community eye examinations and referrals to HES since 2010 were gathered via Information Services Division of NHS Scotland. RESULTS: As of March 2019, there were 278 IP optometrists in Scotland (278/1189; 23.4%). Two hundred eighteen IP optometrists work in 293 practices across 11 of Scotland's 14 health boards. There was a strong correlation (r = +0.96) between population density and number of IP optometrists. Fifty-six percent of IP optometrists work in the two most deprived quintiles. Since IP's introduction, there has been a marked increase in anterior segment supplementary visits (+290%). Optometry referrals to GPs have reduced by 10.5%, but referrals to HES have increased by 118% (to 96,315). There was no correlation between quantity of IP optometrists and referral rates to HES (r = -0.06, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.56, p = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of IP optometrists and associated referral rates in Scotland. Despite good geographical distribution and increased supplementary attendances, optometric referrals to HES have doubled and continue to rise.

The ideal building material should be (1) versatile and controllable in shape and stoichiometry, (2) spontaneously self-assemble, and (3) thermodynamically, chemically, and enzymatically stable with a long shelf life. RNA building blocks exhibit each of the above. RNA is a polynucleic acid, making it a polymer, and its negative-charge prevents nonspecific binding to negatively charged cell membranes. The thermostability makes it suitable for logic gates, resistive memory, sensor set-ups, and NEM devices. RNA can be designed and manipulated with a level of simplicity of DNA while displaying versatile structure and enzyme activity of proteins. RNA can fold into single-stranded loops or bulges to serve as mounting dovetails for intermolecular or domain interactions without external linking dowels. RNA nanoparticles display rubber- and amoeba-like properties and are stretchable and shrinkable through multiple repeats, leading to enhanced tumor targeting and fast renal excretion to reduce toxicities. It was predicted in 2014 that RNA would be the third milestone in pharmaceutical drug development.

OBJECTIVE The current study aimed to show the correlation of indeterminate lesions of COVID-19 pneumonia detected on computed tomography with the results of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. METHODS Patients with high-resolution computed tomography images that were reported to contain indeterminate lesions in terms of COVID-19 pneumonia were included retrospectively in the study. The lesions were categorized and the patterns were classified. The RT-PCR-positive and the RT-PCR-negative patients were compared. P<0.05 was accepted as the statistical significance limit. RESULTS The RT-PCR-positive patients had a higher rate of the peripheral lesion. Limited consolidation areas were not detected in the RT-PCR-positive patients. In the RT-PCR-negative patients, the rates of acinar nodules and the tree-in-bud pattern were significantly higher. The RT-PCR-negative patients had higher nodular contour features and lesion coalescence. In the subgroup consisting of lesions with ground-glass opacities and/or ground-glass opacity around the nodule, the rate of nodular contour positivity was significantly higher in the RT-PCR- positive patients. CONCLUSION COVID-19 pneumonia can be suspected in peripheral indeterminate lesions.

There are now growing concerns that the risks associated with restricted access to family caregivers and visitors have started to outweigh the potential benefits associated with preventing COVID-19 infections. Many residents have sustained severe and potentially irreversible physical, functional, cognitive, and mental health declines. As Canada emerges from its first wave of the pandemic, nursing homes across the country have cautiously started to reopen these settings, yet there is broad criticism that emerging visitor policies are overly restrictive, inequitable and potentially harmful. We reviewed the nursing home visitor policies for Canadas ten provinces and three territories as well as international policies and reports on the topic to develop evidence-informed, data-driven and expert-reviewed guidance for the re-opening of Canadian nursing homes to family caregivers and visitors.","output":"Finding the Right Balance: An Evidence-Informed Guidance Document to Support the Re-Opening of Canadian Nursing Homes to Family Caregivers and Visitors during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface spike glycoprotein - a major antibody target - is critical for virus entry via engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

On the other hand, structural conservation in the spike protein can be targeted to reduce escape mutations and achieve broad protection. Here, we designed candidate stable immunogens that mimic surface features of selected conserved regions of spike protein through epitope grafting, in which we present the target epitope topology on diverse heterologous scaffolds that can structurally accommodate the spike epitopes. Structural characterization of the epitope-scaffolds showed stark agreement with our computational models and target epitopes. The sera from mice immunized with engineered designs display epitope-scaffolds and spike binding activity. We also demonstrated the utility of the designed epitope-scaffolds in diagnostic applications. Taken all together, our study provides important methodology for targeting the conserved, non-RBD structural motifs of spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 epitope vaccine design and demonstrates the potential utility of epitope grafting in rational vaccine design.","output":"Adaptation-proof SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With a heightened increase in concern for an influenza pandemic we sought to better understand the 1918 Influenza pandemic, the most devastating epidemic of the previous century. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R(0) = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30C40 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results illustrate the importance of considering the population dynamics when making statements about the epidemiological parameters of Influenza.

The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan sets the rules for health care services provided by health insurance. The MHLW issued a notice in 2020 permitting telemedicine and dental telemedicine for the first visit and for follow-up visits to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection. We conducted this study to clarify the status of dental telemedicine during 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from lists obtained on the MHLW website in the analysis. We investigated the number of dental institutions conducing dental telemedicine for the first visit and for follow-up visits by prefecture. RESULTS: In each prefecture, fewer dental institutions conducted telemedicine for the first visit than for follow-up visits. Regions with large metropolitan areas had higher numbers of dental institutions conducting dental telemedicine for the first visit and follow-up visits. Private dental clinics provided the largest proportion of dental telemedicine for the first visit, and general hospitals provided the largest proportion for follow-up visits. CONCLUSION: Our study findings indicated that many dental institutions in Japan made efforts to provide dental services via dental telemedicine using the telephone or online with video to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection.

Furthermore, to verify whether the quality requirement of aPDT-treated plasma is acceptable, the differences of the levels of clotting factors, total plasma proteins, and anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies titrations in plasma of patient before and after aPDT treatment were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cur@PLGA-NPs was synthesized using Electrospinning process and characterized by different analysis including Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy assays. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the plasma samples of patients suspected of having COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Then, the treated plasma samples with Cur@PLGA-NPs plus blue laser were exposed to Vero cells. Eventually, cell cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects of treated Vero cells were evaluated.

The aims of the study were to examine the associations between all-cause mortality and PM in the pandemic period and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019). METHODS: We collected daily data regarding all-cause mortality (stratified by age and gender), and PM concentrations for 107 Italian provinces from 1 January 2015 to 31 May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods. RESULTS: Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in pandemic period.

A chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates and a rapid COVID-19 PCR was positive. She was emergently intubated and developed hemodynamic instability requiring multiple vasopressors, and her extremities were noted to be cool and clammy. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed a large irregularly shaped mobile hyperechoic density transiting the tricuspid valve as well as a dilated right ventricle. She was started on unfractionated heparin for concern of acute pulmonary embolism, though she did not undergo diagnostic imaging due to her hemodynamic instability and COVID-19 status. Bedside findings were formally confirmed by an emergent formal transthoracic echocardiogram and intravenous alteplase was administered. Her hemodynamics stabilized shortly after and she was weaned from vasopressor support. A repeat POCUS the following day showed resolution of the thrombus. Discussion: COVID-19 has altered the risk-benefit calculus of many clinical activities, impacting the availability of imaging due infection control, transport, and staffing issues. POCUS can serve as an efficient diagnostic modality in times of limited resources and/or emergent situations requiring rapid bedside diagnosis. Management of a moderate-to-high risk pulmonary embolism (PE) with anticoagulation is a widely accepted practice, and thrombolytics should be considered when hemodynamic instability is present. However, the management is less clear when a right heart thrombus (RHT) is found. The incidence of RHT ranges from 4-18%, though its identification is expected to increase with the rising popularity and training of POCUS. A RHT is considered a medical emergency given the high propensity of progression to a PE and increased mortality rate. Treatment with thrombolytics in addition to anticoagulation has shown improved outcomes in retrospective studies and meta-analyses, and is favored when compared to anticoagulation alone or surgical interventions, however there are still no definitive guidelines regarding its routine use. With new treatment modalities such as catheter-directed thrombolysis and surgical embolectomy becoming more widely available, larger studies are needed to show which treatment choice is superior. Regardless, prompt diagnosis can be achieved with POCUS and therapy can be initiated sooner which is proven to improve outcomes and was demonstrated in the case above.","output":"Right heart thrombus with high-risk pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 pneumonia, a pocus diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was conducted to clarify the potential mechanisms of Troxerutin neuroprotection against Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation through targeting the SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway.

We have studied the relationships between these two types of particles. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that they are closely related, since both large and small particles reacted equally with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for TGEV proteins. Monensin, a drug that selectively affects the Golgi complex, caused an accumulation of large annular viral particles in perinuclear elements of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. A partial reversion of the monensin blockade was obtained in both the absence and presence of cycloheximide, a drug that prevented the formation of new viral particles. After removal of monensin, the Golgi complex recovered its perinuclear location, and a decrease in the number of perinuclear large viral particles was observed. The release of small dense viral particles into secretory vesicles and the extracellular medium was also observed, as was a partial recovery of infectivity in culture supernatants. Small viral particles started to be seen between the third and the fourth Golgi cisternae of normally infected cells.

In contrast, in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, which show a moderate cytopathic effect and a low viral titer, this processing of N was not observed. To further verify these observations, we transiently expressed N in different cell lines. Caco-2 and N2a cells served as models for persistent SARS-CoV infection, whereas Vero E6 and A549 cells did as prototype cell lines lytically infected by SARS-CoV. The experiments revealed that N induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, resulting in processing of N at residues 400 and 403 by caspase-6 and/or caspase-3. Of note, caspase activation is highly cell type specific in SARS-CoV-infected as well as transiently transfected cells. In Caco-2 and N2a cells, almost no N-processing was detectable. In Vero E6 and A549 cells, a high proportion of N was cleaved by caspases. Moreover, we examined the subcellular localization of SARS-CoV N in these cell lines. In transfected Vero E6 and A549 cells, SARS-CoV N was localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas in Caco-2 and N2a cells, nearly no nuclear localization was observed. In addition, our studies indicate that the nuclear localization of N is essential for its caspase-6-mediated cleavage. These data suggest a correlation among the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, subcellular localization of N, induction of apoptosis, and the subsequent activation of caspases leading to cleavage of N.","output":"Cell Type-Specific Cleavage of Nucleocapsid Protein by Effector Caspases during SARS Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral RNAs can perturb the miRNA regulatory network, competing with host RNAs as part of their infective process.

This implies that, compared to uncuffed tracheal tubes, the cuffed tracheal tubes selected will be smaller and therefore have a shorter length. We hypothesized that cuffed tracheal tubes might be of insufficient length for selective endobronchial intubation if the tube cuff were fully immersed in the left or right mainstem bronchus. METHODS The distance from the proximal end of the tracheal tube to the upper border of the cuff in cuffed tracheal tubes and to the upper margin of the Murphy eye in uncuffed tracheal tubes, respectively, was assessed in sizes 3.0 - 7.0 mm internal diameter. The raw data sets of two previously performed studies obtained from 337 children aged from birth to 16 years, including the distances \\"teeth to tracheal tube tip\\" and \\"tracheal tube tip to carina\\", were used to calculate age-, weight- and height-related data for the distance from \\"teeth to carina\\". Tracheal tube dimensions were compared with age-related distances from \\"teeth to carina\\", applying published recommendations for the selection of uncuffed and cuffed tracheal tubes for selective endobronchial intubation in children. RESULTS The differences between the length of the age-related tracheal tube and the tracheal tube insertion length required to guarantee full insertion of the tracheal tube cuff or the Murphy eye within the mainstem bronchus ranged from -3.5 to 52.6 mm in cuffed tracheal tubes and from 42.3 to 83.3 mm in uncuffed tracheal tubes. CONCLUSIONS For many age groups of patients requiring selective endobronchial intubation, the lengths of cuffed tracheal tubes, in contrast to those of uncuffed tracheal tubes, were revealed to be critically short for safe taping outside the oral cavity with the cuff placed completely within the right or left mainstem bronchus.","output":"Simulated dimensional compatibility of uncuffed and cuffed tracheal tubes for selective endobronchial intubation in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented amount of mental and economic turmoil with ever increasing fatality and no vaccination in sight Here, feedback control theory based regulation of daily tests and quarantine is proposed to guarantee prescribed degree of exponential decay in number of infections A dynamic model of COVID-19 is constructed and the parameters are further optimized using trust region method to match the reported cases trend in the US Next, Lyapunov stability based controllers are designed that prescribe the amount of daily positive tests to be done in order to eradicate the infections in a much shorter time span without any further social restrictions The results show a dramatic reduction in the number of cases and span of COVID-19 can be obtained doubling the number of daily quarantines ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Stabilizing COVID-19 Infections in US by Feedback Control based Test and Quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused widespread infection and significant mortality across the globe Combined virology perspective of SARS-CoV-2 with a deep-rooted understanding of pathophysiological and immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is of prime importance The characteristic symptom of COVID-19 is respiratory distress with diffused alveolar damage, but emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 might also have neurologic consequences Dysregulated homeostasis in the lungs has proven to be fatal, but one cannot ignore that the inability to breathe might be due to defects in the respiratory control center of the brainstem While the mechanism of pulmonary distress has been documented in the literature, awareness of neurological features and their pathophysiology is still in the nascent state This review makes references to the neuro-immune axis and neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, as well as the prototypic H-CoV strains in human brains Simultaneously, considerable discussion on relevant experimental evidence of mild to severe neurological manifestations of fellow neurotropic murine--CoVs (m-CoVs) in the mouse model will help understand the underpinning mechanisms of Neuro-COVID In this review, we have highlighted the neuroimmunopathological processes in murine CoVs While MHV infection in mice and SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans share numerous parallels, there are critical differences in viral recognition and viral entry These similarities are highlighted in this review, while differences have also been emphasized Though CoV-2 Spike does not favorably interact with murine ACE2 receptor, modification of murine SARS-CoV2 binding domain or development of transgenic ACE-2 knock-in mice might help in mediating consequential infection and understanding human CoV2 pathogenesis in murine models While a global animal model that can replicate all aspects of the human disease remains elusive, prior insights and further experiments with fellow m--CoV-induced cause-effect experimental models and current human COVID-19 patients data may help to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-induced multifactorial multi-organ failure","output":"Murine--coronavirus-induced neuropathogenesis sheds light on CNS pathobiology of SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused large-scale, long-lasting lockdowns in many parts of the world, which resulted in many people in need for financial or other aids.

METHODS/DESIGN: The CReSt-R intervention trial is a single center, pilot randomised controlled study based at the National University of Ireland (NUI), Galway. The trial will recruit participants from four clinical sites with assessment and intervention completed by the primary NUI Galway team. The trial will explore the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a novel psychosocial intervention for early psychosis based on a combined cognitive remediation training and cognitive behavioural therapy approach focused on social recovery. Participants, aged 16C35 within the first 5 years of a diagnosed psychotic disorder, will be recruited from the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service and the Adult Mental Health Services in the region. DISCUSSION: Cognitive remediation training (for improving cognition) and social recovery focused cognitive behavioural therapy, have both separately demonstrated effectiveness.

A 46-year-old gentleman presented to us with complaints of intermittent fever for the past 2 weeks associated with fatigue along with oral ulcers and skin rashes which resolved spontaneously. These symptoms started after he received the second dose of the BBIP-CorV COVID-19 vaccine. His complete blood picture showed pancytopenia. A detailed infectious disease workup was unrevealing; however, his bone marrow biopsy revealed increased histiocyte activity, with some showing hemophagocytosis and dysplasia. Immunohistochemistry profile demonstrated strong CD 68 positivity. Further investigations showed raised serum ferritin and fasting triglyceride levels. He was immediately started on dexamethasone acetate at a dose of 10 mg/m(2), after which his clinical symptoms, as well as his blood parameters, improved remarkably. This is the first documented case in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: The data from clinical trials support the general safety profile of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. We endorse its mass implementation. However, we believe that robust data need to be generated to evidence any adverse events, especially those with serious outcomes. Physicians should be aware of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine as a possible trigger for HLH and start prompt treatment, resulting in favorable outcomes. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: The presentation of HLH may vary and can present in an immunocompetent patient with no underlying risk factor. HLH should be kept in differentials when a patient presents with pancytopenia with a recent history of receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Steroids play a major role in the treatment of HLH, and definitive diagnosis and early treatment improve clinical outcomes.","output":"Inactivated COVID-19 vaccine triggering hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in an immunocompetent adult - A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 continues to teach the global community important lessons about preparedness for research and effective action to respond to emerging health threats.

We describe the network and its members and activities, and the work-related opportunities and challenges we faced over a one-year period during the pandemic. We highlight the value of having strong and long-term empirical ethics networks embedded across diverse research institutions to be able to: 1) identify and share relevant ethics challenges and research questions and ways of doing research;2) work with key stakeholders to identify appropriate ways to contribute to the emerging health issue response C e.g. through ethics oversight, community engagement, and advisory roles at different levels;and 3) learn from each other and from diverse contexts to advocate for positive change at multiple levels. It is our view that being both embedded and long term offers particular opportunities in terms of deep institutional and contextual knowledge and relationships with and access to a wide range of stakeholders in place. Being networked offers opportunities to draw upon a wide range of expertise and perspectives operating at multiple levels, and to bring together internal and external perspectives (i.e. different positionalities). Long term funding means that the people and resources are in place and ready to respond in a timely way.

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of emergency imaging volumes from January 5 to May 30, 2020. Weekly volume data were collected for total imaging studies, abdominopelvic CT, and abdominopelvic CTs positive for common causes of acute nontraumatic abdominal pain. Two emergency radiology attendings scored all diverticulitis cases independently, and weekly volume data for uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis cases was also collected. Volume data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared, using 2019 volumes as a control. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, overall emergency imaging volume decreased 30% compared to 2019 (p = 0.002). While the number of emergency abdominopelvic CTs positive for appendicitis and small bowel obstruction did not significantly change during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of diverticulitis decreased significantly compared to 2019 (p = 0.001). This reduction can be specifically attributed to decreased uncomplicated diverticulitis cases, as the number of uncomplicated diverticulitis cases dropped significantly (p = 0.002) while there was no significant difference in the number of complicated diverticulitis cases (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced emergency abdominopelvic CT volume during the COVID-19 pandemic can partially be explained by decreased imaging of lower acuity patients.

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, questionnaires including the QMCOO were distributed to 1,953 older adults, and responses were returned by mail. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) for the QMCOO among older participants (age 75 years) and extracted the relevant factors. Next, we structured the model for the QMCOO based on these factors and conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using structural equation modeling. We conducted a CFA among young-older participants (age 65 to <75 years) for the same model. RESULTS Of the 1,110 (53.5%) adults who responded, data from the 994 respondents who provided complete answers were analyzed. Five factors were extracted from the results of the EFA: physical and mental condition, relationship with society, eating and smoking, chance for exercise, and cognitive function. The results of the CFA were as follows: comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.899, adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) = 0.965, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.034, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.040.

The programme creates the environments that maximise functional ability to enable people to be and do what they value and to stay at home in best possible conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Five levers are targeted: tackling loneliness, restoring feeling of usefulness, finding solutions to face material daily life difficulties, promoting social participation and combating digital divide. Concretely, the SoBeezy programme relies on: (1) a digital intelligent platform available on smartphone, tablet and computer, but also on a voice assistant specifically developed for people with digital divide; (2) a large solidarity network which potentially relies on everyones engagement through a participatory intergenerational approach, where the older persons themselves are not only service receivers but also potential contributors; (3) an engagement of local partners and stakeholders (citizens, associations, artisans and professionals). Organised as a hub, the system connects all the resources of a territory and provides to the older person the best solution to meet his demand. Through a mixed, qualitative and quantitative (before/after analyses and compared to controls) approach, the research programme will assess the impact and effectiveness on healthy ageing, the technical usage, the mechanisms of the intervention and conditions of transferability and scalability.

Few large-scale studies have examined public opinion on sharing, including of mental health (MH) versus physical health (PH) data. We measured data sharing preferences. DESIGN/SETTING/INTERVENTIONS/OUTCOMES: Pre-registered anonymous online survey, measuring expressed preferences, recruiting February to September 2020. Participants were randomised to one of three framing statements regarding MH versus PH data. PARTICIPANTS: Open to all UK residents. Participants numbered 29 275; 40% had experienced an MH condition. RESULTS: Most (76%) supported identifiable data sharing for direct clinical care without explicit consent, but 20% opposed this. Preference for clinical/identifiable sharing decreased with geographical distance and was slightly less for MH than PH data, with small framing effects. Preference for research/de-identified data sharing without explicit consent showed the same small PH/MH and framing effects, plus greater preference for sharing structured data than de-identified free text. There was net support for research sharing to the NHS, academic institutions, and national research charities, net ambivalence about sharing to profit-making companies researching treatments, and net opposition to sharing to other companies (similar to sharing publicly). De-identified linkage to non-health data was generally supported, except to data held by private companies. We report demographic influences on preference.

The reason is thought to be that the timing of the surgery was quite late after the infections, and the surgery was performed using appropriate PPE and surgical procedure. The indications for and timing of tracheostomy for severe COVID-19 patients should be decided through multidisciplinary discussion.","output":"Management of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients: The Japanese experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hspb8 is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family. Its expression is known to be upregulated under heat shock. This protein interacts with different partners and can, therefore, be involved in various processes relevant to tissue integrity and functioning. In humans, mutations in the gene encoding Hspb8 can lead to the development of various diseases such as myopathies and neuropathies. In our study, we aimed to perform an in-depth characterization of zebrafish Hspb8 during zebrafish development. We applied techniques such as RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, LC-MS, and morpholino-mediated knockdown. We broadened the knowledge regarding zebrafish hspb8 expression during development under normal and heat shock conditions as well as its tissue- and subcellular-specific localization. A co-IP analysis allowed us to conclude that zebrafish Hspb8 can interact with proteins such as Bag3 and Hsc70, which are crucial for formation of an autophagy-inducing complex. We also demonstrated that hspb8 morpholino-mediated knockdown has an impact on zebrafish embryos' morphology, muscle ultrastructure, and motility behavior. Our research provides a valuable resource for the potential use of the zebrafish as a model for studying pathological conditions associated with hspb8 disorders.","output":"Characterization of Hspb8 in Zebrafish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans. Such mutations can occur in the spike (S) protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor and is cleaved by TMPRSS2. However, whether S mutations affect SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remains unknown. Here, we show that naturally occurring S mutations can reduce or enhance cell entry via ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus exhibits substantially lower entry than that of SARS-CoV S. Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural and binding analyses. Nevertheless, the D614G mutation does not affect neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses. Taken together, we conclude that the D614G mutation increases cell entry by acquiring higher affinity to ACE2 while maintaining neutralization susceptibility. Based on these findings, further worldwide surveillance is required to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility among humans.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 D614G spike mutation increases entry efficiency with enhanced ACE2-binding affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Home care for elderly people is an important part of the social welfare system.

In this study, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 33,940 individuals with BTI and several controls of people without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including contemporary (n = 4,983,491), historical (n = 5,785,273) and vaccinated (n = 2,566,369) controls.

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 suspected cases and to evaluate the performance of the triage process in predicting COVID-19 in Southern Tunisia. METHODS: It was a prospective study including all patients consulting to the Hedi Chaker University Hospital departments from March to June 2020. A clinical triage score (CTS) was used to assess the risk of the infection and to refer patients to the appropriate part of the facility accordingly. RESULTS: Overall, 862 patients were enrolled, among whom 505 patients (58.6%) were classified as suspected cases (CTS 4). Of these, 46.9% (n = 237) were of mild form. Samples were collected from 215 patients (24.9%), among whom five were COVID-19 positive, representing a positive rate of 2.3%. The in-hospital cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 was 580/100000 patients. The total daily incidence decreased significantly during the study period (p < 0.001, chi-square for linear trend = 25.6). At a cut-off of four, the CTS had a sensitivity of 40%, a specificity of 32.4%, and negative and positive predictive values of 95.8% and 1.4%, respectively. DISCUSSION: Although the triage process based on the CTS was not as performant as the RT-PCR, it was crucial to interrupt virus spread among hospitalized patients in COVID-19-free departments.","output":"Epidemiological profile and performance of triage decision-making process of COVID-19 suspected cases in southern Tunisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines two stock market anomalies and provides strong evidence of the day-of-the-week effect in the Chinese A-share market during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The QMJ factor is similar to the division of speculative and non-speculative stocks described by Birru (2018). Our findings provide evidence that the QMJ strategy gains negative returns on Fridays for both anomalies because the junk side is sensitive to an elevated mood and, thus, performs better than the quality side of portfolios on Friday. Our findings are also consistent with the theory of investor sentiment which asserts that investors are more optimistic when their mood is elevated, and generally individual mood is better on Friday than on other days of the week. Therefore, the speculative stocks earned higher sustainable stock returns during higher volatility in Chinese market due to COVID-19.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative, cross-comparative case study evaluation at two sites in England and one in Wales, consisting of interviews with stakeholders at the sites, alongside observations of strategic meetings and analysis of key documents. RESULTS: We interviewed 52 stakeholders across the three sites in the second half of 2019 and observed four meetings from late 2019 to early 2020 (further observation was prevented by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic). The single most important driver of vertical integration was found to be to maintain primary care local to where patients live and thereby manage demand pressure on acute hospital services, especially emergency care. The opportunities created by maintaining local primary care providersto develop patient services in primary care settings and better integrate them with secondary carewere exploited to differing degrees across the sites. There were notable differences between sites in operational and management arrangements, and in organisational and clinical integration. Closer organisational integration was attributed to previous good relationships between primary and secondary care locally, and to historical planning and preparation towards integrated working across the local health economy. The net impact of vertical integration on health system costs is argued by local stakeholders to be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Vertical integration is a valuable option when primary care practices are at risk of closing, and may be a route to better integration of patient care.

Treatment outcomes were reported for the following biologics: secukinumab (n = 105), brodalumab (n = 22), and ixekizumab (n = 1). Patients were classified as responders or non-responders according to achievement of a positive response/improvement based on criteria established for each included study. For secukinumab 57.1% (n = 60/105) of patients were responders in a mean response period of 16.2 weeks and 42.9% (n = 45/105) were non-responders; for brodalumab, 100.0% (n = 22/22) of patients were responders within 4.4 weeks; and the one patient treated with ixekizumab was a responder within 10 weeks. In conclusion, IL-17 inhibitors may serve as an effective therapeutic target in approximately two-thirds of patients with HS and can be considered in those who are refractory to other treatment modalities.

Although no established risk factors for self-harm exist, adolescents who self-harm may have decreased pain sensitivity, but this has not been systematically investigated. OBJECTIVE: To assess somatosensory function using quantitative sensory testing (QST) in children and adolescents living in care grouped by the number of episodes of self-harm in the past year and compare their somatosensory profiles with community control participants to investigate associations with the incidence or frequency of self-harm. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Recruitment for this cross-sectional study began January 2019 and ended March 2020. Exclusion criteria included intellectual disability (intelligence quotient <70), autism spectrum disorder, or recent serious injury. Children and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with no underlying health conditions were recruited from local authority residential care settings in Glasgow, UK, and schools and youth groups in London and Glasgow, UK. The volunteer sample of 64 participants included adolescents ages 13 to 17 years (34 [53%] females; 50 [78%] living in residential care; mean [SD] age, 16.34 [1.01] years) with varying incidents of self-harm in the past year (no episodes, 31 [48%]; 1-4 episodes, 12 [19%]; and 5 episodes, 2 [33%]). EXPOSURES: Participants were tested using a standardized QST protocol to establish baseline somatosensory function. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Associations between somatosensory sensitivity, incidence and frequency of self-harm, residential status, age, gender, and prescription medication were calculated. Secondary outcomes assessed whether self-harm was associated with specific types of tests (ie, painful or nonpainful). RESULTS: A total of 64 participants ages 13 to 17 years completed testing (mean [SD] age, 16.3 [1.0] years; 34 [53%.] females and 30 [47%] males; 50 [78%] living in group homes). Adolescents with 5 or more self-harm incidences showed significant pain hyposensitivity compared with community control participants after adjusting for age, gender, and prescription drug use (SH group with 5 or more episodes vs control: ?1.03 [95% CI, ?1.47 to ?0.60]; P < .001). Hyposensitivity also extended to nonpainful stimuli, similarly adjusted (SH group with 5 or more episodes vs control: ?1.73; 95% CI, ?2.62 to ?0.84; P < .001). Pressure pain threshold accounted for most of the observed variance (31.1% [95% CI, 10.5% to 44.7%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that sensory hyposensitivity is a phenotype of Adolescents who self-harm and that pressure pain threshold has clinical potential as a quick, inexpensive, and easily interpreted test to identify adolescents at increased risk of repeated self-harm.","output":"Assessment of Somatosensory Function and Self-harm in Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lombardy was the epicenter in Italy of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. To face the contagion growth, from March 8 to May 8 2020, a regional law re-designed the hub-and-spoke system for time-dependent diseases to better allocate resources for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We report the reorganization of the major hospital in Lombardy during COVID-19 pandemic, including the rearrangement of its ICU beds to face COVID-19 pandemic and fulfill its role as extended hub for time-dependent diseases while preserving transplant activity. To highlight the impact of the emergently planned hub-and-spoke system, all patients admitted to a COVID-19-free ICU hub for trauma, neurosurgical emergencies and stroke during the two-month period were retrospectively collected and compared to 2019 cohort. Regional data on organ procurement was retrieved. Observed-to-expected (OE) in-ICU mortality ratios were computed to test the impact of the pandemic on patients affected by time-dependent diseases. RESULTS: Dynamic changes in ICU resource allocation occurred according to local COVID-19 epidemiology/trends of patients referred for time-dependent diseases. The absolute increase of admissions for trauma, neurosurgical emergencies and stroke was roughly two-fold. Patients referred to the hub were older and characterized by more severe conditions. An increase in crude mortality was observed, though OE ratios for in-ICU mortality were not statistically different when comparing 2020 vs. 2019. An increase in local organ procurement was observed, limiting the debacle of regional transplant activity.

Adequate sedation, most commonly being achieved with remifentanil and dexmedetomidine, is integral to this procedure. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of these 2 sedatives. METHODS: We conducted electronic searches in Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, Springer, and Web of Science with no language restrictions. Studies comparing safety and efficacy between the sole use of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine among patients who underwent AFOI were included. Eight randomized controlled trials, comprising 412 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were first attempt intubation success rate and incidence of hypoxia. The secondary outcomes were the Ramsay Sedation Scale score at intubation, memory recall of endoscopy, and unstable hemodynamic parameters during intubation. RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the incidence of hypoxemia during AFOI (risk ratio: 2.47; 95% confidence [CI]: 1.32C4.64]) compared with remifentanil; however, the first intubation success rates were equivalent (risk ratio: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.87C1.46]. No significant differences between the 2 sedatives were found for the Ramsay Sedation Scale score at intubation (mean difference: ?0.14; 95% CI: ?0.66C0.38) or unstable hemodynamic parameters during intubation (risk ratio: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.59C1.17). Dexmedetomidine reduced memory recall of endoscopy (risk ratio: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.13C1.72). CONCLUSIONS: While both remifentanil and dexmedetomidine are effective for AFOI and well-tolerated, dexmedetomidine may be more effective in reducing the incidence of hypoxemia and memory recall of endoscopy.

Poor communication while wearing respirators may have fatal complications for patients, and no solution has been proposed to date. Objective: To examine whether use of an in-ear communication device is associated with improved communication while wearing different personal protective equipment (N95 mask, half-face elastomeric respirator, and powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) in the operating room. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study was conducted in June 2020. Surgical residents from the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, were recruited. All participants had normal hearing, were fluent in English, and had access to the operating rooms at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Exposures: All participants performed the speech intelligibility tasks with and without an in-ear communication device. Main Outcomes and Measures: Speech intelligibility was measured using a word recognition task (Modified Rhyme Test) and a sentence recognition task (AzBio Sentence Test). A percentage correct score (0% to 100%) was obtained for each speech intelligibility test. Listening effort was assessed using the NASA Task Load Index. An overall workload score, ranging from 0 points (low workload) to 100 points (high workload), was obtained. Results: A total of 12 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [1.9] years; 8 women [66.7%]). AzBio Sentence Test results revealed that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) speech intelligibility was 98.8% (1.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.3% (7.4%) with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean speech intelligibility was 58.5% (12.4%) without the in-ear device vs 90.8% (8.9%) with the device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean speech intelligibility was 84.6% (9.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.5% (5.5%) with the device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (32.3%; 95% CI, 23.8%-40.7%; P < .001) and the PAPR (9.9%; 95% CI, 1.4%-18.3%; P = .01). Furthermore, use of the device was associated with decreased listening effort. The NASA Task Load Index results reveal that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) overall workload score was 12.6 (10.6) points without the in-ear device vs 17.6 (9.2) points with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean overall workload score was 67.7 (21.6) points without the in-ear device vs 29.3 (14.4) points with the in-ear device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean overall workload score was 42.2 (18.2) points without the in-ear device vs 23.8 (12.8) points with the in-ear device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant decrease in overall workload score while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (38.4; 95% CI, 23.5-53.3; P < .001) and the PAPR (18.4; 95% CI, 0.4-36.4; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that among participants using facial respirators that impaired communication, a novel in-ear device was associated with improved communication and decreased listening effort. Such a device may be a feasible solution for protecting health care workers in the operating room while allowing them to communicate safely, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Association of In-Ear Device Use With Communication Quality Among Individuals Wearing Personal Protective Equipment in a Simulated Operating Room"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The propagations of diseases, behaviors and information in real systems are rarely independent of each other, but they are coevolving with strong interactions. To uncover the dynamical mechanisms, the evolving spatiotemporal patterns and critical phenomena of networked coevolution spreading are extremely important, which provide theoretical foundations for us to control epidemic spreading, predict collective behaviors in social systems, and so on. The coevolution spreading dynamics in complex networks has thus attracted much attention in many disciplines. In this review, we introduce recent progress in the study of coevolution spreading dynamics, emphasizing the contributions from the perspectives of statistical mechanics and network science. The theoretical methods, critical phenomena, phase transitions, interacting mechanisms, and effects of network topology for four representative types of coevolution spreading mechanisms, including the coevolution of biological contagions, social contagions, epidemicCawareness, and epidemicCresources, are presented in detail, and the challenges in this field as well as open issues for future studies are also discussed.","output":"Coevolution spreading in complex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been wide heterogeneity in the medical management of transplant recipients.

METHODS: We performed a computerised bibliographic search of studies indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed, arXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv between 1 January 2016 and 31 July 2021. Two reviewers performed the title/abstract and full-text screening. The remaining papers were screened by four reviewers using the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) for DL studies and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) for TML studies. Papers that fulfilled the pre-defined screening requirements underwent full CLAIM/RQS evaluation alongside the risk of bias assessment using QUADAS-2, both conducted by the same four reviewers. Standard measures of discrimination were extracted for the developed predictive models. RESULTS: 17/28 papers (five DL and twelve TML) passed the quality screening and were subject to a full CLAIM/RQS/QUADAS-2 assessment, which revealed a substantial study heterogeneity that precluded us from performing quantitative analysis as part of this review.

Given the im-portance of performing routine endoscopic procedures to an individuals future health, we sought to estimate the risk of COVID-19 infection for healthcare staff and patients undergoing endoscopic studies at an ambulatory endoscopy center during the pandemic. Material and Methods. This is a prospective(and) analytical cohort study conducted in an ambulatory gastroenterology center located in the Au-tonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Patients undergoing different endoscopic procedures were evaluated for COVID-19 between April 14 and August 31, 2020. COVID-19 was also evaluated in all healthcare and associated staff during the same time period. The risk (cumu-lative incidence) of acquiring COVID-19 in all patients and staff was calculated. Results. Between April 14 and August 31, 2020, procedures were performed in 3,745 patients with a mean age of 51.12 years;2,102 (56.18%) were male and 1,643 (43.82%) were female. Follow-up was completed in 3,492 patients, 18 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 standing for an incidence of 0.52% (95%CI 0.31 C 0.81%). Six (5.45%) out of 110 staff members were infected with COVID-19 (1 endoscopist, 4 endoscopy assistants and 1 administrative staff member). In this group, the incidence of positive tests for COVID-19 was 5.45% (95%CI: 2.03 C 11.50%). The increased rates of positive cases among our patients and healthcare professionals were respectively 7.9 and 23.6 times lower than in general pop-ulation. Conclusion. During the study period, the propor-tion of COVID-19 infections in our ambulatory specialized in gastrointestinal endoscopy was low and much lower than that in the general population for both patients and health-care professionals.

The German government implemented a shutdown in Mar 2020, affecting outpatient and hospital care. The aim of the present article was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on patient volumes and surgical procedures of a Level I trauma center in Germany. METHODS: All emergency patients were recorded retrospectively during the shutdown and compared to a calendar-matched control period (CTRL). Total emergency patient contacts including trauma mechanisms, injury patterns and operation numbers were recorded including absolute numbers, incidence proportions and risk ratios. RESULTS: During the shutdown period, we observed a decrease of emergency patient cases (417) compared to CTRL (575), a decrease of elective cases (42 vs. 13) and of the total number of operations (397 vs. 325). Incidence proportions of emergency operations increased from 8.2 to 12.2% (shutdown) and elective surgical cases decreased (11.1 vs. 4.3%). As we observed a decrease for most trauma mechanisms and injury patterns, we found an increasing incidence proportion for severe open fractures. Household-related injuries were reported with an increasing incidence proportion from 26.8 to 47.5% (shutdown). We found an increasing tendency of trauma and injuries related to psychological disorders. CONCLUSION: This analysis shows a decrease of total patient numbers in an emergency department of a Level I trauma center and a decrease of the total number of operations during the shutdown period. Concurrently, we observed an increase of severe open fractures and emergency operations.

However, the actual number of infections is likely to be under-ascertained due to the epidemiological characteristics such as mild and subclinical infections and limited testing availability in the early days of the pandemic. In this study, we infer the true number of infections in Japan between January 16, 2020, and December 31, 2021, using a statistical modelling framework that combines data on reported cases and fatalities. MethodsWe used reported daily COVID-19 deaths stratified into 8 distinct age-groups and age-specific infection fatality ratios (IFR) to impute the true number of infections. Estimates of IFR were informed from published studies as well seroprevalence studies conducted in Japan. To account for the uncertainty in IFR estimates, we sampled values from relevant distributions. ResultsWe estimated that as of December 31, 2021, 2.90 million (CrI: 1.77 to 4.27 million) people had been infected in Japan, which is 1.68 times higher than the 1.73 million reported cases. Our meta-analysis confirmed that these findings were consistent with the intermittent seroprevalence studies conducted in Japan. ConclusionsWe have estimated that a substantial number of COVID-19 infections in the country were unreported, particularly in adults.

Households are divided into predominantly beer, wine or spirits purchasers. RESULTS Over 5 years, there were decreases in purchases of grams of alcohol within beer amongst beer-purchasing households and increases in purchases of grams of alcohol within wine and spirits amongst, respectively, wine- and spirits-purchasing households. Almost all the changes were due to beer-purchasing households buying less regular strength beer, and wine and spirits-purchasing households buying, respectively, more regular strength wine and spirits, rather than increases in purchases of no- and low-alcohol products.

Methods From January 2007 to February 2015 200 patients underwent 207 endovascular procedures for carotid artery stenosis. Of all, 113 arteries (56.5%) were symptomatic. Significant changes across time were calculated with the use of Change Point analysis using bootstrap and mean squared error estimates. Results The technical success was 98.6% (204/207 cases). Thirty-day neurological events included stroke in four patients (2%) and transient ischemic attack in two (1%). None of the patients died during the first 30 days. The most significant change of radiation duration occurred after the 33rd patient with a decrease from 25.31 min to 12.31 min, while for the total operative time that change occurred between the 31st and 33rd patient where mean operation time decreased from 88.89 min to 49.22 min. The most significant change of contrast media used occurred at the 40th patient with a decrease from 91.58 ml to 62 ml. During a mean follow-up period of 42  20.02 months none of the patients experienced any cerebrovascular event. There was one case of significant recurrent stenosis, which was successfully treated by endovascular means. Conclusions Endovascular treatment of carotid artery stenosis performed in a single center with the use of a cerebral protection device seems to consist a safe therapeutic choice with acceptable results, within the referenced benchmarks proposed in the latest guidelines. Certain perioperative parameters such as the amount of contrast media used, the fluoroscopy and operation time, seem to decline overtime indicating increasing operator's experience.

Dominant among the negative impacts are a decline in health-seeking behaviours, low programme implementation, increased cost and wastages resulting from PPE, transition to virtual meetings, a decline in capacity building and staff burnout/pressure. However, some positive impacts include increased efficiency through the use of virtual innovations, peer-to-peer intervention through the establishment of networks, flexibility and prompt adaptation to the crisis, prudent management of available resources, etc. This research contributes to theory and practice. Research limitations/implications Conducting this research and recruiting participants at the height of COVID-19 in Nigeria, in adherence to the prevention guidelines, constituted a considerable limitation to the study. Practical implications Although the identified impact could be useful in framing operational policies and guidelines, the study highlights a salient future outlook with policy implications for both the governance of NGOs and the facilitation of sustainable development goals by the government. Originality/value Although researchers continue to explore the impact of COVID-19, none has considered the NGO sector, especially in developing countries, and with a focus on providing evidence-backed resilience practices for the future.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the operations and management of NGOs: resilience and recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I have been researching coronaviruses for more than forty years.

Sunlight is known to be the natural energy source that degrades plastic waste at a very slow rate. Mimicking the role of sunlight, the photocatalytic degradation process could significantly accelerate the degradation rate thanks to the photocatalyst that drastically facilitates the photochemical reactions involved in the degradation process. This mini review begins with an introduction to the chemical compositions of the common plastic waste. The mechanisms of photodegradation of polymers in general were then revisited. Afterwards, a few photocatalysts were introduced with an emphasis on titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), which is the most frequently used photocatalyst. The roles of TiO(2) photocatalyst in the photodegradation process were then elaborated, followed by the recent advances of photocatalytic degradation of various plastic waste. Lastly, our perspectives on the future research directions of photocatalytic plastic degradation are present. Herein, the importance of catalytic photodegradation is emphasized to inspire research on developing new photocatalysts and new processes for decomposition of plastic waste, and then to increase its recycling rate particularly in the current pandemic with the ever-increasing generation of plastic waste.","output":"Photocatalytic Degradation of Plastic Waste: A Mini Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present update is a reassessment of the 2018 'Guidelines for HPV-DNA Testing for Cervical Cancer Screening in Brazil' (Zeferino et al.)9, according to the changes observed in new international guidelines and knowledge updates.

The most common symptoms of a disease are fever, cough, generalized body ache, weakness, dyspnoea, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Among vascular complications of COVID-19, the venous thrombotic complications, like pulmonary embolism and lower limb deep veins thrombosis, are not uncommon. But data about arterial thrombotic complications of COVID-19, especially carotid thrombosis, are still limited. We are describing a case of stroke due to thrombosis of the right carotid arteries, in a patient who had recovered from asymptomatic COVID-19. A 66-year-old male with arterial hypertension presented to the emergency department with a history of repeated collapse, dysarthria, weakness in the left extremities, and a drop in the left angle of his mouth (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]-4). The patient was swabbed for COVID-19 which was negative. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was obtained which showed thrombosis in the branching point of the brachiocephalic trunk (BCT) continuing into the right subclavian artery (SA) and also into the right common carotid artery (CCA), with a subtotal occlusion of the right CCA, extending into the internal carotid artery (ICA) as well. From the apical lung tissue caught during the CT scan, bilateral, irregular widespread ground-glass opacifications, as well as consolidations and small reticular changes were seen in the lungs, which is typical for COVID-19 infection. A quantitative antibody test for COVID-19 infection was performed with the results showing a strong positivity for IgG antibodies, indicating previous COVID-19 infection. The patient was indicated for a standard carotid thrombectomy, which was performed without complications. It seems that one of the important factors that led to the formation of the thrombus in the carotid arteries was COVID-19 infection-induced inflammation in the atherosclerotic carotid vessels and generalized hypercoagulability as well as hyperviscosity. COVID-19 infection is an independent and important risk factor for the formation of an arterial thrombus during the acute illness and in the early post-COVID-19 period also, regardless of the severity of its course.

Successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewaters has been reported in several countries. This study investigated the presence and persistence of viral RNA in treated and untreated wastewaters in Padua, Italy. An urban experimental network of sampling sites was tested for prospective surveillance activities. Methods Seven sampling sites (i.e. wastewater pumping stations, plant inlets and outlets) were selected from the two main municipal wastewater treatment plant systems. Eleven grab samples (9 untreated, 2 treated wastewaters) were collected on 2 dates. All samples were tested at t0 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and t1 = 24 h to investigate its persistence, at room temperature and under refrigerated conditions. Overall, 33 sub-samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration and tested for molecular detection of viral RNA with two RT-qPCR assays. Results At t0, positivity for at least one RT-qPCR assay was achieved by 4/9 untreated wastewater samples and 2/2 tertiary treated samples. A minimum SARS-CoV-2 titer of 4.8C4.9 log10 gc/L was estimated. At t1, three refrigerated subsamples were positive as well. The two RT-qPCR assays showed differential sensitivity, with the N assay detecting 90% of successful amplifications. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in untreated and treated wastewaters. Its persistence after 24 h was demonstrated in subsamples kept at 4 C. Hospitalization data suggested an approximate WBE detection power of 1 COVID-19 case per 531 inhabitants. The possible role of WBE in COVID-19 environmental surveillance is strongly supported by our findings. WBE can also provide precious support in the decision-making process of restriction policies during the epidemic remission phase.

One acute hospital (W) among three in a Scottish healthboard experienced an unexpected surge of COVID-19 clusters. AIM: To investigate possible causes of COVID-19 clusters at Hospital W. METHODS: Daily surveillance provided total numbers of patients and staff involved in clusters in three acute hospitals (H, M and W) and care homes across the healthboard. All clusters were investigated and documented, along with patient boarding, community infection rates and outdoor temperatures from October 2020 to March 2021. Selected SARS-CoV-2 strains were genotyped. FINDINGS: There were 19 COVID-19 clusters on 14 wards at Hospital W during the six-month study period, lasting from 2-42 days (average: 5 days, median: 14 days) and involving an average of 9 patients (range 1-24) and 7 staff (range 0-17). COVID-19 clusters in Hospitals H and M reflected community infection rates. An outbreak management team implemented a control package including daily surveillance; ward closures; universal masking; screening; restricting staff and patient movement; enhanced cleaning; and improved ventilation. Forty clusters occurred across all three hospitals before a January window opening policy, after which there were three during the remainder of the study. CONCLUSION: The winter surge of COVID-19 clusters was multifactorial, but clearly exacerbated by moving trauma patients around the hospital.

The dynamics of recruitment and retention of memory B cells to tissues and their immunological purpose remains unclear. Here, we characterized tissue-resident memory B cells (BRM) that are stably maintained in the lungs of mice after pulmonary influenza infection. Influenza-specific BRM were localized within inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (iBALTs) and displayed transcriptional signatures distinct from classical memory B cells in the blood or spleen while showing partial overlap with memory B cells in lung-draining lymph nodes. We identified lung-resident markers, including elevated expression of CXCR3, CCR6, and CD69, on hemagglutinin (HA)- and nucleoprotein (NP)-specific lung BRM. We found that CCR6 facilitates increased recruitment and/or retention of BRM in lungs and differentiation into antibody-secreting cells upon recall. Although expression of CXCR3 and CCR6 was comparable in total and influenza-specific memory B cells isolated across tissues of human donors, CD69 expression was higher in memory B cells from lung and draining lymph nodes of human organ donors relative to splenic and PBMC-derived populations, indicating that mechanisms underpinning BRM localization may be evolutionarily conserved. Last, we demonstrate that human memory B cells in lungs are transcriptionally distinct to populations in lung-draining lymph nodes or PBMCs.

There are now consensus clinical guidelines that have described the presentation and diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This report aims to describe a case of MIS-C in an 11-year-old Saudi Arabian girl who presented with coronary artery aneurysm and cardiac involvement. CASE REPORT: We describe an 11-year-old Saudi girl who was asymptomatic for 3 weeks after contracting SARS-CoV-2. Three weeks after suffering a mild flulike illness, she developed a high fever, cough, and severe clinical deterioration within 12 h of admission, including shock, rash, pleural effusion, high inflammatory markers, and a coronary aneurysm. As per current practice, the diagnosis was confirmed as multisystem inflammatory syndrome based on a SARS-CoV-2 test with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 2 nasopharyngeal aspirates.

Despite this, crops were sown and harvested, food was produced and agriculture continued to function, albeit it with many logistical challenges. Plant health lies at the heart of preventing crop losses through a combination of varietal resistance and agronomic practices. In the case of foliar plant diseases in wheat, varietal resistance plays a key role, but the use of synthetic fungicides is essential to minimize crop losses. European arable production faces a dilemma: how to contribute and maintain global food supplies but at the same time decrease emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), reduce inputs potentially harmful to biodiversity, society and the environment while ensuring no more land is brought into production. Throughout history, major disruptions in society have led to big steps in agricultural innovation. Presently, the major disruptive forces in Europe are not just a result of the COVID pandemic but the increasingly urgent need to address climate change. Within the European Green Deal, the Farm\\\\to\\\\Fork strategy is in place to help achieve climate neutrality by 2050, aiming for a reduction of GHG emissions of 55% by 2030. To achieve this, there will need to be a major adjustment to how food is produced, a realignment in plant health strategies and accelerated innovation across the agricultural sector. This paper aims to evaluate how synthetic fungicides presently contribute to plant health (mainly wheat) and food production as well as the management of GHG emissions. In addition, it explores the future challenges and prospects for their positive contribution in achieving global food security alongside emerging innovative technologies.

Reflecting on the first 6 months of the pandemic responses in terms of refugee protection, the two countries have taken diverging pathways. South Africa used the pandemic to start building a border fence on the border with Zimbabwe, initially curtailed all foreign shop owners from opening under lockdown and excluded asylum seekers from emergency relief grants. In contrast, Uganda opened its borders to refugees from the DRC in June, when border closures were still the global norm. Whilst both responses are not unusual in light of their standard governance approaches, they highlight the own self-image the countries espouse C with Uganda positioning itself as the worlds premier refugee protector at a time when it is desperately in need of more funds and South Africa looking to politically capitalize internally from reiterating a division between migrant communities as a threat to poor and disenfranchised South Africans. Even during a pandemic, the practice of refugee protection does not happen in a political vacuum. This paper is based on over 50 in-person and digital interviews conducted in Uganda and South Africa in 2020, as well as nine focus groups with refugee and host communities.","output":"Who is watching?

Our study evaluated the effect of direct antiviral agents (DAAs) on OLP and hyposalivation in convicts with chronic hepatitis C, examining patients before, during and after the antiviral treatment period with direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs). METHODS: We screened 198 inmates for the presence of the HCV antibody. Patients found to be positive underwent a quantitative HCV-RNA test and HCV genotype typing, as well as an oral cavity examination using a scoring system for OLP (REU score) and the clinical oral dryness score (CODS). Subsequently, all patients underwent DAA therapy and a systematic physical examination of the oral cavity at 1, 3 and 6 months from the beginning of treatment. RESULTS: Fifty patients (25.25%) had a positive HCV-RNA test. At baseline, OLP was detected in 4 patients (8%), with a mean REU score of 10.134, and different degrees of hyposalivation were seen in 17 patients (34%), with a mean CODS score of 4.711.72. Six months after the start of DAA therapy, we observed resolution of OLP in 3 patients (75%) and improvement in the remaining subject with a significantly lower mean REU score (24). Hyposalivation disappeared in 5 patients, improved in 10, and remained unchanged in 2 patients with a significantly lower mean CODS score (0.060.24).

The addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions, which prevent severe disease and reduce hospitalizations, to the repertoire of COVID-19 countermeasures offers the opportunity to reduce system stress but requires strategic planning and use of novel approaches. Our objective was to develop a web-based decision-support tool to help existing and future mAb infusion facilities make better and more informed staffing and capacity decisions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using real-world observations from three medical centers operating with federal field team support, we developed a discrete-event simulation model and performed simulation experiments to assess performance of mAb infusion sites under different conditions. RESULTS: 162,000 scenarios were evaluated by simulations. Our analyses revealed that it was more effective to add check-in staff than to add additional nurses for middle-to-large size sites with 2 infusion nurses; that scheduled appointments performed better than walk-ins when patient load was not high; and that reducing infusion time was particularly impactful when load on resources was only slightly above manageable levels. DISCUSSION: Physical capacity, check-in staff, and infusion time were as important as nurses for mAb sites. Health systems can effectively operate an infusion center under different conditions to provide mAb therapeutics even with relatively low investments in physical resources and staff. CONCLUSION: Simulations of mAb infusion sites were used to create a capacity planning tool to optimize resource utility and allocation in constrained pandemic conditions, and more efficiently treat COVID-19 patients at existing and future mAb infusion sites.","output":"Staffing and Capacity Planning for SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibody Infusion Facilities: A Performance Estimation Calculator Based on Discrete-Event Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innate immunity triggers responsible for viral control or hyperinflammation in COVID- 19 are largely unknown.

It is critical to predict the effectiveness of kidney transplantation to optimise organ allocation. This would allow patients to choose the best accessible kidney donor and the optimal immunosuppressive medication. Several studies have attempted to identify factors that predispose to graft rejection, but the results have been contradictory. As a result, the goal of this paper is to use the African buffalo-based artificial neural network (AB-ANN) approach to uncover predictive risk variables related to kidney graft. These two feature selection approaches combine to provide a novel hybrid feature selection technique that could select the most important elements to improve prediction accuracy. The feature analysis revealed that clinical features have varied effects on transplant survival. The collected data is processed in both training and testing methods. The prediction model's performance, in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, was examined, and the results were compared with those of other existing systems, including naive Bayesian, random forest, and J48 classifier. The results suggest that the proposed approach can forecast graft survival in kidney recipients' next visits in a creative manner and with more accuracy compared with other classifiers. This proposed method is more efficient for predicting kidney graft survival. Incorporating those clinical tools into outpatient clinics' everyday workflows could help physicians make better and more personalised decisions.","output":"Predicting the Kidney Graft Survival Using Optimized African Buffalo-Based Artificial Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the leading cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) expression is an important susceptibility factor for HuNoV infection based on controlled human infection models and epidemiologic studies that show an association of secretor status with infection caused by several genotypes. The fucosyltransferase 2 gene (FUT2) affects HBGA expression in intestinal epithelial cells; secretors express a functional FUT2 enzyme, while nonsecretors lack this enzyme and are highly resistant to infection and gastroenteritis caused by many HuNoV strains. These epidemiologic associations are confirmed by infections in stem cell-derived human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures. GII.4 HuNoV does not replicate in HIE cultures derived from nonsecretor individuals, while HIEs from secretors are permissive to infection. However, whether FUT2 expression alone is critical for infection remains unproven, since routinely used secretor-positive transformed cell lines are resistant to HuNoV replication. To evaluate the role of FUT2 in HuNoV replication, we used CRISPR or overexpression to genetically manipulate FUT2 gene function to produce isogenic HIE lines with or without FUT2 expression. We show that FUT2 expression alone affects both HuNoV binding to the HIE cell surface and susceptibility to HuNoV infection. These findings indicate that initial binding to a molecule(s) glycosylated by FUT2 is critical for HuNoV infection and that the HuNoV receptor is present in nonsecretor HIEs. In addition to HuNoV studies, these isogenic HIE lines will be useful tools to study other enteric microbes where infection and/or disease outcome is associated with secretor status.","output":"Genetic Manipulation of Human Intestinal Enteroids Demonstrates the Necessity of a Functional Fucosyltransferase 2 Gene for Secretor-Dependent Human Norovirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The speed and scale of the global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented pressures on health services worldwide, requiring new methods of service delivery during the health crisis.

Cardiac injury was identified by classic methods, while fibrosis was characterized by histological analysis of the hearts. Etanercept treatment at 0.8 mg/kg/week twice weekly by subcutaneous injection effectively alleviates the cardiac fibrosis in HFD-fed rats. STAT3 activation seems to be induced in parallel with fibrosis-related gene expression in the hearts of HFD-fed rats. Decreased STAT3 activation plays a role in the etanercept-treated animals. Moreover, fibrosis-related genes are activated by palmitate in parallel with STAT3 activation in H9c2 cells. Etanercept may inhibit the effects of palmitate, but it is less effective than a direct inhibitor of STAT3. Direct inhibition of STAT3 activation by etanercept seems unlikely.

Higher educational institutes (HEIs) are compelled to adopt digital technologies and technology-mediated learning in the teaching-learning processes. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors affecting learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction and the mediating role of prerecorded videos from the learners perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A self-designed structured questionnaire based on previous similar studies is adopted as a survey instrument. It consists of 22 questions to address the five constructs of the proposed hypothesized conceptual model, developed for the study. Data of 311 students from HEIs of Maharashtra state in India were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis is carried out to test the model fitness, reliability and validity, and structural equation modeling is applied to conduct path analysis and hypotheses testing of the model. Findings: Hypotheses testing reveals that perceived usefulness (PU) significantly affects the perceived learning effectiveness, which again affects the learning satisfaction of the students. In addition, perceived ease of use affects the PU as suggested in the technology acceptance model. The prerecorded videos have a moderating role to play in the computer self-efficacy and the perceived learning effectiveness of the students. This research will provide meaningful acumen to enhance the overall learning process among students in urban as well as rural India. Originality/value: This study explores the technology-mediated learning during the unexpected and dynamic situations of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of higher education in India. For sustainable use of technology-assisted learning, educators must understand the key factors that influence students learning effectiveness and satisfaction. The research outcomes will lead toward developing the human capacities, as the prerecorded videos at the HEIs of India will provide new approaches for effectively adopting digital technologies and technology-mediated learning. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Effectiveness and satisfaction of technology\\\\mediated learning during global crisis: understanding the role of pre-developed videos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To explore if retinal findings are associated with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, we recruited participants positive for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab, with no medical history. Subjects underwent retinal imaging with an automated imaging device (3D OCT-1 Maestro, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain colour fundus photographs (CFP) and optical coherence tomographic (OCT) scans of the macula. Data on personal biodata, medical history and vital signs were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS: 108 patients were recruited. Mean age was 36.05.4 years. 41 (38.0%) had symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) at presentation. Of 216 eyes, 25 (11.6%) had retinal signseight (3.7%) with microhaemorrhages, six (2.8%) with retinal vascular tortuosity and two (0.93%) with cotton wool spots (CWS). 11 eyes (5.1%) had hyper-reflective plaques in the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer layer on OCT, of which two also had retinal signs visible on CFP (CWS and microhaemorrhage, respectively).

We investigated the practicability, acceptability, and appropriateness of the device in children with gait impairments undergoing neurorehabilitation. Concerning appropriateness, we investigated whether (i) stride-to-stride variability of the stride time and inter-joint coordination was higher when walking over-ground in Andago versus treadmill walking, and (ii) activation of antigravity leg muscles decreased with higher levels of BWU. METHODS Eighteen children and adolescents with gait impairments participated in three sessions. Practicability was assessed by determining the time needed to get a patient in and out of Andago, the accuracy of the BWU system, and other aspects. Acceptability was assessed by patients responding to questions, while six therapists filled out the System Usability Scale. To determine appropriateness, the participants were equipped with surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes, electrogoniometers and accelerometers. Various parameters were compared between walking over-ground and on a treadmill, and between walking with three different levels of BWU (median: 20%, 35% and 50% of the bodyweight) over-ground. RESULTS Practicability: the average time needed to get in and out of Andago amounted to 60 s and 16 s, respectively. The BWU system seemed accurate, especially at higher levels. We experienced no technical difficulties and Andago prevented 12 falls. However, participants had difficulties walking through a door without bumping into it. Acceptability: after the second session, nine participants felt safer walking in Andago compared to normal walking, 15 preferred walking in Andago compared to treadmill walking, and all wanted to train again with Andago. Therapists rated the usability of the Andago as excellent. Appropriateness: stride-to-stride variability of stride duration and inter-joint coordination was higher in Andago compared to treadmill walking. sEMG activity was not largely influenced by the levels of BWU investigated in this study, except for a reduced M. Gluteus Medius activity at the highest level of BWU tested. CONCLUSIONS The Andago is a practical and well-accepted device to train walking over-ground with BWU in children and adolescents with gait impairments safely. The system allows individual stride-to-stride variability of temporospatial gait parameters without affecting antigravity muscle activity strongly.

Clinical pathways are promising care plans that proved to be efficient in reducing costs and optimizing resource usage. However, most clinical pathways are circulated in paper-based formats. Clinical pathway computerization is an emerging research field that aims to integrate clinical pathways with health information systems. A key process in clinical pathway computerization is the standardization of clinical pathway terminology to comply with digital terminology systems. Since clinical pathways include sensitive medical terms, clinical pathway standardization is performed manually and is difficult to automate using machines. The objective of this research is to introduce automation to clinical pathway standardization. The proposed approach utilizes a semantic score-based algorithm that automates the search for SNOMED CT terms. The algorithm was implemented in a software system with a graphical user interface component that physicians can use to standardize clinical pathways by searching for and comparing relevant SNOMED CT retrieved automatically by the algorithm. The system has been tested and validated on SNOMED CT ontology. The experimental results show that the system reached a maximum search space reduction of 98.9% within any single iteration of the algorithm and an overall average of 71.3%. The system enables physicians to locate the proper terms precisely, quickly, and more efficiently.

We examined the effects of the presence of an SAR on self-reported measures of stress in a community sample of 70 children (40 girls, 30 boys) between the ages of 7 and 10 years old. Child participants were randomly assigned to either a robot-present or a robot-absent condition during the Trier Social Stress Test for Children. Contrary to our predictions, we did not detect a stress-buffering effect of the presence of the robot. Instead, the primary analysis showed that the robots presence led to a larger decrease in positive affect following the task. However, further analyses found no significant difference in positive affect when accounting for baseline group differences. Exploratory analyses of the nature of childrens interactions with the SAR during the stressful task found that higher levels of parent-reported social anxiety were associated with greater prosocial behaviors towards the SAR, thus signifying a potential target for future interventions.

The outbreak of this new emerging contagious disease has impacted a wide range of sectors including health and economics. Much information about COVID-19 has been discovered by many laboratories, and action taken in various ways as quickly as possible to inhibit the outbreak. It was found that COVID-19 is a ribonucleic acid virus (RNA virus) that can cause infection among humans. Moreover, it can mutate and spread contagiously mainly through the respiratory system. The most common symptoms are cough and fever. Many patients could develop to either pneumonitis or respiratory failure. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect various organs, the main infections being in lungs and rectum. In these cases, many laboratories can isolate the virus from oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab and then apply the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to identify the COVID-19 virus. Many of the viral infections can cause cystitis by immunologic response. There is a study that showed the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be isolated from the urine sample. The patients had significant changes in urinary storage for frequency, urgency, and urinary incontinence during infected period, which improved after the disease resolved. Moreover, there is a study that reported that the COVID-19 patients who had the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scores of 20 to 35 had significantly longer hospital stays, more frequent intensive care requirements, and higher mortality rates.

Often, however, clinical questions also arise regarding the treatment effect in subpopulations of patients, which would experience clinical or disease related events post-randomization. Events that occur after treatment initiation and potentially affect the interpretation or the existence of the measurements are called intercurrent events in the ICH E9(R1) guideline. If the intercurrent event is a consequence of treatment, randomization alone is no longer sufficient to meaningfully estimate the treatment effect. Analyses comparing the subgroups of patients without the intercurrent events for intervention and control will not estimate a causal effect. This is well known, but post-hoc analyses of this kind are commonly performed in drug development. An alternative approach is the principal stratum strategy, which classifies subjects according to their potential occurrence of an intercurrent event on both study arms. We illustrate with examples that questions formulated through principal strata occur naturally in drug development and argue that approaching these questions with the ICH E9(R1) estimand framework has the potential to lead to more transparent assumptions as well as more adequate analyses and conclusions. In addition, we provide an overview of assumptions required for estimation of effects in principal strata.

METHODS: We retrospectively report the clinical management of 3,737 screened patients, including 3,119 (83.5%) treated with HCQ-AZ (200 mg of oral HCQ, three times daily for ten days and 500 mg of oral AZ on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days, respectively) for at least three days and 618 (16.5%) patients treated with other regimen (others). Outcomes were death, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), 10 days of hospitalization and viral shedding. RESULTS: The patients mean age was 45 (sd 17) years, 45% were male, and the case fatality rate was 0.9%. We performed 2,065 low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans highlighting lung lesions in 592 of the 991 (59.7%) patients with minimal clinical symptoms (NEWS score = 0). A discrepancy between spontaneous dyspnoea, hypoxemia and lung lesions was observed. Clinical factors (age, comorbidities, NEWS-2 score), biological factors (lymphocytopenia; eosinopenia; decrease in blood zinc; and increase in D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine phosphokinase, and C-reactive protein) and moderate and severe lesions detected in low-dose CT scans were associated with poor clinical outcome. Treatment with HCQ-AZ was associated with a decreased risk of transfer to ICU or death (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.18 0.11C0.27), decreased risk of hospitalization 10 days (odds ratios 95% CI 0.38 0.27C0.54) and shorter duration of viral shedding (time to negative PCR: HR 1.29 1.17C1.42).

While the importance of allergic responses in asthma is well known, respiratory viral and bacterial infections and pollutants especially cigarette smoke are important factors in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Corticosteroid treatment remains the first preference of treatment in either disease, however these therapies are not always completely effective, and are associated with side effects and steroid resistance. Due to such limitations, development of new treatments represents a major goal for both the pharmaceutical industry and academic researchers. There are now excellent reasons to promote NF-B signalling intermediates and Rel family proteins as potential therapeutic targets for both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This notion is supported by the fact that much of the underlying inflammation of both diseases independent of stimuli, is mediated at least in part, by NF-B mediated signalling events in several cell types. Also, a range of inhibitors of NF-B signalling intermediates are now available, including DNA oligonucleotides and DNA-peptide molecules that act as NF-B decoy sequences, small molecule inhibitors such as IKK- inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitors affecting NF-B signalling, that have either shown promise in animal models or have begun clinical trials in other disorders.

To date, mechanical sensors and surface electromyography (EMG) have been the primary sensing modalities used to classify ambulation. Ultrasound (US) imaging can be used to detect user-intent by characterizing structural changes of muscle. Our study evaluates wearable US imaging as a new sensing modality for continuous classification of five discrete modes: level, incline, decline, stair ascent, and stair descent ambulation, and benchmarks performance relative to EMG sensing. Ten subjects were equipped with a wearable US scanner and eight unilateral EMG sensors. Time-intensity features were recorded from US images of three thigh muscles. Features from sliding windows of EMG signals were analyzed in two configurations: one including 5 EMG sensors on muscles around the thigh, and another with 3 additional sensors placed on the shank. Linear discriminate analysis was implemented to continuously classify these phase-dependent features of each sensing modality as one of five modes. Five-fold cross-validation was used for each modality and subject. US-based sensing statistically improved mean classification accuracy to 99.8% (99.5100% CI) compared to 8-EMG sensors (85.8%; 84.087.6% CI) and 5-EMG sensors (75.3%; 74.576.1% CI). Further, separability analyses show the importance of superficial and deep US information for stair classification relative to other modes. These results are the first to demonstrate the ability of US-based sensing to classify discrete ambulation modes, highlighting the potential for improved assistive device control using less widespread, less superficial and higher resolution sensing of skeletal muscle.","output":"Ultrasound Sensing Can Improve Continuous Classification of Discrete Ambulation Modes Compared to Surface Electromyography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first manifested in Wuhan, China in December 2019 as multiple cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology.

Genetic variability, heritability, strength and direction of association among variables, and direct and indirect relationships among physiochemical and nutritional traits with -carotene content were evaluated. Core diameter, foliage weight, root weight and shoulder weight showed significant association with -carotene accumulation. Principal component analysis for physiochemical and nutritional assessment divided these genotypes into two distinctive groups, Eastern carrots and Western carrots. Caloric and moisture content had high positive associations with -carotene content while carbohydrate content was negatively associated. Five genotypes (T-29, PI 634658, PI 288765, PI 164798, and Ames 25043) with the highest -carotene contents were selected for making three nutraceutical supplements (carrot-orange juice, carrot jam and carrot candies).

In this premise, we studied the prognostic value of two markers of iron metabolism ferritin and hemoglobin. METHODOLOGY A retrospective-cohort study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in northern India involving 210 hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 15-and above. Analysis was done for clinical profile, comorbidities and basic laboratory indices including ferritin-hemoglobin ratio (FHR) with primary end-point being in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS Median serum ferritin levels (640.00ng/mL vs 220.00ng/mL) were significantly higher among non-survivors as against survivors while median hemoglobin levels were significantly lower (12.12g/dL vs 13.73g/dL). Serum ferritin levels >400ng/mL (Sn 80%, Sp 70%) predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity. Notably, serum ferritin levels >400ng/mL (HR 11.075 [1.481-82.801]) and anemia, defined as a hemoglobin of <12g/dL for females and < 13g/dL for males and were significantly associated with the risk of mortality in a univariable Cox-proportional hazards regression. The median FHR was significantly higher among non-survivors compared to survivors (56.98 vs 17.17). FHR>31 (Sn 85% Sp 71.6%) was highly sensitive and specific for predicting mortality. The multivariable analysis indicated that FHR >31 remained an independent risk factor for mortality (HR 12.293 [3.147-48.028]). CONCLUSION Ferritin-hemoglobin ratio (FHR), which encompasses into a single index, the effects of both elevated levels of ferritin and the severity of anemia, seems to perform particularly well as a prognostic marker and emerged as an independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. Hyperferritinemia and anemia, both, are inexorably interlinked in addition to having a role, directly or indirectly in the disease pathophysiology.

Although D-dimer is a recognized biomarker for disease severity, there are insufficient data to recommend using this parameter to guide therapeutic decisions. Purpose: The aim of the study is to investigate whether D-dimer guided anticoagulant therapy (ACT) is associated with a better evolution in moderate and severe COVID 19 illness. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 120 consecutive patients (71 men, mean age 62.814 years old), hospitalised for moderate or severe COVID-19 illness. All patients were clinically examined, thoracic CT was performed, hematologic parameters were measured. Presence of VTE in patients with risk factors was excluded with doppler imaging and/or contrast thoracic CT. Patients with D-dimer 0.5 mg/L received prophylactic ACT (enoxaparin 40 mg daily), patients with D-dimer between 0.5 mg/L and 1 mg/L received 40 mg bid and those with D dimer 1mg/L were treated with full dose ACT (enoxaparin 1mg/kg bid). During hospitalization D-dimer was measured and the ACT was adapted accordingly. In all patients COVID-19 disease was managed according to current guidelines. After discharge patients were followed up 307 days. Prophylactic ACT was continued in patients with high thrombotic risk. Results: 76 patients (63.3%) had moderate, and 44 patients (36.6%) had severe disease. Comorbidities were present in 71.5% patients (61.5% with cardiovascular disease, 16.6% with diabetes mellitus, 16.6% with obesity, 6.6% with renal failure, 4.1% with neoplastic disease). Average D-dimer was 1.30.8 mg/L. D-dimer elevation>0.5 mg/L was seen in 79 patients (65.8%). D-dimer was higher in patients with severe vs moderate illness 1.50.9 mg/L vs 1.010.9 mg/l (p<0.05) and in patients with comorbidities vs patients with no comorbidities (1.20.8 mg/L vs 0.70.6 mg/L, p<0.05). During hospitalization and subsequent follow up no VTE was recorded. 10 patients (0.83%) initially on prophylactic doses were switched to full dose ACT. Haemorrhagic complications were recorded in 5 patients (4.1%) and were minor. 4 patients (3.3%) with moderate illness at admission and comorbidities, were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) and subsequently died (two patients with severe respiratory failure, one patient with respiratory failure and myocarditis and one patient with coma after resuscitated cardiac arrest). 116 patients (96.7%) were discharged after a median hospitalization of 123 days and there were no complications recorded during the short term follow up. Conclusions: D-dimer guided therapy is associated with a lower incidence of TVP complications and mortality in moderate and severe hospitalized patients (0% vs 10% and 3.3% vs 20.3% respectively in literature data base) with nonsignificant haemorrhagic complications.

This could be implemented using the biosensor principle based on peptide aptamers for spatial recognition of corresponding protein markers of diseases in biological fluids. In this paper, a low-cost label-free principle of biomarker detection using a biosensor system based on fluorometric registration of the target proteins bound to peptide aptamers was investigated. The main detection principle considered includes the re-emission of the natural fluorescence of selectively bound protein markers into a longer-wavelength radiation easily detectable by common charge-coupled devices (CCD) using a specific luminophore. Implementation of this type of detection system demands the reduction of all types of stray light and background fluorescence of construction materials and aptamers. The latter was achieved by careful selection of materials and design of peptide aptamers with substituted aromatic amino acid residues and considering troponin T, troponin I, and bovine serum albumin as an example. The peptide aptamers for troponin T were designed in silico using the ?Protein 3D? (SPB ETU, St. Petersburg, Russia) software. The luminophore was selected from the line of ZnS-based solid-state compounds. The test microfluidic system was arranged as a flow through a massive of four working chambers for immobilization of peptide aptamers, coupled with the optical detection system, based on thick film technology.

By including multiple routine settings in research, we aimed to promote generalisability of findings and demonstrate potential efficiencies derived from LHS. We illustrate the nature and range of research CIN has supported over the past 7 years as a form of LHS. Clinically, this has largely focused on common, serious paediatric illnesses such as pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea with dehydration with recent extensions to neonatal illnesses. CIN also enables examination of the quality of care, for example that provided to children with severe malnutrition and the challenges encountered in routine settings in adopting simple technologies (pulse oximetry) and more advanced diagnostics (eg, Xpert MTB/RIF). Although regular feedback to hospitals has been associated with some improvements in quality data continue to highlight system challenges that undermine provision of basic, quality care (eg, poor access to blood glucose testing and routine microbiology). These challenges include those associated with increased mortality risk (eg, delays in blood transfusion). Using the same data the CIN platform has enabled conduct of randomised trials and supports malaria vaccine and most recently COVID-19 surveillance.

We examined the secretion of gut hormones in cholecystectomized subjects to test the hypothesis that gallbladder emptying potentiates postprandial release of GLP-1. Ten cholecystectomized subjects and 10 healthy, age-, gender-, and body mass index-matched control subjects received a standardized fat-rich liquid meal (2,200 kJ). Basal and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), cholecystokinin (CCK), and gastrin were measured. Furthermore, gastric emptying and duodenal and serum bile acids were measured. We found similar basal glucose concentrations in the two groups, whereas cholecystectomized subjects had elevated postprandial glucose excursions. Cholecystectomized subjects had reduced postprandial concentrations of duodenal bile acids, but preserved postprandial plasma GLP-1 responses, compared with control subjects. Also, cholecystectomized patients exhibited augmented fasting glucagon. Basal plasma CCK concentrations were lower and peak concentrations were higher in cholecystectomized patients. The concentrations of GIP, GLP-2, and gastrin were similar in the two groups. In conclusion, cholecystectomized subjects had preserved postprandial GLP-1 responses in spite of decreased duodenal bile delivery, suggesting that gallbladder emptying is not a prerequisite for GLP-1 release. Cholecystectomized patients demonstrated a slight deterioration of postprandial glycemic control, probably because of metabolic changes unrelated to incretin secretion.","output":"Postprandial gut hormone responses and glucose metabolism in cholecystectomized patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the microbial composition of the respiratory tract and other infected tissues as well as their possible pathogenic contributions to varying degrees of disease severity in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Between 27 January and 26 February 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients in Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. We identified distinct signatures of microbial dysbiosis among severely ill COVID-19 patients on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Co-detection of other human respiratory viruses (including human alphaherpesvirus 1, rhinovirus B, and human orthopneumovirus) was demonstrated in 30.8% (4/13) of the severely ill patients, but not in any of the mildly affected patients. Notably, the predominant respiratory microbial taxa of severely ill patients were Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Mycoplasma spp. (including M. hominis and M. orale). The presence of the former two bacterial taxa was also confirmed by clinical cultures of respiratory specimens (expectorated sputum or nasal secretions) in 23.1% (3/13) of the severe cases. Finally, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes was demonstrated in one severely ill patient, which might accelerate his disease deterioration and death occurring one month after ICU admission. Our findings point to SARS-CoV-2-related microbial dysbiosis and various antibiotic-resistant respiratory microbes/pathogens in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity. Detection and tracking strategies are needed to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance, improve the treatment regimen and clinical outcomes of hospitalized, severely ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Characterization of respiratory microbial dysbiosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human infections with avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have frequently raised global concerns of emerging, interspecies-transmissible viruses with pandemic potential. Waterfowl, the predominant reservoir of influenza viruses in nature, harbor precursors of different genetic lineages that have contributed to novel pandemic influenza viruses in the past. METHODS: Two duck influenza H5N2 viruses, DV518 and DV413, isolated through virological surveillance at a live-poultry market in Taiwan, showed phylogenetic relatedness but exhibited different replication capabilities in mammalian Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. This study characterizes the replication properties of the two duck H5N2 viruses and the determinants involved. RESULTS: The DV518 virus replicated more efficiently than DV413 in both MDCK and chicken DF1 cells. Interestingly, the infection of MDCK cells by DV518 formed heterogeneous plaques with great differences in size [large (L) and small (S)], and the two viral strains (p518-L and p518-S) obtained from plaque purification exhibited distinguishable replication kinetics in MDCK cells. Nonetheless, both plaque-purified DV518 strains still maintained their growth advantages over the plaque-purified p413 strain. Moreover, three amino acid substitutions in PA (P224S), PB2 (E72D), and M1 (A128T) were identified in intra-duck variations (p518-L vs p518-S), whereas other changes in HA (N170D), NA (I56T), and NP (Y289H) were present in inter-duck variations (DV518 vs DV413). Both p518-L and p518-S strains had the N170D substitution in HA, which might be related to their greater binding to MDCK cells. Additionally, polymerase activity assays on 293T cells demonstrated the role of vRNP in modulating the replication capability of the duck p518-L viruses in mammalian cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that intra-host phenotypic variation occurs even within an individual duck. In view of recent human infections by low pathogenic AIVs, this study suggests possible determinants involved in the stepwise selection of virus variants from the duck influenza virus population which may facilitate inter-species transmission.","output":"Phenotypic and Genetic Characterization of Avian Influenza H5N2 Viruses with Intra- and Inter-Duck Variations in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report two cases of eyebrow granulomas in patients who underwent a permanent eye makeup procedure.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (EC 3.4.15.1) is a dipeptidyl carboxylase that, when inhibited, can reduce blood pressure through the reninCangiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are used as a first-line medication to be prescribed to treat hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure, among others. It has been suggested that ACE inhibitors can alleviate the symptoms in mouse models. Despite the benefits of ACE inhibitors, previous studies also have suggested that genetic variants of the ACE gene are risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurological diseases, while other variants are associated with reduced risk of AD. In mice, ACE overexpression in the brain reduces symptoms of the AD model systems. Thus, we find two opposing effects of ACE on health. To clarify the effects, we dissect the functions of ACE as follows: (1) angiotensin-converting enzyme that hydrolyzes angiotensin I to make angiotensin II in the reninCangiotensin system; (2) amyloid-degrading enzyme that hydrolyzes beta-amyloid, reducing amyloid toxicity. The efficacy of the ACE inhibitors is well established in humans, while the knowledge specific to AD remains to be open for further research. We provide an overview of ACE and inhibitors that link a wide variety of age-related comorbidities from hypertension to AD to aging.

The interviews were used to explore stability and change in levels of loneliness from the perspective of older people themselves. The interviews focused on participants perspectives of the events that triggered loneliness, stability, and change in levels of loneliness over time as well as participants responses to loneliness.

The single-use food container-derived pyrolytic product was largely composed of hydrocarbons with a wide range of carbon numbers from C(1) to C(32), while the corrugated fiberboard-derived pyrolytic product was composed of a variety of chemical groups such as phenolic compounds, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and oxygenates involving alcohols, acids, aldehydes, ketones, acetates, and esters. Changes in the pyrolysis temperature from 500 C to 900 C had no significant effect on the selectivity toward each chemical group found in the pyrolytic liquid derived from either the single-use food containers or corrugated fiberboard. The co-pyrolysis of the single-use food containers and corrugated fiberboard led to 6 times higher hydrogen (H(2)) selectivity than the pyrolysis of the single-use food containers only.

The analysis of fiscal stabilization in the United States, a monetary union equipped with a common fiscal capacity, has often informed the literature on the European EMU and could serve as a reference for its possible future reforms. This paper expands that literature in three ways: first, by measuring stabilization not only as inter-state risk-sharing of asymmetric shocks, but also as intertemporal stabilization of common shocks;second, by doing this for specific items in the US federal budget, both on the revenue and on the expenditure side;and third, by also measuring the impact of the federal system of unemployment benefits and of its extension as a response to the Great Recession. Corporate and personal income tax, on the revenue side, and social security benefits and federal grants, on the spending side, are the most effective items. The US federal system of unemployment insurance provides great stabilization in the event of a large shock, in particular when enhanced by the discretionary program of extended benefits. These findings imply that a proper design of the budget can maximize its stabilization effect, when it helps bridging the gap between higher mobility of capital and lower mobility of labor, by collecting revenues based on the income of the most mobile factor (corporate income tax) and providing support to the income of the least mobile factor (social security).","output":"Fiscal Stabilization in the United States: Lessons for Monetary Unions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 disease led to an unprecedented health emergency, still ongoing worldwide.

Previous studies analyzed the impact of social distance measures on individuals' mental health, whereas few studies have examined the interplay between the adults' functioning, as parents, during this period and the association with the child's adjustment. The present study tested if maternal distress/coping predicts children's behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown, hypothesizing a mediation effect via children's emotional experience. Participants were 144 mothers (M age = 39.3, 25-52, SD = 5.6) with children aged 5-10 years (M age = 7.54, SD = 1.6, 82 boys); mothers answered to an online survey. Results indicated that mothers with higher exposure to COVID-19 showed higher levels of distress and higher display of coping attitudes, even if in the structural equation modeling model, the COVID-19 exposure was not a predictor of mothers' distress. Compared with mothers with good coping skills, mothers with higher stress levels were more likely to attribute negative emotions to their children at the expense of their positive emotions. Moreover, children's emotions acted as mediators between maternal distress/coping and children's adaptive/maladaptive behaviors. In conclusion, it is important to support parents during pandemic emergence, by providing them with adequate information to manage the relationship with their children, to reduce their level of distress and to enhance their coping abilities.","output":"Maternal Distress/Coping and Children's Adaptive Behaviors During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Mediation Through Children's Emotional Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses the role of r/Wallstreetbets as a counter-hegemonic movement that is juxtaposed against the traditional Goliaths of finance in America.

A major factor attributing to the variation in mHealth study results may be mHealth user engagement. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to determine if user engagement with smartphone apps for the prevention and management of CVD is associated with improved CVD health behavior change and risk factor outcomes. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases from 2007 to 2020. Studies were eligible if they assessed whether user engagement with a smartphone app used by an individual to manage his or her CVD risk factors was associated with the CVD health behavior change or risk factor outcomes. For eligible studies, data were extracted on study and sample characteristics, intervention description, app user engagement measures, and the relationship between app user engagement and the CVD risk factor outcomes. App user engagement was operationalized as general usage (eg, number of log-ins or usage days per week) or self-monitoring within the app (eg, total number of entries made in the app). The quality of the studies was assessed. RESULTS Of the 24 included studies, 17 used a randomized controlled trial design, 4 used a retrospective analysis, and 3 used a single-arm pre- and posttest design. Sample sizes ranged from 55 to 324,649 adults, with 19 studies recruiting participants from a community setting. Most of the studies assessed weight loss interventions, with 6 addressing additional CVD risk factors, including diabetes, sleep, stress, and alcohol consumption. Most of the studies that assessed the relationship between user engagement and reduction in weight (9/13, 69%), BMI (3/4, 75%), body fat percentage (1/2, 50%), waist circumference (2/3, 67%), and hemoglobin A1c (3/5, 60%) found statistically significant results, indicating that greater app user engagement was associated with better outcomes. Of 5 studies, 3 (60%) found a statistically significant relationship between higher user engagement and an increase in objectively measured physical activity. The studies assessing the relationship between user engagement and dietary and diabetes self-care behaviors, blood pressure, and lipid panel components did not find statistically significant results. CONCLUSIONS Increased app user engagement for prevention and management of CVD may be associated with improved weight and BMI; however, only a few studies assessed other outcomes, limiting the evidence beyond this. Additional studies are needed to assess user engagement with smartphone apps targeting other important CVD risk factors, including dietary behaviors, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension.

While the number of academically affiliated medical human rights programs has increased in recent years, there is still substantial unmet need for pro bono evaluations throughout the United States, especially for individuals in detention. Approach The Mount Sinai Human Rights Program launched its pilot Remote Evaluation Network in September 2019, with the aim to coordinate forensic mental health evaluations by telephone or video call for individuals who are unable to access in-person services. The authors recruited mental health clinicians from across the country, trained them in best practices in conducting forensic evaluations using telehealth platforms, and coordinated pro bono mental health evaluations of individuals seeking immigration relief. Remote forensic services have been a particularly relevant solution in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes The Remote Evaluation Network consists of seventeen active evaluators. From December 2019 to April 2020, the pilot program has coordinated fifteen forensic evaluations of individuals seeking asylum and other forms of protected immigration status in six different states. All clinicians participated in a training module on best practices in conducting forensic evaluations by telephone; respondents to optional pre-and-post-module surveys reported an increase in comfort level with conducting telephonic evaluations after participating in the module. Next Steps We will formally evaluate this pilot program's services by assessing the quality of medico-legal affidavits from telephonic evaluations, tracking legal outcomes and qualitative feedback from attorneys, and investigating the acceptability of telephonic mental health evaluations among legal professionals.

DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous Cochrane review, search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from 01 October 2010 to 01 April 2020, and forward and backward citation analysis of included studies. DATA SELECTION: RCTs and c-RCTs involving people of any age, testing the use of hand hygiene methods, surface disinfection or cleaning, and other miscellaneous barrier interventions. Face masks, eye protection, and person distancing are covered in Part 1 of our systematic review. Outcomes included acute respiratory illness (ARI), influenza-like illness (ILI) or laboratory-confirmed influenza (influenza) and/or related consequences (e.g. death, absenteeism from school or work). DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors working in pairs independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. The generalised inverse variance method was used for pooling by using the random-effects model, and results reported with risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We identified 51 eligible trials. We included 25 randomised trials comparing hand hygiene interventions with a control; 15 of these could be included in meta-analyses. We pooled 8 trials for the outcome of ARI. Hand hygiene showed a 16% relative reduction in the number of participants with ARI (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.86) in the intervention group. When we considered the more strictly defined outcomes of ILI and influenza, the RR for ILI was 0.98 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.14), and for influenza the RR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.34). Three trials measured absenteeism. We found a 36% relative reduction in absentee numbers in the hand hygiene group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.71). Comparison of different hand hygiene interventions did not favour one intervention type over another. We found no incremental effects of combining hand hygiene with using face masks or disinfecting surfaces or objects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of evidence for the impact of hand hygiene in reducing ILI and influenza, the modest evidence for reducing the burden of ARIs, and related absenteeism, justifies reinforcing the standard recommendation for hand hygiene measures to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Funding for relevant trials with an emphasis on adherence and compliance with such a measure is crucial to inform policy and global pandemic preparedness with confidence and precision.","output":"Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

Antibodies were tethered through an engineered calmodulin (CaM)-binding peptide into a stimulus-responsive hydrogel composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-functionalized CaM. Macromolecular crowding is modulated by transient heating, which decreases effective pore sizes. Using a fluorescent ligand bound to the scFv, frequency-domain fluorescence spectroscopy was used to assess the structural coupling between the VH and the VL domains and relationships with functional stabilization. There is minimal structural coupling between the VH and the VL domains in solution, as is apparent from the substantial rotational mobility for the bound ligand, that is suggestive of an independent mobility for the VH and the VL domains. In comparison, the hydrogel matrix acts to structurally couple the VH and the VL domains, resulting in a reduction in rotational mobility and a retention of ligand binding in the presence of 8.0 M urea. Under these same conditions, ligand binding is disrupted for scFv antibodies in solution. Increases in the stabilization of scFv antibodies in hydrogels is not simply the result of molecular crowding because decreases in pore size act to destabilize ligand binding. Rather, our results suggest that the functional stabilization of the scFv antibody within the PEG hydrogel matrix includes important factors involving protein solvation that stabilize interdomain interactions between the VH and the VL domains necessary for ligand binding.","output":"Hydrogel Tethering Enhances Interdomain Stabilization of Single-Chain Antibodies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has motivated the researchers to use artificial intelligence techniques for a potential alternative to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction due to the limited scale of testing. The chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the alternatives to achieve fast diagnosis, but the unavailability of large-scale annotated data makes the clinical implementation of machine learning-based COVID detection difficult. Another issue is the usage of ImageNet pre-trained networks which does not extract reliable feature representations from medical images. In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical convolutional network (HCN) architecture to naturally augment the data along with diversified features. The HCN uses the first convolution layer from COVIDNet followed by the convolutional layers from well-known pre-trained networks to extract the features. The use of the convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations relevant to the CXR modality. We also propose the use of ECOC for encoding multiclass problems to binary classification for improving the recognition performance. Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of achieving better results in comparison with the existing studies. The proposed method can accurately triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR images for sharing the testing load and increasing the testing capacity.","output":"Triage of potential COVID-19 patients from chest X-ray images using hierarchical convolutional networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the sexually transmitted infection (STI) vaccine research priorities of global leaders in STI vaccine research, development, and service provision. METHODS: Global representatives attending the STI Vaccines: Opportunities for Research, Development, and Implementation symposium preceding the STI & HIV World Congress in 2019 were invited to complete an electronic survey. We asked participants to rank items by importance/priority for STI vaccine development for the following areas of focus: specific STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, herpes, and trichomoniasis), broad research domains (basic science, funding, communication, program planning, and vaccine hesitancy), and specific research activities related to these domains. We calculated weighted value scores based on the ranking (e.g., first, second, third) and the total number of responses in order to produce a ranked list of the priorities. RESULTS: A total of 46 out of 97 (44%) symposium attendees responded to the survey. Gonorrhea was identified as the STI that should be prioritized for vaccine development, followed by syphilis with weighted value scores of 3.82 and 3.37, respectively, out of a maximum of five. Basic science (and vaccine development) was the domain ranked with the highest priority with a weighted value score of 4.78 out of six. Research activities related to basic science and vaccine development (including pre-clinical and clinical trials, and surveillance measures) and increased funding opportunities were the most highly ranked activities in the STI vaccine development and research domains and activities categories.

Many species of bats are insectivorous while others are frugivorous and few of them are hematophagous. Some of these animals fly during the night, others are crepuscular or diurnal. Some fly long distances during seasonal migrations. Many species are colonial cave-dwelling, living in a rather small home range while others are relatively solitary. However, in spite of the importance of bats for terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem ecology, the diversity in their biology and lifestyles remain poorly known and underappreciated. More than sixty viruses have been detected or isolated in bats; these animals are therefore involved in the natural cycles of many of them. This is the case, for instance, of rabies virus and other Lyssavirus (Family Rhabdoviridae), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Paramyxoviridae), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Coronaviridae). For these zoonotic viruses, a number of bat species are considered as important reservoir hosts, efficient disseminators or even directly responsible of the transmission. Some of these bat-borne viruses cause highly pathogenic diseases while others are of potential significance for humans and domestic or wild animals; so, bats are an important risk in human and animal public health. Moreover, some groups of viruses developed through different phylogenetic mechanisms of coevolution between viruses and bats. The fact that most of these viral infections are asymptomatic in bats has been observed since a long time but the mechanisms of the viral persistence are not clearly understood. The various bioecology of the different bat populations allows exchange of virus between migrating and non-migrating conspecific species. For a better understanding of the role of bats in the circulation of these viral zoonoses, epidemiologists must pay attention to some of their biologic properties which are not fully documented, like their extreme longevity, their diet, the population size and the particular densities observed in species with crowded roosting behavior, the population structure and migrations, the hibernation permitting overwintering of viruses, their particular innate and acquired immune response, probably related at least partially to their ability to fly, allowing persistent virus infections and preventing immunopathological consequences, etc. It is also necessary to get a better knowledge of the interactions between bats and ecologic changes induced by man and to attentively follow bat populations and their viruses through surveillance networks involving human and veterinary physicians, specialists of wild fauna, ecologists, etc. in order to understand the mechanisms of disease emergence, to try to foresee and, perhaps, to prevent viral emergences beforehand. Finally, a more fundamental research about immune mechanisms developed in viral infections is essential to reveal the reasons why Chiroptera are so efficient reservoir hosts. Clearly, a great deal of additional work is needed to document the roles of bats in the natural history of viruses.","output":"Bats and Viruses: complex relationships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread worldwide since it first emerged in December 2019, with more than 100 million cases reported to date, causing a great impact on healthcare systems. Heart failure (HF) is a major health problem. It affects about 10 million people in Europe and is the leading cause of hospitalization for patients older than 65 years. During the first wave of COVID-19 there was an important decrease in HF hospitalizations. Data regarding HF admissions during the second and third waves and inter-waves periods is scarce. PURPOSE: To examine the impact of COVID-19 on HF hospitalizations during the first year of the pandemic and to compare the clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients admitted during the three pandemic waves with those admitted the previous year during the same periods. METHODS: Data from a tertiary Heart Failure Unit in Southern Spain between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021 were compared to the corresponding time period in the previous year. The impact of the pandemic on weekly hospitalizations was assessed using a Poisson Regression model, with year, season and pandemic wave as covariates. Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients admitted during the three waves were compared to those admitted during the same periods one year after. RESULTS: A significantly lower weekly number of admissions for HF was observed during the three pandemic wave periods compared to all other included periods (inter-wave periods and same periods in the previous year) (p=0.002, IRR 0.81, 0.77C0.86). Figure 1 shows monthly HF admissions between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021 (pandemic year) and the previous year, as well as COVID-19 hospitalized cases in our area. Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients admitted during the COVID-19 waves and the same periods in the previous year are shown in Figure 2. Patients admitted during the COVID-19 waves were younger, and fewer had diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF) and valvular heart disease (VHD). There were no differences in clinical outcomes (intensive care unit admission, in-hospital mortality). CONCLUSION: There was decline in HF hospitalization during the three waves of the pandemic year, but not during the inter-wave periods. Patients admitted during the wave periods had some clinical differences but similar in-hospital outcomes.

Given the various AKI rates and their associated risk factors, lack of AKI recovery in the majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and limited data regarding AKI in patients with COVID-19 in Iran, we aim to investigate the potential risk factors for AKI development and its incidence in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled adult patients referred to the Sina Hospital, Iran, from February 20 to May 14, 2020, with either a positive PCR test or a highly susceptible chest computed tomography features consistent with COVID-19 diagnosis. AKI was defined according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes criteria, and patients were stratified based on their AKI staging. We evaluated the risk indicators associated with AKI during hospitalization besides in-hospital outcomes and recovery rate at the time of discharge. RESULTS: We evaluated 516 patients with a mean age of 57.6  16.1 years and a male-to-female ratio of 1.69 who were admitted with the COVID-19 diagnosis. AKI development was observed among 194 (37.6%) patients, comprising 61.9% patients in stage 1, 18.0% in stage 2, and 20.1% in stage 3. Out of all patients, AKI occurred in 58 (11.2%) patients during the hospital course, and 136 (26.3%) patients arrived with AKI upon admission. AKI development was positively associated with all of the in-hospital outcomes, including intensive care unit admissions, need for invasive ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, multiorgan damage, and mortality. Patients with stage 3 AKI showed a significantly higher mortality rate, ARDS, and need for invasive ventilation than other stages. After multivariable analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR]: 11.27), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR: 6.89), history of hypertension (OR: 1.69), disease severity (OR: 2.27), and high urea levels (OR: 1.04) on admission were independent risk indicators of AKI development. Among 117 (28.1%) patients who experienced AKI and survived, only 33 (28.2%) patients made a recovery from the AKI, and 84 (71.8%) patients did not exhibit full recovery at the time of discharge. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We found that male sex, history of CKD, hypertension, disease severity, and high serum urea were independent risk factors associated with AKI in patients with COVID-19. Also, higher stages of AKI were associated with increased risk of mortality and in-hospital complications. Our results indicate a necessity for more precise care and monitoring for AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19, and lack of AKI recovery at the time of discharge is a common complication in such patients.","output":"The Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes Associated with Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with COVID-19: Data from a Large Cohort in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is caused by the novel enveloped beta-coronavirus with a genomic RNA closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV) and is named coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) In this study, six synthetic drugs were specifically docked against the RBD Most of the six compounds were observed to fit nicely with specific noncovalent interactions Oseltamivir was found to be the most strongly interacting with the RBD, exhibiting high values of full fitness and low free energy of binding It formed multiple noncovalent bonds in the region of the active site Hydroxychloroquine also demonstrated high binding affinity in the solvent accessibility state and fit nicely into the S-protein's active pocket The results revealed that these compounds could be potent inhibitors of S-protein that could, to some extent, block its interaction with ACE-2 It is obvious from the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was changed with the interaction of different drugs, which led to the unsuitability to bind ACE2 receptor Hence, laboratory studies elucidating the action of these compounds on SARS-CoV-2 are warranted for clinical assessments Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and oseltamivir interacted well with the receptor-binding domain of S-protein via noncovalent interactions and were recommended as excellent candidates for COVID-19 ? 2020 by the authors","output":"A new proposed mechanism of some known drugs targeting the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein using molecular docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We encounter the world as a continuous flow and effortlessly segment sequences of events into episodes.

A new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been recognized as the responsible pathogen in this infection. Although coronavirus disease is principally expressed as a pulmonary infection, critical SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently complicated with coagulopathy, and thromboembolic events are recognizable in several patients. Dehydration, acute inflammatory condition, protracted immobilization during disease, existence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, previous coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease are frequent comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized subjects, which possibly augment thrombo-embolic risk. However, other causal factors can still be identified such as unrestricted angiotensin II action, the use of immunoglobulins, an increased production of adhesion molecules able to induce vascular inflammation and endothelial activation, complement stimulation, excessive production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and increased platelet count. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be chosen as early treatment because of its anti-inflammatory action and its ability to antagonize histones and so defend the endothelium. However, several therapeutic possibilities have also been proposed such as fibrinolytic treatment, drugs that target NETs, and complement inhibition.

Hawai'i has not been spared from the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the local population, including high infection rates in racial and ethnic minorities. Early in the pandemic, we described in this journal various technologies used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Herein we characterize a 969-bp SARS-CoV-2 segment of the S gene downstream of the receptor-binding domain. At the John A. Burns School of Medicine Biocontainment Facility, RNA was extracted from an oropharyngeal swab and a nasal swab from 2 patients from Hawai'i who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. Following PCR, the 2 viral strains were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGAX. Phylogenetic tree results indicate that the virus has been introduced to Hawai'i from multiple sources. Further, we decoded 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 13 unique SARS-CoV-2 genomes within this region of the S gene, with 1 non-synonymous mutation (P681H) found in the 2 Hawai'i strains. The P681H mutation has unique and emerging characteristics with a significant exponential increase in worldwide frequency when compared to the plateauing of the now universal D614G mutation. The P681H mutation is also characteristic of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Additionally, several mutations resulting in cysteine residues were detected, potentially resulting in disruption of the disulfide bridges in and around the receptor-binding domain.

The present study aimed to investigate the recovery of reduced antitumor immunity by several ingredients taken as supplements or foods, including trehalose (Treh) and glycosylated hesperidin (gHesp).

Subsequently, cells were stimulated with IL-2 for an additional 28 days. During the 28 days, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 50 g/ml chrysotile asbestos fibers. In addition, cells were treated with 10 mM Treh or 10 M gHesp. Following culture for 28 days, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to assess the expression levels of transcription factors, cytokines and specific genes, including matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3, in unstimulated cells (fresh) and cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (stimuli). The results demonstrated that compared with the control group, chrysotile-exposure induced alterations in MMP-7, NNT and IL-17A expression levels were not observed in the 'Treh' and 'gHesp' groups in stimulated cells. The results suggested that Treh and gHesp may reverse asbestos exposure-induced reduced antitumor immunity in T helper cells.

However, the precise timing of gut closure in todays precocious pig is not known. We gavaged piglets immediately after birth and at 1-h after birth with Cy5-labeled Ovalbumin (Cy5-Ova) then harvested their small intestines 6C7 h later. To assess localization of Cy5-Ova in the small intestinal epithelial cells, we performed immunohistochemistry using a basolateral surface marker and a recycling endosome marker called pIgR, the late endosomal marker Rab7, and the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. Cy5-Ova co-localized with Rab7 and LAMP-1 in the duodenum and jejunum of 0-h old and 1-h old gavaged piglets, but only in the ileum of 0-h gavaged piglets. These data suggest that movement of Cy5-Ova through the late endosomes to the lysosomes was much reduced in the ileum of 1-h gavaged piglets. Cy5-Ova was largely present in epithelial cell digestive and transport vacuoles, but it did not colocalize with pIgR-positive endosomes in 0-h and 1-h gavaged piglets. Differences in macromolecular uptake across the different regions of the small intestine after only 1-h may be due to prior processing of colostral macromolecules, changes in the intestine due to initiation of colonization by microflora and/or the initiation of gut-closure. Understanding the relationship between the localization of Cy5-Ova and small intestinal permeability may contribute to establishing whether oral vaccination in the newborn can capitalize on the transient permeability before gut closure to promote immune protection.","output":"Assessment of intestinal macromolecular absorption in young piglets to pave the way to oral vaccination: preliminary results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As lung ultrasound (LUS) is a noninvasive, radiation-free, repeatable and portable imaging tool suitable for a point-of-care use, several recent literature reports have emphasized its role as the ideal screening tool for SARS-CoV2 pneumonia.

SER-109, an investigational microbiome drug of donor-derived, purified spores, reduced recurrence in a dose-ranging, phase (P) 1 study in subjects with multiple rCDIs. METHODS: In a P2 double-blind trial, subjects with clinical resolution on standard-of-care antibiotics were stratified by age (< or 65 years) and randomized 2:1 to single-dose SER-109 or placebo. Subjects were diagnosed at study entry by PCR or toxin testing. Safety, C. difficileCpositive diarrhea through week 8, SER-109 engraftment, and bile acid changes were assessed. RESULTS: 89 subjects enrolled (67% female; 80.9% diagnosed by PCR). rCDI rates were lower in the SER-109 arm than placebo (44.1% vs 53.3%) but did not meet statistical significance. In a preplanned analysis, rates were reduced among subjects 65 years (45.2% vs 80%, respectively; RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11C2.81), while the <65 group showed no benefit. Early engraftment of SER-109 was associated with nonrecurrence (P < .05) and increased secondary bile acid concentrations (P < .0001). Whole-metagenomic sequencing from this study and the P1 study revealed previously unappreciated dose-dependent engraftment kinetics and confirmed an association between early engraftment and nonrecurrence. Engraftment kinetics suggest that P2 dosing was suboptimal. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Early SER-109 engraftment was associated with reduced CDI recurrence and favorable safety was observed.

Recently, single-incision laparoscopic surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery have been developed as minimally invasive alternatives for CLC. Few comparative studies have been reported. METHODS Female patients with symptomatic gallstone disease who were treated in 2011 with SPC, TVC, or CLC were entered into a database. Patients were matched for age, body mass index, and previous abdominal surgery. After the operation all patients received a survey with questions about recovery, cosmesis, and body image. RESULTS A total of 90 patients, 30 in each group, were evaluated. Median operative time for CLC was significantly shorter (p < 0.001). There were no major complications. Length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, and postoperative complications were not significantly different. The results for cosmesis and body image after the transvaginal approach were significantly higher. None of the sexually active women observed postoperative dyspareunia. CONCLUSIONS Both SPC and TVC are feasible procedures when performed in selected patients. CLC is a faster procedure, but other clinical outcomes and complication rates were similar.

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the difference of the susceptibility for Mo infection, RNA-sequencing technology was used to compare the transcriptomic response of the lung tissue of Mo-infected Bbs and Ahs. RESULTS: Six Bbs and six Ahs were divided into experimental group and control group respectively, all of them were experimentally infected with Mo by intratracheal injection. For collecting lung tissue samples, three Bbs and three Ahs were sacrificed on day 4 post-infection, and the others were sacrificed on day 14 post-infection. Total RNA extracted from lung tissue were used for transcriptome analyses based on high-throughput sequencing technique and bioinformatics. The results showed that 212 (146 up-regulated, 66 down-regulated) DEGs were found when comparing transcriptomic data of Bbs and Ahs at 4th dpi, besides, 311 (158 up-regulated, 153 down-regulated) DEGs were found at 14th dpi. After GO analysis, three main GO items protein glycosylation, immune response and positive regulation of gene expression were found related to Mo infection. In addition, there were 20 DEGs enriched in these above items, such as SPLUC1 (BPIFA1), P2X7R, DQA, HO-1 and SP-A (SFTPA-1). CONCLUSIONS: These selected 20 DEGs associated with Mo infection laid the foundation for further study on the underlying molecular mechanism involved in high level of resistance to Mo expressed by Bbs, meanwhile, provided deeper understandings about the development of pathogenicity and host-pathogen interactions.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of postmastectomy HFRT vs CFRT based on the NCT00793962 trial. METHODS: A Markov model was adopted to synthesize the medical costs and health benefits of patients with high-risk breast cancer based on data from the NCT00793962 trial. Main outcomes were discounted lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We employed a time-dependent horizon from Chinese, French and USA payer perspectives. Model robustness was evaluated with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Patients receiving CFRT versus HFRT gained an incremental 0.0163 QALYs, 0.0118 QALYs and 0.0028 QALYs; meanwhile an incremental cost of $2351.92, $4978.34 and $8812.70 from Chinese, French and USA payer perspectives, respectively. Thus CFRT versus HFRT yielded an ICER of $144,281.47, $420,636.10 and $3,187,955.76 per QALY from Chinese, French and USA payer perspectives, respectively. HFRT could maintain a trend of >50% probabilities of cost-effectiveness below a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $178,882.00 in China, while HFRT was dominant relative to CFRT, regardless of the WTP values in France and the USA. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICERs were most sensitive to the parameters of overall survival after radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Postmastectomy HFRT could be used as a cost-effective substitute for CFRT in patients with high-risk breast cancer and should be considered in appropriately selected patients.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of postmastectomy hypofractionated radiation therapy vs conventional fractionated radiation therapy for high-risk breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Skin tests, including patch tests (PTs), prick tests and intradermal tests (IDTs), are useful to identify the culprit(s) of a cutaneous adverse drug reaction (CADR), and to determine (a) safer alternative drug(s).

Conversely, the price of discretionary foods and drinks did not increase during the pandemic. The cost of the current and recommended diets significantly increased throughout this period, but the latter continued to be less expensive than the former. Due to income supplements provided between May and September 2020, the affordability of the recommended diet improved greatly, by 27% and 42%, for households with minimum-wage and welfare-only disposable household income, respectively.

In this article, the concept\\"digital privacy divide (DPD)\\"is introduced to describe the perceived gap in the privacy preservation of individuals based on the geopolitical location of different countries. To better understand the DPD phenomenon, we created an online questionnaire and collected answers from more than 700 respondents from four different countries (the United States, Germany, Bangladesh, and India) who come from two distinct cultural orientations as per Hofstede's individualist vs. collectivist society. However, our results revealed some interesting findings. DPD does not depend on Hofstede's cultural orientation of the countries.

Distance mentorship models may be utilized to overcome geographic limitations, increase mentorship access, and strengthen mentoring relationships in surgery. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify the scope of literature on distance mentoring in surgery, the range of its application, its effectiveness, and any gaps in the literature that should be addressed in order to enhance mentorship in the surgical field. DESIGN: A comprehensive PubMed review was performed in January 2021 on distance mentorship of students, trainees, and surgeons in the surgical field. Reviews, replies, and non-English articles were excluded. Data was extracted regarding publication year, author's country, specialty, subjects, aim of mentorship model, and efficacy. RESULTS: 134 total studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies were published in 2020, written by authors in the United States, from general surgery, and featured an expert surgeon paired with a more junior fully trained surgeon. In all, 93.3% of studies utilized distance mentorship to enhance surgical skill through telementoring and only 4.5% were focused on mentorship to enhance careers through professional development. The remaining studies utilized distance mentorship models to increase surgical research (0.7%) and clinical knowledge (1.5%). CONCLUSION: The results of this review suggest successful implementation of distance mentoring in surgery through telementoring, but a lack of professionally aimed distance mentorship programs. Amidst COVID-19, distance mentorship is particularly important because of decreased face-to-face opportunity. Future studies in the surgical field should investigate distance mentoring as a means of increasing mentorship for professional development.","output":"Overcoming the Impact of COVID-19 on Surgical Mentorship: A Scoping Review of Long-distance Mentorship in Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to investigate the serotype-associated fatality rate in cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the Spanish region of Madrid between 2007 and 2020. Serotyping was performed by Pneumotest Latex and the Quellung reaction using commercial antisera. Case-fatality rate was estimated as the ratio between the number of deaths at hospital discharge and the number of cases attributable to each serotype. To evaluate the association measures, the odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval were calculated. Twenty five pneumococcal serotypes were associated to mortality and comprised 87.8% of the total number of isolates characterized. Serotypes 8, 3, 19A, 1, 7F, 22F, 12F, and 11A were the most prevalent (3% each). Serotypes 31, 11A, and 19F were significantly associated to high case-fatality rates (>20% each). The lower significantly associated case-fatality rate (<10% each) was found in serotypes 5, 1, 12B, 7F, 12F, 8, 33, and 10A. The serotypes with higher mortality levels (0.04 per 100,000 population) were 11A (fatality 24.0%), 3 (fatality 18.7%), 19A (fatality 12.5%), and 8 (fatality 7.2%). Serotype 3 was worrisome because it is associated with important fatality levels combined with very high incidence and mortality rates. Serotype 11A also showed a high fatality with marked incidence and mortality levels. Some few frequent serotypes as 31, 19F, and 15A despite its high fatality had low levels of mortality. By contrast other serotypes as 8 showing low fatality had high mortality ranges because it shows a wide extended distribution. Finally, common serotypes, such as 1 and 5, presented small mortality length, due to their low case-fatality rates.","output":"Age-Dependent Serotype-Associated Case-Fatality Rate in Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in the Autonomous Community of Madrid between 2007 and 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gold standard for gastric cancer detection is gastric histopathological image analysis, but there are certain drawbacks in the existing histopathological detection and diagnosis.

While the clinical translation of real cardiomyocytes obtained by cellular reprogramming has progressed only slowly, a multitude of clinical studies were carried out with cell products of somatic origin. This was mostly based on assumptions and experimentally acquired data with respect to the plasticity of adult precursor cells that, in retrospect, lacked validity. Accordingly, on closer inspection the results of the clinical studies were not convincing but they were nevertheless often presented and viewed in a very optimistic light.

Since oncolytic viruses are biological agents, they might require more realistic in vitro tumor models than common monolayer tumor cell cultures to provide meaningful predictive preclinical evaluation results. For more realistic invitro tumor models, three-dimensional tumor cell-culture systems can be employed in preclinical virotherapy research. This review provides an overview of spheroid and hydrogel tumor cell cultures, organotypic tumor-tissue slices, organotypic raft cultures, and tumor organoids utilized in the context of oncolytic virotherapy.

However, questions remain over the accuracy and reliability of the data they produce, particularly regarding the influence of environmental parameters such as humidity and temperature, and with varying PM sources and concentration profiles. In this study, eight units each of five different models of commercially available low-cost optical PM sensors (40 individual sensors in total) were tested under controlled laboratory conditions, against higher-grade instruments for: lower limit of detection, response time, responses to sharp pollution spikes lasting <1 [Formula: see text] , and the impact of differing humidity and PM source. All sensors detected the spikes generated with a varied range of performances depending on the model and presenting different sensitivity mainly to sources of pollution and to size distributions with a lesser impact of humidity. The sensitivity to particle size distribution indicates that the sensors may provide additional information to PM mass concentrations.

In the second case, a 26-year-old woman initially presented with visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations, and impairment in activities of daily living, and was given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Nine months later she was hospitalized for increasing confusion. MRI showed leukoencephalopathy and diffuse involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing callosal lesions. AQP4 antibody testing was positive and CSF testing for other antibodies of autoimmune encephalitis was negative. She had some improvement in cognition with high dose corticosteroids but remained significantly impaired. On follow-up, her repeat MRI showed a small new right inferomedial frontal enhancing lesion although she did not complain of any new cognitive issues, her MOCA score was 21/30, and she was started on eculizumab.

Introduction: Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Methods: Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). Conclusions: Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.","output":"Factores relacionados con efectos adversos psiquitricos en personal de salud durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innovation systems have seen diverse actors attempting to tame the Covid-19 crisis, under varying degrees of government direction Largely neglected in scholarly and public attention, however, are ?bottom-up? solutions arising from the periphery of innovation systems Drawing on inductive case research on a fringe doctor who invented the idea of the drive-through testing system, and two university student teams that developed coronavirus applications, this study examines how peripheral actors generate innovative, bottom-up solutions at speed in a time of crisis Our findings reveal that, in a crisis situation, bottom-up solutions transpire on the basis of three innovation drivers: (a) peripheral status, expediting the commence of innovation activities;(b) interdisciplinary collaboration, enabling access to a greater spectrum of knowledge and perspectives;and (c) prior knowledge, prescribing the direction of solution generation We also identify that system intermediaries support the innovation activities of peripheral actors, thereby helping bottom-up solutions to become more customer facing Such functions of intermediaries include demand articulation, technical assistance, and promulgation of generated solutions Our findings offer theoretical implications for the literature on innovation in a time of crisis and practical implications for governments and organizations preparing themselves for the potential second wave of coronavirus emergencies, or even a completely new form of future crisis","output":"Bottom-up solutions in a time of crisis: the case of Covid-19 in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A recent randomised trial showed that recombinant thrombomodulin did not benefit patients who had sepsis with coagulopathy and organ dysfunction. Several recent studies suggested presence of clinical phenotypes in patients with sepsis and heterogenous treatment effects across different sepsis phenotypes. We examined the latent phenotypes of sepsis with coagulopathy and the associations between thrombomodulin treatment and the 28-day and in-hospital mortality for each phenotype. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of multicentre registries containing data on patients (aged  16 years) who were admitted to intensive care units for severe sepsis or septic shock in Japan. Three multicentre registries were divided into derivation (two registries) and validation (one registry) cohorts. Phenotypes were derived using k-means with coagulation markers, platelet counts, prothrombin time/international normalised ratios, fibrinogen, fibrinogen/fibrin-degradation-products (FDP), D-dimer, and antithrombin activities. Associations between thrombomodulin treatment and survival outcomes (28-day and in-hospital mortality) were assessed in the derived clusters using a generalised estimating equation. RESULTS: Four sepsis phenotypes were derived from 3694 patients in the derivation cohort. Cluster dA (n = 323) had severe coagulopathy with high FDP and D-dimer levels, severe organ dysfunction, and high mortality. Cluster dB had severe disease with moderate coagulopathy. Clusters dC and  had moderate and mild disease with and without coagulopathy, respectively. Thrombomodulin was associated with a lower 28-day (adjusted risk difference [RD]: ? 17.8% [95% CI ? 28.7 to ? 6.9%]) and in-hospital (adjusted RD: ? 17.7% [95% CI ? 27.6 to ? 7.8%]) mortality only in cluster dA. Sepsis phenotypes were similar in the validation cohort, and thrombomodulin treatment was also associated with lower 28-day (RD: ? 24.9% [95% CI ? 49.1 to ? 0.7%]) and in-hospital mortality (RD: ? 30.9% [95% CI ? 55.3 to ? 6.6%]). CONCLUSIONS: We identified four coagulation marker-based sepsis phenotypes. The treatment effects of thrombomodulin varied across sepsis phenotypes. This finding will facilitate future trials of thrombomodulin, in which a sepsis phenotype with high FDP and D-dimer can be targeted.

Early studies reported intubation rates between 12.2-29.2% with varying criteria between sites and as the pandemic has progressed. With the rapid spread of infection and increased use of ventilators, triage of patients based on factors such as their past medical history can help guide resource allocation. This retrospective study examined a large multi-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 infection to identify risk factors associated with intubation. METHODS: Adult patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter from December 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 with COVID-19 were included in the Cerner COVID-19 dataset, which was extracted from 62 hospital systems throughout the United States. Only patients with at least two previous visits in the past 5 years were included. ICD-10 diagnosis codes, demographic data, and discharge status were collected and classified based on intubation status. Logistic regression model identified independently associated risk factors for intubation. RESULTS:18,467 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, with 5,525 seen only in the ED and 12,942 hospitalized. The mean age was 54.3  20.5 years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.42  11.72, 8,397 (45.6%) patients were male, and 938 (7.2%) were intubated. 1,829 (14.1%) patients died in the hospital and 4,185 (22.7%) had a non-routine discharge, which encompasses home health care, short-term hospital, other facility including intermediate care and skilled nursing home. Using multivariate logistic regression, patients who were intubated were more likely to present with stroke, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, septic shock, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and encephalopathy. From patient demographics and past medical history, male sex (p=0.011), age &gt; 35 (p=0.035 for 35-49 years old;p&lt;0.001 for &gt;50 years old), BMI &gt; 30 (p=0.013 for BMI 30-40;p=0.004 for BMI &gt;40), and previous respiratory failure (p=0.014) were independently associated with intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19, male sex, increased age, BMI &gt; 30, and previous respiratory failure were independently associated with the risk for intubation. Intubated patients were also more likely to present with stroke, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, septic shock, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and encephalopathy.

The present study aims to establish the spatial epidemiology of cancer burden in Africa and delineate the association between cancer burden and the country-level socioeconomic status. The study also examines the forecasts of the cancer burden for 2040 and evaluates infrastructure availability across all African countries. METHODS: The estimates of age, sex, and country-specific incidence and mortality of 34 neoplasms in 54 African countries, were procured from GLOBOCAN 2020. Mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) was employed as a proxy indicator of 5-year survival rates, and the socioeconomic development of each country was measured using its human development index (HDI). We regressed age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and MIR on HDI using linear regression model to determine the relationship between cancer burden and HDI. Maps were generated for each cancer group for each country in Africa. The data about the cancer infrastructure of African countries were extracted from the WHO Cancer Country Profiles. RESULTS: In Africa, an estimated 1.1 million new cases [95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) 1.0 C 1.3 million] and 711,429 [611,604 C 827,547] deaths occurred due to neoplasms in 2020. The ASIR was estimated to be 132.1/100,000, varying from 78.4/100,000 (Niger) to 212.5/100,000 (La Runion) in 2020. The ASMR was 88.8/100,000 in Africa, ranging from 56.6/100,000 in the Republic of the Congo to 139.4/100,000 in Zimbabwe. The MIR of all cancer combined was 0.64 in Africa, varying from 0.49 in Mauritius to 0.78 in The Gambia. HDI had a significant negative correlation with MIR of all cancer groups combined and main cancer groups (prostate, breast, cervical and colorectal). HDI explained 75% of the variation in overall 5-year cancer survival (MIR). By 2040, the burden of all neoplasms combined is forecasted to increase to 2.1 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths in Africa. CONCLUSION: High cancer mortality rates in Africa demand a holistic approach toward cancer control and management, including, but not limited to, boosting cancer awareness, adopting primary and secondary prevention, mitigating risk factors, improving cancer infrastructure and timely treatment.","output":"Mapping Cancer in Africa: A Comprehensive and Comparable Characterization of 34 Cancer Types Using Estimates From GLOBOCAN 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human taste sensation can be qualitatively described with surface electromyography.

This posed a challenge for students who had acclimated to learning anatomy inside the laboratory for the majority of their first year of medical school. The purpose of this study was to assess student perceptions of the abrupt transition from in person anatomy dissections and practical exams to an exclusively online format. MATERIALS AND METHODS An anonymous survey was distributed to medical students from the Class of 2023 at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University (n=191) in February 2021. The survey assessed student perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on their medical education. In total, 45 responses were recorded, and survey data was analyzed using SPSS software. Nonparametric methods were used due to the ordinal nature of the Likert scale responses. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed. In addition, focus groups were conducted with 11 medical students who had completed the survey. RESULTS A majority of respondents (82.55%) stated that their learning and understanding of anatomy was worse after cancellation of in person anatomy lab dissections. In contrast, understanding of didactic lecture material was split, with 37.5% stating that online lectures had no impact on their learning and understanding of the material, 31.25% stating understanding was worse, and 25% stating it was better following transition to online-only lectures. The results from the Wilcoxon signed rank test of Likert scale responses indicated that students perceived impact of cancelling in person anatomy lab as significantly worse compared to the impact of cancelling in person lectures (p<0.001). Focus group responses echoed this theme, with the loss of 3-dimensional visual and tactile learning in laboratory cited most frequently by participants as a challenge with the transition to online anatomy. CONCLUSION Medical student respondents in the class of 2023 perceived online anatomy as inferior to in person laboratory sessions after the COVID-19 shut-down in March 2020. The transition from in person to online anatomy was more impactful on student understanding of material than the transition from in person to online didactic lectures. Of note, the students surveyed had completed the majority of their anatomy curriculum in person prior to the transition online. SIGNIFICANCE/IMPLICATION The medical school shutdowns that occurred in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of in person interaction with cadaveric specimens in anatomy education, especially in the context of how students were initially exposed to content. When possible, consideration should be given to learning approaches that students are familiar with and how changes to the curriculum will impact them.","output":"Transitioning from In Person to Online Human Anatomy: Student Perspectives from the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Postural tachycardia syndrome (PTS) is a novel identified sequela of COVID-19 infection.

CASE SUMMARY: A total of seven active patients (three collegiate athletes, one recreational athlete, two registered nurses, one hospitality employee), age 24  6 years, and six females were followed for a mean of 152  105 days after contracting COVID-19. Tilt table was performed to establish the diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms were palpitations (7/7), dyspnoea (6/7), and gastrointestinal complaints (5/7). One patient required hospitalization for symptom management. The mean latency of PTS onset following COVID-19 was 21  15 days. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) demonstrated sinus rhythm in all patients, one with resting sinus tachycardia. Echocardiogram demonstrated normal systolic and diastolic left ventricular function in all patients. On tilt table testing, baseline heart rate (HR) was 72  12 with maximum HR reaching 136  13. Six of seven patients failed to respond to supportive therapy alone, and two patients failed medical management with ivabradine, midodrine, and/or metoprolol. Of three severely symptomatic patients, two demonstrated some degree of clinical recovery with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). DISCUSSION: This novel case series describes the development of PTS in the context of COVID-19 infection. Severity of symptoms and response to treatment was heterogeneous.

We sought to explore the community and religious factors unique to this sample, as they relate to the psychological and public health impact of quarantine. Community organizations were trusted more than any other source of COVID 19-related information, including federal, state, and other government agencies, including the CDC, WHO and media news sources. This was supported qualitatively with open-ended responses in which participants described the range of supports organized by community organizations. These included tangible needs (i.e. food delivery), social support, virtual religious services, and dissemination of COVID-19 related information. The overall levels of distress and anxiety were elevated and directly associated with what was reported to be largely inadequate and inconsistent health related information received from local departments of health. In addition, the majority of participants felt that perception of or concern about future stigma related to a COVID-19 diagnosis or association of COVID-19 with the Jewish community was high and also significantly predicted distress and anxiety. The current study demonstrates the ways in which religious institutions can play a vital role in promoting the well-being of their constituents. During this unprecedented pandemic, public health authorities have an opportunity to form partnerships with religious institutions in the common interests of promoting health, relaying accurate information and supporting the psychosocial needs of community members, as well as protecting communities against stigma and discrimination.","output":"A look at the first quarantined community in the United States: Response of religious communal organizations and implications for public health during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How has the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic affected R&D and innovation in Poland? Numerous international studies conducted after the Great Depression in 2008-2010 show a strong procyclicality of investments in R&D and innovation in companies: investments rise during the economic upturn and fall sharply during the crisis. This procyclicality is driven within firms both by internal financial resources and by differences in market incentives to innovate. It seems likely that the COVID-19 crisis caused financial weakness for many actors, having the most significant impact on the willingness or ability of smaller firms to support R&D and innovation. However, where firms are able to sustain these investments, evidence from the crisis a decade ago suggests that they will be more likely to survive, grow more strongly, and have higher profitability. Based on the analysis of the literature and macroeconomic data, this paper presents several recommendations that, if implemented by R&D actors, could help increase the efficiency of operations, even in times of crisis. ? 2021 Kinga Karpiska, published by Sciendo.","output":"Situation of the R&D Sector in Poland in the Face of the Current Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most common neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 are headache, anosmia, and dysgeusia.

Identifying risk for post-treatment worsening of symptoms using latent trajectories of change in eating disorder (ED) symptoms during treatment could allow for personalization of treatment to improve long-term outcomes METHODS: Participants (N = 56) with BN-spectrum EDs received 16 sessions of CBT and completed digital self-monitoring of eating episodes and ED behaviors. The Eating Disorder Examination was used to measured ED symptoms at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Latent growth mixture modeling of digital self-monitoring data identified latent growth classes. KruskalCWallis H tests examined effect of trajectory of change in ED symptoms on post-treatment to follow-up symptom change. RESULTS: Multi-class models of change in binge eating, compensatory behaviors, and regular eating improved fit over one-class models. Individuals with high frequency-rapid response in binge eating (H(1) = 10.68, p =0 .001, (2) = 0.24) had greater recurrence of compensatory behaviors compared to individuals with low frequency-static response. Individuals with static change in regular eating exhibited greater recurrence of binge eating than individuals with moderate response (H(1) = 8.99, p = 0.003, (2) = 0.20).

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Community LFT pilot at covid-19 testing sites in Liverpool, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 5869 asymptomatic adults (18 years) voluntarily attending one of 48 testing sites during 6-29 November 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were tested using both an Innova LFT and a quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test based on supervised self-administered swabbing at testing sites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of LFT compared with RT-qPCR in an epidemic steady state of covid-19 among adults with no classic symptoms of the disease. RESULTS: Of 5869 test results, 22 (0.4%) LFT results and 343 (5.8%) RT-qPCR results were void (that is, when the control line fails to appear within 30 minutes). Excluding the void results, the LFT versus RT-qPCR showed a sensitivity of 40.0% (95% confidence interval 28.5% to 52.4%; 28/70), specificity of 99.9% (99.8% to 99.99%; 5431/5434), positive predictive value of 90.3% (74.2% to 98.0%; 28/31), and negative predictive value of 99.2% (99.0% to 99.4%; 5431/5473). When the void samples were assumed to be negative, a sensitivity was observed for LFT of 37.8% (26.8% to 49.9%; 28/74), specificity of 99.6% (99.4% to 99.8%; 5431/5452), positive predictive value of 84.8% (68.1% to 94.9%; 28/33), and negative predictive value of 93.4% (92.7% to 94.0%; 5431/5814). The sensitivity in participants with an RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) of <18.3 (approximate viral loads >10(6) RNA copies/mL) was 90.9% (58.7% to 99.8%; 10/11), a Ct of <24.4 (>10(4) RNA copies/mL) was 69.4% (51.9% to 83.7%; 25/36), and a Ct of >24.4 (<10(4) RNA copies/mL) was 9.7% (1.9% to 23.7%; 3/34). LFT is likely to detect at least three fifths and at most 998 in every 1000 people with a positive RT-qPCR test result with high viral load. CONCLUSIONS: The Innova LFT can be useful for identifying infections among adults who report no symptoms of covid-19, particularly those with high viral load who are more likely to infect others. The number of asymptomatic adults with lower Ct (indicating higher viral load) missed by LFT, although small, should be considered when using single LFT in high consequence settings. Clear and accurate communication with the public about how to interpret test results is important, given the chance of missing some cases, even at high viral loads. Further research is needed to understand how infectiousness is reflected in the viral antigen shedding detected by LFT versus the viral loads approximated by RT-qPCR.","output":"Performance of the Innova SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid lateral flow test in the Liverpool asymptomatic testing pilot: population based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Approximately half of patients with cancer use some form of complementary medicine alongside conventional cancer treatment. The topic of complementary medicine often remains undiscussed in consultations between patients with cancer and their healthcare providers. This results in increased risks for adverse or interaction effects and decreased access to the benefits of evidence-based complementary medicine for patients with cancer. This paper describes the design of patient participatory study titled COMMON that aims to explore and enhance open and effective communication about complementary medicine in oncology. The study is carried out in collaboration with 12 (former) patients with breast cancer as coresearchers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study complies with the six steps of the intervention mapping framework. Three non-academic hospitals recruit participants (patients with cancer, oncology healthcare providers and managers) for interviews about the organisation, experiences and needs regarding complementary medicine. To assess communication about complementary medicine, recorded oncology consultations are analysed. For an overview of evidence-based complementary medicine available to patients with cancer, a review of reviews is conducted on the evidence on cancer patient-reported outcomes of complementary medicine frequently used by patients with cancer, supplemented with an online search and survey among organisations and persons providing complementary medicine to patients with cancer. Together, these steps generate input for the development of a toolbox that supports an open and effective discussion on complementary medicine in oncology. In a pilot study, acceptability and usability of the toolbox are assessed among patients with cancer and oncology healthcare providers. Dissemination of the toolbox is covered by the commitment of stakeholder parties.

METHODS We evaluated thermal spread of two VSDs in vitro using thin bovine muscle strips. Thermal injury was measured using an infrared camera, temperature probes and histology. The recordings were made with the VSD alone and with a rectangular clamp next to the VSD. RESULTS Both instruments showed a significant temperature spread of 2.5 mm lateral to the VSD. The placement of a metal clamp next to the VSD significantly reduced the temperature spread. Histological examinations were able to underline these findings. CONCLUSIONS In this study we describe a straightforward clinically relevant in vitro model for the evaluation of future electrosurgical instruments.

Methods We retrospectively evaluated 146 consecutive patients who, between February 2009 and July 2018, underwent emergency CE at Hiroshima University Hospital to detect the source of ongoing overt OGIB. Patients with a bleeding source located outside the small bowel were excluded. The remaining 127 patients were stratified according to the timing of CE relative to the onset of bleeding: patients in group A (n = 15, 12 men; mean age: 75 years; age range: 62-83 years) underwent CE within 48 hours of bleeding onset, whereas patients in group B (n = 112, 73 men; mean age: 65 years; age range: 17-88 years) underwent CE at >48 hours after bleeding onset. All patients underwent double-balloon endoscopy, and the final diagnosis was compared against the CE findings. Results The CE lesion detection rate was significantly higher in group A (12/15 patients, 80%) than in group B (53/112 patients, 47%) (p = 0.0174). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the patients' background characteristics. Vascular lesions were the most frequent finding in both groups.

Rapid development and spread of various multi drug-resistant strains of Mtb emphasize that an effective vaccine is still the most cost-effectives and efficient way of controlling and eradicating TB. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only licensed TB vaccine, still remains the most widely administered human vaccine, but is inefficient in protecting from pulmonary TB in adults. The protective immunity afforded by BCG is thought to wane with time and considered to last only through adolescent years. Heterologous boosting of BCG-primed immune responses using a subunit vaccine represents a promising vaccination approach to promote strong cellular responses against Mtb. In our earlier studies, we discovered lipopeptides of ESAT-6 antigen with strong potential as a subunit vaccine candidate. Here, we have investigated that potential as a booster to BCG vaccine in both a pre-exposure preventive vaccine and a post-exposure therapeutic vaccine setting. Surprisingly, our results demonstrated that boosting BCG with subunit vaccine shortly before Mtb challenge did not improve the BCG-primed immunity, whereas the subunit vaccine boost after Mtb challenge markedly improved the quantity and quality of effector T cell responses and significantly reduced Mtb load in lungs, liver and spleen in mice. These studies suggest that ESAT-6 lipopeptide-based subunit vaccine was ineffective in overcoming the apparent immunomodulation induced by BCG vaccine in Mtb uninfected mice, but upon infection, the subunit vaccine is effective in re-educating the protective immunity against Mtb infection. These important results have significant implications in the design and investigation of effective vaccine strategies and immunotherapeutic approaches for individuals who have been pre-immunized with BCG vaccine but still get infected with Mtb.","output":"Future Path Toward TB Vaccine Development: Boosting BCG or Re-educating by a New Subunit Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral and medical control measures are not effective in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Patients who work in the medical field, and who always get their medication from the same pharmacy, showed better perception towards pharmaceutical care services that might be provided to COVID-19 patients (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists had an unsatisfactory contribution to the management of the disease in outpatient settings. Moreover, there was a poor perception of the pharmacists role including their knowledge, communication skills and counselling skills. Thus, it is essential to improve pharmacists knowledge and practices about infectious diseases.","output":"Providing pharmaceutical care during the COVID-19 pandemic: attitudes and experiences of home-treated patients in Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Olfaction is a fundamental sense that plays a vital role in daily life in humans, and can be altered in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using conventional echo-planar-imaging (EPI) based sequences can be challenging in brain regions important for olfactory processing, such as the olfactory bulb (OB) and orbitofrontal cortex, mainly due to the signal dropout and distortion artifacts caused by large susceptibility effects from the sinonasal cavity and temporal bone. To date, few studies have demonstrated successful fMRI in the OB in humans. T2-prepared (T2prep) BOLD fMRI is an alternative approach developed especially for performing fMRI in regions affected by large susceptibility artifacts. The purpose of this technical study is to evaluate T2prep BOLD fMRI for olfactory functional experiments in humans. Olfactory fMRI scans were performed on 7T in 14 healthy participants. T2prep BOLD showed greater sensitivity than GRE EPI BOLD in the OB, orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole. Functional activation was detected using T2prep BOLD in the OB and associated olfactory regions. Habituation effects and a bi-phasic pattern of fMRI signal changes during olfactory stimulation were observed in all regions. Both positively and negatively activated regions were observed during olfactory stimulation. These signal characteristics are generally consistent with literature and showed a good intra-subject reproducibility comparable to previous human BOLD fMRI studies. In conclusion, the methodology demonstrated in this study holds promise for future olfactory fMRI studies in the OB and other brain regions that suffer from large susceptibility artifacts.","output":"Functional Activities Detected in the Olfactory Bulb and Associated Olfactory Regions in the Human Brain Using T2-Prepared BOLD Functional MRI at 7T"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory infectious disease caused by a newly discovered virus strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) This pandemic spread quickly across nations with a high mortality rate in immunocompromised patients This contagious disease posed a serious threat to health systems It impacted the continents of the earth in a way that could not have been predicted Therefore, many leading funding agencies announced the call for proposal to diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 pandemic using advanced technology-based methods, including nanotechnology The researchers coming from the nanotechnology community can contribute their efforts to cope with COVID-19 As a community member of nanotechnology, we suggest some new research targets that can be designed and improved, optimized, and developed the existing/new materials in the sub-field of diagnostics and healthcare of nanotechnology The potential research targets to fight against COVID-19 includes Point-of-care diagnostics (POCD), surveillance and monitoring, novel therapeutics, vaccine development, research, and development, repurposing existing drugs with potential therapeutic applications, development of antiviral nanocoating/antimicrobial spray-based coating for PPE, magnetic nanoparticles and viral RNA and rapid detection kits","output":"Contribution of Nanotechnology in the Fight Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Introduction: Intra-procedural rupture (IPR) of cerebral aneurysms is a serious complication of endovascular treatment (EVT) that is associated with high rate of mortality and poor outcomes. Therefore, it is important to identify the risk factors for aneurysmal IPR to improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the possible risk factors for aneurysmal IPR and discussed its management and outcomes for patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Methods: A total of 106 patients with cerebral aneurysm who have undergone EVT were included in this study, with a mean follow-up period of 17.2 months. Risk factors for IPR, such as the aneurysm's location, size and morphology, etc. were evaluated, and the chi-squared test was used for statistical analysis. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 15 months. RESULTS Results: Among all 106 patients who have undergone EVT, five (4.7%) had aneurysmal IPR as well as ruptured aneurysms with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Among those five patients, primary coiling was performed in three cases and balloon/stent-assisted coiling was performed in two cases, with complete occlusion of the aneurysmal sac achieved in four (4/5) patients. Clinical follow-up with the mRS scores of the patients revealed mortality in one patient (20%), favourable outcomes in three patients (60%) and unfavourable outcomes in one patient (20%). CONCLUSION Conclusion: Aneurysmal IPR is considered a rare but important complication of endovascular coiling that is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Several risk factors are significantly associated with IPR, such as small-sized aneurysm ( 3.5 mm), presence of bleb and parent vessel tortuosity. Acom location, irregular shape and past episode of SAH also increase the risk of IPR, but such association was found to be statistically insignificant in our study. Although IPR is considered a devastating complication, good clinical outcomes can be achieved with early detection and proper management using rapid aneurysmal coil packing and occlusion.","output":"Risk factor assessment and outcomes of intra procedural rupture of intracranial aneurysm during endovascular treatment: A race against time."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the researchers argue that the repercussions of the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic are taking a toll on rural women, not as a new phenomenon, but as an amplifier for their historical calamities dovetailed by climate change. The declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation ignited widespread pronouncements of national state of disasters in various countries around the globe including Zimbabwe. Subsequently, like other countries, Zimbabwe followed the precautionary measures outlined by the WHO and pronounced its national lockdown to curtail the transmission of the virus. This paper intends to demonstrate how convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change impacts serves as a double injustice for rural women in Nyanga communities, Zimbabwe. The study was qualitative in nature guided by the descriptive research design. Twenty participants comprising rural women and social workers were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The Thematic Content Analysis was followed to analyse the data from which the findings were derived. This study established that the COVID-19 pandemic is enhancing the catastrophic implications created by climate change on rural women whose food security systems are shattered, livelihood strategies maimed, caregiving roles burgeoning, and access to healthcare systems compromised. This daunting double impact is aggravated by gender inequalities, social exclusion and patriarchal dominance. The centrality of social justice to social work connotes that the profession has a tendentious responsibility to stand in the gap and liberate women from the jaws of these double catastrophes (climate change and COVID-19).","output":"Social Work Practice: Accounting for Double Injustices Experienced by Women Under the Confluence of Covid-19 Pandemic and Climate Change Impacts in Nyanga, Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the basic emotions generated by the COVID-19 pandemic is the fear of contacting this disease. The main aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Romanian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), based on classical test theory and item response theory, namely, graded response model. The FCV-19S was translated into Romanian following a forward-backward translation procedure. The reliability and validity of the instrument were assessed in a sample of 809 adults (34.6% males; M(age) = 32.61; SD 11.25; age range from 18 to 68 years). Results showed that the Romanian FCV-19S had very good internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha = .88; McDonalds omega = .89; composite reliability = .89). The confirmatory factor analysis for one-factor FCV-19S based on the maximum likelihood estimation method with Satorra-Bentler correction for non-normality proved that the model fitted well (CFI = .99, TLI = .97, RMSEA = .06, 90% CI [.05, .09], SRMR = .01). As for criterion-related validity, the fear of COVID-19 score correlated with depression (r = .25, p < .01), stress (r = .45, p < .01), resilience (r = ? .22, p < .01) and happiness (r = ?.33, p < .01). The heterotrait-monotrait criteria less than .85 certified the discriminant validity of the FCV-19S-RO. The GRM analysis highlighted robust psychometric properties of the scale and measurement invariance across gender. These findings emphasized validity for the use of Romanian version of FCV-19S and expanding the existing body of research on the fear of COVID-19. Overall, the current research contributes to the literature not only by validating the FCV-19S-RO but also by considering the positive psychology approach in the study of fear of COVID-19, emphasizing a negative relationship among resilience, happiness and fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Fear of COVID-19 in Romania: Validation of the Romanian Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale Using Graded Response Model Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the evolution of chemosensation via extended psychophysical testing in patients who suffered from sudden chemosensory loss due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: Prospective cohort study of patients with sudden chemosensory loss since February 2020 and confirmed COVID-19 infection via RT-PCR or serology testing. Olfactory function was tested extensively using the \\"Sniffin Sticks\\" test battery. In addition, we screened gustatory perception and nasal cooling sensations using psychophysical tests. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients completed the study. After a mean of 37 days, 37% of patients showed olfactory dysfunction, 7% were dysgeusic, and 48% showed signs of low sensitivity for cooling sensation. A longer duration of anosmia before smell improvement was correlated with lower olfactory function at 5 weeks. Odor threshold detection was more affected by COVID-19 compared to odor identification. CONCLUSION: Five weeks after developing sudden chemosensory loss due to COVID-19, a high proportion of patients were dysosmic and showed signs of low nasal cooling sensitivity, whereas most of them had normal taste function. SARS-CoV-2 affected mainly odor thresholds, possibly suggesting that the major cause of loss of smell lies at the level of the olfactory neuroepithelium, rather than in the central nervous system.","output":"Psychophysical evaluation of chemosensory functions 5 weeks after olfactory loss due to COVID-19: a prospective cohort study on 72 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biophysical properties of the tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV) coat protein (CP) make it possible to display foreign peptides on the surface of TMV.

The peptide RB19, which contains an arginine residue plus the 5B19 epitope fused to the CP (TMV-RB19), resulted in the induction of necrotic local lesions on inoculated leaves of N. tabacum Xanthi-nn and cell death of infected BY2 protoplasts.

In this systematic review, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. METHODS: We searched PubMed, BioMedCentral, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies comparing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring during the pandemic and a non-pandemic period. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool. The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation. Secondary endpoints were bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favourable neurological outcome. RESULTS: We identified six studies. In two studies, rates of return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge decreased significantly during the pandemic. Especially in Europe, bystander-witnessed cases, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation attempted by emergency medical services were reduced during the pandemic. Also, ambulance response times were significantly delayed across all studies and patients presenting with non-shockable rhythms increased in two studies. In 2020, 3.9-5.9% of tested patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 4.8-26% had suggestive symptoms (fever and cough or dyspnoea). CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests had worse short-term outcomes during the pandemic than a non-pandemic period suggesting direct effects of COVID-19 infection and indirect effects from lockdown and disruption of healthcare systems.

Contingency management (CM) is a behavioural intervention involving identification of target behaviours (such as attendance, abstinence, or steps towards recovery) and the provision of incentives (such as vouchers or credits towards the purchase of preferred items) contingent on objective evidence of these behaviours. Contingency management for abstinence and attendance in substance misuse treatment has a substantial evidence base but has not been widely adopted or extended to other addictive behaviours such as gambling. Potential barriers to the widespread adoption of CM may relate to practitioners perceptions about this form of incentive-based treatment. The present study sought to explore United Kingdom (UK) gambling treatment providers views of CM for treatment of problem gambling and gambling disorder. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 treatment providers from across the UK working with people with gambling problems. Participants were provided with an explanation of CM, several hypothetical scenarios, and a structured questionnaire to facilitate discussion. Thematic analysis was used to interpret findings. RESULTS: Participants felt there could be a conflict between CM and their treatment philosophies, that CM was similar in some ways to gambling, and that the CM approach could be manipulated and reduce trust between client and therapist. Some participants were more supportive of implementing CM for specific treatment goals than others, such as for incentivising attendance over abstinence due to perceived difficulties in objectively verifying abstinence. Participants favoured providing credits accruing to services relevant to personal recovery rather than voucher-based incentives. CONCLUSIONS: UK gambling treatment providers are somewhat receptive to CM approaches for treatment of problem gambling and gambling disorder. Potential barriers and obstacles are readily addressable, and more research is needed on the efficacy and effectiveness of CM for gambling.

In this study, we estimated the impact of delays in diagnosis on cancer survival outcomes in four major tumour types. METHODS: In this national population-based modelling study, we used linked English National Health Service (NHS) cancer registration and hospital administrative datasets for patients aged 15-84 years, diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and oesophageal cancer between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2010, with follow-up data until Dec 31, 2014, and diagnosed with lung cancer between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2012, with follow-up data until Dec 31, 2015. We use a routes-to-diagnosis framework to estimate the impact of diagnostic delays over a 12-month period from the commencement of physical distancing measures, on March 16, 2020, up to 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis. To model the subsequent impact of diagnostic delays on survival, we reallocated patients who were on screening and routine referral pathways to urgent and emergency pathways that are associated with more advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. We considered three reallocation scenarios representing the best to worst case scenarios and reflect actual changes in the diagnostic pathway being seen in the NHS, as of March 16, 2020, and estimated the impact on net survival at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis to calculate the additional deaths that can be attributed to cancer, and the total years of life lost (YLLs) compared with pre-pandemic data. FINDINGS: We collected data for 32a??583 patients with breast cancer, 24a??975 with colorectal cancer, 6744 with oesophageal cancer, and 29a??305 with lung cancer. Across the three different scenarios, compared with pre-pandemic figures, we estimate a 79-96% increase in the number of deaths due to breast cancer up to year 5 after diagnosis, corresponding to between 281 (95% CI 266-295) and 344 (329-358) additional deaths. For colorectal cancer, we estimate 1445 (1392-1591) to 1563 (1534-1592) additional deaths, a 153-166% increase; for lung cancer, 1235 (1220-1254) to 1372 (1343-1401) additional deaths, a 48-53% increase; and for oesophageal cancer, 330 (324-335) to 342 (336-348) additional deaths, 58-60% increase up to 5 years after diagnosis. For these four tumour types, these data correspond with 3291-3621 additional deaths across the scenarios within 5 years. The total additional YLLs across these cancers is estimated to be 59a??204-63a??229 years. INTERPRETATION: Substantial increases in the number of avoidable cancer deaths in England are to be expected as a result of diagnostic delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Urgent policy interventions are necessary, particularly the need to manage the backlog within routine diagnostic services to mitigate the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with cancer.

From a mechanical perspective, there are several rationales to assume that vitamin D positively modifies host responses to SARS-CoV-2, either in the early infection or subsequent hyper-inflammatory stages of COVID-19. It has been long known that vitamin D metabolites induce antiviral effects through indirect and direct mechanisms via antimicrobial peptides, immune modulation, the interaction between major viral and cellular particles, initiation of apoptosis and autophagy, and diversity of hereditary and epigenetic aspects. The remarkable overlap between the deficiency of vitamin D and risk factors for severe COVID-19, including obesity, aging, and Black or Asian ethnicity, has motivated researchers to assume that supplementation of vitamin D can be promising as a preventive or treatment agent for COVID-19. Since the outset of the pandemic, researchers have integrated literature searches and cross-sectional statistical studies to appraise the vitamin D level impact of COVID-19, whereby nearly 30 observational studies have confirmed that the incidence, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 are inversely related to the serum 25OHD concentrations. Also, some recently announced clinical trials indicated that vitamin D supplementation has a positive effect on the severity of COVID-19;however, other studies, including clinical trials, have not supported that, especially if we take into account what was revealed in a recent clinical trial, i.e., airway diseases are related to the irregular metabolism of vitamin D increasing the potential of developing vitamin D deficiency due to pulmonary inflammation. Therefore, more dedicated studies are required without critical limitations to ascertain the actual effect of vitamin D in preventing and treating COVID-19, and if its effectiveness is proven, the effective dose must be determined. ? 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

AIM: To describe characteristics of patients who died and the care they received, and to examine how patient characteristics, setting and visiting restrictions are related to provided care and evaluation of the dying process. DESIGN: An open observational online survey among healthcare professionals about their experience of end-of-life care that was provided to a patient with or without COVID-19 who died between March and July 2020. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals (nurses, physicians and others) in the Netherlands from all settings: home (n = 163), hospital (n = 249), nursing home (n = 192), hospice (n = 89) or elsewhere (n = 68). RESULTS: Of patients reported on, 56% had COVID-19. Among these patients, 358 (84.4%) also had a serious chronic illness. Having COVID-19 was negatively, and having a serious chronic illness was positively associated with healthcare staff's favourable appreciation of end-of-life care. Often there had been visiting restrictions in the last 2 days of life (75.8%). This was negatively associated with appreciation of care at the end of life and the dying process. Finally, care at the end of life was less favourably appreciated in hospitals and especially nursing homes, and more favourably in home settings and especially hospices. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic may be further optimised, especially in nursing homes and hospitals. Allowing at least some level of visits of relatives seems a key component.","output":"Dying in times of the coronavirus: An online survey among healthcare professionals about end-of-life care for patients dying with and without COVID-19 (the CO-LIVE study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India was one of the leading countries to implement the initial lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, but still, the lockdown failed and within a few months, India joined the list of countries most affected by the coronavirus epidemic Why did this transpire?

Adolescent girls are vulnerable to this event and experience more severe and long-standing adverse effects. Thus, this study aimed to examine major depressive symptoms and associated factors and the level of sexually transmitted infection among female adolescents evaluated for rape cases at Jimma Medical Center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescent girls assessed for rape cases in Jimma Medical Center. Data were collected using structured questionnaire and entered into Epi Data version 3.1 then exported to SPSS version 21.0 for analysis. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were carried out. RESULTS: A total of 174 raped adolescent females took part in the study. Of the total participants, 155 (89.1%) of these individuals had major depressive symptoms (95 CI %, 84.5C93.7%), while 85 (48.9%) of them had an STI (95% CI, 41.1C56.9%). From logistic regression, place of residence (AOR 14.65, 95%, (p=0.002)), attending school currently (AOR 9.01, 95%, p=0.004), raped by hitting (AOR 17.67, 95%, p<0.001) and unwanted pregnancy (AOR 14.68, 95%, p=0.001) were the variables associated with major depression. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that adolescents were suffering from several encumbrances like major depressive symptoms, sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancy. It also indicated that place of residence, school attending, and unwanted pregnancy had an association with major depressive symptoms. Therefore, the need for a comprehensive approach while treating this vulnerable group is highly recommended.","output":"Rape Survivors' Sorrow: Major Depressive Symptoms and Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Adolescent Girls, Southwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probiotics have been shown to bind to host receptors, which are important for pathogen adhesion and induce the hosts production of defence factors. They can activate the goblet-cell-derived production of mucins, a major component of the mucus layer and a physical barrier participating in limiting the proximity of microorganisms to the epithelial layer. In the last decade, Bacillus spp. strains have gained interest in human and animal health due to their tolerance and stability under gastrointestinal tract conditions. Moreover, Bacillus spp. strains can also produce various antimicrobial peptides that can support their use as commercial probiotic supplements and functional foods. The present study aimed to evaluate and determine the ability of selected Bacillus spp. strains to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F4 and to reduce binding of ETEC F4 to HT29-16E (mucus-secreting and goblet-like) human intestinal cells. Moreover, mucus production in the HT29 cells in the presence of the Bacillus spp. strains was quantified by ELISA. Bacillus spp. strains (CHCC 15076, CHCC 15516, CHCC 15541, and CHCC 16872) significantly inhibited the growth of ETEC F4. Moreover, the ability of the probiotic Bacillus spp. strains to stimulate mucin release was highly strain dependent. The treatment with Bacillus subtilis CHCC 15541 resulted in a significant increase of both MUC2 and MUC3 in HT29-16E cells. Therefore, this strain could be an up-and-coming candidate for developing commercial probiotic supplements to prevent infections caused by ETEC F4 and, potentially, other pathogens.","output":"Comparative Evaluation of the Antimicrobial and Mucus Induction Properties of Selected Bacillus Strains against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Editor's Note.-Articles in the RadioGraphics Update section provide current knowledge to supplement or update information found in full-length articles previously published in RadioGraphics.

Due to the lack of data about GC removal using advanced treatment processes, a novel paralleling and bubbling corona discharge reactor (PBCD) combined with iron-loaded activated-carbon fibre (Fe-ACF) was addressed in this study to degrade GCs represented by hydrocortisone (HC) and betamethasone (BT). The results showed that the PBCD-based system can degrade GCs effectively and can achieve effective sterilization. The removal rates of GCs were ranked as PBCD/Fe-ACF > PBCD/ACF > PBCD. The concentration of E. coli was reduced from 109 to 102 CFU/mL after 60 min of PBCD-based system treatment. The abundance of bacteria in actual hospital wastewater (HWW) was significantly reduced. Plasma changed the physical and chemical properties of ACF and Fe-ACF by etching axial grooves and enhancing stretching vibrations of surface functional groups, thus promoting adsorption and catalytic degradation. For GC degradation, the functional reactive species were identified as ?OH, 1O2, and ?O2 radicals. Possible degradation pathways for HC and BT were proposed, which mainly included defluorination, keto acid decarboxylation, demethylation, intramolecular cyclization, cleavage and ester hydrolysis, indicating a reduction in GC toxicity. Since GCs are widely used in patients with COVID-19 and their wastewater needs to be sterilized simultaneously, the intensive and electrically driven PBCD-based system is promising in GC pollution control and sterilization in terminal water treatment facilities.","output":"Simultaneous degradation of glucocorticoids and sterilization using bubbling corona discharge plasma based systems: a promising terminal water treatment facility for hospital wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 43-year-old male Bell 214C helicopter pilot presented to the emergency ward with flu-like syndrome.

However, in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional infectious disease surveillance failed to deliver a warning alert. The aim of this work is to develop search-engine-based surveillance methods for the early warning and prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks. Methods: By using more than 444 million Baidu search queries from China as training set, we collected 32 keywords from the Baidu Search Index that may related to COVID-19 outbreak from 18 December 2019 to 11 February 2020. The Beijing Xinfadi outbreak from 30 May 2020 to 30 July 2020 was used as independent test set. A multiple linear regression was applied to model the relationship between the daily query frequencies of keywords and the daily new cases. Findings: Our results show that 11 keywords in search queries were highly correlated to the daily numbers of confirmed cases (r =0.96, P <0.01). An abnormal initial peak (1.46 times the normal volume) in queries appeared on 31 December 2019, which could have served as an early warning signal for an outbreak. Of particular concern, on this day, the volume of the query Wuhan Seafood Market increased by over 240 times (from 10 to 2410), the volume of the query Wuhan outbreak increased by over 622 times (from 7 to 4359), and 17.5% of Chinas query volume originated from Hubei Province, 51.15% of which was from Wuhan city. The quantitative model using four keywords (Epidemic, Masks, Coronavirus and Clustered pneumonia) successfully predicted the daily numbers of cases for the next two days, and detected an early signal during the Beijing Xinfadi outbreak (R2 =0.80). Interpretation: Our study demonstrates the ability of search engine query data to detect COVID-19 outbreaks, and suggests that abnormalities in query volume can serve as early warning signals.","output":"Early Detection of COVID-19 Epidemic Using Search Engine Query Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital competence in education includes, amongst other things, the ability to create and manage content and information, mastery of communication tools, and solving technological problems The access to information and communication technologies (ICT) for educational purposes could have affected the academic performance of mathematics students prior to COVID-19 The objectives were to (1) analyze family and economic factors that could influence the use of ICT for educational purposes, and (2) determine what attributes of Melillas mathematics students could explain an additional variation in the use of ICT for academic purposes before COVID-19 A total of 2018 students at secondary schools in Melilla were included in this cross-sectional study A validated questionnaire with 14 questions regarding ICT and its uses and resources in mathematics learning was administered to students Statistical analysis revealed that 63 81% of students used ICT to study mathematics and 36 19% did not Of this percentage, 30 22% failed mathematics and 68 43% reported that ICT does not help them improve their grades The use of ICT to study mathematics was influenced by students perceptions of its usefulness for their academic performance and learning We also found an association with educational level and time spent on the Internet","output":"Uses and Resources of Technologies by Mathematics Students Prior to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has become a promising tool to estimate population-level changes in community infections and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease.

In this study, we validated a molecular testing method by concentrating viruses from wastewater using ultrafiltration and detecting SARS-CoV-2 using one-step RT-qPCR assay. The following parameters were optimized including sample storage condition, wastewater pH, RNA extraction and RT-qPCR assay by quantification of SARS-CoV-2 or spiked human coronavirus strain 229E (hCoV-229E). Wastewater samples stored at 4 C after collection showed significantly enhanced detection of SARS-CoV-2 with approximately 2C3 PCR-cycle threshold (Ct) values less when compared to samples stored at ?20 C. Pre-adjustment of the wastewater pH to 9.6 to aid virus desorption followed by pH readjustment to neutral after solid removal significantly increased the recovery of spiked hCoV-229E. Of the five commercially available RNA isolation kits evaluated, the MagMAX-96 viral RNA isolation kit showed the best recovery of hCoV-229E (50.1  20.1%).

From a resource perspective, creativity at work can be viewed as a high-intensity job demand, and organizations should encourage it by providing and managing employee resources. This study is an attempt to empirically investigate how competence and abusive supervision affect the relationship between procedural justice and creativity from the conservation of resources perspective. Findings from two-wave time-lagged survey data from 377 South Korean employees indicate that procedural justice increases creativity through the mediation of competence. Furthermore, abusive supervision has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between procedural justice and competence. The findings show that competence moderates the relationship between procedural justice and creativity and that the lower the level of abusive supervision, the greater the effect of procedural justice on competence and creativity.","output":"Creativity in the South Korean Workplace: Procedural Justice, Abusive Supervision, and Competence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiation emergency medicine (REM) systems are operated around the world to provide specialized care for injured individuals who require immediate medical attention in accidents.

This study focuses on outdoor falls within an urban community in Hong Kong. Urban environmental hazards are often place-specific and dependent upon the built features, landscape characteristics, and habitual activities. Therefore, falls must be examined with respect to local situations. RESULTS: This paper uses spatial analysis methods to map fall occurrences and examine possible environmental attributes of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong. The Nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) techniques can offer additional insights about the circumstances and environmental factors that contribute to falls. The results affirm the multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations and for selected groups of the population. CONCLUSION: The techniques to detect hot spots of falls yield meaningful results that enable the identification of high risk locations. The combined use of descriptive and spatial analyses can be beneficial to policy makers because different preventive measures can be devised based on the types of environmental risk factors identified. The analyses are also important preludes to establishing research hypotheses for more focused studies.","output":"Spatial analysis of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurately estimating the size of the undocumented immigrant population is a critical component of assessing the health and security risks of undocumented immigration to the United States. To provide one such estimate, we use data from the Mexican Migration Project (MMP), a study that includes samples of undocumented Mexican immigrants to the United States after their return to Mexico. Of particular interest are the departure and return dates of a sampled migrant's most recent sojourn in the United States, and the total number of such journeys undertaken by that migrant household, for these data enable the construction of data-driven undocumented immigration models. However, such data are subject to an extreme physical bias, for to be included in such a sample, a migrant must have returned to Mexico by the time of the survey, excluding those undocumented immigrants still in the United States.

Methods: We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (102,578 beds) certified by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine. Results: Acute (emergency) medicine physicians treated severe COVIDC19 patients in more than half of hospitals. Emergency medical teams consisted of acute medicine physicians and other specialists. Frontline acute care physicians were concerned about their risk of infection in 80% of hospitals, and experienced stress due to a lack of personal protective equipment. TwentyCsix of the 143 hospitals that had a mental health check/consultation system in place indicated that there was a doctor who experienced mental health problems. Of the 37 hospitals without a system, only one hospital was aware of the presence of a doctor complaining of mental health problems.

This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. Methods: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Results: Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression.

Drawing on a survey of 166 Egyptian agri-food SMEs, this study investigates differences in- and determinants of COVID-19 business risk perception among these enterprises. The empirical results showed that risk perception was highly asymmetric across geographical regions. Enterprises with longer cash flow coverage periods and higher values of total assets perceived significantly lower risk levels, as cash and assets functioned as a buffer against the impact of COVID-19. The findings of the study imply that the just-in-time approach and the absence of a proactive and preventative stance to risk management reduced the resilience of agri-food SMEs to the risks presented by the pandemic. Generally, enterprises that operate both in domestic and export markets perceived lower COVID-19 risks. Finally, the main export destination to which the surveyed enterprises export was a significant determinant of their risk perception. These findings could be useful to managers of agri-food businesses in terms of better understanding of risks and promotion of risk management practices. More so, they can help design effective policy interventions to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on Egyptian agri-food SMEs and build up their resilience to future pandemics and shocks","output":"Risk perception and determinants in small- and medium-sized agri-food enterprises amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Since 23rd January 2020, the Chinese government has imposed restrictive measures including self-isolation, travel restrictions and lockdown of Wuhan city in order to prevent the incoming waves of COVID-19 outbreak in the country. However, the impact of mental health and stress concerns on relationship and sexuality amidst the COVID-19 lockdown was currently unclear. Aim The cross-sectional study was designed to determine the changes in health, relationship and sexuality among the Chinese couples who lived together amid the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods Participants of Chinese nationality aged 18 years were asked to complete a self-administered online questionnaire regarding sexuality behaviour and impact of event scale (IES) in March 2020. Non-random sampling was used for participant recruitment. Also assessed were sociodemographic data including sex, age, employment, region, sexual dysfunction, and whether participants tested positive for COVID-19. Outcomes IES score, frequency of sexual intercourse per week, quality of usual sex life, emotional bonding and duration of relationship were measured. Results A total of 1139 participants (i.e., 735 males and 404 females) were included in the study. Mean age and IES of participants was 33.69.5 years and 27.48.6, respectively. Being male was significantly associated with increased frequency of sexual intercourse amid the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.012). Also, participants with an IES score &lt;26 were more likely to report that they had increased frequency of sexual intercourse per week (P&lt;0.001) and the COVID-19 pandemic had positively affected the quality of their usual sex lives (P&lt;0.001). On the other hand, participants with IES score 26 were more likely to report that the COVID-19 pandemic had positively affected their emotional bonding (P&lt;0.001). Clinical implications Frequency of sexual intercourse and quality of sex life in participants who experienced high stressful impact were more likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strengths and limitations This was one of the first studies to assess sexual behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese adults. Since participants were asked to self-report their sexual behaviour, this potentially introduced self-reporting and recall bias into our findings. Conclusions Our study reported that despite the moderate-to-severe stressful impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority reported no significant changes in the frequency of their sexual intercourse per week, quality of their usual sexual lives and emotional bonding.","output":"The impact of mental health and stress concerns on relationship and sexuality amidst the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The efficacy of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is controversial. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether skeletonized left internal mammary artery (LIMA) mobilization contributes to the development of severe adhesions, which will affect what type of lung surgery (open or closed procedure) will be required in the future. METHODS Eight patients (mean age 73.9 years) with previous CABG surgery using a LIMA to left anterior descending (LAD) graft underwent left-sided lobectomy for operable non-small cell lung carcinoma. RESULTS The lobectomy by thoracotomy rate was 62.5% (5 patients), generally in patients with tumors in the left upper lobe or in patients post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, while the video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy rate was 37.5% (3 patients). Mean hospital stay was 8.3 days. There was no mortality or major morbidity, apart from six minor complications in four patients (50%) (air leak, atrial fibrillation, atelectasis, pneumonia). CONCLUSIONS Patients with operable non-small cell lung carcinoma following CABG surgery who need left upper lobe resection do not benefit from the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery technique due to significant adhesions between the LIMA to LAD graft and the lung. The method of preserving a small portion of the lung on the LIMA to LAD graft may help during left upper lobe resections.

The resulting hybrid, serologically A-like/Tn (T-nouvelle) structure potentially acts as a hostCpathogen functional molecular bridge. In humans, this intermediate structure will hypothetically be replaced by ABO(H) blood group-specific, mucin-type structures, in the case of infection hybrid epitopes, implicating the phenotypically glycosidic accommodation of plasma proteins. The virus may, by mimicking the synthetic pathways of the ABO(H) blood groups, bind to the cell surfaces of the blood group O(H) by formation of a hybrid H-type antigen as the potential precursor of hybrid non-O blood groups, which does not affect the highly anti-glycan aggressive anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinin activities, exerted by the germline-encoded nonimmune immunoglobulin M (IgM). In the non-O blood groups, which have developed from the H-type antigen, these IgM activities are downregulated by phenotypic glycosylation, while adaptive immunoglobulins might arise in response to the hybrid A and B blood group structures, bonds between autologous carbohydrates and foreign peptides, suggesting the exertion of autoreactivity. The non-O blood groups thus become a preferred target for the virus, whereas blood group O(H) individuals, lacking the A/B phenotype-determining enzymes and binding the virus alone by hybrid H-type antigen formation, have the least molecular contact with the virus and maintain the critical anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinin activities, exerted by the ancestral IgM, which is considered the humoral spearhead of innate immunity.","output":"Why Blood Group A Individuals Are at Risk Whereas Blood Group O Individuals Might Be Protected from SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Infection: A Hypothesis Regarding How the Virus Invades the Human Body via Abo(H) Blood Group-Determining Carbohydrates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care tests (POCT) for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were implemented in emergency departments of all hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark in 2018. AIM: To establish whether POC testing for influenza viruses or RSV is based on a valid respiratory symptom indication, whether changes in patient management based on a positive result are safe and whether syndromic POC testing may benefit patients with influenza or RSV. METHODS: Samples from 180 children (< 18 years) and 375 adults tested using POCT between February and July 2018 were retested for 26 respiratory pathogens. Diagnosis, indication for POC testing, hospitalisation time, antimicrobial therapy and readmission or death within one month of testing were obtained from patient records. RESULTS: A valid indication for POC testing was established in 168 (93.3%) of children and 334 (89.1%) of adults. A positive POCT result significantly reduced antibiotic prescription and median hospitalisation time by 44.3 hours for adults and 14.2 hours for children, and significantly increased antiviral treatment in adults. Risk of readmission or death was not significantly altered by a positive result. Testing for 26 respiratory pathogens established that risk of coinfection is lower with increasing age and that POCT for adults should be restricted to the influenza and RSV season. CONCLUSION: Positive POCT resulted in changed patient management for both children and adults, and was deemed safe.

We aimed to explore the seroprevalence of hospital staff in the area with zero confirmed COVID-19 case to shed light on the situation of COVID-19 infection in zero or low infection rate countries where mass screening was not readily available. METHODS: A locally developed rapid immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin G (IgG) test kit was used for hospital staff screening of Ranong hospital which is located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from 17th April to 17th May 2020. All staff was tested, 100 of which were randomly invited to have a repeating antibody test in one month. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002). RESULTS: Of 844 hospital staff, 82 were tested twice one month apart (response rate for repeating antibody test 82%). Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive IgM, none had positive IgG. Female staff had 1.0% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.5-2.1%) while male had 0.5% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.1-2.6%). No participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptoms and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between SARS-CoV-2 IgM status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, close contact with PCR-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 antibody test could detect a considerable number of hospital staff who could be potential silent spreaders in a province with zero COVID-19 cases.

Dose of hydroxychloroquine was selected as per body weight of the subject. Primary end point was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change at week 12 from baseline. Secondary endpoint was change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post prandial plasma glucose (PPG), body weight and any adverse reaction including no of hypoglycemic events, as well as a change in the percentage of subjects with A1C < 7.0% and > 6.5% after 12 weeks of treatment.. In follow-up of 400 mg once daily was once again divided to 200 mg twice daily (BD) to study the effect on tolerability profile for further 12 weeks. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine was associated with significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline (7C8.5%) in 12 weeks ?0.78%, ?0.91% and 1.2% for hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg OD, respectively, versus 0.13% with placebo (P < 0.005).

Past studies have shown that the perceived susceptibility, the perceived severity of being afflicted with life-threatening diseases, and the perceived benefits of using a facemask are predictors of a persons use of a facemask. However, I argue that people wear a facemask not merely for infection prevention, and various sociocultural reasons have been motivating people to wear (and not wear) a facemask. Facemasks thus have sociocultural implications for people. Research on the sociocultural meanings of facemasks is scant, and even less is known on how the shifting sociocultural meanings of facemasks are related to the changing social environment, which, I argue, serve as remarkable underlying factors for people using (and not using) facemasks. As new infectious diseases such as avian influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have been emerging, threatening peoples health worldwide, and because facemasks have been documented to have substantial efficacy in the prevention of infection transmission, understanding the sociocultural meanings of facemasks has significant implications for public health policymakers and health care providers in designing a socially and culturally responsive public health and infection control policy for the community. METHODS: A qualitative research design involving the use of 40 individual, in-depth semistructured interviews and a phenomenological analysis approach were adopted. RESULTS: The sociocultural meanings of the facemask have been undergoing constant change, from positive to negative, which resulted in the participants displaying hesitation in using a facemask in the post-SARS era. Because it represents a violation of societal ideologies and traditional Chinese cultural beliefs, the meanings of the facemask that had developed during the SARS outbreak failed to be sustained in the post-SARS era. CONCLUSION: The changes in meaning not only influenced the participants perceptions of the facemask but also influenced their perceptions of people who use facemasks, which ultimately influenced their health behavior, preventing them from using facemasks in the post-SARS era. These findings have critical implications for designing a culturally responsive infection prevention and facemask usage policy in the future.","output":"Qualitative study on the shifting sociocultural meanings of the facemask in Hong Kong since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak: implications for infection control in the post-SARS era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, US patients and clinicians have endured medication shortages of nearly every class, including many lifesaving medications These shortages have persisted despite determined efforts by federal, academic, and professional organizations Medication shortages have resulted in lost lives, medication errors, and substantial financial cost Economic drivers are the primary cause for drug shortages, exacerbated by manufacturing and quality problems, and unreliable and uncertain sources for many raw materials required to synthesize these drugs Drug shortages force clinicians to make untenable choices and decide which of their patients should receive a lifesaving scarce medication The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many hospitals ability to provide basic care and aggravated existing drug shortages The influx of patients suffering from COVID-19 has exposed flaws in the fractured manner in which essential medications reach patients The unique nature of COVID-19, often requiring prompt and decisive clinical decision-making, challenges the accepted approach for ethical analysis adopted by clinical ethicists The author, a clinician and bioethicist, notes the ethical challenges he and other frontline providers have faced in deciding which patients are more deserving of a scarce medication ?

Repurposed anti-viral drugs have played a huge role in combating the virus, and most recently, dexamethasone (Dex) have shown its therapeutic activity in severe cases of COVID-19 patients. The study sought to provide insights on the anti-COVID-19 mechanism of Dex at both atomic and molecular level against SARS-CoV-2 targets. Computational methods were employed to predict the binding affinity of Dex to SARS-CoV-2 using the Schrodinger suite (v2020-2). The target molecules and ligand (Dex) were retrieved from PDB and PubChem, respectively. The selected targets were SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), and host secreted molecules glucocorticoid receptor, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Critical analyses such as Protein and ligand preparation, molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), and toxicity analyses were performed using the targets and the ligand as inputs. Dex showed stronger affinity to its theoretical (glucocorticoid) receptor with a superior docking score of -14.7 and a good binding energy value of -147.48 kcal/mol; while short hydrogen bond distances were observed in both Mpro and IL-6 when compared to glucocorticoid receptor. Based on these findings, Dex-target complexes were used to perform MD simulations to analyze Dex stability at 50 ns.

Prior studies have shown that the majority of patients with fragility fracture are not treated for underlying osteoporosis. Our hospitalist-led co-management service for patients with acute hip fracture had no system for evaluating and treating osteoporosis in this cohort. Our objective was to implement a fracture liaison service (FLS) to assist patients with acute hip fracture and assess subsequent impact on diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. METHODS We conducted a pre-post study design at our tertiary academic center, including patients >50 years old hospitalized with acute hip fracture. We implemented a FLS, whereby all patients received endocrinology consultation. Outcome measures included the proportion of patients evaluated for osteoporosis by time of hospital discharge, comparing pre-implementation (12 months) and post-implementation (9 months) cohorts. We also measured the proportions of patients evaluated for and offered treatment for osteoporosis within three months of discharge for patients with post-discharge encounters visible in the medical record. RESULTS We identified 167 patients before and 124 after FLS implementation. In univariate analysis, the proportion of patients evaluated for osteoporosis before discharge increased from 0.6% to 72.6% (p<0.001) pre- vs. post-implementation. The proportion of patients offered osteoporosis treatment within three months after discharge increased from 25.3% to 46.3% (p=0.01).

Professionals involved in the care, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-infected patients have been subject to emotional and physical distress that can potentially enhance the development of occupational diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of burnout among Portuguese radiographers. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, quantitative study. Burnout levels were estimated using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey, composed of 22 questions. Specific questions were developed to characterize the socio-demographic situation and the impact of the pandemic on the radiographers. Data were descriptively analyzed and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for correlation analysis. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 386 radiographers, 68.7% of whom where female and 31.3% male. The mean sample age was 36.3 (9.1) years. A total of 43.5% and 45.5% of subjects had a high level of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, respectively, and 59.8% experienced low personal accomplishment. Altogether, 23.3% of study participants were at high risk of burnout in the three dimensions assessed and 77.2% in at least one. CONCLUSION: Study results showed that radiographers were at high risk of developing burnout in the COVID-19 pandemic setting. Health institutions should actively monitor these professional's mental health and develop restorative strategies that enable their emotional wellbeing, preventing absenteeism and increasing patients' quality of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Burnout of health professionals has a strong impact on health services organization, resulting in increased absenteeism and error probability, frequent work delays, low productivity and job satisfaction, inter- and intra-professional conflicts, high job turnover, high job quit, and decreased quality of care perceived by users.","output":"Burnout among Portuguese radiographers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, like much of the rest of the world, we went into lockdown A week into our new reality, we decided to do a survey study about how people were experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic In this piece, we describe what motivated us to do the study, how we went about it, and what others can learn from our experiences","output":"From Zero to a National Data Set in 2 Weeks: Reflections on a COVID-19 Collaborative Survey Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Limited information is available about the present characteristics and dynamic clinical changes that occur in patients with COVID-19 during the early phase of the illness.

METHODS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients with COVID-19 who were released from quarantine until April 30, 2020, in Korea. A total of 5628 patients were included in the training and testing cohorts to train and validate the models that predict clinical severity and the duration of hospitalization, and the clinical severity score was defined at four levels: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. RESULTS: Out of a total of 5601 patients, 4455 (79.5%), 330 (5.9%), 512 (9.1%), and 301 (5.4%) were included in the mild, moderate, severe, and critical levels, respectively. As risk factors for predicting critical patients, we selected older age, shortness of breath, a high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, a low lymphocyte count, and a low platelet count. We developed 3 prediction models to classify clinical severity levels. For example, the prediction model with 6 variables yielded a predictive power of >0.93 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We developed a web-based nomogram, using these models.

It involves extracting cough episodes from audios of a diverse real-world noisy conditions and then screening for the COVID-19 infection based on the cough characteristics. The proposed algorithm was developed and evaluated using self-recorded cough audios collected from COVID-19 patients monitored by Biovitals?

In this study, going out in public amidst the spread of COVID-19 infections was investigated by examining new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive cases of COVID-19 and its relationship to four indicators of people going out in public (the people flow, the index of web searches for going outside, the number of times people browse restaurants, and the number of hotel guests, from the Regional Economic and Social Analysis System (V-RESAS). Two waves of COVID-19 infections were examined using cross-correlation analysis. In the first wave, all four indicators of going out changed to be opposite the change in new PCR positive cases, showing a lag period of C1 to +6 weeks. In the second wave, the same relationship was only observed for the index of web searches for going outside, and two indicators showed the positive lag period of +6 to +12 weeks after the change in new PCR positive cases. Moreover, each indicator in the second wave changed differently compared to the first wave. The complexity of peoples behaviors around going out increased in the second wave, when policies and campaigns were implemented and peoples attitudes were thought to have changed.

Like all cells in the mononuclear phagocytic system, macrophages and microglia constitutively express the poliovirus receptor, CD155. Besides myeloid cells, CD155 is widely upregulated ectopically in the neoplastic compartment of malignant gliomas (and solid cancers in general). Intratumor treatment with the highly attenuated rhino:poliovirus chimera, PVSRIPO, yielded long-term survival with durable radiographic responses in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (Desjardins et al. New England Journal of Medicine, 2018). Here, we studied mechanisms of PVSRIPO immunotherapy in mouse brain tumor models to decipher contributions of myeloid vs. malignant cells to antitumor efficacy. PVSRIPO treatment caused intense engagement of the GAMM infiltrate associated with substantial, but transient tumor regression. This was accompanied by diffuse microglia activation and proliferation in the normal central nervous system (CNS) surrounding the tumor, extending to the ipsilateral and even the contralateral hemispheres. PVSRIPO-instigated microglia activation occurred against a backdrop of sustained innate antiviral inflammation, associated with induction of the PD-L1 immune checkpoint on GAMM. Combining PVSRIPO with PD1/PD-L1 blockade led to durable remissions. Our work implicates GAMM as active drivers of PVSRIPO-induced antitumor inflammation and reveals profound and widespread neuroinflammatory activation of the CNS-resident myeloid compartment by PVSRIPO.","output":"Polio Virotherapy of Malignant Glioma Engages the Tumor Myeloid Infiltrate and Induces Diffuse Microglia Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growing adoption of intelligent technologies has brought us to a crossroad.

DESIGN: Five sequential cross-sectional age, sex and province-weighted population-based samples who completed online surveys. SETTING: Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 15 019 Canadians aged 18 years and over were recruited through a recognised polling firm (Leger Opinion). Respondents were 51.5% female with a mean age of 48.1 (SD 17.2) years (range 18C95 years) and predominantly white (80.8%). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of vaccine hesitancy over the five surveys (time points) and their sociodemographic, clinical and psychological correlates. RESULTS: A total of 42.2% of respondents reported some degree of vaccine hesitancy, which was lowest during surveys 1 (April 2020) and 5 (March 2021) and highest during survey 3 (November 2020). Fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that women, those aged 50 and younger, non-white, those with high school education or less, and those with annual household incomes below the poverty line in Canada were significantly more likely to report vaccine hesitancy, as were essential and healthcare workers, parents of children under the age of 18 and those who do not get regular influenza vaccines. Endorsing prevention behaviours as important for reducing virus transmission and high COVID-19 health concerns were associated with 77% and 54% reduction in vaccine hesitancy, respectively. Having high personal financial concerns was associated with 1.33 times increased odds of vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the importance of targeting vaccine efforts to specific groups by emphasising the outsized health benefits compared with risks of vaccination.

We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 M, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) and 100-fold reductions in Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 100 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.","output":"The folate antagonist methotrexate diminishes replication of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and enhances the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in cell culture models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2, the last isolated human beta-coronavirus, has revolutionized modern knowledge of the pathogenesis of viral pneumonia.

The first one is aimed to test antiviral molecules already present in therapeutic use, with a mechanism of an action directed towards viral proteins functional to replication or adsorption; the second one, it is the repositioning of molecules with known pharmacological activity for which various chemistry studies have been prepared in an attempt to find new and specific viral targets; the third, it is the search for molecules of natural origin for which to demonstrate a specific anti-coronavirus activity. Many databases of natural and synthetic substances have been used for the identification of potent inhibitors of various viral targets. The field of computer-aided drug design seems to be promising and useful for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors; hence, different structure- and ligand-based computational approaches have been used for their identification. This review analyzes in-depth and critically the most recent publications in the field of applied computational chemistry to find out molecules of natural origin with potent antiviral activity.

This leads to the expression of the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) which provokes pathological changes in both the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. Accumulating evidence suggests that mHTT can spread between cells of the CNS but here, we explored the possibility that mHTT could also propagate and cause pathology via the bloodstream. For this, we used a parabiosis approach to join the circulatory systems of wild-type (WT) and zQ175 mice. After surgery, we observed mHTT in the plasma and circulating blood cells of WT mice and post-mortem analyses revealed the presence of mHTT aggregates in several organs including the liver, kidney, muscle and brain. The presence of mHTT in the brain was accompanied by vascular abnormalities, such as a reduction of Collagen IV signal intensity and altered vessel diameter in the striatum, and changes in expression of Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65-67) in the cortex. Conversely, we measured reduced pathology in zQ175 mice by decreased mitochondrial impairments in peripheral organs, restored vessel diameter in the cortex and improved expression of Dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 (DARPP32) in striatal neurons. Collectively, these results demonstrate that circulating mHTT can disseminate disease, but importantly, that healthy blood can dilute pathology.

METHODS: In between 10 December 2020 and 9 February 2021, an online survey was organized in nine low- and middle-income countries. In total 10,183 adults (median age 45 years, interquartile range 33C57 years, range 18C93 years), including 6470 from Brazil, 1738 Malaysia, 1124 Thailand, 230 Bangladesh, 219 DR Congo, 159 Benin, 107 Uganda, 81 Malawi and 55 from Mali participated in the study. COVID-19 testing/infection status was assessed by self-report. RESULTS: Of the 10,183 participants, 40.3% had ever tested for COVID-19, 7.3% tested positive, and 33.0% tested negative. In an adjusted logistic regression model, predisposing factors (residing in Brazil, postgraduate education), enabling/disabling factors (urban residence, higher perceived economic status, being a student or worker in the health care sector, and moderate or severe psychological distress), and need factors (having at least one chronic condition) increased the odds of COVID-19 testing. Among those who were tested, participants residing in Bangladesh, those who had moderate to severe psychological distress were positively associated with COVID-19 positive diagnosis. Participants who are residing in Malaysia and Thailand, and those who had higher education were negatively associated with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis. Considering all participants, higher perceived economic status, being a student or worker in the health sector, and moderate or severe psychological distress were positively associated with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis, and residing in Malaysia, Thailand or five African countries was negatively associated with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis. CONCLUSION: A high rate of COVID-19 testing among adults was reported in nine low-and middle-income countries. However, access to testing needs to be increased in Africa. Moreover, COVID-19 testing programmes need to target persons of lower economic status and education level who are less tested but most at risk for COVID-19 infection.","output":"Using Andersens model of health care utilization to assess factors associated with COVID-19 testing among adults in nine low-and middle-income countries: an online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent findings indicated that SARS-CoV-2 related neurological manifestations involve cytokine release syndrome along with endothelial activation, blood brain barrier dysfunction, and immune\\\\mediated mechanisms.

A shortage of the drug in 2021 created a dilemma for those needing to perform the euthanasia procedure in animals facing negative welfare conditions. The reason for the shortage was attributed to chemical production issues. The veterinary community worked together to conserve what euthanasia drug was available, and to identify alternative methods that could be quickly implemented, while still adhering to safety and efficacy requirements. Through collaborative efforts, useful guidelines were created and shared with a variety of animal industries to ensure euthanasia procedures could still be facilitated when necessary. While pentobarbital sodium has increased in availability in 2022, lessons have been learned to support animal care should the shortage occur again. ABSTRACT: In 2021, a shortage in the supply of the euthanasia drug pentobarbital sodium affected animal care professionals around the world, including in the United States and Canada. Pentobarbital sodium is the drug of choice for companion animal euthanasia in both countries. The decreased availability of pentobarbital sodium affected a number of animal care industries, forcing conservation of the drug and the use of alternative methods and other agents to facilitate humane death for all manner of animal species. Veterinary medical groups, laboratory research institutions, and the animal sheltering industry worked together to identify the best path forward to maintain routine euthanasia practices and to protect the welfare of animals. This article aims to explore the reasons behind the shortage and to highlight the necessary responses and adjustments made in order to continue providing euthanasia services in North America. Recommendations for handling future pentobarbital shortages are included.","output":"Lessons and Recommendations from a Pentobarbital Shortage: US and Canada 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate stress levels among the health care workers (HCWs) of the radiation oncology community in Asian countries. METHODS: HCWs of the radiation oncology departments from 29 tertiary cancer care centers of Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Nepal were studied from May 2020 to July 2020. A total of 758 eligible HCWs were identified. The 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, and 22-Item Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used for assessing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to identify the causative factors affecting mental health. RESULTS: A total of 758 participants from 794 HCWs were analyzed. The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-28). The incidence of moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress was 34.8%, 31.2%, and 18.2%, respectively. Severe personal concerns were noticed by 60.9% of the staff. On multivariate analysis, the presence of commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 during the previous 2 weeks, contact history (harzard ratio [HR], 2.04; CI, 1.15 to 3.63), and compliance with precautionary measures (HR, 1.69; CI, 1.19 to 2.45) for COVID-19 significantly predicted for increasing anxiety (HR, 2.67; CI, 1.93 to 3.70), depression (HR, 3.38; CI 2.36 to 4.84), and stress (HR, 2.89; CI, 1.88 to 4.43) (P < .001). A significant regional variation was also noticed for anxiety, stress, and personal concerns. CONCLUSION: This survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a significant proportion of HCWs in the radiation oncology community experiences moderate to severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. This trend is alarming and it is important to identify and intervene at the right time to improve the mental health of HCWs to avoid any long-term impacts.","output":"Multinational Study to Assess Stress Levels Among the Health Care Workers of Radiation Oncology Community at the Outset of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In urban areas, road transportation is the main source of pollutants, and weather impacts spatiotemporal variation of air quality. In this paper, we demonstrate the spatiotemporal variabilities of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and NO2 in the south of Paris, with an emphasis on the comparison of air pollutant levels between COVID-19 lockdown and non-lockdown days according to meteorological conditions. The influence of COVID-19 lockdowns could be region-specific. Thus, it is worthwhile to conduct investigations across different regions and via different methodologies. This manuscript contains data that could be relied upon to evaluate available options for mitigation of urban air pollution. Using Airparif data and mobile survey data collected by Aeroqual 500 sensors, this study confirms that road traffic seems to be the determining factor of air quality in the southern part of Paris. The daily average concentrations of NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 calculated in 2020 show a strong spatiotemporal variability explained by the type of weather on the one hand and by the proximity of emission sources on the other hand. Mobile surveys show that during lockdowns in 2020, when the weather was stable, in 13th arrondissement of Paris, NO2 values exceeded 250 g/m3 with PM10 values over 70 g/m3, mainly in three locations: the area between Rue Tolbiac and Rue Nationale, along Rue de Chevaleret, and on Boulevard Priphrique.","output":"Spatiotemporal Variation of Air Quality (PM and NO2) in Southern Paris during COVID-19 Lockdown Periods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are currently the greatest global health burden. The coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having an adverse impact on people's mental health, particularly in vulnerable populations, such as refugees. AIMS: The present study was designed to examine the association between COVID-19 and changes in mental health in Syrian refugees in Turkey. METHOD: We conducted a two-wave panel survey of a representative sample of 302 of the estimated 500 000 Syrian refugees (ages 18 and older) living under humanitarian support in Istanbul (first wave between 9 and 15 July 2020 and the follow-up between 11 and 14 September 2020). We administered seven items from the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey in addition to one-context specific item about life changes because of COVID-19, and measures of depression (10-item Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale, CESD-10), anxiety (6-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI-6) and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-4). RESULTS: A factor analysis yielded three COVID-19 factors, labelled social relationships, stress and hope. We conducted a series of cross-lag panel analyses to test associations between the COVID-19 factors and mental health. We found associations between all COVID-19 factors and CESD-10, between COVID-19 stress and STAI-6, and between COVID-19 stress and COVID-19 hope and PSS-4.

Though nonpharmacological measures are crucial for management, their implementation is questionable. Hence, this study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications on QoL among uncontrolled hypertensives and diabetics in rural India. METHODS: An interventional study was done in 3 villages with 100 participants each, where village one received lifestyle modification as intervention and village two physical activity and village three control receiving standard care. The baseline data included socio-demographic characteristics such as awareness of hypertension, diabetes, lifestyle pattern and physical activity, and WHO QoL. The participants were trained, followed up, and assessed after 12 months following intervention. QoL scores between groups and pre- and post-intervention in the group were compared using MannCWhitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively. RESULTS: In this study, there was a significant improvement in overall QoL and in all the four domains, namely physical, psychological, social relationship, and environmental domains in both the intervention villages.

Viral aetiology is the most common. Among bacterial causes, the main agent is Streptococcus pyogenes or group A -haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes 5%-30% of the episodes. In the diagnostic process, clinical assessment scales can help clinicians to better predict suspected bacterial aetiology by selecting patients who should undergo a rapid antigen detection test. If these techniques are not performed, an overdiagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis often occurs, resulting in unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics, most of which are broad spectrum. Consequently, management algorithms that include the use of predictive clinical rules and rapid tests have been set up. The aim of the treatment is speeding up symptom resolution, reducing the contagious time span and preventing local suppurative and non-suppurative complications. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of pharyngitis. The association of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not indicated as the initial treatment of acute infection. Neither are macrolides indicated as first-line therapy; they should be reserved for patients allergic to penicillin.

To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures - including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing - may be required to reduce transmission. Using a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40,162 UK participants, we simulated the impact of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing and physical distancing scenarios. As well as estimating reduction in effective reproduction number, we estimated, for a given level of COVID-19 incidence, the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated that combined testing and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone (50-65% compared to 2-30%). If limits are placed on gatherings outside of home/school/work (e.g. maximum of 4 daily contacts in other settings), then manual contact tracing of acquaintances only could have a similar effect on transmission reduction as detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where there were 10,000 new symptomatic cases per day, we estimated in most contact tracing strategies, 140,000 to 390,000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimates that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number that is below one in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control.","output":"Effectiveness of isolation, testing, contact tracing and physical distancing on reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV?2 pandemic represents a great challenge worldwide not only under the aspect of treatment but also of prevention.

Firstly, the analysis of the interviews provided insight into the social function of work. Work creates feelings of connection and belonging;however, it can also create the opposite, negatively affecting our experience of leisure time, our productivity, and our well-being. Participants described how paid work provided structure and routine, which resulted in an increased feeling of subjective well-being. However, a lack of structure and routine during the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected feelings of \\"usefulness\\" and \\"productivity\\". Secondly, an increase in leisure time created more opportunities for autonomy, leading to more unforced leisure activities and a better balance between work and self. Moreover, an increase in autonomy could be achieved through both increased work flexibility and a shorter working week. Lastly, this study aimed to demonstrate that more leisure time during lockdown periods can change how we spend our free time, therefore resulting in more pro-environmental consumer behaviour.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: COVID-19 convalescent plasma from 18 donors was collected longitudinally for a maximum of 63-129 days following resolution of symptoms. All the samples were initially screened by the Ortho total Ig test to confirm positivity and subsequently tested with seven additional direct sandwich or indirect binding assays (Ortho, Roche, Abbott, Broad Institute) directed against a variety of antigen targets (S1, receptor binding domain, and nucleocapsid [NC]), along with two neutralization assays (Broad Institute live virus PRNT and Vitalant Research Institute [VRI] Pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization [RVPN]). RESULTS: The direct detection assays (Ortho total Ig total and Roche total Ig) showed increasing levels of antibodies over the time period, in contrast to the indirect IgG assays that showed a decline. Neutralization assays also demonstrated declining responses; the VRI RVPN pseudovirus had a greater rate of decline than the Broad PRNT live virus assay. DISCUSSION: These data show that in addition to variable individual responses and associations with disease severity, the detection assay chosen contributes to the heterogeneous results in antibody stability over time. Depending on the scope of the research, one assay may be preferable over another. For serosurveillance studies, direct, double Ag-sandwich assays appear to be the best choice due to their stability; in particular, algorithms that include both S1- and NC-based assays can help reduce the rate of false-positivity and discriminate between natural infection and vaccine-derived seroreactivity.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody persistence in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors: Dependency on assay format and applicability to serosurveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fetal gallstones are rare incidental findings on ultrasound during pregnancy.

We hypothesized that PRGF, rather than PRP, could be more effective because of its intrinsic characteristics in promoting the healing of intestinal anastomosis. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the effects of PRP and PRGF on various parameters of anastomotic healing in a swine model. METHODS Eight female pigs were randomly assigned to two groups and subjected to hand sewn jeujuno-jejunal appositional extramucosal anastomoses. For each animal, a total of six anastomoses were performed: two were considered controls and received no treatment, while the remaining four anastomoses were treated with PRP or PRGF of which both were prepared at a platelet concentration that was respectively 3.4-fold and 2.81-fold higher than the original platelet count. In each animal, either PRP or PRGF was used as a treatment, to avoid interference among products. Animals were euthanized after 8 days and the anastomoses were evaluated and compared for the presence of adhesions, anastomotic leakage, bursting pressure, and histological appearance. RESULTS The concentration of platelets in PRP was 3.41-fold higher (range, 3.20-4.24) that the concentration in whole blood, while the concentration in PRGF was 2.81-fold higher (range, 2.89-4.88). The results obtained from the present study highlighted that there are no differences between anastomotic samples treated with either PRP or PRGF preparations, except for a significant increase in epithelization of the intestinal mucosa at the anastomotic site in the PRGF group. CONCLUSIONS Both PRP and PRGF suspensions should be considered a safe strategy and represent a relatively low-cost technology that is flexible enough to be applied in several therapeutic fields. No true benefit could be proven in our study compared to the no treatment following anastomoses formation, with the exception of enhanced epithelization of the mucosa in the PRGF group.","output":"Comparison of the effects of platelet-rich or growth factor-rich plasma on intestinal anastomosis healing in pigs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has made significant progress in developing novel treatments for COVID-19 since the pandemic began. Some treatments target the patients dysregulated inflammatory response during COVID-19 infection and may cause hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) in patients with current or past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This review summarizes the risk and management of HBVr due to different treatments of COVID-19 in patients who have current or past HBV infection. Abnormal liver function tests are common during COVID-19 infection. Current evidence suggests that current or past HBV infection is not associated with an increased risk of liver injury and severe disease in COVID-19 patients. Among patients who received high-dose corticosteroids, various immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies and inhibitors of Janus kinase, the risk of HBVr exists, especially among those without antiviral prophylaxis. Data, however, remain scarce regarding the specific use of immunosuppressive therapies in COVID-19 patients with HBV infection. Some results are mainly extrapolated from patients receiving the same agents in other diseases. HBVr is a potentially life-threatening event following profound immunosuppression by COVID-19 therapies.

ABSTRACT: Drugs targeting the endocannabinoid system are of interest as potential systemic chemotherapeutic treatments and for palliative care in cancer. In this context, cannabinoid compounds have been successfully tested as a systemic therapeutic option in preclinical models over the past decades. Recent findings have suggested an essential function of the endocannabinoid system in the homeostasis of various skin functions and indicated that cannabinoids could also be considered for the treatment and prophylaxis of tumour diseases of the skin. Cannabinoids have been shown to exert their anticarcinogenic effects at different levels of skin cancer progression, such as inhibition of tumour growth, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis, as well as inducing apoptosis and autophagy.

There is some evidence that people with dementia and informal carers would benefit from technology-based counselling. However, it remains unclear which features of those interventions relate to beneficial outcomes and which aspects are necessary for a successful implementation. Therefore, the primary objectives are: (1) to identify conditions of successful implementation of technology-based counselling interventions in dementia and (2) to investigate the effectiveness of those interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a mixed-methods systematic review. The first primary objective requires evidence from various study designs addressing aspects on effective and non-effective implementation of technology-based counselling. This could be telephone-based, web-based or mobile-based interventions for people with dementia and informal carers. For the second primary objective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) dealing with any outcomes will be included. Year of publication and language will not be restricted. We will search CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science up to April 2021. Additionally, we will perform web searching and citation tracking. To achieve the first primary objective, a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) will be conducted. The QCA enables us to identify necessary or sufficient components for a successful implementation. To reach the second primary objective, a meta-analysis will be performed with respect to potential clinical and statistical heterogeneity of RCTs. The revised Risk of Bias tool 2.0 will be used to check the risk of bias in RCTs. For all other study designs, the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool will be used.

Using data from 5,786 associate veterinarians in private practice, information was obtained using employment information related to compensation, work hours, hour preferences, and job turnover. Burnout was measured using the Professional Quality of Life Scale and used to calculate conditional probabilities on turnover and reduced working hours due to burnout. Lost revenue from each outcome (turnover and reduced working hours) was then used to calculate the economic costs to the veterinary services industry. The attributable cost of burnout of veterinarians to the US industry is between $1 and 2 billion annually in lost revenue, though there is a large amount of uncertainty. The cost is dependent on whether veterinary technicians are included in the analysis. The highest economic cost per veterinarian is among food animal practitioners, while the lowest is among equine. This study demonstrates that there are significant economic costs due to burnout among veterinarians and veterinary technicians.

The local approach to this problem considers each time series separately and fits a function or model to each series. The global approach fits a single function to all series. For groups of similar time series, global methods outperform the more established local methods. However, recent results show good performance of global models even in heterogeneous datasets. This suggests a more general applicability of global methods, potentially leading to more accurate tools and new scenarios to study. Formalizing the setting of forecasting a set of time series with local and global methods, we provide the following contributions: 1) Global methods are not more restrictive than local methods, both can produce the same forecasts without any assumptions about similarity of the series. Global models can succeed in a wider range of problems than previously thought. 2) Basic generalization bounds for local and global algorithms. The complexity of local methods grows with the size of the set while it remains constant for global methods. In large datasets, a global algorithm can afford to be quite complex and still benefit from better generalization. These bounds serve to clarify and support recent experimental results in the field, and guide the design of new algorithms. For the class of autoregressive models, this implies that global models can have much larger memory than local methods. 3) In an extensive empirical study, purposely naive algorithms derived from these principles, such as global linear models or deep networks result in superior accuracy. In particular, global linear models can provide competitive accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than local methods.","output":"Principles and Algorithms for Forecasting Groups of Time Series: Locality and Globality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onslaught of SARS-CoV-2, the research community has been searching for a vaccine to fight against this virus. However, during this period, the virus has mutated to adapt to the different environmental conditions in the world and made the task of vaccine design more challenging. In this situation, the identification of virus strains is very much timely and important task. We have performed genome-wide analysis of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries to identify and prepare a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset of SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, with the use of this SNP data, the advantage of hierarchical clustering is taken care of in such a way so that Average Linkage and Complete Linkage with Jaccard and Hamming distance functions are applied separately in order to identify the virus strains as clusters present in the SNP data. In this regard, the consensus of both the clustering results are also considered while Silhouette index is used as a cluster validity index to measure the goodness of the clusters as well to determine the number of clusters or virus strains. As a result, we have identified five major clusters or virus strains present worldwide. Apart from quantitative measures, these clusters are also visualized using Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT) plot. The evolution of these clusters are also shown. Furthermore, top 10 signature SNPs are identified in each cluster and the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in the respective protein structures. Also, the sequence and structural homology-based prediction along with the protein structural stability of these non-synonymous signature SNPs are reported in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clusters. As a consequence, T85I, Q57H and R203M in NSP2, ORF3a and Nucleocapsid respectively are found to be responsible for Cluster 1 as they are damaging and unstable non-synonymous signature SNPs. Similarly, F506L and S507C in Exon are responsible for both Clusters 3 and 4 while Clusters 2 and 5 do not exhibit such behaviour due to the absence of any non-synonymous signature SNPs. In addition to all these, the code, SNP dataset, 10664 labelled SARS-CoV-2 strains and additional results as supplementary are provided through our website for further use.","output":"Genome-wide analysis of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify virus strains in 73 countries based on single nucleotide polymorphism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Freiburg was among the most heavily affected German cities during the first wave of Sars-Cov-2 infections in spring 2020. Consequently, the University Medical Center Freiburg was one of the first hospitals in Germany to treat Covid19 patients. Objectives: To assess the proportion and characteristics of health care workers (HCW) that have been infected during that first wave SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG and IgM antibodies were measured. Methods: HCW (n=902, mean age: 40.7 years) participated in this study, and filled out an epidemiological questionnaire. Serum samples were analysed for SARS-Cov-2 IgG/IgM antibodies via rapid diagnostic test (RT) and via ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.2. An exposure prevention score was developed to quantify the adherence to preventive measures in everyday life. Results: 902 HCW were tested by RT, and 499 by ELISA. In total, 11.5% of recruited HCW were antibody-positive in the RT, 12.2% in the ELISA. 87.5% of RT positives, 98% of ELISA-positives reported symptoms, compared to 74.6% and 78% of negatives, respectively. Symptoms such as cough (57%/46%), loss of smell and taste (34%/5.2%), fatigue (68%/45%), fever (48%/24%), body aches (45%/22%), and headaches (58%/46%) were reported by significantly more RT positives compared to negatives. The respective differences were even more pronounced (p<0.001) among ELISA-positives compared to negatives with >50% of those positive reported impaired smell or taste compared to less than 7% among the group of ELISA-negatives (p<0.00001). In logistic regression models, shift work and belonging to the lowest quartile of the exposure prevention score were significantly associated with seropositivity in both tests. Exposure towards children was inversely associated with seropositivity, however, in the finally adjusted model only significant for those that were RT-positive, but not ELISA-positive, reflecting the lower specificity of the former.

This outbreak began when a traveler arriving from Hong Kong sought medical care at a small hospital (Hospital A) in Hanoi, initiating a serious and substantial transmission event within the hospital, and subsequent limited spread within the community. METHODS: We surveyed Hospital A personnel for exposure to the index patient and for symptoms of disease during the outbreak. Additionally, serum specimens were collected and assayed for antibody to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody and job-specific attack rates were calculated. A nested case-control analysis was performed to assess risk factors for acquiring SARS-CoV infection. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three of 193 (79.3%) clinical and non-clinical staff consented to participate. Excluding job categories with <3 workers, the highest SARS attack rates occurred among nurses who worked in the outpatient and inpatient general wards (57.1, 47.4%, respectively). Nurses assigned to the operating room/intensive care unit, experienced the lowest attack rates (7.1%) among all clinical staff. Serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection was detected in 4 individuals, including 2 non-clinical workers, who had not previously been identified as SARS cases; none reported having had fever or cough.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of HCWs regarding COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs in three public health facilities in the Somali Region, Eastern Ethiopia. A self-administered questionnaire was shared with all HCWs working at the public health facilities. A total of 15 knowledge questions were scored as 1 or 0 for correct or incorrect responses, respectively. A total of 14 practice questions were scored on a 3-point scale from 1 (always) to 3 (never). A total of six attitude questions were rated on a 5-point Likert scale, in a negative dimension, as follows: 1 (strongly agree), 2 (agree), 3 (neutral), 4 (disagree), and 5 (strongly disagree). Mean scores were calculated and used as a cut point to dichotomize the outcome variables (>13.7 indicated good knowledge, <18.8 indicated good practices, and 10.5 indicated favorable attitudes). We used t tests and analyses of variance (ie, F tests) to analyze the mean score differences of knowledge, attitudes, and practices between the independent variables. Spearman correlation was used to assess the relationship between mean knowledge and attitude scores. RESULTS: Of the 686 HCWs approached, a total of 434 HCWs responded (63.3% response rate). The mean age of the participants was 27.6 (SD 5.3) years, and the majority of the participants were male (293/434, 67.5%). The mean knowledge score was 13.7 (SD 2.6), and 73.3% (318/434) of participants had sufficient knowledge.

Methods Weekly case rates per Middle Super Output Area (MSOA, n=4412) in England from 2020-03-15 to 2020-07-04 were obtained, and characteristics of local epidemics were calculated, e.g. the highest case rate per area. Simple linear and logistic regression analyses were employed to assess the association of these metrics with index of multiple deprivation (IMD). Local authority-level (n=309) cases were used similarly in a sensitivity analysis, as these data were available daily and extended further back in time. The impact of lockdown was assessed by comparing the cumulative case rate in the most deprived 20% of MSOAs to the least deprived 20%, for the periods before the lockdown, and by the end of lockdown. Findings Less deprived areas began recording COVID-19 cases earlier than more deprived areas and were more likely to have peaked by March 2020. More deprived areas case rates grew faster and peaked higher than less deprived areas. During the first national lockdown in the UK, the relative excess in case rates in the most deprived areas increased to 130% of that of the least deprived ones. Interpretation The pattern of disease spread in England confirm the hypothesis that initial cases of a novel infectious disease are likely to occur in more affluent communities, but more deprived areas will overtake them once national mitigation strategies begin, and bear the brunt of the total case load. The strict first national lockdown served to increase case rate inequalities in England.","output":"The effects of the first national lockdown in England on geographical inequalities in the evolution of COVID-19 case rates: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDThe 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continued into 2020, and the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) associated death toll increased OBJECTIVESTo analyze COVID-19 death rates in European countries or regions to determine whether there was a significant association between bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination policy and lower rates of COVID-19 related deaths METHODSCertain Northern European countries or regions had low death rates regardless of BCG policy The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables RESULTSUsing least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P &lt; 0 0005 for BCG and P = 0 001 for salmiak) Salmiak score alone was significant (P = 0 016) when using least squares regression with robust error algorithm CONCLUSIONSThe results seem to confirm an association between BCG-positive vaccination policy and salmiak consumption, and lower death rates from COVID-19 Implementing BCG vaccination policy and fortification of foods with salmiak (NH4Cl) may have a significant impact on the control of SARS-CoV epidemic","output":"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination Policy and Consumption of Ammonium Chloride-Enriched Confectioneries May Be Factors Reducing COVID-19 Death Rates in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN Retrospective comparison based on the degree of pelvic obliquity (PO). PURPOSE To assess the controversial indications for and limitations of ending the instrumentation for posterior spinal fusion (PSF) at L5 in patients with flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis (fNMS). METHODS We reviewed the cases of 45 patients with progressive spinal deformity as a result of fNMS treated by PSF to L5 and followed for an average of 4 years postoperatively with adequate clinical and radiological data. Anterior-posterior and lateral whole spine radiographs were evaluated. We divided patients into two groups based on the degree of pelvic obliquity (PO) at the final follow-up. Radiographic data from the two groups were analyzed to identify the indications and limitations of this surgical method focusing on PO. RESULTS Preoperatively, there were significant differences between the two groups in Cobb angle, PO, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis (LL) while sitting; Cobb angle and LL while supine (Supine Cobb, and Supine LL); and major curve flexibility. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified Supine Cobb and Supine LL as independent risk factors for residual PO at the final follow-up (Supine Cobb: odds ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.2, Supine LL: odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.8-1.0). CONCLUSION Patients with larger preoperative Cobb angle and smaller LL while supine may not achieve adequate spine and pelvic correction and this may lead to deterioration in the PO over time, even after spinal fusion ending at L5.","output":"Limitations of posterior spinal fusion to L5 for flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis focusing on pelvic obliquity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report the perioperative outcomes of 200 patients with gynecologic cancer who underwent surgery during the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the safety of surgical approach. METHODS: Data of patients operated between March 10 and May 20, 2020, were collected retrospectively. Data were statistically analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics for Windows v. SP21.0. RESULTS: Data of 200 patients were included. Their mean age was 56 years. Of the patients, 54% (n=108), 27.5% (n=55), 12.5% (n=25), and 2% (n=4) were diagnosed as having endometrial, ovarian, cervical, and vulvar cancer, respectively. Of them, 98% underwent non-emergent surgery. A minimally invasive surgical approach was used in 18%. Stage 1 cancer was found in 68% of patients. Surgeons reported COVID-related changes in 10% of the cases. The rate of postoperative complications was 12%. Only two patients had cough and suspected pneumonic lesions on thoracic computed tomography postoperatively, but neither was positive for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction testing. CONCLUSION: Based on the present findings, it is thought that gynecologic cancer surgery should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic while adhering to the measures. Postponement or non-surgical management should only be considered in patients with documented infection.

Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles.

When microscopic, it is an asymptomatic and nonspecific reaction of little clinical significance accompanying many pathological processes. When macroscopic and affecting large portions of the lung parenchyma, it manifests by restrictive ventilatory defect and gas exchange impairment leading to dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia, alveolar opacities at chest imaging, and symptoms of systemic inflammation such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. This picture constitutes the clinico-pathological syndrome of organizing pneumonia, which has been recognized and characterized as a distinct entity in the past 30 years. Although the classical features of organizing pneumonia are increasingly familiar to chest physicians, and the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment makes it appear at first sight as an easy problem to resolve, atypical clinical presentations, similarities with other diseases, severe forms, histological variants, side effects of therapy, and relapses can make the management more difficult than initially expected.

However, there are knowledge gaps about the severity, prevalence, etiology, and duration of OD in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Olfactory function was assessed in all participants using questionnaires and the butanol threshold test (BTT). Patients with COVID-19 and abnormal olfaction were further evaluated using the smell identification test (SIT), sinus imaging, and nasoendoscopy. Selected patients received nasal biopsies. Systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed items from January 1, 2020 to April 23, 2020 were searched. Studies that reported clinical data on olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Results: We included 18 COVID-19 patients and 18 controls. Among COVID-19 patients, 12 of 18 (67%) reported olfactory symptoms and OD was confirmed in 6 patients by BTT and SIT. Olfactory dysfunction was the only symptom in 2 patients. Mean BTT score of patients was worse than controls (P =. 004, difference in means = 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-2.9). Sinusitis and olfactory cleft obstruction were absent in most patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of nasal biopsy revealed the presence of infiltrative CD68+macrophages harboring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen in the stroma. Olfactory dysfunction persisted in 2 patients despite clinical recovery. Systematic review showed that the prevalence of olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 ranged from 5% to 98%. Most studies did not assess olfaction quantitatively. Conclusions: Olfactory dysfunction is common in COVID-19 and may be the only symptom. Coronavirus disease 2019-related OD can be severe and prolonged.

While a CAT bond typically enables fund generation to the insurers and re-insurers after a disaster happens, a PEFF or pandemic bond's payout is linked to random thresholds that keep evolving as the pandemic continues to unfold. The subtle difference in the timing and structure of the funding payout between the usual CAT bond and PEFF complicates the valuation of the latter. We address this complication, and our analysis identifies certain aspects in the PEFF's design that must be simplified and strengthened so that this financial instrument is able to serve the intent of its original creation. An extension of the compartmentalized deterministic epidemic model--which describes the random number of people in three classes: susceptible (S), infected (I), and removed (R) or SIR for short--to its stochastic analog is put forward. At time t, S(t), I(t), and R(t) satisfy a system of interacting stochastic differential equations in our extended framework. The payout is triggered when the number of infected people exceeds a predetermined threshold. A CAT-bond pricing setup is developed with the Vasi?ek-based financial risk factor correlated with the SIR dynamics for the PEFF valuation. The probability of a pandemic occurrence during the bond's term to maturity is calculated via a Poisson process. Our sensitivity analyses reveal that the SIR's disease transmission and recovery rates, as well as the interest rate's mean-reverting level, have a substantial effect on the bond price. Our proposed synthesized model was tested and validated using a Canadian COVID-19 dataset during the early development of the pandemic. We illustrate that the PEFF's payout could occur as early as seven weeks after the official declaration of the pandemic, and the deficiencies of the most recent PEFF sold by an international financial institution could be readily rectified.

FGD5 antisense RNA 1 (FGD5-AS1) facilitates the progression of various tumors. However, the expression and function of FGD5-AS1 in ovarian cancer (OC) and its mechanism of action are not yet clear. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to explore the expression levels of FGD5-AS1 and miR-142-5p in OC. The relationship between the expression of FGD5-AS1 and clinicopathological indicators of OC patients was analyzed by 2 test. CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay, and Transwell assay were carried out to detect cell proliferation, migration, as well as invasion, respectively. Subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment and lung metastasis model were used to examine the biological effects of FGD5-AS1 in OC in vivo. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay or RIP experiment was employed to explore the targeting relationship between FGD5-AS1 and miR-142-5p, as well as miR-142-5p and PD-L1 3'UTR. First, we found that FGD5-AS1 was markedly up-regulated in OC. Moreover, its high expression level was associated with positive local lymph node metastasis and higher T stage in OC patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that FGD5-AS1 facilitated the proliferation, migration, as well as invasion of OC cells. Mechanistically, it was revealed that FGD5-AS1 targeted miR-142-5p to repress its expression and function. Furthermore, miR-142-5p has a binding site for 3' UTR of PD-L1, and FGD5-AS1 could positively regulate PD-L1 expression via repressing miR-142-5p.

We included eight studies that met the inclusion criteria, representing 10,966 cases distributed in 15 countries around the world until July 20, 2020. The results of our review demonstrate that the maternal characteristics, clinical symptoms, maternal and neonatal outcomes almost 11,000 cases of COVID-19 and pregnancy described in 15 different countries are not worse or different from the general population. We suggest that pregnant women are not more affected by the respiratory complications of COVID-19, when compared to the outcomes described in the general population. We also suggest that the important gestational shift Th1-Th2 immune response, known as a potential contributor to the severity in cases of viral infections during pregnancy, are counter-regulated by the enhanced-pregnancy-induced ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis. Moreover, the relatively small number of reported cases during pregnancy does not allow us to affirm that COVID-19 is more aggressive during pregnancy. Conversely, we also suggest, that down-regulation of ACE2 receptors induced by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry might have been detrimental in subjects with pre-existing ACE2 deficiency associated with pregnancy.

Modeling the spread and development of infectious diseases represented by new Coronavirus has become an important part of public health work in the world. Estimation of possible infection population and prospective suggestion of handling spread based on exist data are of crucial importance. Considering of the biology parameters obtained based on Chinese clinical data in Wuhan and real spread feature of 2019-nCov in Italy, we build a more applicable model called SEIJR with log-normal distributed time delay to forecast the trend of spreading. Adopting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we estimate the early period average spreading velocity (0) and implement inversion analysis of time point (T0) when the virus first hit the Italy. Based on fixed 0 and T0, we then obtained the average spreading velocity 1 after the area lockdown using PSO. The result shows that it will be helpful in addressing the infection by generating the prediction trends of different which we considered.

In addition to being considered at higher risk for worse outcomes from COVID-19, people with cancer may also experience disruptions or delays in health services. This systematic review aimed to identify the delays and disruptions to cancer services globally. METHODS: This is a systematic review with a comprehensive search including specific and general databases. We considered any observational longitudinal and cross-sectional study design. The selection, data extraction, and methodological assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by specific tools. The delays and disruptions identified were categorized, and their frequency was presented. RESULTS: Among the 62 studies identified, none exhibited high methodological quality. The most frequent determinants for disruptions were provider- or system-related, mainly because of the reduction in service availability. The studies identified 38 different categories of delays and disruptions with impact on treatment, diagnosis, or general health service. Delays or disruptions most investigated included reduction in routine activity of cancer services and number of cancer surgeries; delay in radiotherapy; and delay, reschedule, or cancellation of outpatient visits. Interruptions and disruptions largely affected facilities (up to 77.5%), supply chain (up to 79%), and personnel availability (up to 60%). CONCLUSION: The remarkable frequency of delays and disruptions in health care mostly related to the reduction of the COVID-19 burden unintentionally posed a major risk on cancer care worldwide. Strategies can be proposed not only to mitigate the main delays and disruptions but also to standardize their measurement and reporting.

Cervical anastomosis by a circular stapler (CS) has been widely accepted as a simple and convenient method, but anastomotic strictures are likely to occur. The aim of this study was to investigate an association between CS size and the incidence of anastomotic stricture after cervical esophagogastric anastomosis performed by a CS. METHODS Between April 2011 and March 2016, 236 consecutive patients underwent cervical esophagogastric anastomosis by a CS via a retrosternal route after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. These patients were divided into according to CS size for the procedure as follows: small-sized (25 mm) CS group (SG, n = 116) and large-sized (28 or 29 mm) CS group (LG, n = 120). The clinical data of patients were analyzed retrospectively to compare the two groups. RESULTS Overall, anastomotic strictures were observed in 90 patients (38%). The incidence of anastomotic stricture was significantly lower in the LG than the SG (23% vs. 53%, p < 0.001) (Table 3).

Using expert opinion and scientific evidence, we identified host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic.

By coupling this toxicity alleviation with the expression of an MPro-eGFP fusion protein in a human cell host for straightforward characterization with fluorescent flow cytometry, we developed an effective method that allows bulk analysis of cellular potency of MPro inhibitors. In comparison to an antiviral assay in which MPro inhibitors may target host proteases or other processes in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle to convene strong antiviral effects, this novel assay is more advantageous in providing precise cellular MPro inhibition information for assessment and optimization of MPro inhibitors. We used this assay to analyze 30 literature reported MPro inhibitors including MPI1-9 that were newly developed aldehyde-based reversible covalent inhibitors of MPro, GC376 and 11a that are two investigational drugs undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in United States, boceprevir, calpain inhibitor II, calpain inhibitor XII, ebselen, bepridil that is an antianginal drug with potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that were previously shown to inhibit MPro. Our results showed that most inhibitors displayed cellular potency much weaker than their potency in direct inhibition of the enzyme. Many inhibitors exhibited weak or undetectable cellular potency up to 10 M. On contrary to their strong antiviral effects, 11a, calpain inhibitor II, calpain XII, ebselen, and bepridil showed relatively weak to undetectable cellular MPro inhibition potency implicating their roles in interfering with key steps other than just the MPro catalysis in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle to convene potent antiviral effects. characterization of these molecules on their antiviral mechanisms will likely reveal novel drug targets for COVID-19.

Therefore, the current paper aims to give an empirical example on how to perform a health survey among university students, focusing on (1) choosing topics for the survey and (2) methodological considerations of how to reach the target population. Methods: An online questionnaire including around 270 items was developed covering a comprehensive set of health topics. Participants were recruited via the university email. Mixed channels for survey promotion, such as lecture visits and social media, were used, accompanied by different monetary and non-monetary incentives. Descriptive analyses were performed to describe the sample. Results: A total of 5,006 participants (out of 31,213 registered students) viewed the first page of the questionnaire; of whom, 4,714 continued further.

The current study investigated the arrhythmic consequences of the COVID\\\\19 lockdown in patients with defibrillators (ICDs) living in the province of Ferrara, Italy. METHODS: Both the arrhythmias and the delivered ICD therapies as notified by the devices were prospectively collected during the lockdown period (P1) and compared to those occurred during the 10 weeks before the lockdown began (P2) and during the same period in 2019 (P3). Changes in outcome over the three study periods were evaluated for significance using McNemar's test. RESULTS: A total of 413 patients were included in the analysis. No differences were found concerning either arrhythmias or shocks or anti\\\\tachycardia pacing. Only the number of patients experiencing non\\\\sustained ventricular tachycardias (NSVTs) during P1 significantly decreased as compared to P2 (p = 0.026) and P3 (p = 0.009).

The purpose of this study was to predict the clinical significance of cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction by calcitriol using in vitro human cryopreserved hepatocytes, HepaRG experimental systems, and various pharmacokinetic estimation models. CYP2B6, 3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 mRNA levels increased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of calcitriol in human cryopreserved hepatocytes and HepaRG cells. Using the half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) and maximum induction effect (E(max)) obtained from the in vitro study, a basic kinetic model was applied, suggesting clinical relevance. In addition, a static mechanistic model showed the improbability of a clinically significant effect; however, the calculated area under the plasma concentrationCtime curve ratio (AUCR) was marginal for CYP3A4 in HepaRG cells. To clarify the effect of CYP3A4 in vivo, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling was applied as a dynamic mechanistic model, revealing a low clinically significant effect of CYP3A4 induction by calcitriol. Therefore, we conclude that CYP induction by calcitriol treatment would not be clinically significant under typical clinical conditions.","output":"Pharmacokinetic Estimation Models-based Approach to Predict Clinical Implications for CYP Induction by Calcitriol in Human Cryopreserved Hepatocytes and HepaRG Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We need an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 patients and to decrease virus carriage duration. METHODS: We conducted an uncontrolled, non-comparative, observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). RESULTS: All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. CONCLUSION: We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease.

Since nickel, as well as iron, is one of the most stable nuclei, the nickel energy spectrum and its relative abundance with respect to iron provide important information to estimate the abundances at the cosmic ray source and to model the Galactic propagation of heavy nuclei. However, only a few direct measurements of cosmic-ray nickel at energy larger than $ \\\\sim$ 3 GeV/n are available at present in the literature and they are affected by strong limitations in both energy reach and statistics. In this paper we present a measurement of the differential energy spectrum of nickel in the energy range from 8.8 to 240 GeV/n, carried out with unprecedented precision by the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) in operation on the International Space Station since 2015. The CALET instrument can identify individual nuclear species via a measurement of their electric charge with a dynamic range extending far beyond iron (up to atomic number $ Z $ = 40). The particle's energy is measured by a homogeneous calorimeter (1.2 proton interaction lengths, 27 radiation lengths) preceded by a thin imaging section (3 radiation lengths) providing tracking and energy sampling. This paper follows our previous measurement of the iron spectrum [O. Adriani et al., Phys. Rev.

A retrospective cohort study using a self-reported questionnaire was performed among patients with IBD between 22 June 2021 and 30 August 2021. Of the 187 participants, 10.2% (n = 19) were hesitant to be vaccinated. Patients in the vaccine-hesitant group were younger (p = 0.009) and had a shorter disease duration (p = 0.020).

Mirrored windows, which have a metallic coating that turns window exteriors into mirrors, had frequent collisions, which were mitigated when Feather Friendly?bird deterrent markers were applied. Bird-friendly windowsCORNILUX?ultraviolet (UV) and fritted windowsCalso reduced collisions when data were collected across fall and winter. Extending this prior research, we evaluated additional mitigation and tested the replicability of effects for pear trees, mirrored windows, and bird-friendly windows across two years. METHODS: Using published data from eight buildings monitored for collisions in year 1 (Fall and Winter, 2019C2020), we added another year of monitoring, Fall and Winter, 2020C2021. Between years, Feather Friendly?mitigation markers were added to collision-prone areas of two buildings, including both mirrored and transparent windows. RESULTS: The two buildings that received new Feather Friendly?mitigation had significantly fewer collisions post-mitigation. Control areas also had nonsignificant decline in collisions. The interaction of area (mitigation vs. control) by time (year 1 vs. 2) was significant, based on generalized estimating equations (GEE). The total yearly collisions across all eight buildings declined from 39 to 23. A second GEE analysis of all 8 buildings showed that mirrored windows, pear trees, and bird-friendly windows were each significant when analyzed separately. The best-fit model showed more collisions for mirrored windows and fewer collisions for bird-friendly windows. We found pear tree proximity to be related to more collisions in winter than fall. In addition, pear trees showed reduced collisions from year 1 to 2, consistent with new mitigation for two of three buildings near pear trees. DISCUSSION: Feather Friendly(?) markers can mitigate collisions with transparent windows, not only mirrored windows, compared to unmitigated areas over 2 years. Results also underscore the dangers of pear tree proximity and mirrored windows and the efficacy of bird-friendly windows. Thus, bird collisions can be prevented by window mitigation, permanent bird-friendly windows, and landscape designs that avoid creating ecological traps.","output":"Bird-window collisions: Mitigation efficacy and risk factors across two years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From Farm to Fork Strategy is at the heart of the European Green Deal C the new growth strategy of the EU and a key to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

DATA SOURCES: Multiple electronic databases, including the WHO database of publications on coronavirus disease and the medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 27 March 2020, with ongoing surveillance through 24 April 2020), and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Studies published in any language reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors (demographic characteristics, role, exposures, environmental and administrative factors, and personal protective equipment [PPE] use) and HCW infections. New evidence will be incorporated on an ongoing basis by using living review methods. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; verification was done by a second reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: 64 studies met inclusion criteria; 43 studies addressed burden of HCW infections (15 on SARS-CoV-2), and 34 studies addressed risk factors (3 on SARS-CoV-2). Health care workers accounted for a significant proportion of coronavirus infections and may experience particularly high infection incidence after unprotected exposures. Illness severity was lower than in non-HCWs. Depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were common in HCWs during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The strongest evidence on risk factors was on PPE use and decreased infection risk. The association was most consistent for masks but was also observed for gloves, gowns, eye protection, and handwashing; evidence suggested a dose-response relationship. No study evaluated PPE reuse. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk. Infection control training was associated with decreased risk. LIMITATION: There were few studies on risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, the studies had methodological limitations, and streamlined rapid review methods were used. CONCLUSION: Health care workers experience significant burdens from coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

We collected chest CT scans of 202 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19, and try to develop a rapid, accurate and automatic tool for severity screening follow-up therapeutic treatment. METHODS A total of 729 2D axial plan slices with 246 severe cases and 483 non-severe cases were employed in this study. By taking the advantages of the pre-trained deep neural network, four pre-trained off-the-shelf deep models (Inception-V3, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-201) were exploited to extract the features from these CT scans. These features are then fed to multiple classifiers (linear discriminant, linear SVM, cubic SVM, KNN and Adaboost decision tree) to identify the severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. Three validation strategies (holdout validation, tenfold cross-validation and leave-one-out) are employed to validate the feasibility of proposed pipelines. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The experimental results demonstrate that classification of the features from pre-trained deep models shows the promising application in COVID-19 severity screening, whereas the DenseNet-201 with cubic SVM model achieved the best performance. Specifically, it achieved the highest severity classification accuracy of 95.20% and 95.34% for tenfold cross-validation and leave-one-out, respectively. The established pipeline was able to achieve a rapid and accurate identification of the severity of COVID-19. This may assist the physicians to make more efficient and reliable decisions.","output":"Rapid identification of COVID-19 severity in CT scans through classification of deep features."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We performed a phenome-wide association study to identify pre-existing conditions related to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prognosis across the medical phenome and how they vary by race.

In fact, most basic principles of these processes were first described in viral systems. Furthermore, viruses seem not to respect basic rules, and cases of abnormal expression strategies are quiet common, although such strategies are usually also finally observed in rare cases of cellular gene expression. Concerning translation, viruses most often violate Kozak's original rule that eukaryotic translation starts from a capped monocistronic mRNA and involves linear scanning to find the first suitable start codon. Thus, many viral cases have been described where translation is initiated from noncapped RNA, using an internal ribosome entry site. This review centers on other viral translation strategies, namely shunting and virus-controlled reinitiation as first described in plant pararetroviruses (Caulimoviridae). In shunting, major parts of a complex leader are bypassed and not melted by scanning ribosomes. In the Caulimoviridae, this process is coupled to reinitiation after translation of a small open reading frame; in other cases, it is possibly initiated upon pausing of the scanning ribosome. Most of the Caulimoviridae produce polycistronic mRNAs. Two basic mechanisms are used for their translation. Alternative translation of the downstream open reading frames in the bacilliform Caulimoviridae occurs by a leaky scanning mechanism, and reinitiation of polycistronic translation in many of the icosahedral Caulimoviridae is enabled by the action of a viral transactivator. Both of these processes are discussed here in detail and compared to related processes in other viruses and cells.","output":"Viral strategies of translation initiation: Ribosomal shunt and reinitiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The therapeutic potential of melatonin as a chronobiotic cytoprotective agent to counteract the consequences of COVID-19 infections has been advocated. Because of its wide-ranging effects as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory compound, melatonin could be unique in impairing the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, indirect evidence points out to a possible antiviral action of melatonin by interfering with SARS-CoV-2/angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 association. Melatonin is also an effective chronobiotic agent to reverse the circadian disruption of social isolation and to control delirium in severely affected patients. As a cytoprotector, melatonin serves to combat several comorbidities such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases, which aggravate COVID-19 disease. In view of evidence on the occurrence of neurological sequels in COVID-19-infected patients, another putative application of melatonin emerges based on its neuroprotective properties. Since melatonin is an effective means to control cognitive decay in minimal cognitive impairment, its therapeutic significance for the neurological sequels of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered. Finally, yet importantly, exogenous melatonin can be an adjuvant capable of augmenting the efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

We investigated whether the pandemic affected primary care and health outcomes of DMP-CAD patients (n = 750) by using a questionnaire assessing patients' utilization of medical care, CAD symptoms, as well as health behavior and mental health since March 2020. We found that out of concern about getting infected with COVID-19, 9.1% of the patients did not consult a medical practitioner despite having CAD symptoms. Perceived own influence on infection risk was lower and anxiety was higher in these patients compared to symptomatic CAD patients who consulted a physician. Among the patients who reported chest pain lasting longer than 30 min, one third did not consult a medical practitioner subsequently. These patients were generally more worried about COVID-19. Patients with at least one worsening CAD symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, perspiration, or nausea without apparent reason) since the pandemic showed more depressive symptoms, higher anxiety scores, and were less likely to consult a doctor despite having CAD symptoms out of fear of infection. Our results provide evidence that the majority of patients received sufficient medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.

An oral dose (50 or 100mg) of TRA was administered to 17 healthy volunteers. Hair samples were collected prior to drug administration and 14, 30, 60 and 120 days after ingestion. Each sample was segmented in 5mm segments and washed. The analytes were extracted from pulverized hair by incubation in extraction media for 18h at 37C. A validated UHPLC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the analytes at a LLOQ of 0.001ng/mg. Hair segments corresponding to the time of ingestion were positive for TRA and the metabolites of each sampling time point, although neighboring segments also showed positive results. The highest concentrations for both dosage groups were observed in the proximal segment of hair collected 14 days after ingestion for all subjects: 0.061-0.95ng TRA/mg, 0.012-0.86ng NDMT/mg and 0.009-0.17ng ODMT/mg (n=16). Generally, the TRA concentration was higher than the metabolites concentrations but depended on the CYP2D6 phenotype. The metabolite to TRA ratios were stable within a subject over the sampling time points, however it varied greatly between subjects. No significant differences in hair concentrations were found between the two dosage groups at each sampling time. Several confounding factors were identified such as hair pigmentation and internal sweat. We showed that analysis of 5mm segments improved the determination of the exposure time after a single ingestion of TRA. In addition, in the later sampling time points the analytes were spread more between segments and the total drug amount of each later sampling time point declined up to a 100% (median: 75%) due to wash out.

This study investigates the prevalence and factors correlated with attitudes regarding wife-beating among Bangladeshi women in urbanCrural contexts. METHODS: A sample of 13,033 urban women and 51,344 rural women data from the Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019 were analyzed using the Chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression model. RESULTS: The findings reveal that arguing with her husband is the widespread reason for wife-beating in Bangladesh (urban: 17.3%, rural: 21.9%), followed by neglecting the children (urban: 12.7%, rural: 15.8%). About 8% of urban women and 10% of rural women favoured the opinion that refusing to involve sexual intercourse is a legitimate justification for wife-beating. In comparison, around 5% feel that a husband has a right to beat his wife due to burning food. The respondents age, education, marital status, number of children, socioeconomic level, any health or physical difficulty, having problems becoming pregnant, and the husbands age are all significant factors in justifying wife-beating. CONCLUSIONS: Bangladesh has a massive challenge in eliminating IPV. Women from lower socioeconomic classes, low levels of education, other challenges, and residents of rural areas are particularly more vulnerable than their urban counterparts. Therefore, it is vital to develop a proper action plan that considers womens education and occupation to raise awareness of the various implications of wife-beating in women, particularly in Bangladeshs rural areas.","output":"Prevalence and determinants of wife-beating in Bangladesh: evidence from a nationwide survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe pulmonary involvement, are at an increased thromboembolic risk related, among various causes, to the cytokine storm and excessive activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets. Different intensity of anticoagulation for them is proposed, mainly with low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs); in a confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) the therapeutic dose of LMWH is routinely used. Some authors suggest that hemorrhagic complications in COVID-19 patients are rare. At the same time, one can find reports on internal bleeding, including retroperitoneal hematoma (RPH) and other abdominal hematomas. CASE REPORTS: The authors describe 5 cases (3 of those aged more than 80 years) with giant RPHs and with moderate/severe COVID-19 pneumonia, treated before RPH diagnosis with different enoxaparin doses. The therapeutic dose was given to the male with verified PE limited to the segmental/subsegmental pulmonary arteries and initially to the female in whom echocardiography was strongly suggestive of PE, yet this diagnosis was excluded on CT angiography. In one patient, the enoxaparin dose was escalated from 40 mg bd to 60 mg bd after the D-dimer increase. Two patients had bleeding complications despite the enoxaparin dose restricted to 40 mg/daily or bd. Two males had a coexistent psoas hematoma while in only one female there was a coexistent femoral hematoma. RPHs occurred between day 4 and 14 of hospitalization and all were treated conservatively.

We report here the results of a single-center retrospective observational study of the remission rate in pediatric patients with SNRS receiving tacrolimus. Serial renal biopsies from children on tacrolimus therapy were evaluated for tubulointerstitial fibrosis and transforming growth factor- immunostaining. Of the 16 children with SRNS, 15 went into complete remission after a median of 120 days of therapy. Nine children were able to stop steroids, while the others were on tapering doses. Forty-seven percent had relapses, most of which were steroid-responsive. Serial renal biopsies were obtained from seven children after a median treatment duration of 24 months; two of these children had increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis and four showed increased transforming growth factor- tissue staining. Children with worsening histological findings were younger. There was no significant association between tacrolimus exposure and biopsy changes, although the average trough level was higher in those children with worsening histological findings. In conclusion, tacrolimus may be a safe and effective alternative agent for inducing remission in children with SRNS. However, caution needs to be taken when prescribing this agent due to its narrow therapeutic index. Serial renal biopsies are necessary to check for subclinical nephrotoxicity, especially in younger children and those with higher trough levels.","output":"Experience with tacrolimus in children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is important to avoid 3Cs (closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings). However, the risk of contact with an unspecified number of people is inevitable while commuting to and from work. In this study, we investigated the relationship between commuting, and the risk of COVID-19 and COVID-19-induced anxiety. Methods: An internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain a dataset from 27036 respondents. One-way commuting time was evaluated using a five-case method. The commuting distance was estimated using zip codes of the home and workplace. Logistic regression analysis was performed with the following outcomes: COVID-19 risk, close contact, infection anxiety, and infection anxiety due to commuting. Commuting distance and commuting time were analyzed separately in the model. We excluded participants with incalculable commuting distance, commuting distance exceeding 300 km, commuting distance of 0 km, or who telecommuted at least once a week. Results: The total number of participants included in the analysis was 14038. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of using public transportation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were 4.17 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.51-6.93) (commuting time) and 5.18 (95% CI: 3.06-8.78) (commuting distance). The aOR of COVID-19 diagnosis decreased significantly with increasing commuting distance. The aORs of using public transportation to infection anxiety were 1.44 (95% CI: 1.31-1.59) (commuting time) and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.32-1.60) (commuting distance). The longer the commuting time, the more the aOR increased.. Conclusions: COVID-19 risk, close contact, and infection anxiety were all associated with the use of public transportation during commuting. Both commuting distance and time were associated with infection anxiety due to commuting, and the strength of the association increased with increase in commuting time distance. Since transportation by commuting is associated with COVID-19 risk and anxiety, we recommend the use of telecommuting and other means of work.","output":"Effect of commuting on the risk of COVID-19 and COVID-19-induced anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Preliminary screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly performed offline in China.

Here we present a generalizable assay platform, nanobody-functionalized nanoparticles for rapid, electronic detection (Nano2RED), demonstrated in the detection of Ebola and COVID-19 antigens. To efficiently generate high-quality affinity reagents, synthetic nanobody co-binders and mono-binders with high affinity, specificity, and stability were selected by phage display screening of a vastly diverse, rationally randomized combinatorial library, bacterially expressed and site-specifically conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as multivalent in-solution sensors. Without requiring fluorescent labelling, washing, or enzymatic amplification, these AuNPs reliably transduce antigen binding signals upon mixing into physical AuNP aggregation and sedimentation processes, displaying antigen-dependent optical extinction readily detectable by spectrometry or simple electronic circuitry. With nanobodies against an Ebola virus secreted glycoprotein (sGP) and a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as targets, Nano2RED showed a high sensitivity (limit of detection of 10 pg/mL for sGP and 40 pg/mL for RBD in diluted human serum), a high specificity, and a large dynamic range (7 logs). Unlike conventional assays where slow mass transport for surface binding limits the assay time, Nano2RED features fast antigen diffusion at micrometer scale, and can be accelerated to deliver results within a few minutes. The rapid detection, low material cost (estimated < $0.01 per test), inexpensive and portable readout system (< $5 and < 100 cm3), and digital data output, make Nano2RED particularly suitable for screening of patient samples with simplified operation and accelerated data transmission.

The Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) Registry is being established as part of the ADNeT initiative, with the primary objective of collecting data to monitor and enhance the quality of care and patient outcomes for people diagnosed with either dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A secondary aim is to facilitate the recruitment of participants into dementia research and trials. This paper describes the Registry protocol. METHODS: The ADNeT Registry is a prospective CQR of patients newly diagnosed with either dementia or MCI. Eligible patients will be identified initially from memory clinics and individual medical specialists (e.g., geriatricians, psychiatrists and neurologists) involved in the diagnosis of dementia. Participants will be recruited using either an opt-out approach or waiver of consent based on three key determinants (capacity, person responsible, and communication of diagnosis). Data will be collected from four sources: participating sites, registry participants, carers, and linkage with administrative datasets. It is anticipated that the Registry will recruit approximately 10,000 participants by the end of 2023. The ADNeT registry will be developed and implemented to comply with the national operating principles for CQRs and governed by the ADNeT Registry Steering Committee. DISCUSSION: The ADNeT Registry will provide important data on current clinical practice in the diagnosis, treatment and care of people with dementia and MCI in Australia as well as long-term outcomes among these people. These data will help to identify variations in clinical practice and patient outcomes and reasons underlying these variations, which in turn, will inform the development of interventions to improve care and outcomes for people with dementia and MCI.","output":"The protocol of a clinical quality registry for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI): the Australian dementia network (ADNeT) Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of 2020, scientific conferences around the globe have evolved quickly to adapt to a virtual or hybrid format when in-person meetings were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Numerous regions of the world have had varying responses in their attempts to contain the spread of the virus. Factors such as public health policies, governance, and sociopolitical climate have led to differential levels of success at controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Ultimately, a more advanced surveillance metric for COVID-19 transmission is necessary to help government systems and national leaders understand which responses have been effective and gauge where outbreaks occur. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced COVID-19 surveillance metrics for Canada at the country, province, and territory level that account for shifts in the pandemic including speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. Enhanced surveillance identifies risks for explosive growth and regions that have controlled outbreaks successfully. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 62 days of COVID-19 data from Canadian public health registries for 13 provinces and territories. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Canada as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: We compare the week of February 7-13, 2021, with the week of February 14-20, 2021. Canada, as a whole, had a decrease in speed from 8.4 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 7.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population. The persistence of new cases during the week of February 14-20 reported 7.5 cases that are a result of COVID-19 transmissions 7 days earlier. The two most populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec both experienced decreases in speed from 7.9 and 11.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population for the week of February 7-13 to speeds of 6.9 and 9.3 for the week of February 14-20, respectively. Nunavut experienced a significant increase in speed during this time, from 3.3 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 10.9 daily new cases per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: Canada excelled at COVID-19 control early on in the pandemic, especially during the first COVID-19 shutdown. The second wave at the end of 2020 resulted in a resurgence of the outbreak, which has since been controlled. Enhanced surveillance identifies outbreaks and where there is the potential for explosive growth, which informs proactive health policy.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance System in Canada: Longitudinal Trend Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Covid-19 has placed an unprecedented demand on healthcare systems worldwide. A positive safety culture is associated with improved patient safety and in turn patient outcomes. To date, no study has evaluated the impact of Covid-19 on safety culture. Methods The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was used to investigate safety culture during Covid-19 at a large UK teaching hospital. Findings were compared with baseline data from 2017. Incident reporting from the year preceding the pandemic was also examined. Results Significant increases were seen in SAQ score for doctors and AHPs (p value) from baseline (p value). A decrease in SAQ was found in the nursing group. Largely due to perception of management and safety climate subscales. During Covid-19, on univariate regression analysis, female gender (p<0.001), age 40-49 years (p<0.01), non-white ethnicity (p<0.001), nursing job role (p<0.001) were all associated with lower SAQ scores. Training (p<0.001) and support (p<0.001) for redeployment were associated with higher SAQ scores. On multivariate analysis, non-disclosed gender (-0.13, -0.26-0.00), non-disclosed ethnicity (-0.11, -0.22-0.00), nursing role (-0.15, -0.24-0.06), and support (0.24, 0.07-0.4) persisted to significance. A significant decrease (p<0.003) was seen in error reporting after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussion Differences in reported safety culture may reflect perception of risk due to: occupational exposure, job function, or access to support services. Reductions in incident reporting may be due to increased workload, change in nature of work, or changing safety attitudes. Targeted high-quality support for redeployed staff may help improve safety during future pandemics.","output":"What Has Been the Impact of Covid-19 on Safety Culture?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: National data on chronic dialysis treatment are essential to support the development of health policies aimed at improving the treatment for thousands of people. OBJECTIVE: To report epidemiological data from the 2020 Brazilian Dialysis Survey, sponsored by the Brazilian Society of Nephrology. METHODS: A survey was carried out in Brazilian chronic dialysis centers using an online questionnaire for the year, covering clinical and epidemiological aspects of patients in a chronic dialysis program, data on dialysis therapy, characteristics of dialysis units and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 235 (28%) of the centers responded to the questionnaire. In July 2020, the estimated total number of patients on dialysis was 144,779. The estimated prevalence and incidence rates of patients per million population (pmp) were 684 and 209, respectively. Of the prevalent patients, 92.6% were on hemodialysis (HD) and 7.4% were on peritoneal dialysis (PD);23% were on the transplant waiting list. A central venous catheter was used by a quarter of patients on HD. The incidence rate of confirmed COVID-19 between February and July 2020 was 684/10,000 dialysis patients, and the lethality rate was 25.7%. The estimated overall mortality and COVID-19 crude annual mortality rates were 24.5 and 4.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The absolute number of patients on chronic dialysis and prevalence rate continued to increase. The low use of PD as dialysis therapy was maintained and the use of long-term catheters for HD increased.

In temperate regions, a distinct seasonality is observed, where peaks of infections typically occur in early winter, often preceding the annual influenza season. Infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and in some populations exceed that of influenza. Two subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B, have been described, and molecular epidemiological studies have shown that both viruses mostly co-circulate. This trend also appears to be the case for Australia; however, previous genomic studies have been limited to cases from one Eastern stateNew South Wales. As such, the broader spatial patterns and viral traffic networks across the continent are not known. Here, we conducted a whole-genome study of RSV comparing strains across eastern and Western Australia during the period January 2016 to June 2017. In total, 96 new RSV genomes were sequenced, compiled with previously generated data, and examined using a phylodynamic approach. This analysis revealed that both RSV-A and RSV-B strains were circulating, and each subtype was dominated by a single genotype, RSV-A ON1-like and RSV-B BA10-like viruses. Some geographical clustering was evident in strains from both states with multiple distinct sub-lineages observed and relatively low mixing across jurisdictions, suggesting that endemic transmission was likely seeded from imported, unsampled locations. Overall, the RSV phylogenies reflected a complex pattern of interactions across multiple epidemiological scales from fluid virus traffic across global and regional networks to fine-scale local transmission events.","output":"The spatial-temporal dynamics of respiratory syncytial virus infections across the eastCwest coasts of Australia during 2016C17"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Beforehand transection and suturing (BTS) of the dorsal vascular complex (DVC), a novel technique in non-neurovascular bundle sparing (NVB-sparing) extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (eLRP), had been proposed; this study aimed to evaluate this technique in clinical laparoscopic procedures.

The WHO on March 11, 2020, has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic. Several studies found an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms, such as distress, anxiety, fear of infection, depression and insomnia in the general population. Therefore, psychiatrists have been professionally overloaded, trying to manage the psychosocial impact of the pandemic and suffering its effects in person.ObjectivesTo evaluate the disease perceptions, distress and burnout among psychiatrists from the Department of Mental Health and Addictions of Pavia in three different times, which correspond to the three main phases of the pandemic management in Italy: T0 is the first peak of the infections and the lock-down, from March to June;T1 is the reduction of the infections and the reopening, from June to October;T2 is the second wave of infections with a new progressive closure, the current one.MethodsWe used three questionnaires: the BIPQ (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire), the PSS-10 (Perceived Stress Scale-10), the PED (Profile of emotional distress). We also used a survey (6 items) in T0, T1 and T2 to evaluate exposure, perception, quality of life and burnout.Resultstable 1,2,3.

We examine how patterns of emotion regulation and brain structure and function predict internalizing problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as moderate the association between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing problems. Methods: Data are from a longitudinal sample (N=145, aged 10-15) strategically assessed at three crucial timepoints: prior to the pandemic, early during the stay-at-home order period, and again six months later. We examined associations of neural structure and function during an emotional processing task prior to the pandemic, use of emotion regulation strategies prior to and during the pandemic, and pandemic-related stressors with internalizing problems. Results: Greater exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms both early (?=.437, p<.001) and later (?=.225, p=.004) in the pandemic. Youth who reported more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, including rumination (?=.204, p=.026) and expressive suppression (?=.177, p=.023), also had higher internalizing problems. Higher left amygdala activation to neutral relative to fearful faces prior to the pandemic was associated with greater internalizing symptoms (?=-.229, p=.007), and a stronger relation between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing problems (?=-.186, p=.014). Conclusion: Pandemic-related stressors are strongly associated with internalizing problems in adolescents, and individual differences in emotional reactivity and regulation and their underlying neural mechanisms contribute to stress-related vulnerability.

Antibody-mediated protection is challenged by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) with immune escape properties, such as omicron (B.1.1.529) that is rapidly spreading worldwide. Here, we report neutralizing antibody dynamics in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 convalescent and infection-naive individuals vaccinated with mRNA BNT162b2 by quantifying anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and determining their avidity and neutralization capacity in serum. Using live-virus neutralization assays, we show that a superior infection-neutralizing capacity against all VoCs, including omicron, developed after either two vaccinations in convalescents or after a third vaccination or breakthrough infection of twice-vaccinated, naive individuals. These three consecutive spike antigen exposures resulted in an increasing neutralization capacity per anti-spike antibody unit and were paralleled by stepwise increases in antibody avidity. We conclude that an infection-plus-vaccination-induced hybrid immunity or a triple immunization can induce high-quality antibodies with superior neutralization capacity against VoCs, including omicron.","output":"Three exposures to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by either infection or vaccination elicit superior neutralizing immunity to all variants of concern."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: China has launched methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and needle and syringe exchange programmes (NSEP) as part of the country's HIV prevention strategy amongst injection drug users. MMT is expanding, with backing from multiple government ministries, however, NSEP have received less political support and funding. METHODS: Semi-structured, serial interviews were conducted with key informants, knowledgeable about China's harm reduction policies. Concurrent content analysis allowed for revision of the interview guide throughout the data collection process. This was combined with a systematic analysis of official government policy documents on NSEP and MMT, including white papers, legal documents, and policy statements. FINDINGS: Early consensus between public security and public health sectors regarding methadone's dual use in HIV prevention as well as method of drug control created broad institutional support for MMT programmes amongst policy makers. In contrast, NSEP were seen as satisfying only the HIV prevention goals of the public health sector, and were perceived as condoning illicit drug use. Furthermore, NSEP's roots in China, as an experimental collaboration with international groups, created suspicion regarding its role in China's drug control policy. NSEP and MMT's distinct paths to policy development are reflected in the complex and occasionally contradictory nature of China's harm reduction strategy. CONCLUSIONS: These discrepancies highlight the need for a more politically sustainable and comprehensive integration of harm reduction projects. Recommendations include improved evaluation methods for NESP, NSEP-MMT cross-referral system, and stronger NSEP advocacy within the non-profit and public health sectors.","output":"A harm reduction paradox: Comparing China's policies on needle and syringe exchange and methadone maintenance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Beijing, China, experienced the world's largest outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beginning in March 2003, with the outbreak resolving rapidly, within 6 weeks of its peak in late April. Little is known about the control measures implemented during this outbreak. OBJECTIVE To describe and evaluate the measures undertaken to control the SARS outbreak. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were reviewed from standardized surveillance forms from SARS cases (2521 probable cases) and their close contacts observed in Beijing between March 5, 2003, and May 29, 2003. Procedures implemented by health authorities were investigated through review of official documents and discussions with public health officials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Timeline of major control measures; number of cases and quarantined close contacts and attack rates, with changes in infection control measures, management, and triage of suspected cases; and time lag between illness onset and hospitalization with information dissemination. RESULTS Health care worker training in use of personal protective equipment and management of patients with SARS and establishing fever clinics and designated SARS wards in hospitals predated the steepest decline in cases. During the outbreak, 30 178 persons were quarantined. Among 2195 quarantined close contacts in 5 districts, the attack rate was 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3%-7.3%), with a range of 15.4% (95% CI, 11.5%-19.2%) among spouses to 0.36% (95% CI, 0%-0.77%) among work and school contacts. The attack rate among quarantined household members increased with age from 5.0% (95% CI, 0%-10.5%) in children younger than 10 years to 27.6% (95% CI, 18.2%-37.0%) in adults aged 60 to 69 years. Among almost 14 million people screened for fever at the airport, train stations, and roadside checkpoints, only 12 were found to have probable SARS. The national and municipal governments held 13 press conferences about SARS. The time lag between illness onset and hospitalization decreased from a median of 5 to 6 days on or before April 20, 2003, the day the outbreak was announced to the public, to 2 days after April 20 (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS The rapid resolution of the SARS outbreak was multifactorial, involving improvements in management and triage in hospitals and communities of patients with suspected SARS and the dissemination of information to health care workers and the public.","output":"Evaluation of control measures implemented in the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Beijing, 2003."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is complex and requires multidisciplinary consideration In times of crisis when resources are limited and the health of patients might be compromised, as is the case with COVID-19, a strategic approach that takes into account tumor characteristics, patient factors, and available treatment options can optimize patient outcomes while balancing resource utilization Herein, we detail our group's management strategy for patients with localized HCC during the global pandemic that carefully considers individual patient needs and those of the institutional workforce, the local healthcare system, and the greater patient community we serve","output":"Surgical Management of Localized Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Times of Crisis: A Strategic Approach to Resource Utilization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To fight the COVID-19 epidemic, many countries implemented containment measures that made physical distancing the norm and imposed restrictions on the use of public space. In countries where access to public green spaces (PGSs) was safeguarded, they were expected to partially counterbalance the negative health outcomes of these containment measures, as they offered a unique opportunity to meet others, to avoid isolation, and to move, play and relax at a safe distance. Research on PGS use and its objective association with health during the COVID-19 epidemic is rather limited and is based on quantitative research methodologies. Such methodologies are useful to detect objective associations between PGS use and health or between COVID-19 and PGS use, but fall short in explaining the observed associations. This qualitative research filled this gap by examining how PGS users perceived the health advantages of PGSs and how the use of PGSs changed during the epidemic in the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. In total, 23 individual face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted in various PGSs. We found that while PGSs were initially perceived as a possible threat to health in the first period of the epidemic, they gradually became associated in users' minds with both improved physical and mental health. Although the mechanisms behind this association were also present prior to the epidemic, they became more tangible and more universal. We also found that the use of PGSs changed during the epidemic due to measures and restrictions and due to health risk perceptions. We distinguished five different health risk perception profiles in relation to COVID-19: the denier, the fatalist, the negotiator, the conformer and the worrier. These different health risk perceptions impacted on the use of and behaviour within PGSs. This research confirms the importance of PGSs during an epidemic and may inspire further research, offer pointers to policymakers for developing and implementing strategies related to the use of PGSs during epidemics, and assist them in providing available and accessible PGSs and in designing attractive, more epidemic-proof PGSs.","output":"Perceived Health Impact and Usage of Public Green Spaces in Brussels' Metropolitan Area During the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Female, 21-year-old Final Diagnosis: Optic neuritis Symptoms: Vision changes Medication: Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Infectious Diseases ? Neurology OBJECTIVE: Rare co-existance of disease or pathology BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, extensive research has been conducted on the pulmonary implications of this novel disease. However, there has been limited data on the extrapulmonary manifestations. There have been few documented causes of optic involvement and little is understood about the pathophysiology around its presentation and the possible treatments to prevent long-term complications. Here, we describe a case of optic neuritis in a female patient concurrently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Given the plethora of evidence supporting neurological manifestations of the virus, we hypothesize that there is an association between our patients optic neuritis and her infection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old woman with no past medical history who presented with blurry vision in her left eye. Optic neuritis was suspected with physical examination and confirmed with imaging of the optic nerve. Further diagnostic evaluation was nonsuggestive of multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases; however, the patient was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Steroids and remdesivir treatment were started, but without the presence of any respiratory symptoms. The patients symptoms completely resolved by day 5 of hospitalization and she was discharged home without any complications. CONCLUSIONS: Optic neuritis has remained an uncommon complication of SARS-CoV-2. This rather rare complication of SARS-CoV-2 is one that clinicians should be cognizant of due to the long-term implications of optic neuritis. Furthermore, it is pertinent to consider ophthalmic involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection to appropriately guide patient care during the pandemic, as prompt treatment can lead to improved outcomes.","output":"Unilateral Optic Neuritis Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Rare Complication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Translate and investigate psychometric properties of the Polish version of COVID-19-PTSD in a sample of healthcare workers.

METHODS: This study was conducted on 103 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of 103 patients, 49 (N) and 54 (N) patients received dual-immunosuppressants (baricitinib plus two doses of secukinumab) and triple immunosuppressants (baricitinib plus single dose of tocilizumab and secukinumab) in group A and group B, respectively. Groups were compared in terms of clinical outcome, critical support-requirement, survival, re-hospitalisation, and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Patients in group B achieved normal blood oxygen saturation level (SpO(2)) earlier than the patients of group A [4 day (IQR: 3C12) vs 5 day (IQR: 5C14), p < .05]. The requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation (MV) support was less in group B than group A [16.7%/28.6%, 11.1%/18.4%, respectively p < .05]]. The incidence of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome and 60-day all cause mortality was reduced in group B compared to group A [0.43 (0.19C0.98), p < .05; 0.35 (0.08C1.44), p > .05].

We aimed to identify a parsimonious set of symptoms that jointly predict COVID-19 and investigated whether predictive symptoms differ between the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) lineage (predominating as of April 2021 in the US, UK, and elsewhere) and wild type. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We obtained throat and nose swabs with valid SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results from 1,147,370 volunteers aged 5 years and above (6,450 positive cases) in the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. This study involved repeated community-based random surveys of prevalence in England (study rounds 2 to 8, June 2020 to January 2021, response rates 22%C27%). Participants were asked about symptoms occurring in the week prior to testing. Viral genome sequencing was carried out for PCR-positive samples with N-gene cycle threshold value < 34 (N = 1,079) in round 8 (January 2021). In univariate analysis, all 26 surveyed symptoms were associated with PCR positivity compared with non-symptomatic people. Stability selection (1,000 penalized logistic regression models with 50% subsampling) among people reporting at least 1 symptom identified 7 symptoms as jointly and positively predictive of PCR positivity in rounds 2C7 (June to December 2020): loss or change of sense of smell, loss or change of sense of taste, fever, new persistent cough, chills, appetite loss, and muscle aches. The resulting model (rounds 2C7) predicted PCR positivity in round 8 with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77. The same 7 symptoms were selected as jointly predictive of B.1.1.7 infection in round 8, although when comparing B.1.1.7 with wild type, new persistent cough and sore throat were more predictive of B.1.1.7 infection while loss or change of sense of smell was more predictive of the wild type. The main limitations of our study are (i) potential participation bias despite random sampling of named individuals from the National Health Service register and weighting designed to achieve a representative sample of the population of England and (ii) the necessary reliance on self-reported symptoms, which may be prone to recall bias and may therefore lead to biased estimates of symptom prevalence in England.

A total of 457 patients underwent thin-section chest CT scans during the hospitalization or after discharge to identify the pulmonary lesion. A total of 287 patients were followed up from 90 days to 150 days after the onset of the disease, and lung function tests were conducted in about three months after the onset. The risk factors affecting the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis were identified through regression analysis and the prediction model of the persistence of pulmonary fibrosis was established. Results: : Parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were the most common CT features in all COVID-19 patients. During the 0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120 and >120 days after onset, 86.87%, 74.40%, 79.56%, 68.12% and 62.03% patients developed with pulmonary fibrosis and 4.53%, 19.61%, 18.02%, 38.30% and 48.98% patients reversed pulmonary fibrosis, respectively. It was observed that Age, BMI, Fever, and Highest PCT were predictive factors for sustaining fibrosis even after 90 days from onset. A predictive model of the persistence with pulmonary fibrosis was developed based-on the Logistic Regression method with an accuracy, PPV, NPV, Sensitivity and Specificity of the model of 76%, 71%, 79%, 67%, and 82%, respectively. More than half of COVID-19 patients revealed abnormal condition in lung function after 90 days from onset, and the ratio of abnormal lung function did not differ on a statistically significant level between the fibrotic and non-fibrotic groups. Conclusions: : Persistent pulmonary fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with older age, high BMI, severe/critical condition, fever, long time to turn the viral RNA negative, pre-existing disease and delay to admission. Fibrosis developed in COVID-19 patients could be reversed in about a third of the patients after 120 days from onset.

Periods of health crisis such as the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic add to the enormous burden of the media in keeping people constantly informed. Extant literature suggests that when a message is released through the media, what matters most is not what is said but how it is said. As such, the media could either mitigate or accentuate the crisis depending on the major frames adopted for the coverage. Methods: The study utilises content analysis. Data were sourced from LexisNexis database and two websites that yielded 6145 items used for the analysis. Nine predetermined frames were used for the coding. Results: Human Interest and fear/scaremongering frames dominated the global media coverage of the pandemic. We align our finding with the constructionist frame perspective which assumes that the media as information processor creates 'interpretative packages' in order to both reflect and add to the 'issue culture' because frames that paradigmatically dominate event coverage also dominate audience response. The language of the coverage of COVID-19 combines gloom, hope, precaution and frustration at varied proportions. Conclusion: We conclude that global media coverage of COVID-19 was high, but the framing lacks coherence and sufficient self-efficacy and this can be associated with media's obsession for breaking news.

Blood collectors have rapidly scaled up collection and distribution programs. METHODS: We developed a detailed simulation model of CCP donor recruitment, collection, production, and distribution processes. We ran our model using varying epidemic trajectories from 11 U.S. states and with key input parameters drawn from wide ranges of plausible values to identify key drivers of ability to scale collections capacity and meet demand for CCP. RESULTS: Utilization of available CCP collections capacity followed increases in COVID-19 hospital discharges with a lag. Utilization never exceeded 75% of available capacity in most simulations. Demand was met for most of the simulation period in most simulations, but a substantial portion of demand went unmet during early, sharp increases in hospitalizations. For epidemic trajectories that included multiple epidemic peaks, second wave demand could generally be met due to stockpiles established during the decline from an earlier peak. Apheresis machine capacity (number of machines) and probability that COVID-19 recovered individuals are willing to donate were the most important supply-side drivers of ability to meet demand. Recruitment capacity was important in states with early peaks. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemic trajectory was the most important determinant of ability to meet demand for CCP, although our simulations revealed several contributing operational drivers of CCP program success.","output":"Factors driving availability of COVID-19 convalescent plasma: Insights from a demand, production, and supply model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has become the most critical global health challenge in recent history. With SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was an unexpectedly high and specific prevalence of olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs). These high rates of hyposmia and hypogeusia, initially reported as up to 89% in European case series, led to the global inclusion of loss of taste and/or smell as a distinctive feature of COVID-19. However, there is emerging evidence that there are striking differences in the rates of OTDs in East Asian countries where the disease first emerged, as compared to Western countries (15.8 vs. 60.9%, p-value < 0.01). This may be driven by either variations in SARS-CoV-2 subtypes presenting to different global populations or genotypic differences in hosts which alter the predisposition of these different populations to the neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that rates of OTDs were significantly higher in objective testing for OTDs as compared to subjective testing (73.6 vs. 60.8%, p-value = 0.03), which is the methodology employed by most studies. Concurrently, it has also become evident that racial minorities across geographically disparate world populations suffer from disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality. In this mini review, we aim to delineate and explore the varying rates of olfactory and taste disorders amongst COVID-19 patients, by focusing on their underlying geographical, testing, ethnic and socioeconomic differences.

However, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 by dose in elderly populations in countries with high prevalence of the Gamma variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). MethodsWe conducted a test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 vaccine in adults aged 60 years or older during a Gamma-variant-associated epidemic in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, between 17 January and 2 July 2021. Cases and matched test-negative controls were individuals, identified from surveillance databases, who experienced an acute respiratory illness and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness by dose against RT-PCR-confirmed Covid-19, Covid-19 hospitalization, and Covid-19-related death.

Methods: We studied residents living in LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, who underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 1 to August 31, 2020, and examined predictors of all-cause death within 30 days after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We examined a broad range of risk factor categories including demographics, comorbidities, functional status, laboratory tests, and characteristics of the LTC facility and surrounding community were examined. In total, 304 potential predictors were evaluated for their association with mortality using machine learning (Random Forest). Results: A total of 64,733 residents of LTC, median age 86 (78, 91) years (31.8% men), underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, of whom 5029 (7.8%) tested positive. Thirty-day mortality rates were 28.7% (1442 deaths) after a positive test. Of 59,702 residents who tested negative, 2652 (4.4%) died within 30 days of testing. Predictors of mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection included age, functional status (e.g., activity of daily living score and pressure ulcer risk), male sex, undernutrition, dehydration risk, prior hospital contacts for respiratory illness, and duration of comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, COPD). Lower GFR, hemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte count, and serum albumin were associated with higher mortality. After combining all covariates to generate a risk index, mortality rate in the highest risk quartile was 48.3% compared with 7% in the first quartile (odds ratio 12.42, 95%CI: 6.67, 22.80, p < 0.001). Deaths continued to increase rapidly for 15 days after the positive test. Conclusions: LTC residents, particularly those with reduced functional status, comorbidities, and abnormalities on routine laboratory tests, are at high risk for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: This was a single-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in adult recipients >1.5 years post-HTx. Participants were randomized to standard care (control group) or to the mHeart Strategy (intervention group). For patients randomized to the mHeart strategy, multifaceted theory-based interventions were provided during the study period to optimize therapy management using the mHeart mobile application. Patient experience regarding their medication regimens were evaluated in a face-to-face interview. Medication adherence was assessed by performing self-reported questionnaires. A composite adherence score that included the SMAQ questionnaire, the coefficient of variation of drug levels and missing visits was also reported. Results: A total of 134 HTx recipients were randomized (intervention N = 71; control N = 63). Mean follow-up was 1.6 (SD 0.6) years. Improvement in adherence from baseline was significantly higher in the intervention group versus the control group according to the SMAQ questionnaire (85% vs. 46%, OR = 6.7 (2.9; 15.8), p-value < 0.001) and the composite score (51% vs. 23%, OR = 0.3 (0.1; 0.6), p-value = 0.001).

Therefore, identifying the primary sources of COVID-19 information among older adults can be valuable, as it can enable information on life-saving measures to be effectively disseminated to this population. METHODS: We analyzed the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement that was administrated from June 2020 through July 2020 (n=8,050). A survey-weighted logistic model was conducted to examine the association between sources of COVID-19 information Medicare beneficiaries most relied on (i.e., traditional news sources, social media, comments/guidance from government officials, other webpages/internet, friends/family members, and health care providers) and engaging in all three recommended preventive behaviors (i.e., mask wearing, social distancing, and handwashing). RESULTS: Among study participants, 89.8% engaged in all three recommended preventive behaviors. Approximately 59.3% of beneficiaries reported that they most relied upon traditional news sources for COVID-19 information; 11.4% reported health care providers; 10.6% reported comments/guidance from government officials; 8.8% reported other webpages/internet, 8.6% reported friends/family members; and 1.3% reported they relied upon social media. Beneficiaries who relied on comments/guidance from government officials for COVID-19 information (vs. traditional news sources) were more likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.20,2.35). However, those who relied on COVID-19 information from friends/family members (vs. traditional news sources) were less likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.44,0.73).

The only meta-analysis conducted in 2008 found that elevated serum S100B levels were associated with significantly worse survival in melanoma patients. Serum LDH is an established prognostic factor in patients with advanced melanoma. OBJECTIVE: To compare the discriminative and prognostic ability of serum S100B with that of serum LDH in patients with melanoma. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA Statement. The study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42019137138). RESULTS: A quantitative analysis of data from 6 eligible studies included 1,033 patients with cutaneous melanoma. The discriminative ability of serum S100B at identifying disease relapse [pooled Area Under the ROC (AUROC) 78.64 (95% CI 70.28; 87.01)] was significantly greater than the discriminative ability of serum LDH [AUROC 64.41 (95% CI 56.05; 7278)] (p=0.013). Ten eligible studies with 1,987 patients were included in the risk of death analysis. The prognostic performance of serum S100B [pooled estimate of adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.78 (95% CI 1.38; 2.29)] was independent but not superior to that of serum LDH [HR 1.60 (95% CI 1.36; 2.29)]. LIMITATIONS: A relatively small number of articles were eligible and there was considerable heterogeneity across the included studies.

The purpose of this study was to compare regional muscle oxyhemoglobin saturation and surface EMG data, measured under resting and dynamic conditions (treadmill run and strength exercises) by a recently developed wearable integrated quadriceps muscle oximetry/EMG system adopting smart textiles for EMG, with those obtained by using two \\"gold standard\\" commercial instrumentations for EMG and muscle oximetry. The validity and agreement between the wearable integrated muscle oximetry/EMG system and the \\"gold standard\\" instrumentations were assessed by using the Bland-Altman agreement plots to determine the bias. The results support the validity of the data provided by the wearable electronic garment developed purposely for the quadriceps muscle group and suggest the potential of using such device to measure strength and endurance exercises in vivo in various populations.","output":"Validation of Fabric-Based Thigh-Wearable EMG Sensors and Oximetry for Monitoring Quadriceps Activity during Strength and Endurance Exercises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recent evidence suggested that the higher titers of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody from convalescent plasma donors contributed to the clinical improvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies varied in each individual, and the precise factors that might govern such variation have not been elucidated. Objectives: To assess the factors associated with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia. Information of interest including demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody among COVID-19 CCP donors were collected. The correlation was assessed using multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 50 COVID-19 CCP donors with the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody of more than 1:320 and 33 donors with the titers of less than 1:320 were analyzed. Our analysis revealed that CCP donors with history of cough, fever, dyspnea, and pneumonia significantly had higher titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody compared to asymptomatic donors. Moreover, CCP donors with elevated levels of eosinophils and immature granulocytes and low levels of albumins had higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The titer of antibody was not affected by comorbidities of donors. Conclusions: CPP donors who had experience of symptomatic COVID-19 with high eosinophils level, high immature granulocytes and low albumin level have higher titers of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibody than those who experienced asymptomatic COVID-19. Our current findings may be used as the additional baseline criteria for selecting the donors of CCP for the management of COVID-19.","output":"The predictors of high titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody of convalescent plasma donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les pneumopathies infectieuses lies au COVID-19 prsentent actuellement un motif frquent dhospitalisation aux services de pneumologie.

We hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes might influence this variation. Using next generation sequencing, we analysed the class I and class II classical HLA genes of 147 individuals of European descent experiencing variable clinical outcomes following COVID-19 infection. Forty-nine of these patients were admitted to hospital with severe respiratory disease. They had no significant pre-existing comorbidities. We compared the results to those obtained from a group of 69 asymptomatic hospital workers who evidence of COVID exposure based on blood antibody testing. Allele frequencies in both the severe and asymptomatic groups were compared to local and national healthy controls with adjustments made for age and sex. With the inclusion of hospital staff who had reported localised symptoms only (limited to loss of smell/taste, n = 13) or systemic symptoms not requiring hospital treatment (n = 16), we carried out ordinal logistic regression modelling to determine the relative influence of age, BMI, sex and the presence of specific HLA genes on symptomatology. We found a significant difference in the allele frequency of HLA-DRB1*04:01 in the severe patient compared to the asymptomatic staff group (5.1% vs. 16.7%, P = .003 after adjustment for age and sex). There was a significantly lower frequency of the haplotype DQA1*01:01-DQB1*05:01-DRB1*01:01 in the asymptomatic group compared to the background population (P = .007). Ordinal logistic regression modelling confirmed the significant influence of DRB1*04:01 on the clinical severity of COVID-19 observed in the cohorts. These alleles are found in greater frequencies in the North Western European population. This regional study provides evidence that HLA genotype influences clinical outcome in COVID-19 infection.

Host immune responses to CoVs are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoVs are not well characterized4. Here, we show that lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in immune cells were highly susceptible to a murine CoV-mouse hepatitis virus. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic immune cells, higher splenic viral burden and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that constitutive Ly6e directly protects primary B cells from murine CoV infection. Our results show that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis.

METHODS This is a prospective, single-centre, three-arm randomised trial. A total of 99 eyes of 99 patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the 360 incision group (n=34), the upper-180 incision group (n=34) and the lower-180 incision group (n=31). Intraocular pressure (IOP), number of medications and complications were evaluated until 12 months after surgery. Surgical success (with or without medication) was defined as IOP 21 mmHg and 20% IOP reduction (criterion A) or IOP 15 mmHg and 20% IOP reduction (criterion B). RESULTS The mean IOP (SD) in all eyes was reduced from 18.6 (5.9) mmHg with 3.1 (1.1) medications to 13.7 (3.4) mmHg (20.8% reduction; p<0.001) with 1.4 (1.3) medications (p<0.001) at postoperative 12-month. Each group produced comparable mean reductions in both IOP and the number of medications throughout 12 months of follow-up.

Besides impact on quality of life, these symptoms (now called Post-COVID-Syndrome) may have an impact on functioning and may also hinder to participation in social life in affected people. However, little is known about developing such syndrome a for patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 who did not need hospitalization or intensive care. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in 1027 patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 was performed in two communities in Bavaria, Germany. The Rehabilitation-Needs-Survey (RehabNeS) including the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) on health-related quality of life, was used. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: In all, 97.5% of patients reported one symptom in the infection stage, such as fatigue, respiratory problems, limitations of the senses of taste and smell, fear and anxiety and other symptoms. In this time period, 84.1% of the participants experienced activity limitations and participation restrictions such as carrying out daily routines, handling stress, getting household tasks done, caring for/supporting others, and relaxing and leisure concerns. In all, 61.9% of participants reported persisting symptoms more than 3 months after infection. These were fatigue, sleep disturbances, respiratory problems, pain, fear and anxiety, and restrictions in movement; 49% of the participants reported activity limitations and participation restrictions. Predominately, these were handling stress, carrying out daily routines, looking after ones health, relaxing and leisure activities and doing house work. The impacts on quality of life and vocational performance were rather low. CONCLUSION: The results show that long-term symptoms after mild and moderate COVID-19 are common and lead to limitations of activities and participation. However, it seems that in most cases they are not severe and do not lead to frequent or serious issues with quality of life or work ability.","output":"The impact of Post-COVID-Syndrome on functioning C results from a community survey in patients after mild and moderate SARS-CoV-2-infections in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to compare ribavirin therapy versus supportive therapy only for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be localized on the surface of the protein.

Grossmans Continuous Active Learning (CAL) tool, which uses supervised machine learning. Results: Five observational studies and one clinical practice guideline were identified. Infection prevention measures identified in this rapid review included: social distancing and isolation, personal protective equipment (PPE) use and hygiene practices, screening, training and staffing policies. The use of PPE, laboratory screening tests, sick pay to staff, self-confinement of staff within the LTCFs for 7 or more days, maintaining maximum resident occupancy, training and social distancing significantly reduced the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among residents and/or staff of LTCFs (p<0.05). Practices such as hiring of temporary staff, not assigning staff to care separately for infected and uninfected residents, inability to isolate sick residents and infrequent cleaning of communal areas significantly increased the prevalence of infection among residents and/or staff of LTCFs (p<0.05).

One change has been to reduce elective neurosurgery cases, which has impacted neurosurgery education. Published literature is lacking about the healthcare services, education, and residents well-being during adaptation to the pandemic, especially in national referral hospitals in developing countries. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on current neurosurgical services during 2020. We evaluated 34 neurosurgery residents in Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital using a self-made questionnaire to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their surroundings, education process, and satisfaction with the currently adapted education program. We used the modified Maslach Burnout Inventory to assess burnout in the residents before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Neurosurgical residents spent more time studying neurosurgical theory (Mode 1C1.5h/day, p < 0.05) but spent less time learning neurosurgical skills (Mode 30 minC1 h/day, p < 0.05) compared to before the pandemic. The resident satisfaction mean score (scale 0C10) was 7.58 for live surgery and 8.53 for the microsurgical skills lab training program. On a scale of 1C10, the residents stress level increased after the pandemic but the change was not statistically significant (6.61  1.87, p > 0.05). The Modified Maslach Burnout inventory score was 3.02  3.74 during the pandemic, and increased from before the pandemic (2.41  3.18), but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemics have reduced the working hours and the clinical exposure of neurosurgical residents. Fortunately, this pandemic has led to a new opportunity to find many suitable learning methods which may decrease the risk of burnout. The psychological burden of residents is still worrisome, and planned management is necessary to sustain resident performance.","output":"New adaptation of neurosurgical practice and residency programs during the Covid-19 pandemic and their effects on neurosurgery resident satisfaction and welfare at the National General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The effective treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. We reported successful use of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in cases of severe COVID-19, but evidence from larger case series is still lacking. Methods: A multi-center retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of IVIg administered within two weeks of disease onset at a total dose of 2 g/kg body weight, in addition to standard care. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Efficacy of high-dose IVIg was assessed by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and the Kaplan-Meier curve adjusted by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis, and IPTW after multiple imputation (MI) analysis. Results: Overall, 26 patients who received high-dose IVIg with standard therapy and 89 patients who received standard therapy only were enrolled in this study. The IVIg group was associated with a lower 28-day mortality rate and less time to normalization of inflammatory markers including IL-6, IL-10, and ferritin compared with the control. The adjusted HR of 28-day mortality in high-dose IVIg group was 0.24 (95% CI 0.06-0.99, p<0.001) in IPTW model, and 0.27 (95% CI 0.10-0.57, p=0.031) in IPTW-MI model. In subgroup analysis, patients with no comorbidities or treated in the first week of disease were associated with more benefit from high-dose IVIg. Conclusions: High-dose IVIg administered in severe COVID-19 patients within 14 days of onset was linked to reduced 28-day mortality, more prominent with those having no comorbidities or treated at earlier stage.","output":"High-Dose Intravenous Immunoglobulin in Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multicenter Retrospective Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with rheumatic disease taking long-term disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are expected to have a higher risk of infection due to the alterations in cellular immunity associated with these medications. However, the potential risks associated with these drugs remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatic disease taking disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. METHODS: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease taking DMARDs with or without long-term (> 6 months) HCQ treatment prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were selected consecutively. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the history of symptoms suggestive of the disease and/or serum IgG positivity. During statistical analysis, the risk of COVID-19 infection was calculated in rheumatic patients taking DMARDs versus controls, as well as in patients taking HCQ versus those who are not. The ORs and 95% CIs were also calculated. The participants in the control group were selected from individuals without RD. RESULTS: A total of 800 patients with RD and 449 controls were analyzed. COVID-19 infection was detected in 16.8% of rheumatic patients versus 17.6% of controls (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.7-1.28). The proportions of COVID-19 infection in HCQ users versus non-users were 15.3% and 18.1%, respectively (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.61-1.26). These results remained unchanged after adjusting for all covariates using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that rheumatic patients taking DMARDs are not at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and that HCQ therapy has no influence on the risk of COVID-19 infection. Key points a? The risk of COVID-19 infection is not higher in patients with RD on DMARD therapy. a? The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in HCQ users has not significant difference relative to non-users. a? Significant percent of RD patients taking DMARDs had asymptomatic infection. a?

The efficacy of sizing and insertion was investigated, as well as complications. The literature was also reviewed to compare this material with other porcine-derived grafts in use for the management of lower eyelid retraction. METHODS This was a retrospective case series observing all patients who received lower eyelid Permacol implants by the two senior authors (AAM, TGH) for the management of lower eyelid retraction. Patient demographics, indications for surgery, graft size, degree of postoperative lid advancement, and complications were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 12 patients (16 eyelids) received Permacol implants for correction of lower eyelid retraction during the study period of 18 months (January 2015 to July 2017). Ten procedures were related to thyroid eye disease, 3 for reconstruction, 2 postcosmetic lower lid blepharoplasty, and one acquired anophthalmic socket. The average preoperative inferior scleral show (ISS) was 1.74 mm, and the average postoperative ISS was 0.82 mm. There was a mean lower eyelid elevation of 0.91 mm (p < 0.005, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and mean ratio of graft height:preoperative ISS was 3.8:1 over a median of 8 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Permacol is a safe and effective alternative to autologous tissues for use as a spacer in patients with lower eyelid retraction of varying etiologies.

When the two type2 biomarkers were assessed separately, there were limited correlations between either increased FeNO level or blood eosinophil count and decreased incidence of total exacerbation or frequency of mild exacerbation. Combining these two biomarkers strengthened their association with both incidence and frequency of acute exacerbation. In addition, during further assessment, simultaneously increased FeNO level and blood eosinophil count were associated with both mild and moderate acute exacerbation. Among the subjects included in this analysis, although the predictive capability was improved when these two biomarkers were combined, the improvement was not statistically significant, indicating the need to increase the sample size.

Substitution of L-arginine with D-arginine did not increase uptake or splice-correction activity. High concentration of serum significantly decreased the uptake and splice-correction activity of oligoarginine conjugates, but had much less effect on the conjugates containing X or B. In summary, incorporation of X/B into oligoarginine enhanced the antisense activity and serum-binding profile of CPP?PMO. Toxicity of X/B-containing conjugates was affected by the number of Xs, treatment time and concentration.

After more than one decades efforts, we tried to assess the improvements and problems of Chinas PHEMS between 2002 and 2012. METHODS: We conducted two rounds of national surveys and collected the data of the year 2002 and 2012, including all 32 provincial, 139 municipal, and 489 county CDCs. The municipal and county CDCs were selected by systematic random sampling. Twenty-one indicators of four stages (preparation, readiness, response and recovery) from the National Assessment Criteria for CDC Performance were chosen to assess the ten-year trends. RESULTS: At the preparation stage, organization, mechanisms, workforce, and stockpile across all levels and regions were significantly improved after one decades efforts. At the readiness stage, the capability for formulating an emergency plan was also significantly improved during the same period. At the response stage, internet-based direct reporting was 98.8%, and coping scores were nearly full points of ten in 2012. At the recovery stage, the capabilities were generally lower than expected. CONCLUSIONS: Due to forceful leadership, sounder regulations, and intensive resources, Chinas PHEMS has been improved at the preparation, readiness, and response stages; however, the recovery stage was still weak and could not meet the requirements of crisis management and preventive governance. In addition, CDCs in the Western region and counties lagged behind in performance on most indicators.

Our research introduces the constructivist concept of securitization according to the Copenhagen School to explain the structural handicap of global surgery and by that presents a structural explanation. We investigate the securitizing potential of surgical diseases in comparison to infectious diseases. Results: Surgical conditions are non-contagious without the risk for disease outbreaks, hardly preventable and their treatment is often infrastructurally demanding. These key features mark their low securitizing potential. Additionally, as PHEIC is the only securitizing institution in the realm of health, infectious diseases have a privileged role in health security.

It has been suggested that 3CLpro is catalytically active as a dimer, making the dimerization interface a target for antiviral development. Guided by structural analysis, here we introduced single amino acid substitutions at nine residues at three key sites of the dimer interface to assess their impact on dimerization and activity. We show that at site 1, alanine substitution of S1 or E166 increased by 2-fold or reduced relative activity, respectively. At site 2, alanine substitution of S10 or E14 eliminated activity, whereas K12A exhibited 60% relative activity.

As the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases in the community, migration into the acute care hospital setting intensifies, creating confusion when fever develops postoperatively. The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission. This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively. One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations. Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.","output":"Postoperative fever in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: ZyCoV-D, a DNA-based vaccine, showed promising safety and immunogenicity in a phase 1/2 trial. We now report the interim efficacy results of phase 3 clinical trial with ZyCoV-D vaccine in India. METHODS: We conducted an interim analysis of a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial at 49 centres in India. Healthy participants aged at least 12 years were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either ZyCov-D vaccine (Cadila Healthcare; 2 mg per dose) or placebo. An interactive web response system was used for randomisation (blocks of four) of participants as well as to enrol those aged 60 years and older with or without comorbid conditions, and those aged 12C17 years. It was also used to identify 600 participants for immunogenicity (blocks of six). Participants, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. Three doses of vaccine or placebo were administered intradermally via a needle-free injection system 28 days apart. The primary outcome was the number of participants with first occurrence of symptomatic RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 28 days after the third dose, until the targeted number of cases (interim analysis n=79, full analysis n=158) have been achieved. The analysis was done in the per-protocol population, which consisted of all participants with negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status who received three doses of vaccine or placebo. Assessment of safety and tolerability was based on the safety population, which consisted of all enrolled participants who were known to have received at least one dose of study vaccine or placebo. This trial is registered with Clinical Trial Registry India, CTRI/2021/01/030416, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Jan 16, and June 23, 2021 (data cutoff), 33 194 individuals were screened, of whom 5241 did not meet screening criteria and 27 703 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ZyCoV-D (n=13 851) or placebo (n=13 852). Per-protocol, 81 cases were eligible and included in efficacy analysis (20 of 12 350 in the ZyCoV-D group and 61 of 12 320 in placebo group). The ZyCoV-D vaccine efficacy was found to be 666% (95% CI 476C807). The occurrence of solicited adverse events was similar between the treatment groups (623 [449%] in the ZyCoV-D group vs 620 [447%] in the placebo group). There were two deaths (one in each group) reported at the data cutoff, neither of which was considered related to the study treatments. INTERPRETATION: In this interim analysis, ZyCoV-D vaccine was found to be efficacious, safe, and immunogenic in a phase 3 trial.

BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery has been associated with reduced long-term mortality compared to usual care for severe obesity which is particularly relevant in the COVID-19 era. Most prior studies involved the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) operation and there is less long-term data on the sleeve gastrectomy (SG). METHODS: In this retrospective, matched cohort study, patients with a body mass index 35a??kg/m2 who underwent bariatric surgery from January 2005 to September 2015 in three integrated health systems in the United States were matched to nonsurgical patients on site, age, sex, body mass index, diabetes status, insulin use, race/ethnicity, combined Charlson/Elixhauser comorbidity score, and prior health care utilization, with follow-up through September 2015. Each procedure (RYGB, SG) was compared to its own control group and the two surgical procedures were not directly compared to each other. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis investigated time to all-cause mortality (primary outcome) comparing each of the bariatric procedures to usual care. Secondary outcomes separately examined the incidence of cardiovascular-related death, cancer related-death, and diabetes related-death. RESULTS: Among 13,900 SG, 17,258 RYGB, and 87,965 nonsurgical patients, the 5-year follow-up rate was 70.9%, 72.0%, and 64.5%, respectively. RYGB and SG were each associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to nonsurgical patients at 5-years of follow-up (RYGB: HR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.35,0.54; SG: HR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.13,0.57) Similarly, RYGB was associated with a significantly lower 5-year risk of cardiovascular- (HR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.37), cancer- (HR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.76), and diabetes-related mortality (HR = 0.23; 95% CI:0.15, 0.36). There was not enough follow-up time to assess 5-year cause-specific mortality in SG patients, but at 3-years follow up, there was significantly lower risk of cardiovascular- (HR = 0.33; 95% CI:0.19, 0.58), cancer- (HR = 0.26; 95% CI:0.11, 0.59), and diabetes-related (HR = 0.15; 95% CI:0.04, 0.53) mortality for SG patients. CONCLUSION: This study confirms and extends prior findings of an association with better survival following bariatric surgery in RYGB patients compared to controls and separately demonstrates that the SG operation also appears to be associated with lower mortality compared to matched control patients with severe obesity that received usual care. These results help to inform the trade-offs between long-term benefits and risks of bariatric surgery.","output":"Reduction in Long-term Mortality after Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Bypass Compared to Non-surgical Patients with Severe Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has become the most devastating disease of the current century and spread over 216 countries around the world.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the sandwich approach, which is a new technique for creating a preperitoneal space. METHODS The operation was performed via the sandwich approach. We made sure to protect the preperitoneal fascia areolar layer when making the preperitoneal space. RESULTS We performed TAPP in 745 patients (876 hernias) treated between October 2006 and April 2015 at Himeji Medical Center and Kurashiki Central Hospital. Before October 2010, we did not use the sandwich approach, and recurrence was observed in three patients. From October 2010, we always used the sandwich approach and never experienced any cases of recurrence. Clavien-Dindo classification Grade 3 or higher postoperative complications occurred in 6 patients (0.8%) between October 2006 and April 2015.

Dynamics of the WPD-loop is an essential determinant of the catalytic activity of tyrosine-protein phosphatase zeta, an implicated protein in glioblastoma cells. The WPD-loop assumes a closed conformation upon substrate binding in order to position its catalytic aspartate to participate in catalysis. Herein, we explore the impact of NAZ2329, a recently identified allosteric inhibitor of tyrosine-protein phosphatase zeta, on the atomic flexibility of the WPD-loop. The druglikeness of NAZ2329 was assessed using the SwissADME online tool. The enzymatic complex was then subjected to conformational simulations using the AMBER molecular dynamics software. Structural analysis revealed that NAZ2329 induced an open conformation of the crucial WPD-loop, consequently impeding enzyme activity even upon substrate binding. Based on the molecular interactions between NAZ2329 and tyrosine-protein phosphatase zeta, a pharmacophore model was generated to exhibit the important functional moieties of NAZ2329. These findings provide an insightful molecular and structural mechanism in targeting tyrosine-protein phosphatase zeta as a therapeutic intervention for glioblastoma. We believe that this optimized pharmacophoric model will aid in the design of improved anti-tyrosine phosphatase agents, thus allowing for increased patient adherence.","output":"Allosteric inhibition induces an open WPD-loop: a new avenue towards glioblastoma therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19, just like SARS and MERS before it, is a disease caused by corona virus and can lead to severe respiratory diseases in humans. With the outbreak of novel corona virus, WHO on 30th January 2020 declared it a Public Health Emergency and further on 11th March 2020, Covid-19 disease was declared a pandemic. India in the initial stages of the pandemic dealt with it in a very effective manner. With timely implementation of lockdown, India was able to contain the spread of Covid-19 to some extent. However with the recently announced Unlock 1.0, the SARS CoV-2 is expected to spread. This study aims to track and analyze the Covid-19 situation in major states that constitute of 70 percent of the total cases. Thus the states selected for the study are: Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. These are the states which had more than ten thousand Covid-19 patients as/on June 10th 2020. The analysis period is from March 25th to June 10th and the data source is India Covid-19 tracker. To assess the previous and current Covid-19 situations in these states indicators such as Active rates, Recovery rate, Case fatality rate, Test positivity rate, tests per million, cases per million, test per confirmed case has been used. The study finds that although the absolute number of active cases may be rising, however it is showing a decreasing trend with an increase in recovery rates. With increasing number of Covid-19 cases, testing also has increased however not in the similar proportion and thus by developed nation standard we are lagging. With increasing TPR and cases per million, Delhi is well on its way to surpass even Mumbai which till now has proven to be worst hit in this pandemic. An interesting finding is that of test per confirmed case which shows that every 6th person in Maharashtra and every 8th in Delhi is showing positive result of Covid-19 test. Given such an increase and unlocked India, Delhi might soon enter into the third stage of community transmission where source of 50 percent or more cases would be unknown. There has been an increase in the Covid-19 related health infrastructure with the public-private partnership which involved both private hospitals and lab joining hands to battle Covid-19, however, affordability still remains an issue. If experts are to be believed, pandemic is not over because we have unlocked. The worst is yet to come as Covid-19 is predicted to peak in mid-July to August in India. Thus, it would be advisable to not venture out unnecessarily just because restrictions have been lifted.

Of 60 ICU patients with COVID-19 enrolled and analyzed in this prospective cohort study, 48 patients (80%) were alive at ICU discharge. HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels at ICU admission were elevated compared with a healthy control, both in ICU nonsurvivors and ICU survivors. HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels were higher in patients with a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (> 10), and the presence of septic shock or acute kidney injury.

Awareness campaigns are highly influential tools to expand healthy behavior practices among individuals during epidemics and pandemics. Mathematical modeling has become an important tool in analyzing the effects of media awareness on the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, a fractional-order epidemic model incorporating media coverage is presented and analyzed. The problem is formulated using susceptible, infectious and recovered compartmental model. A long-term memory effect modeled by a Caputo fractional derivative is included in each compartment to describe the evolution related to the individuals experiences. The well-posedness of the model is investigated in terms of global existence, positivity, and boundedness of solutions. Moreover, the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium points are given alongside their local stabilities. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, the global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria is proven according to the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] . Finally, numerical simulations are performed to support our analytical findings. It was found out that the long-term memory has no effect on the stability of the equilibrium points. However, for increased values of the fractional derivative order parameter, each solution reaches its equilibrium state more rapidly. Furthermore, it was observed that an increase of the media awareness parameter, decreases the magnitude of infected individuals, and consequently, the height of the epidemic peak.","output":"The influence of awareness campaigns on the spread of an infectious disease: a qualitative analysis of a fractional epidemic model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 214 countries across the world, creating uncertainty and affecting every institution and individual.

METHODS: A total of 463 patients with COVID-19 and who had at least one electrocardiogram recording from February 1 to March 19, 2020, in Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Arrhythmias occurred in 85 of 463 (18.4%) patients: atrial arrhythmias in 10.2%, junctional arrhythmias in 0.2%, ventricular arrhythmias in 3.5%, and conduction block in 7.3%. Compared with patients without arrhythmias, those with arrhythmias had higher mortality, both during the time from symptom onset (p < 0.001) and from admission to follow-up (p < 0.001). The frequencies of severe COVID-19 (44.7% vs. 21.2%; p < 0.001) and death (25.9% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.001) were higher in patients with arrhythmias than in those without arrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias could predict severity and mortality, their odds ratios (OR) were 4.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.35 to 8.40), 5.80 (95% CI 1.89 to 17.76) respectively for severity, and were 3.51 (95% CI 1.74 to 7.08), 3.41 (95% CI 1.13 to 10.24) respectively for mortality. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 were associated with the occurrence of arrhythmias (all p < 0.05).

During fusion, the palatal shelves migrate towards the embryonic midline to form a seam. Apoptotic elimination of medial edge epithelium (MEE) cells along this seam is required for the completion of palate fusion. METHODS Whole exome sequencing (WES) of six Chinese cleft palate families was applied to identify novel cleft palate-associated gene variants. Palatal fusion and immunofluorescence studies were performed in a murine palatal shelf organ culture model. Gene and protein expression were analyzed by qPCR and immunoblotting in murine MEE cells during seam formation in vivo. Mechanistic immunoprecipitation studies were performed in murine MEE cells in vitro. RESULTS WES identified Bcl-2 associated anthanogene 6 (BAG6) as a novel cleft palate-associated gene. In murine MEE cells, we discovered upregulation of Bag6 and the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) during seam formation in vivo. Using a palatal shelf organ culture model, we demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 enhances MEE cell apoptosis by promoting p300's acetylation of FoxO1, thereby promoting transcription of the pro-apoptotic Fas ligand (FasL). Subsequent gain- and loss-of-function studies in the organ culture model demonstrated that FasL is required for Bag6/acFoxO1-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Bax/caspase-3 signaling, MEE apoptosis, and palate fusion. Palatal shelf contact was shown to enhance Bag6 nuclear localization and upregulate nuclear acFoxO1 in MEE cells. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 and p300 co-operatively enhance FoxO1 acetylation to promote FasL-mediated MEE apoptosis during palate fusion.","output":"The cleft palate candidate gene BAG6 supports FoxO1 acetylation to promote FasL-mediated apoptosis during palate fusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus is a virus capable of mutating very quickly and many other viruses that arise due to mutations of this virus.

Both genetic factors and environmental factors play an important role in PD pathogenesis and response to treatment. However, PD is clinically heterogeneous and genetically complex, and the exact genetic or environmental causes of this disorder remain unclear. Various approaches for detecting disease-causing genes have recently been made available. In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have attracted attention for the identification of disease-associated loci of multifactorial disorders. This review introduces GWAS of PD, followed by a discussion about the limitations of GWAS and the major challenges facing geneticists in the post-GWAS era. Alternative strategies to address these challenges are then proposed, such as epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) using next-generation sequencing. To date, however, few reports have described these analyses, and the evidence remains insufficient to confidently identify or exclude rare variants or epigenetic changes in PD. Further analyses are therefore required, using sample sizes in the tens of thousands, extensive functional annotations, and highly targeted hypothesis testing.","output":"Genetic and epigenetic analyses of panic disorder in the post-GWAS era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quarantine and isolation are the most important public health measures used to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases among individuals.

The mechanisms by which DCIS lesions progress to an invasive state while others remain indolent are yet to be fully characterized and both diagnosis and treatment of this pre-invasive disease could benefit from better understanding the pathways involved. While a decreased expression of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in the tumor microenvironment of patients with DCIS breast cancer was linked to progression to invasive breast cancer (IBC), the downstream effector(s) contributing to this process remain elusive. The current report shows elevated expression of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5a (STAT5a) within the DCIS-like lesions in Cav-1 KO mice following estrogen treatment and inhibition of STAT5a expression prevented the formation of these mammary lesions. In addition, STAT5a overexpression in a human DCIS cell line (MCF10DCIS.com) promoted their invasion, a process accelerated by estrogen treatment and associated with increased levels of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) precursor. In sum, our results demonstrate a novel regulatory axis (Cav-1a?|STAT5aa?|MMP-9) in DCIS that is fully activated by the presence of estrogen.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This prospective study was conducted at Etlik Zbeyde Han?mWomen'sHealthPractices &Research Center between June 2020 and July 2020. The asymptomatic term PROM and miscarriage pregnant women were screened for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) positivity by using IgM and IgG antibody tests. All the positive cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All the patients answered 12 questions to determine their approach to COVID-19. RESULT Four of the 205 (2%) term PROM patients had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody tests, one of the 205 (0.5%) term PROM patients had a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test, and one of the 205 (% 0.5) term PROM patients had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody tests. All 230 miscarriage patients had negative IgM/IgG antibody tests. Four of the positive antibody cases had positive RT-PCR tests (2%) and were referred to a pandemic hospital. The patients thought that 93.2% and 95.6% of pregnant women with term PROM and miscarriage, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 would infect themselves, and 89.8% and 92.6%, respectively, would infect their children. The number of patients who would not consider pregnancy if they were not pregnant during this period was significantly higher in the term PROM (48.3%) compared to the miscarriage (27.8%) patients (p < 0.005).

For noroviruses, the contributions of T cells to viral clearance and vaccination have not been elucidated. We report here that both CD4 and CD8 T cells are required for efficient clearance of primary murine norovirus (MNV) infection from the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes. Further, long-lasting protective immunity was generated by oral live virus vaccination. Systemic vaccination with the MNV capsid protein also effectively protected against mucosal challenge, while vaccination with the capsid protein of the distantly related human Lordsdale virus provided partial protection. Fully effective vaccination required a broad immune response including CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells, but the importance of specific immune cell types varied between the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes. Perforin, but not interferon gamma, was required for clearance of MNV infection by adoptively transferred T lymphocytes from vaccinated hosts. These studies prove the feasibility of both mucosal and systemic vaccination against mucosal norovirus infection, demonstrate tissue specificity of norovirus immune cells, and indicate that efficient vaccination strategies should induce potent CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.","output":"Immune Mechanisms Responsible for Vaccination against and Clearance of Mucosal and Lymphatic Norovirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in December 2019 in China, numerous papers have been published describing a high frequency of liver injury associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, many of them proposing a link between these findings and patient outcomes.

Due to the significance of determining the risk factors for getting COVID-19 among MS patients, the present study was designed to assess the risk of infection following the pulse steroid therapy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all MS patients that received corticosteroids in Tehran from December 2019 to August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic spread. The subjects clinical records including their sex, age, the type of MS, the type of medication, the number of days using corticosteroids, the status of prednisolone intake, and the number of days receiving prednisolone after the corticosteroid therapy were obtained. Moreover, main outcomes such as COVID-19 infection and the occurrence of death were recorded by patients visits and follow-up phone calls. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by physicians according to the clinical performance of RT-PCR, chest CT scan, and antibody tests. RESULTS: Totally, 133 MS cases participated in the study, and the pulse therapy was completed for 104 (78.2%) patients up to 5?7 days. 89 (66.9%) cases used the prednisolone tablet following the pulse therapy. Overall, the infection by Covid-19 was observed in 8 (6%) cases, among whom 5 (71.4%) cases received the pulse therapy for 5?7 days and 4 (57.1%) cases had a history of taking the prednisolone tablet. The age of less than 40 years (OR = 1.03; 95% CI (0.23?4.51)), male sex (OR = 0.35; 95% CI (0.03?3.34)), and the RRMS type (OR = 2.87; 95% CI (0.52?15.72)) had no effect on the risk of Covid-19 infection. In addition, there was not statistically significant difference between subjects with the short-term pulse therapy duration (3?4 days) (OR 0.68 (0.12C3.74) and those with the long-term pulse therapy duration (5?7 days). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed between subjects taking prednisolone (OR = 1.62 (0.34C7.61) and those not taking prednisolone. Furthermore, there was no significant association between different medication groups and the risk of Covid-19 infection (p < 0.05). No death occurred due to Covid-19 infection among the subjects. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection was more common among female and younger patients as well as patients with a longer duration of the pulse therapy and prednisolone intake.

METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): On March 16, 2020, the state government of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, determined that a neurosurgical center with 44 ICU beds equipped with mechanical ventilators should immediately transfer all patients with neurological conditions to other institutions and prepare for patients who were critically ill with COVID-19. The staff, including physical therapists, were trained to handle patients with COVID-19, many of whom were developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with complex and multifactorial ventilatory support needs. Adjustments were made to the physical therapy routine and protocols. Following the stabilization of patients' respiratory condition, physical therapist interventions focused on restoring physical function. RESULTS: A total of 116 confirmed COVID-19 cases were treated from March 17 to May 17, 2020. Sixty percent were men (70) and 40% were women (46), with a median age of 59 years. Eighty-nine percent (103) underwent mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, of which 11% (11) were successfully extubated. Thirty percent (31) of patients underwent tracheostomy, and 26% of those (8) were successfully decannulated. Of the total patients, 57 patients died (mortality rate of 49%), 4 (3%) were transferred to another institution, 23 (20%) were discharged home, and 32 (28%) continued to be hospitalized. CONCLUSION: Physical therapists in the ICU can facilitate care for critical events such as intubation, patient positioning, ventilatory adjustments, extubation, and functional training. IMPACT: The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of physical therapists, specifically in the care of patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. The availability and expertise of physical therapists in the ICU are important for managing critical events such as intubation, patient positioning, ventilatory adjustments, extubation, and functional training.","output":"The First 60 Days: Physical Therapy in a Neurosurgical Center Converted Into a COVID-19 Center in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affects career anxiety of tourism students, who are the potential future employees of tourism and hospitality industry.

BmKTX is a polypeptide extracts from scorpion venom (PESV), which have attracted much attention from researchers in recent years. mBmKTX is a mutant polypeptide according to the amino acid sequence of BmKTX. We expressed it with the vector pGEX-4T-1 in Escherichia coli, and Caenorhabditis elegans were used as the animal model and fed with the strains. In this study, the expression of pGEX-mBmKTX was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and GST-mBmKTX purified from pGEX-mBmKTX as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion protein is approximately 30kDa. The secondary structure prediction shows that mBmKTX is mainly composed of approximately 13% -sheet and 86% loop. A food clearance assay and brood size assay indicated that the worms fed pGEX-mBmKTX ate more and had greater fecundity than those fed the empty vector. A lifespan analysis demonstrated that mBmKTX could significantly prolong the lifespan of C. elegans, with an increase of 22.5% compared with the control. Behavioral assays confirmed that mBmKTX had no influence on the locomotion of C. elegans. In addition, microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that there are 320 differentially expressed genes, 182 of which are related to reproduction, growth and lifespan.

This paper proposes a Best Practice Framework to mitigate these silos. METHODS: Mixed-methods research comprising key informant interviews with major stakeholders across both sectors; a survey of people with/without intellectual disability aged 60+ years; qualitative in-depth interviews; and survey of health professionals. RESULTS: There is an urgent need to develop inter-sectoral 'integrated care systems'. Key components include choice in accommodation; regular assessment of health and well-being indicators; development and adoption of nationally consistent policies/standards across integrated aged- and disability-care sectors; improved strategies for workforce planning; and upskilling of existing staff including place-based collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated service model requires collaboration on broader public policy instruments, appropriate planning and resourcing.

Stroke volume (SV) was determined before and after a fluid challenge with 250 mL crystalloids (Delta-SV) using esophageal Doppler monitoring. Responders were defined by an increase of Delta-SV > 10% after fluid challenge. B-lines were collected at four bilateral predefined zones (right and left anterior and lateral). Delta-B-line was defined as the number of newly appearing B-lines after a fluid challenge. Postoperative pulmonary complications were prospectively recorded according to European guidelines. In total, 197 patients were analyzed. After a first fluid challenge, 67% of patients were responders and 33% were non-responders. Delta-B-line was significantly higher in non-responders than responders [4 (2-7) vs 1 (0-3), p < 0.0001]. Delta-B-line was able to diagnose fluid non-responders with an area under the curve of 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.80, p < 0.0001).

However, the chronology of these effects is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to establish the early sequential effects of heat stress in bull sperm quality. Semen and blood samples of Nellore breed bulls were collected and distributed into control and testicular heat stress (scrotal bags/96 h) groups. Semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, abnormalities, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm lipid peroxidation, seminal plasma lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation. Blood plasma was also evaluated for lipid peroxidation. An increase in sperm abnormalities was observed 7 days following heat stress. After 14 days, sperm lipid peroxidation increased and mitochondrial membrane function, sperm motility, and plasma membrane integrity decreased. Heat stress effects were still observed after 21 days following heat stress. An increase in sperm DNA fragmentation was observed as a late effect after 28 days. Thus, the initial effects of heat stress (i.e., increasing sperm abnormalities and lipid peroxidation) suggest the presence of oxidative stress in the semen that alters mitochondrial function, sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and belatedly, DNA fragmentation. Although sperm abnormalities persisted and increased over time, sperm lipid peroxidation, in turn, increased only until 21 days after heat stress. In this regard, these findings provide a greater understanding of the chronological effects of experimentally induced heat stress on bovine sperm, providing valuable insights about spermatogenesis during the first 28 days following heat stress.","output":"Heat stress effects on bovine sperm cells: a chronological approach to early findings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Events in 2020 have sparked a reimagination of how both individuals and institutions should consider race, power, health, and marginalization in society.

However, whether this dominant variant can potentially spread through the cold chain and whether the spike protein affects virus stability after cold storage remain unclear. To compare the infectivity of two SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein with the D614 mutation (S-D614) and G614 mutation (S-G614), after different periods of refrigeration (4C) and freezing (-20C). We also determined the integrity of the viral RNA and the ability of the spike protein to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after storage at these conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more stable and infectious after storage at -20C than at 4C. Particularly, the S-G614 variant was found to be more stable than the S-D614 variant. The spike protein of the S-G614 variant had better binding ability with the ACE2 receptor than that of the S-D614 variant after storage at -20C for up to 30 days. Our findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, and their stability and infectivity up to 30 days depends on the spike variant.

We observed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, which further depends on the spike variant, that is, the ability of the spike protein to bind with the ACE2 receptor with higher efficiency. The high stability of the S-G614 variant also explains its rapid spread and infectivity.

Patients presented higher sCR1 levels in plasma than controls (p = 0.038). Furthermore, patients that carry the rs2274567*G allele (p.1208Arg) presented higher sCR1 levels than A/A (p.1208His/His) homozygotes (p = 0.036). This is the first study to validate the association of CR1 polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, as well as to evaluate sCR1 levels in a Latin American population. SNPs present in the regulatory and coding regions of this gene may be playing a key role in the observed association, probably by interfering in A? plaques clearance. Inhibition may be due to the increase in local sCR1 levels observed in patients, which may result from polymorphisms leading to larger isoforms of CR1 and/or structural alterations of the protein that makes it less functional, as well as increased vesiculation of the molecules.","output":"First Report of CR1 Polymorphisms and Soluble CR1 Levels Associated with Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visitors may be involved in infection transmission within healthcare settings; however, there is currently limited published data on this subject.

Positively interacting proteins were further tested using a mammalian cell hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation in the human A549 cell line, which has been shown to support SARS coronavirus replication. Out of the seven positive clones observed by yeast two-hybrid assay, only the Ddx5 (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp box polypeptide 5) protein showed specific interaction with SARS-CoV helicase. When expression of DdX5 was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA), SARS coronavirus replication was significantly inhibited in fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cells.

A clinical score predictive of COVID-19 based on readily assessed variables may be useful in settings with restricted or no access to molecular diagnostic tests. Methods: A score based on demographics and symptoms was developed in a cross-sectional study including patients attended in a dedicated COVID-19 screening unit. A backward stepwise logistic regression model was constructed and values for each variable were assigned according to their {beta} coefficient values in the final model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and its area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: A total of 464 patients were included: 98 (21.1%) COVID-19 and 366 (78.9%) non-COVID-19 patients. The score included variables independently associated with COVID-19 in the final model: age equal or above 60 years (2 points), fever (2), dyspnea (1), fatigue (1 point) and coryza (-1). Score values were significantly higher in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 patients: median (Interquartile Range), 3 (2-4), and 1 (0-2), respectively; P<0.001. The score had an AUC of 0.80 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.76-0.86). The specificity of scores equal or greater than 4 and 5 points were 90.4 (95%CI, 87.0-93.3) and 96.2 (95%CI, 93.7-97.9), respectively. Conclusions: This preliminary score based on patients symptoms is a feasible tool that may be useful in setting with restricted or no access to molecular tests in a pandemic period, owing to the high specificity.

Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. RESULTS: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information.

It causes acute respiratory distress syndrome and results in a high mortality rate if pneumonia is involved. Currently, it is difficult to quickly identify asymptomatic cases or COVID-19 patients with pneumonia due to limited access to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid tests and CT scans, which facilitates the spread of the disease at the community level, and contributes to the overwhelming of medical resources in intensive care units. Goal This study aimed to develop a scientific and rigorous clinical diagnostic tool for the rapid prediction of COVID-19 cases based on a COVID-19 clinical case database in China, and to assist global frontline doctors to efficiently and precisely diagnose asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and cases who had a false-negative RT-PCR test result. Methods With online consent, and the approval of the ethics committee of Zhongshan Hospital Fudan Unversity (approval number B2020-032R) to ensure that patient privacy is protected, clinical information has been uploaded in real-time through the New Coronavirus Intelligent Auto-diagnostic Assistant Application of cloud plus terminal (nCapp) by doctors from different cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Harbin, Dalian, Wuxi, Qingdao, Rizhao, and Bengbu) during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. By quality control and data anonymization on the platform, a total of 3,249 cases from COVID-19 high-risk groups were collected. These patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and chest CT scans, both of which were used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia. In particular, the dataset included 137 indeterminate cases who initially did not have RT-PCR tests and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, 62 suspected cases who initially had false-negative RT-PCR test results and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, and 122 asymptomatic cases who had positive RT-PCR test results, amongst whom 31 cases were diagnosed. We also integrated the function of a survey in nCapp to collect user feedback from frontline doctors. Findings We applied the statistical method of a multi-factor regression model to the training dataset (1,624 cases) and developed a prediction model for COVID-19 with 9 clinical indicators that are fast and accessible: 'Residing or visiting history in epidemic regions', 'Exposure history to COVID-19 patient', 'Dry cough', 'Fatigue', 'Breathlessness', 'No body temperature decrease after antibiotic treatment', 'Fingertip blood oxygen saturation<=93%', 'Lymphopenia', and 'C-reactive protein (CRP) increased'. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the model was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.89) in the training dataset and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.86) in the validation dataset (1,625 cases). To ensure the sensitivity of the model, we used a cutoff value of 0.09. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 98.0% (95% CI: 96.9%, 99.1%) and 17.3% (95% CI: 15.0%, 19.6%), respectively, in the training dataset, and 96.5% (95% CI: 95.1%, 98.0%) and 18.8% (95% CI: 16.4%, 21.2%), respectively, in the validation dataset. In the subset of the 137 indeterminate cases who initially did not have RT-PCR tests and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, the model predicted 132 cases, accounting for 96.4% (95% CI: 91.7%, 98.8%) of the cases. In the subset of the 62 suspected cases who initially had false-negative RT-PCR test results and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, the model predicted 59 cases, accounting for 95.2% (95% CI: 86.5%, 99.0%) of the cases. Considering the specificity of the model, we used a cutoff value of 0.32. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 83.5% (95% CI: 80.5%, 86.4%) and 83.2% (95% CI: 80.9%, 85.5%), respectively, in the training dataset, and 79.6% (95% CI: 76.4%, 82.8%) and 81.3% (95% CI: 78.9%, 83.7%), respectively, in the validation dataset, which is very close to the published AI model. The results of the online survey 'Questionnaire Star' showed that 90.9% of nCapp users in WeChat mini programs were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with the tool. The WeChat mini program received a significantly higher satisfaction rate than other platforms, especially for 'availability and sharing convenience of the App' and 'fast speed of log-in and data entry'. Discussion With the assistance of nCapp, a mobile-based diagnostic tool developed from a large database that we collected from COVID-19 high-risk groups in China, frontline doctors can rapidly identify asymptomatic patients and avoid misdiagnoses of cases with false-negative RT-PCR results. These patients require timely isolation or close medical supervision. By applying the model, medical resources can be allocated more reasonably, and missed diagnoses can be reduced. In addition, further education and interaction among medical professionals can improve the diagnostic efficiency for COVID-19, thus avoiding the transmission of the disease from asymptomatic patients at the community level.","output":"A Large-Scale Clinical Validation Study Using nCapp Cloud Plus Terminal by Frontline Doctors for the Rapid Diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Saudi Arabia ranks second in the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Optimal thromboprophylaxis is unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the characteristics of patients with a confirmed thrombotic complication including inflammatory and hemostatic parameters, compare patients affected by arterial vs venous events and examine differences between survivors and non-survivors. We reviewed compliance with thromboprophylaxis and explored how the implementation of a severity-adjusted protocol could have influenced outcome. METHODS: Single-cohort retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted, from March 3 to May 3 2020, to the Infanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, epicenter of the Spanish outbreak. RESULTS: Among 1127 patients, 80 thrombotic events were diagnosed in 69 patients (6.1% of the entire cohort). Forty-three patients (62%) suffered venous thromboembolism, 18 (26%) arterial episodes and 6 (9%) concurrent venous and arterial thrombosis. Most patients (90%) with a confirmed thrombotic complication where under low-molecular-weight heparin treatment. Overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was rare. Initial ISTH DIC score and pre-event CRP were significantly higher among non-survivors. In multivariate analysis, arterial localization was an independent predictor of mortality (OR = 18, 95% CI: 2.4-142, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite quasi-universal thromboprophylaxis, COVID-19 lead to a myriad of arterial and venous thrombotic events. Considering the subgroup of patients with thrombotic episodes, arterial events appeared earlier in the course of disease and conferred very poor prognosis, and an ISTH DIC score &#8805; 3 at presentation was identified as a potential predictor of mortality. Severity-adjusted thromboprophylaxis seemed to decrease the number of events and could have influenced mortality.

We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of sonographic assessment of diaphragmatic thickness and excursion in predicting successful extubation of preterm infants from invasive conventional mechanical ventilation. Preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation who required invasive conventional mechanical ventilation were evaluated by diaphragmatic sonography within 1 h of their planned extubation. Infants were classified into successful or failed extubation groups based on their ability to stay off invasive mechanical ventilation for 72 h after extubation. Inspiratory and expiratory thickness plus excursion of the right and left hemidiaphragm as well as diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) measures were compared between groups. We included 43 eligible infants, of whom 34 infants succeeded and 9 infants failed extubation. Infants in the successful extubation group had a significantly higher expiratory thickness of the right and left hemidiaphragm, excursion of the right and left hemidiaphragm, inspiratory thickness of the left hemidiaphragm, and DTF of the left hemidiaphragm compared with infants who failed extubation. The receiver-operating characteristic curves showed that excursion of the right and left hemidiaphragm has the highest significant accuracy in predicting successful extubation of preterm infants among all diaphragmatic parameters (AUC is 0.98 and 0.96, respectively; p value < 0.001 for both).

We present a formalization of change impact analysis with machine-checked proofs of correctness in the Coq proof assistant. Our formal model factors out domain-specific concerns and captures system components and their interrelations in terms of dependency graphs. Using compositionality, we also capture hierarchical impact analysis formally for the first time, which, e.g., can capture when impacted files are used to locate impacted tests inside those files. We refined our verified impact analysis for performance, extracted it to efficient executable OCaml code, and integrated it with a regression test selection tool, one regression proof selection tool, and one build system, replacing their existing impact analyses. We then evaluated the resulting toolchains on several open source projects, and our results show that the toolchains run with only small differences compared to the original running time.

Thus, the aim of this study was to design and characterize modified mRNA obtained using the above plasmid DNA vaccines as a template. To select the most promising protocol for creating highly immunogenic mRNA vaccines, we performed a comparative analysis of mRNA modifications aimed at increasing its translational activity and decreasing toxicity.

Eight mRNA-GFP variants with different modifications (M0CM7) were obtained using the classic cap(1), its chemical analog ARCA (anti-reverse cap analog), pseudouridine (), N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in different ratios. Modifications M2, M6, and M7, which provided the most intensive fluorescence of transfected HEK293FT cells were used for template synthesis when mRNA encoded influenza immunogens AgH1, AgH3, and AgM2. Virus specific antibodies were registered in groups of animals immunized with a mix of mRNAs encoding AgH1, AgH3, and AgM2, which contained either ARCA (with inclusions of 100%  and 20% m6A (M6)) or a classic cap(1) (with 100% substitution of U with  (M7)).

INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Reproductive outcomes, effects on gametes, pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal complications. RESULT(S): Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Gonadotropin-dependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-Coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum.

Although effective therapies exist, only about half of the patients seem to benefit from them when we consider treatment refusal, dropout rates, and residual symptoms. Thus, providing effective augmentation to standard therapies could improve existing treatments. Group compassion-focused interventions have shown promise for reducing depression, anxiety, and avoidance related to various clinical problems, but this approach has never been evaluated for OCD individuals. However, cultivating compassion for self and others seems crucial for OCD patients, given the accumulating research suggesting that fear of guilt, along with isolation and self-criticism, can strongly contribute to the development and maintenance of OCD. The primary aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability, tolerability, and effectiveness of an 8-week group compassion-focused intervention for reducing OCD symptoms, depression, fear of guilt and self-criticism, and increasing common humanity and compassionate self-reassuring skills in treatment-resistant OCD patients. Using a multiple baseline experimental design, the intervention was evaluated in a sample of OCD patients (N = 8) who had completed at least 6 months of CBT treatment for OCD, but who continued to suffer from significant symptoms. Participants were randomized to different baseline assessment lengths; they then received 8 weekly, 120-min group sessions of compassion-focused therapy for OCD (CFT-OCD), and then were tested again at post-treatment and at 1 month follow up. Despite the adverse external circumstances (post-treatment and follow-up data collection were carried out, respectively, at the beginning and in the middle of the Italian lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic), by the end of treatment, all participants demonstrated reliable decreases in OCD symptoms, and these improvements were maintained at 4-week follow-up for seven of eight participants. The intervention was also associated with improvements in fear of guilt, self-criticism, and self-reassurance, but less consistent improvements in depression and common humanity. Participants reported high levels of acceptability of and satisfaction with the intervention. Results suggest that the intervention may be beneficial as either a stand-alone treatment or as an augmentation to other treatments.","output":"Compassion-Focused Group Therapy for Treatment-Resistant OCD: Initial Evaluation Using a Multiple Baseline Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are still incompletely understood. Neurological manifestations may be due to direct viral effect on neurons and glial cells, to an immune-mediated response to the virus, or to a hypercoagulable state and associated endothelial damage, as well as to severe systemic disease with prolonged intensive care unit stay. OBJECTIVE: To describe two patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed recovery of consciousness after sedation withdrawal, in whom MRI disclosed multifocal white matter brain lesions, compatible with the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. METHODS: Observational report of two cases of severe COVID-19 infection in patients from two tertiary hospitals in S?o Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: These patients underwent neurologic and systemic evaluation for delayed awakening after sedation withdrawal. MRI displayed multifocal centrum semiovale lesions, suggestive of demyelinating inflammation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in both cases. CONCLUSION: A recurrent pattern of multifocal white matter lesions can occur in COVID-19 patients, possibly associated with delayed awakening.

Moreover, drainage in the head and neck area needs cosmetic care, especially in the pediatric population. In this report, we introduce our method of percutaneous abscess drainage using an indwelling needle cannula. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten pediatric and five adult patients with cervical and/or facial abscess treated with this drainage method were retrospectively reviewed. Using an indwelling needle cannula (18-14 G Surflow?, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), abscesses were penetrated under ultrasonic examination. Once purulent retention was identified, the inner metal needle was removed and the outer elastic needle was left and fixed. The outer needle was connected to the tube for continuous suction drainage for large abscess. RESULTS: The primary diseases of these abscesses were cervical abscess of dental origin (5), purulent lymphadenitis (3), pyriform sinus fistula (2) and subperiosteal abscess due to mastoiditis (2), circumorbital cellulitis (1), infection of Warthin's tumor (1), and unknown origin (1). The median (range) duration of drainage was 4 days (3C9 days). Abscesses were successfully treated, and no patients required additional incision for abscess drainage. No apparent scars after drainage were observed. CONCLUSION: This technique resembles the usual venous placement of an indwelling needle cannula and is thought to be familiar to physicians. Although simple and inexpensive, this drainage is safe, effective, and minimally invasive for the treatment of abscess.","output":"Minimally invasive and inexpensive percutaneous abscess drainage using an indwelling needle cannula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon helps infected monkeys breathe more easily.","output":"Drug may help treat SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by disabling fatigue and postexertional malaise. We developed a provocation paradigm with two submaximal bicycle exercise stress tests on consecutive days bracketed by magnetic resonance imaging, orthostatic intolerance, and symptom assessments before and after exercise in order to induce objective changes of exercise induced symptom exacerbation and cognitive dysfunction. Method: Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) scans were performed while at rest on the preexercise and postexercise days in 34 ME/CFS and 24 control subjects. Seed regions from the FSL data library with significant BOLD signals were nodes that clustered into networks using independent component analysis. Differences in signal amplitudes between groups on pre- and post-exercise days were determined by general linear model and ANOVA. Results: The most striking exercise-induced effect in ME/CFS was the increased spontaneous activity in the medial prefrontal cortex that is the anterior node of the Default Mode Network (DMN). In contrast, this region had decreased activation for controls. Overall, controls had higher BOLD signals suggesting reduced global cerebral blood flow in ME/CFS. Conclusion: The dynamic increase in activation of the anterior DMN node after exercise may be a biomarker of postexertional malaise and symptom exacerbation in CFS. The specificity of this postexertional finding in ME/CFS can now be assessed by comparison to post-COVID fatigue, Gulf War Illness, fibromyalgia, chronic idiopathic fatigue, and fatigue in systemic medical and psychiatric diseases.","output":"Submaximal Exercise Provokes Increased Activation of the Anterior Default Mode Network During the Resting State as a Biomarker of Postexertional Malaise in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Catheter management strategies for suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) remain a major challenge in intensive care units (ICUs). The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and mortality attributable to CRBSIs in those patients. METHODS: A population-based surveillance on suspected CRBSI was conducted from 2009 to 2018 in a tertiary care hospital in China. We used the results of catheter tip culture to identify patients with suspected CRBSIs. Demographics, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, interventions, and microorganism culture results were analysed and compared between patients with and without confirmed CRBSIs. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the risk factors for CRBSIs, and attributable mortality was evaluated with a time-varying Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: In total, 686 patients with 795 episodes of suspected CRBSIs were included; 19.2% (153/795) episodes were confirmed as CRBSIs, and 17.4% (119/686) patients died within 30 days. The multifactor model shows that CRBSIs were associated with fever, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hyperglycaemia and the use of continuous renal replacement therapy. The AUC was 77.0% (95% CI 73.3%C80.7%). The population attributable mortality fraction of CRBSI in patients was 18.2%, and mortality rate did not differ significantly between patients with and without CRBSIs (95% CI 0.464C1.279, P = 0.312). CONCLUSIONS: This initial model based on the SIRS criteria is relatively better at identifying patients with CRBSI but only in domains of the sensitivity. There were no significant differences in attributable mortality due to CRBSI and other causes in patients with suspected CRBSI, which prompt catheter removal and re-insertion of new catheter may not benefit patients with suspected CRBSIs.

Eventually, there was a considerable decrease in volunteer blood donations. Regular transfusions and follow-up of patients with thalassemia major (TM) should be maintained during this period. It is possible that the treatment of the patients with TM may hinder due to the difficulty of reaching the treatment center and the difficulty of blood supply. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in the follow-up and treatment of the patients with TM during the outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with TM who were followed up in our center without COVID-19 contact history and symptoms were included in this study. The demographic features and red blood cell volume per kilogram they received, pretransfusion hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF) level, biochemical parameters, and transfusion interval were recorded. The difference between the arithmetic mean of the data before and during the pandemic was evaluated. RESULTS: In this study, 61 patients with TM (32 males/29 females, mean age 13.96.8 y) were evaluated. The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin value was 9.140.77 g/dL and 8.87 0.80 g/dL before and during the pandemic, respectively (P=0.023). There was no difference between before and during the pandemic concerning transfusion interval and transfusion volume. However, SF levels increased above 1000 ng/mL in 16.6% of patients. CONCLUSION: Although blood donation decreased significantly during the pandemic, it was observed in this study that the blood needs of patients with TM could be provided. The results of the SF level showed that the management of chelation therapy should be more meticulous.

Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to study predictors of graft and patient outcomes at 28 days after coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis. RESULTS: We included 130 kidney transplant recipients, with a mean age of 48.7(14.4) years. Fifty-nine patients were managed at home with daily follow-up utilizing a dedicated clinic, while 71 (54.6%) required hospital admission. Acute kidney injury occurred in 35 (26.9%) patients. Secondary infections occurred in 38 (29.2%) patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing was carried out in 84 patients, of whom 70 tested positive for IgG and/or IgM. Fourteen patients died (10.8%).

The novel three-dimensional network-structured catalyst, comprising of -MnO2 nanosheets grown on woven carbon microfibers (MnO2 nanosheets/carbon microfiber), was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach. Catalytic ozonation performance of Ibuprofen removal in water using the new catalyst proves a significant enhancement, where Ibuprofen removal efficiency of close to 90% was achieved with a catalyst loading of 1% (w/v). In contrast, conventional ozonation was only able to achieve 65% removal efficiency under the same operating condition. The enhanced performance with the new catalyst could be attributed to its significantly increased available surface active sites and improved mass transfer of reaction media, as a result of the special surface and structure properties of this new three-dimensional network-structured catalyst.

Malaysia recorded as of July 12, a total of 8718 persons tested positive for Covid-19, with 122 deaths, and 8519 fully recovered, out of a population of 32.4 million. Unprecedented public health and socio-economic policy have been formulated by the Malaysian government to control the catastrophic pandemic spread and to resolve deep socio-economic disruptions and uncertainties. For Malaysia, a major pandemic control policy measure is the Movement Control Order (MCO) over a period of 24 weeks from March 18 to August 31, 2020. This MCO decision is facilitated by the use of epidemiology models such as SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. This MCO has resulted in major socio-economic disruptions and uncertainty. To overcome these immense economic disruptions and uncertainty, several major economic stimulation packages amounting to RM 250 billion, equivalent to 17% of Malaysia 2019 GDP, are formulated to revitalize Malaysias economy. Epidemiology models are widely used worldwide to formulate socially acceptable policy measures for breaking the infection transmission chain and for enhancing economic resilience. Since the start of Covid-19 outbreak in Malaysia, we use and continuously calibrate the existing SIR-based in-house FluSiM@USM model to examine the effectiveness of various intervention and mitigation measures in reducing the pandemic burden, the result of which is presented in this chapter. Our epidemic model analysis suggests that MCO has managed to effectively control the spread of Covid-19 by significantly reducing the effective reproduction number Rt, from 3.5 to 0.2 over a period of 12 weeks. The constantly evolving knowledge of Covid-19 transmission dynamics requires regular data updates and model enhancements. Collaboration and communication between modelers and public health authorities are essential to formulating and supporting complex public health policy decision. This chapter highlights the effectiveness of MCO in controlling Covid-19 spread. It discusses major socio-economic disruptions and uncertainties caused by Covid-19 and MCO to the Malaysian and world economy. Guided by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction developed by the United Nations, this chapter will focus the deliberation on the trade-offs between saving life and saving the economy. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Modeling Effectiveness of Partial Lockdown in Breaking Covid-19 Transmission Chain in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: DNA molecular techniques, including multiple microsatellite analysis and genome-wide SNP-genotyping, were used to unlock and prove the poaching of wild goats (Capra caucasica) in an area of the Caucasian mountains in Russia. ABSTRACT: Poaching is one of the major types of wildlife crime in Russia. Remnants of goats (presumably the wild endemic species, the Caucasian tur) were found in an area of the Caucasian mountains. The case study involves a suspected poacher whose vehicle was found to have two duffel bags containing pieces of a carcass, which he claimed was that of a goat from his flock. The aim of the forensic genetic analysis for this case was to (i) establish individual identity and (ii) perform species identification. DNA typing based on fourteen microsatellites revealed that STR-genotypes generated from pieces of evidence found at crime scene fully matched those obtained from the evidence seized from the suspect. The results of genome-wide SNP-genotyping, using Illumina Goat SNP50 BeadChip, provided evidence that the poached animal was a wild Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica). Thus, based on comprehensive molecular genetic analysis, evidence of poaching was obtained and sent to local authorities. To our knowledge, this case study is the first to attempt to use DNA chips in wildlife forensics of ungulates.","output":"Combination of Multiple Microsatellite Analysis and Genome-Wide SNP Genotyping Helps to Solve Wildlife Crime: A Case Study of Poaching of a Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica) in Russian Mountain National Park"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recognizing human non-speech vocalizations is an important task and has broad applications such as automatic sound transcription and health condition monitoring.

The severity and mortality excessively affected the frail elderly with co-existing medical diseases. There is growing evidence that cross-talk between the gut microbiome, Vitamin D and RAS/ACE2 system is essential for a balanced functioning of the elderly immune system and in regulating inflammation. In this review, we hypothesize that the state of gut microbiome, prior to infection determines the outcome associated with COVID-19 sepsis and may also be a critical factor in success to vaccination. METHODS: Articles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using a combination of terms SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Inflammaging, Immune-senescence, Gut microbiome, Vitamin D, RAS/ACE2, Vaccination. CONCLUSION: Evidence indicates a complex association between gut microbiota, ACE-2 expression and Vitamin D in COVID-19 severity. Status of gut microbiome is highly predictive of the blood molecular signatures and inflammatory markers and host responses to infection. Vitamin D has immunomodulatory function in innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection. Anti-inflammatory functions of Vit D include regulation of gut microbiome and maintaining microbial diversity. It promotes growth of gut-friendly commensal strains of Bifida and Fermicutus species. In addition, Vitamin D is a negative regulator for expression of renin and interacts with the RAS/ ACE/ACE-2 signaling axis. Collectively, this triad may be the critical, link in determination of outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presented data are empirical and informative. Further research using advanced systems biology techniques and artificial intelligence-assisted integration could assist with correlation of the gut microbiome with sepsis and vaccine responses. Modulating these factors may impact in guiding the success of vaccines and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infections.","output":"Gut microbiome, Vitamin D, ACE2 interactions are critical factors in immune-senescence and inflammaging: key for vaccine response and severity of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article constructs and demonstrates an alternate probabilistic approach (using incidence rate restricted model), compared with the deterministic mathematical models such as SIR, to capture the impact of healthcare efforts on the prevalence rate of the COVID-19s infectivity, hospitalization, recovery, and mortality in the eastern, central, mountain, and pacific time zone states in the USA. We add additional new properties for the incidence rate restricted Poisson probability distribution. With new properties, our method becomes feasible to comprehend not only the patterns of the prevalence rate of the COVID-19s infectivity, hospitalization, recovery, and mortality but also to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of social distancing, healthcare managements efforts to hospitalize the patients, the patients immunity to recover, and lastly the unfortunate mortality itself.

Several non-intuitive findings in the data results are noticed. They include the existence of imbalance, different vulnerability, and risk reduction in these four regions. For example, the impact of healthcare efforts is high in the recovery category in the pacific states. The impact is less in the hospitalization category in the mountain states. The least impact is seen in the infectivity category in the eastern zone states. A few thoughts on future research work are cited.

The two expressions are very often used interchangeably especially when it comes to their application. In this paper, the differences between business continuity and disaster recovery are discussed. The disaster management cycle is also addressed in order to highlight the importance of having plans before, during and after the occurrence of an incident. Design/methodology/approach A review of the extant literature on business continuity and disaster recovery was made. A number of different views were then presented in order to provide a better understanding of the two concepts and their potential overlap/connection. The literature review was conducted in 2020 using a variety of academic resources ranging from journal articles to text books and credible Internet websites. Relevant journal articles were obtained from two primary databases: Emerald Insight and EBSCOhost. Keywords, such as DRP, continuity, disruption and BCP, were mainly used to facilitate the search for these resources and other related material. Findings Reviewing the literature revealed that BCP and DRP are not the same. Yet, they are used interchangeably very often in the literature. This indicates a possible relationship/overlap between the two. The relationship between BCP and DRP can be viewed from a variety of perspectives, which altogether provide a better understanding of their purposes and application. Practical implications On top of the need to differentiate between business continuity and disaster recovery, the widespread impact of the current COVID-19 crisis, especially on businesses and supply chains, has unfolded the necessity to deal with business disruptions in all their forms and the significance of quick and effective recovery. This research clarifies the purpose of BCP and the purpose of DRP and their role in combating impacts of disruptive incidents on businesses and organizations. Originality/value BCP and DRP are discussed extensively in the literature. Yet, few studies attempted to address the precise functions of the two resulting in an obvious confusion between their meaning and purpose which subsequently reduced the uniqueness of their application and the uniqueness of the application of each. Only a small minority of practitioners and academics recognise the precise differences between the two.

Methodology: The simplified molecular-input line-entry system of huperzine A was retrieved from the PubChem database, and its targets were predicted using SwissTargetPrediction. These targets were matched with the proteins deposited in DisGeNET for Alzheimer disease and enriched in STRING to identify the probably regulated pathways, cellular components, biological processes, and molecular function. Furthermore, huperzine A was docked against acetylcholinesterase using AutoDock Vina, and simulations were performed with the Gromacs package to take into account the dynamics of the system and its effect on the stability and function of the ligands. Results: A total of 100 targets were predicted to be targeted by huperzine A, of which 42 were regulated at a minimum probability of 0.05.

Under the current COVID-19 pandemic conditions, natural therapeutics with least side effects are the need of the hour to save the patients, especially, which are pre-affected with other medical complications. Although, plants are the major sources of terpenoids; however, for the environmental concerns, the global interest has shifted to the biocatalytic production of molecules from microbial sources. The gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a suitable host in this regard due to its GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status, ease in genetic manipulations and wide industrial acceptability. The B. subtilis synthesizes its terpenoid molecules from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, a common route in almost all microbial strains.

This randomized clinical trial compares the results of full pulpotomy using two calcium-silicate cements, i.e., mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) cement, with RCT in mature permanent teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 157 carious pulp exposure cases in two academic centers with/without established IP were selected/included/randomly appointed to three study arms; (i) RCT (n = 51) as the reference treatment, (ii) pulpotomy with ProRoot MTA (PMTA; n = 55), and (iii) pulpotomy with CEM cement (PCEM; n = 51) as two alternative VPT treatments. Two-year clinical/radiographic results were the outcomes of interest. Data were statistically analyzed through the analysis of variance, chi-square, Fisher exact test, and KruskalCWallis.

We hypothesized that UCLR rates relative to games played would be increased and pitching workload would be decreased in 2020 compared with previous seasons. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: An extensive online search using publicly available data was conducted to identify all MLB pitchers who underwent UCLR between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020. Only pitchers who were competing at the MLB level when undergoing reconstruction were included. Player characteristics and surgery date, as well as career and season of surgery pitching workload, were collected for all included pitchers.

Methods: It is a prospective descriptive study conducted over a 5-month period from January 20, 2020 to June 12, 2020 of all children aged 0 to 18 years consulting the pediatric medical emergency department of the children's hospital in Rabat for home injuries. Results: A total of 13616 patients were admitted during the period from January 20, 2020 to June 12, 2020. Among them, 296 children were admitted for home injuries representing 1.5% of the total admissions before the lockdown and 4.3% during the lockdown. The mean age of the patients was 4 years. Most home injuries occurred in the evening from 6 pm onwards. The most frequent home injuries were foreign body ingestions (33.2%), drug intoxications (16.9%), CO intoxications (16.6%), and caustic ingestions (13.6%). The average admission delay after the accident was 14 hours before and during containment. During the confinement, 82% of the children received in the emergency room required hospitalization for specialized care or monitoring, and 18% were treated at home.

We aimed to review clinical evidence regarding the potential toxicity of psychiatric medications in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A systematic search for all types of empirical studies and reviews in a broad set of electronic databases and trial registries was conducted up to the 15th of August 2020. RESULTS: We identified 3 case series and 4 single-case reports on the occurrence of toxicity induced by various psychotropic drugs (lithium, n = 2; clozapine, n = 5; risperidone n = 2; haloperidol n = 1; duloxetine, n = 1). In addition, we provide a new case report on the possible precipitation of valproic acid-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy. In most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection may have precipitated drug toxicity/side effects. The management of toxicity did not diverge from the usually applied principles in the absence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the limited available evidence, it is currently not possible to derive evidence-based recommendations for the use of psychotropic drugs in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, we provide some guidance based on the reviewed literature. At the current state of knowledge, there is no contraindication for any psychotropic drug. Caution is warranted regarding the dosing and, in particular, the monitoring of clozapine, lithium and valproate.","output":"Toxicity of psychotropic drugs in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial, is being used worldwide for prophylaxis and treatment of Corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) Though the drug is commonly used in many chronic inflammatory diseases for protracted periods, its safety in the new indication is still under scrutiny Therefore, this institute based study sought to assess the acute adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine among in-house health care professionals who were taking the drug for COVID-19 prophylaxis A questionnaire seeking information on the use of the drug was prepared and disseminated electronically to the target population The responses were also received electronically and analysed The participants (n=54) had taken prophylaxis for 1-7 weeks The most common adverse effects in the cohort were nausea (02) and skin rash (02) The total number of adverse effects reported by the participants was 08 One incidence each of gastric upset (01), dizziness (01), pain abdomen (01), and chest tightness (01) was reported None of the adverse effects were serious Our study indicates that the prophylactic weekly single dose of hydroxychloroquine is not associated with any serious adverse effects within 1-7 weeks of initiation Elucidation of the long term and chronic adverse effects, if any, requires further studies","output":"Acute effects of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis for COVID-19 in health care professionals - an online survey.

The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a local capacity to rapidly identify new viruses is therefore critical. This article reviews the molecular biology of pathogenic viruses and the basic principles of molecular techniques commonly used for their detection and characterization. The principles of good laboratory practices for handling pathogenic viruses are also discussed. This review aims at providing researchers and laboratory personnel with an overview of the molecular biology of pathogenic viruses and the principles of molecular techniques and good laboratory practices commonly implemented for their detection and characterization.","output":"Pathogenic viruses: Molecular detection and characterization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the lack of potential vaccines and effective medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major option to curtail the spread of COVID-19 An accurate estimate of the potential impact of different non-pharmaceutical measures on containing, and identify risk factors influencing the spread of COVID-19 is crucial for planning the most effective interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19 and to reduce the deaths Additive model-based bivariate causal discovery for scalar factors and multivariate Granger causality tests for time series factors are applied to the surveillance data of lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US, University of Maryland Data (UMD) data, and Google mobility data from March 5, 2020 to August 25, 2020 in order to evaluate the contributions of social-biological factors, economics, the Google mobility indexes, and the rate of the virus test to the number of the new cases and number of deaths from COVID-19 We found that active cases/1,000 people, workplaces, tests done/1,000 people, imported COVID-19 cases, unemployment rate and unemployment claims/1,000 people, mobility trends for places of residence (residential), retail and test capacity were the popular significant risk factor for the new cases of COVID-19, and that active cases/1,000 people, workplaces, residential, unemployment rate, imported COVID cases, unemployment claims/1,000 people, transit stations, mobility trends (transit), tests done/1,000 people, grocery, testing capacity, retail, percentage of change in consumption, percentage of working from home were the popular significant risk factor for the deaths of COVID-19 We observed that no metrics showed significant evidence in mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic in FL and only a few metrics showed evidence in reducing the number of new cases of COVID-19 in AZ, NY and TX Our results showed that the majority of non-pharmaceutical interventions had a large effect on slowing the transmission and reducing deaths, and that health interventions were still needed to contain COVID-19 ?

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This online cross-sectional study recruited 316 participants. The inclusion criteria were students 18 years and above who were registered with the faculties of medicine at Malaysian public universities located in Klang Valley and in the states of Penang and Kelantan in Peninsular Malaysia. The exclusion criteria were those who presented with psychotic disorders, bipolar mood disorder or a history of illicit drugs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were administered a self-reported questionnaire to gather data on demographic, personal, clinical and psychological characteristics. The questionnaire comprised of the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the WHO Quality of Life- Brief Version (WHOQoL-BREF). RESULTS: The psychological and social QoL scores were lower than the non-pandemic norms of the general population, while the physical health and environmental QoL scores were comparable. After adjusting for relevant demographic, personal and clinical variables, religious coping, greater number of hours of online classes attended, and greater social support from family, friends and significant others were significantly associated with higher QoL among the participants. Frustration due to study disruption, living in areas with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, and a higher severity of depressive and stress symptoms were significantly associated with lower QoL.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of knowledge in Operative Dentistry on undergraduate students perception related to personal life and return to clinical practices classes during pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present research was a cross-sectional, observational, and qualitative survey. The 16-item based questionnaire was sent to undergraduate students in 2020, which were divided into two groups, according to the Operative Dentistry knowledge: G1-not started clinical practice; G2-already started or completed clinical practice. Questions were focused on the impact of the pandemic in relation to their personal lives and return to clinical practice classes. Chi-square association test was performed using the SigmaPlot 12.0 software (P  0.05). RESULTS: The response rate was 55.5% for G1 and 44.4% for G2. Regarding the questions related to personal life, G1 demonstrated higher percentages of fear of contracting the virus during theoretical classes. Same observations were found when students answered about their fear of contracting coronavirus during the clinical practice classes. However, G2 presented the highest agreement responses for the preparedness feeling to return to theoretical classroom, clinical practice classes, and the possibility of applying online learning. CONCLUSIONS: In general, students knowledge had little influence on perception of personal life.

However, the association between meningeal syndrome and the pediatric multisystemic inflammatory syndrome is poorly described in the literature. We will report the case of a boy who presented with meningeal syndrome revealing a Kawasaki-like syndrome. The objective of our work is to provide an update on this pathology which is very little known by clinicians. OBSERVATION: Our patient is a male child aged 8 years, from a 2nd degree consanguineous marriage, with a history of the influenza-like syndrome in all family members one month before admission, He was admitted for the management of a febrile meningeal syndrome, the history of which goes back to seven days before his admission, with the onset of a non-calculated fever resistant to antipyretics, associated with peri-umbilical pain and stiffness of the neck with the notion of photophobia and constipation. The clinical examination revealed a conscious child, GCS 15/15, very asthenic, fever 39.3 degrees. The neurological examination revealed a stiff neck with a negative brudzinski and kerning sign and no sensory-motor deficit. The skin examination reveals a morbilliform exanthema with an interval of healthy skin made up of non-infiltrated erythematous macules, which fade away within vitro pressure, on the lower and upper limbs and the trunk, sparing the face, the palms, the soles, and the external genitals, associated with the presence of bilateral palmoplantar oedema without desquamation. The mucous membrane examination showed bilateral conjunctivitis, not purulent, and cheilitis with left cervical adenopathy measuring 2 cm, with an inflammatory appearance on ganglionic examination. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. In front of the meningeal syndrome, a lumbar puncture was performed and came back negative. The biological workup revealed a major inflammatory syndrome: the white blood cells were 25 000 with a predominance of PNN at 23 500, the lymphocytes at 1,000, the platelets at 278 000, the sedimentation rate at 100 and the CRP at 272, the ferritinemia at 725.12, the Pro-BNP was elevated at 1,834, the liver and kidney biological results were normal. Echocardiography revealed myocarditis with mitral leakage, slight hypokinesia of the left ventricle, ejection fraction at 50%, VGTG 40MM, dilated coronary arteries, left common trunk at 4 mm, and IVA at 3 mm with minimal pericardial effusion. Given the current epidemiological context of the clinical symptomatology in our child, the multisystemic inflammatory syndrome was strongly suspected, so a covid19 serology was performed: negative IgM, positive IgG.

We searched literature databases, COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy registries, and explored reference lists from the inception date to February 2021 without language restriction. Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through COVIDENCE, and performed the data extraction and the risk of bias assessment. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

RESULTS: We retrieved 6757 records and 12 COVID-19 pregnancy registries from the search strategy; 38 clinical and non-clinical studies (involving 2,398,855 pregnant persons and 56 pregnant animals) were included. Most studies (89%) were conducted in high-income countries and were cohort studies (57%). Most studies (76%) compared vaccine exposures with no exposure during the three trimesters of pregnancy. The most frequent exposure was to AS03 adjuvant, in the context of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines, (n=24) and aluminum-based adjuvants (n=11). Only one study reported exposure to messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles COVID-19 vaccines. Except for one preliminary report about A/H1N1 influenza vaccination (adjuvant AS03), corrected by the authors in a more thorough analysis, all studies concluded that there were no safety concerns. CONCLUSION: This rapid review found no evidence of pregnancy-associated safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines or of their components or platforms when used in other vaccines.

Relative to Whites, Black respondents were less distressed, with a lesser increase in craving, and currently attended more virtual meetings. Data provided by a national program reflected a large increase in virtual TS attendance since the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In a survey of well-established NA members, most had made a successful transition from face-to-face to virtual meetings, relative to their antecedent characteristics. This successful transition suggests the possibility of an enhanced opportunity for stabilizing TS membership.","output":"Virtual Twelve Step Meeting Attendance During the COVID-19 Period: A Study of Members of Narcotics Anonymous"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & objectives The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a major public health emergency affecting the healthcare services all over the world. It is essential to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in different parts of our country. This study highlights clinical experience in managing patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care centre in northern India. Methods Clinical characteristics and outcomes of consecutive adults patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital at Chandigarh, India, from April 1 to May 25, 2020 were studied. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat and/or nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were managed according to the institute's consensus protocol and in accordance with Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines. Results During the study period, 114 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted. The history of contact with COVID-19-affected individuals was available in 75 (65.8%) patients. The median age of the patients was 33.5 yr (13-79 yr), and there were 66 (58%) males. Of the total enrolled patients, 48 (42%) were symptomatic. The common presenting complaints were fever (37, 77%), cough (26, 54%) and shortness of breath (10, 20.8%). Nineteen (17%) patients had hypoxia (SpO2<94%) at presentation and 36 (31%) had tachypnoea (RR >24). Thirty four (29.8%) patients had an accompanying comorbid illness. Age more than 60 yr and presence of diabetes and hypertension were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 disease. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was needed in 18 patients (52%), with three (2.6%) patients requiring assisted ventilation. Mortality of 2.6 per cent (3 patients) was observed. Interpretation & conclusions Majority of the patients with COVID-19 infection presenting to our hospital were young and asymptomatic. Fever was noted only in three-fourth of the patients and respiratory symptoms in half of them. Patients with comorbidities were more vulnerable to complications. Triaged classification of patients and protocol-based treatment resulted in good outcomes and low case fatality.","output":"Demographic & clinical profile of patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care hospital in north India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With people moving out of physical public spaces due to containment measures to tackle the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, online platforms become even more prominent tools to understand social discussion.

This study was aimed to investigate the effect of the vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) rs7041 genotype, which has a significant effect on vitamin D metabolism and PTL. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 32 pregnant women who had spontaneous PTL and 54 pregnant women who had no specific findings as a control group. Serum total vitamin D 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were measured using the Elecsys Vitamin D Total Kit. VDBP was measured using a VDBP Quantikine ELISA Kit. The levels of bioavailable 25(OH)D were calculated based on the total 25(OH)D and VDBP concentrations. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7041) in GC were analyzed using a TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay Kit. The unpaired t-test, Chi-squared, and ANCOVA tests were performed. Firth's penalized logistic regression was applied. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and the cutoff value was determined. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS: Total 25(OH)D levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Bioavailable 25(OH)D was significantly decreased in PTL women (p= .011), and VDBP was significantly increased in PTL women (p= .004) compared to the controls. Bioavailable 25(OH)D was lower in women with GT/TG and TT rs7041 genotypes than in those with GG, with statistical significance in women with the TT allele (p= .048). VDBP was higher in women with GT/TG and TT than those with GG, but there was no statistical significance. In PTL prevalence, bioavailable 25(OH)D and VDBP, the odds ratio increased by 1.463 times in GT/TG (p= .728) and increased by 1.675 times in TT compared to the GG allele (p= .640). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for bioavailable 25(OH)D and VDBP, the AUC was 0.665 and 0685, respectively. The optimum cutoff of bioavailable 25(OH)D and VDBP levels for the diagnosis of PTL was calculated as 0.6 ng/mL and 523 g/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with the VDBP rs7041(c.1296 T > G) T allele genotype had reduced serum levels of bioavailable 25(OH)D and were more likely to develop PTL. Therefore, if the T allele is found in the VDBP rs7041 SNP genotyping test before or during pregnancy, more careful prenatal care may be required because of the increased risk of PTL.","output":"Serum vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) concentration and rs7041 genotype may be associated with preterm labor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-pandemic has facilitated the implementation of telemedicine in both clinical practice and research. We highlight recent developments in three promising areas of telemedicine: teleconsultation, telemonitoring, and teletreatment. We illustrate this using Parkinson's disease as a model for other chronic neurological disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Teleconsultations can reliably administer parts of the neurological examination remotely, but are typically not useful for establishing a reliable diagnosis. For follow-ups, teleconsultations can provide enhanced comfort and convenience to patients, and provide opportunities for blended and proactive care models. Barriers include technological challenges, limited clinician confidence, and a suboptimal clinician-patient relationship. Telemonitoring using wearable sensors and smartphone-based apps can support clinical decision-making, but we lack large-scale randomized controlled trials to prove effectiveness on clinical outcomes. Increasingly many trials are now incorporating telemonitoring as an exploratory outcome, but more work remains needed to demonstrate its clinical meaningfulness. Finding a balance between benefits and burdens for individual patients remains vital. Recent work emphasised the promise of various teletreatment solutions, such as remotely adjustable deep brain stimulation parameters, virtual reality enhanced exercise programs, and telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy. Personal contact remains essential to ascertain adherence to teletreatment. SUMMARY: The availability of different telemedicine tools for remote consultation, monitoring, and treatment is increasing.

A strikingly high mortality rate of 94% was described in early reports of patients with COVID-19 transitioned to ECMO. Later case reports and series demonstrating successful recovery from COVID-19 after ECMO have revived interest in this therapeutic modality, including the recent approval of ECMO for COVID-19 patients by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Here, we present the first reports of devastating intracranial hemorrhage as a complication of veno-venous (VV) ECMO in two COVID-19 patients. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We performed a retrospective analysis of 2 cases of devastating intracranial hemorrhage in patients on VV-ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. Collected data included clinical history, laboratory results, treatment, and review of all available imaging. Both patients demonstrated activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) within an appropriate therapeutic range. No risk factors that clearly predicted likelihood of this complication were identified. CONCLUSION: Understanding the complications of ECMO in this cohort and developing therapeutic algorithms to aid in optimal patient selection will be critical in the limited resource setting experienced as a result of global pandemic. We propose the use of head computed tomography (CT) to identify devastating neurological complications as early as possible, aiding in the resource allocation of ECMO machines to the most appropriately selected patients.","output":"Neurologically Devastating Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage in COVID-19 Patients on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tailoring the reaction kinetics is the central theme of designer electrocatalysts, which enables the selective conversion of abundant and inert atmospheric species into useful products.

Since pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are potentially fatal complications of COVID-19, the present study tested the in vitro effectiveness of xylitol against SARS-CoV-2. Virus titers and LRV of SARS-CoV-2, were incubated with a single concentration of nasal spray. Toxicity was observed in the top dilution (1/10). Virus was seen below that dilution so it did not affect calculations of virus titer or LRV. After a 25-minute contact time, the nasal spray (11% Pure Xylitol, 0.85%NaCL (Saline), and 0.20% grapefruit seed extract) reduced virus from 4.2 to 1.7 log10 CCID50 per 0.1 mL, a statistically significant reduction (P<0.001) of 2.5 log10 CCID50.

Chem., 279: 20836C20849, 2004). In this study, HRC peptide (1150C1185) was chosen as the region to make structure-based substitutions to design a series of HRC analogs with increased hydrophobicity, helical propensity and electrostatic interactions, or with a covalent constraint (lactam bridge) to stabilize the -helical conformation. Effects of the substitutions on -helical structure of HRC peptides and their abilities to interact with HRN or HRC have been examined by biophysical techniques. Our results show that the binding of the HRC analogs to HRN does not correlate with the coiled-coil stability of the HRC analogs, but their interactions with HRC does correlate with their stability, except for HRC7. This study also suggested three types of potential peptide inhibitors against viral entry can be designed, those that simultaneously inhibit interaction with HRC and HRN and those that are either HRC-specific or HRN-specific. For example, our study shows the important role of -helical structure in the formation of the six-helix bundle where the lactam bridge constrained analog (HRC5) provided the best interaction with HRN.

Total income often has no identifiable impact on financial stress, all else equal, although the component of income based on investments may be a better predictor of financial stress. Further, there is a positive relationship between liabilities and financial stress. In addition, substantial financial stress is observable for recipients of payments for unemployment or disability, with lower impacts suggested for some other welfare groups.

The release of danger-associated molecular patterns during severe COVID-19 results in both pulmonary epithelial damage and inflammatory disease, which are predisposing risk factors for pulmonary aspergillosis. Moreover, collateral effects of host recognition pathways required for the activation of antiviral immunity may, paradoxically, contribute to a highly permissive inflammatory environment that favors fungal pathogenesis. Diagnosis of CAPA remains challenging, mainly because bronchoalveolar lavage fluid galactomannan testing and culture, which represent the most sensitive diagnostic tests for aspergillosis in the ICU, are hindered by the fact that bronchoscopies are rarely performed in COVID-19 patients due to the risk of disease transmission. Similarly, autopsies are rarely performed, which may result in an underestimation of the prevalence of CAPA. Finally, the treatment of CAPA is complicated by drugCdrug interactions associated with broad spectrum azoles, renal tropism and damage caused by SARS-CoV-2, which may challenge the use of liposomal amphotericin B, as well as the emergence of azole-resistance.

It was shown in our recent studies that water-suspended plastic and wood smoke aerosol PM and carbon-containing nanoparticles from burning organics can interact with the plasma membrane of brain nerve terminals presumably due to their lipid components. COVID-19 patients have neurological symptoms, viral particles were found in the brain, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells via fusion of lipid viral envelope with the plasma membranes of infected cells, and so viral envelop can contain lipid components of the host neuronal membranes. Therefore, interaction of SARS-CoV-2 envelope with PM is possible in water surrounding. After drying, PM can serve as a carrier for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 immobilized at their surface. Moreover, PM and SARS-CoV-2 per se can enter human organism during nasal inhalation, and they both use the same nose-to-brain delivery pathways moving along axons directly to the brain, influencing the nervous system and exocytosis/endocytosis in nerve cells. Thus, PM can aggravate neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and vice versa, due to their identical nose-to-brain delivery mechanism and possible interference of neuronal effects. In addition, different types of PM because of their ability to interact with the plasma membranes of nerve cells can facilitate unspecific SARS-CoV-2 entrance to the cells, and can influence envelope features of SARS-CoV-2.

METHOD: Structural equation modeling was done using data from a cross-sectional study (n = 287; age ranged 14C18) conducted in six schools in Santiago, Chile during 2020. RESULTS: The tested model has a good fit and parsimonious adjustment. It explained 25.9% of the life satisfaction and 9% of the variance of cyberbullying victimization. Family support was positively associated with life satisfaction (p < 0.001) and negatively associated with cyberbullying victimization (p < 0.05). Likewise, family conflict was positively associated with levels of cyberbullying victimization (p < 0.05) and negatively associated with life satisfaction levels (p < 0.001). Finally, family visits were only positively associated with life satisfaction (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Generating interventions on several levels focused on positive family bonds has become essential and urgent. This is especially important considering their protective impacts on cyberbullying victimization in promotion of adolescent well-being and quality of life.","output":"The role of family support and conflict in cyberbullying and subjective well-being among Chilean adolescents during the Covid-19 period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has spread internationally.

Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) promote the mobilization and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and are thereby critical mediators of AMR within the BWWTP microbial community. At present, it is unclear whether specific AMR categories are differentially disseminated via bacteriophages (phages) or plasmids. To understand the segregation of AMR in relation to MGEs, we analyzed meta-omic (metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic) data systematically collected over 1.5 years from a BWWTP. Our results showed a core group of fifteen AMR categories which were found across all timepoints. Some of these AMR categories were disseminated exclusively (bacitracin) or primarily (aminoglycoside, MLS, sulfonamide) via plasmids or phages (fosfomycin and peptide), whereas others were disseminated equally by both MGEs. Subsequent expression- and protein-level analyses further demonstrated that aminoglycoside, bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes were expressed more by plasmids, in contrast to fosfomycin and peptide AMR expression by phages, thereby validating our genomic findings. Longitudinal assessment further underlined these findings whereby the log2-fold changes of aminoglycoside, bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes were increased in plasmids, while fosfomycin and peptide resistance showed similar trends in phages. In the analyzed communities, the dominant taxon Candidatus Microthrix parvicella was a major contributor to several AMR categories whereby its plasmids primarily mediated aminoglycoside resistance. Importantly, we also found AMR associated with ESKAPEE pathogens within the BWWTP, for which MGEs also contributed differentially to the dissemination of ARGs. Collectively our findings pave the way towards understanding the segmentation of AMR within MGEs, thereby shedding new light on resistome populations and their mediators, essential elements that are of immediate relevance to human health.","output":"Mobilome-driven segregation of the resistome in biological wastewater treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We focus on the causes of fluctuations in wintertime PM(10) in nine regional core cities of China using two machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Also, we find the following results. The correlation of gaseous air pollutants and PM(10) were more relevant than that of meteorological conditions and PM(10). CO was the predominant factor for PM(10) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Plain and the Yangtze River Delta while SO(2) and NO(2) were also important features for PM(10) in the Pearl River Delta and Sichuan Basin. The spatial heterogeneity and temporal homogeneity of PM(10) in China are revealed. The long-range transported PM(10) was substantiated to be insignificant, except in the sandstorms.

This philosophy opens the door to identifying potential waste reduction and ongoing efficiencies of processes that have been migrated to SSCs. With the identification of the research need, firstly, a targeted literature review on tools and models of process selection for improvements was performed. The second step entails in-depth interviews with lean management experts, surveys with detailed questions in the area of lean management implementation, and finally a case study on measurements of testing the effectiveness of applying lean management methodology. The findings present drivers and barriers to selecting of processes subject to lean management.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate the construct validity and reliability of a new parent-proxy Preschool Hearing Environments and Reflection on Quality of Life (HEAR-QL) questionnaire. METHODS: Parents of children 2 to 6 years old with any hearing loss (HL) were recruited from multiple sites. To evaluate the new measure's construct validity, participants completed a 70-item preschool HEAR-QL and validated questionnaires measuring hearing and communication functioning (Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children), generic pediatric QL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Parent Report, PedsQL), family functioning (PedsQL Family Impact Module), and parent well-being (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Adult Global Report). Participants completed the preschool HEAR-QL 2 weeks later to measure test-retest reliability. Exploratory principal components analysis was used to reduce the number of items and determine the underlying HEAR-QL factor structure. Analysis of variance examined HEAR-QL differences by HL. RESULTS: Among 205 parents, 144 had children with bilateral HL, 50 had children with unilateral HL, 10 had children with normal hearing (NH), and one child's hearing status was unspecified. The 70-item questionnaire was reduced to 23 items with five underlying factors: Behavior and Attention, Hearing Environments, New Social Situations, Social Interactions, and Communication.

Our study aimed at evaluating the tumor growth rate (TGR) in addition to RECIST 1.1 criteria to assess the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Methods: Tumor real volume was calculated with a dedicated computed tomography (CT) software that semi-automatically assess tumor volume. Target lesions were identified according to RECIST 1.1. For each patient, we had 3 measurement of tumor volume. CT-1 was performed 8-12 weeks before ICI start, the CT at baseline for ICI was CT0, while CT + 1 was the first assessment after ICI. We calculated the percentage increase in tumor volume before (TGR1) and after immunotherapy (TGR2). Finally, we compared TGR1 and TGR2. If no progressive disease (PD), the group was disease control (DC). If PD but TGR2 < TGR1, it was called LvPD and if TGR2 a?? TGR1, HvPD. Results: A total of 61 patients who received ICIs and 33 treated with chemotherapy (ChT) were included. In ICI group, 18 patients were HvPD, 22 LvPD, 21 DC. Median OS was 4.4 months (95% CI: 2.0-6.8, reference) for HvPD, 7.1 months (95% CI 5.4-8.8) for LvPD, p = 0.018, and 20.9 months (95% CI: 12.5-29.3) for DC, p < 0.001.

Exercise can improve QoL, physical function, and overall health in people with cancer and may be an important addition to treatment approaches for cancer cachexia. Greater understanding of patients perception of exercise can help elucidate the feasibility of implementing exercise interventions for cancer cachexia and facilitate the design of patient-centered interventions. We aimed to describe the perception of exercise in patients with advanced cancer and cachexia, and capture exercise motivators, barriers, and preferences, to inform the feasibility of exercise interventions. Individual interviews (n = 20) with patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer with cachexia were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Main themes from interviews were: 1) Life is disrupted by cancer and cachexia; 2) Exercise offers hope; 3) Exercise barriers are multifaceted; and 4) Exercise access and support are important. Participants reported that their cancer and cachexia had intensely altered their lives, including ability to exercise. Exercise was perceived as important and participants described a hope for exercise to improve their health and wellbeing. Yet, several complex exercise barriers, such as burdensome cancer symptoms and the overwhelming impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, hindered exercise participation and prevented participants from fully realizing the perceived benefits of exercise. Factors believed to improve exercise engagement and overcome exercise barriers included increased exercise support (e.g., professional supervision) and accessibility (e.g., convenient locations).

We reasoned that differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 gene expression in sputum cells among patients with asthma may identify subgroups at risk for COVID-19 morbidity.Objectives: To determine the relationship between demographic features and sputum ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in asthma.Methods: We analyzed gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and for ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) (rhinovirus receptor as a comparator) in sputum cells from 330 participants in SARP-3 (Severe Asthma Research Program-3) and 79 healthy control subjects.Measurements and Main Results: Gene expression of ACE2 was lower than TMPRSS2, and expression levels of both genes were similar in asthma and health. Among patients with asthma, male sex, African American race, and history of diabetes mellitus were associated with higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was associated with lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but treatment with triamcinolone acetonide did not decrease expression of either gene. These findings differed from those for ICAM-1, where gene expression was increased in asthma and less consistent differences were observed related to sex, race, and use of ICS.Conclusions: Higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthma subgroups for poor COVID-19 outcomes. The lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with ICS use warrants prospective study of ICS use as a predictor of decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and decreased COVID-19 morbidity.","output":"COVID-19-related Genes in Sputum Cells in Asthma.

As a point-of-care immunodiagnostic test for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the serosurvey represents an alternative to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to measure the magnitude of COVID-19 outbreak in the communities lacking sufficient diagnostic capability for PCR testing. Methods: We assessed seropositivity for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG between April 21 and May 20, 2020, at 2 primary care clinics in Tokyo, Japan. Results: The overall positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.83% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.76-5.16) for the entire cohort (n = 1071). The 23 special wards of central Tokyo exhibited a significantly higher prevalence compared with the other areas of Tokyo after classification by residence (P = .02, 4.68% [3.08-6.79] vs 1.83 [0.68-3.95] in central and suburban Tokyo, respectively). In central Tokyo, the southern area showed the highest seroprevalence compared with the other areas (7.92% [3.48-15.01]), corresponding to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 patients by PCR test reported by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Conclusion: The seroprevalence surveyed in this study was too low for herd immunity, suggesting the need for robust disease control and prevention. A regional-level approach, rather than state- or prefectural-level, could be of importance in ascertaining detailed profiles of the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Geographical Profiles of COVID-19 Outbreak in Tokyo: An Analysis of the Primary Care ClinicCBased Point-of-Care Antibody Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into arguably the largest global public health crisis in recent history-especially in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or an effective anti-viral treatment. As reported, the virus seems to less commonly infect children and causing less severe symptoms among infected children. This narrative review provides an inclusive view of scientific hypotheses, logical derivation, and early analyses that substantiate or refute such conjectures. At the completion of a relatively less restrictive search of this evolving topic, 13 articles-all published in 2020, were included in this early narrative review. Directional themes arising from the identified literature imply the potential relationship between childhood vaccination and COVID-19-either based on the potential genomic and immunological protective effects of heterologous immunity, or based on observational associations of cross-immunity among vaccines and other prior endemic diseases. Our review suggests that immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in children is different than in adults, resulting in differences in the levels of severity of symptoms and outcomes of the disease in different age groups. Further clinical investigations are warranted of at least three childhood vaccines: BCG, MMR, and HEP-A for their potential protective role against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Childhood Immunization and COVID-19: An Early Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Job satisfaction is a widely discussed topic in work psychology, but what might be the contributions of recent discussions of workplace spirituality?

To combat these, novel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying degrees of success. At this very moment, the COVID-19 pandemic is the singular global health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost the whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one invisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication, healing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or any other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and future are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so severe, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease spread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all of these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to facilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we report results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated real-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for COVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available data from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the pandemic through rigorous modeling and statistical analyses. We also explored correlations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and environmental factors.

The http://covid-webapp.numerusinc.com/ web app presented here fills this gap. METHODS: Our web app uses a model that explicitly identifies susceptible, contact, latent, asymptomatic, symptomatic and recovered classes of individuals, and a parallel set of response classes, subject to lower pathogen-contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file of incidence and, if of interest, mortality rate data. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a user-selected subset of these can be fitted to the model using maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). Model fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allow counterfactual and forecasting scenarios. Confidence or credible intervals can be generated using stochastic simulations, based on MLE values, or on an inputted CSV file containing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates of one or more parameters. RESULTS: We illustrate the use of our web app in extracting social distancing, social relaxation, surveillance or virulence switching functions (i.e., time varying drivers) from the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 epidemics in Israel, South Africa, and England. The Israeli outbreak exhibits four distinct phases: initial outbreak, social distancing, social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. An MCMC projection of this latter phase suggests the Israeli epidemic will continue to produce into late November an average of around 1500 new case per day, unless the population practices social-relaxation measures at least 5-fold below the level in August, which itself is 4-fold below the level at the start of July. Our analysis of the relatively late South African outbreak that became the world's fifth largest COVID-19 epidemic in July revealed that the decline through late July and early August was characterised by a social distancing driver operating at more than twice the per-capita applicable-disease-class (pc-adc) rate of the social relaxation driver. Our analysis of the relatively early English outbreak, identified a more than 2-fold improvement in surveillance over the course of the epidemic. It also identified a pc-adc social distancing rate in early August that, though nearly four times the pc-adc social relaxation rate, appeared to barely contain a second wave that would break out if social distancing was further relaxed. CONCLUSION: Our web app provides policy makers and health officers who have no epidemiological modelling or computer coding expertise with an invaluable tool for assessing the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures. This includes an ability to generate an epidemic-suppression or curve-flattening index that measures the intensity with which behavioural responses suppress or flatten the epidemic curve in the region under consideration.","output":"A versatile web app for identifying the drivers of COVID-19 epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For more than 1 year, COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives.

Social influences on subjective distress associated with COVID-19 remain understudied in the Chinese context. Wuhan with its surrounding areas in Hubei province was not only the locale where first COVID-19 cases were detected in the world but was also the hardest hit across China. Data from Hubei provide a unique opportunity to investigate COVID-19-related subjective distress and its social correlates. Methods: We use original data (N=3,465) from the General Social Survey on COVID-19 in Hubei, China, conducted in August 2020. Regression analysis is employed to examine the impact of socioeconomic status, family structure, and social policies on COVID-19-related subjective distress measured by the Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results: First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status are not more immune to distress, and actually it is those better-educated ones who are more distressed. Second, family structure influences distress. Divorced and widowed individuals are more prone to distress than those who are married or single. Those living with COVID-19-infected family members or living with a larger family are particularly more distressed. Third, stricter lockdown measures promote real and perceived protection and also increase individuals psychological distance from the disease, thereby reducing subjective distress. Limitations: The sample is not totally random so we should use caution when generalizing the findings to the general population. Conclusions: The findings contribute to our understanding of mental health disparity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the most well-known identification technologies is iris recognition. Determining the classification threshold for large datasets of iris images remains challenging. To solve this issue, it is essential to extract more discriminatory features from iris images. Choosing the appropriate loss function to enhance discrimination power is one of the most significant factors in deep learning networks. This paper proposes a novel iris identification framework that integrates the light-weight MobileNet architecture with customized ArcFace and Triplet loss functions. By combining two loss functions, it is possible to improve the compactness within a class and the discrepancies between classes. To reduce the amount of preprocessing, the normalization step is omitted and segmented iris images are used directly. In contrast to the original SoftMax loss, the EER for the combined loss from ArcFace and Triplet is decreased from 1.11% to 0.45%, and the TPR is increased from 99.77% to 100%. In CASIA-Iris-Thousand, EER decreased from 4.8% to 1.87%, while TPR improved from 97.42% to 99.66%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tweets containing the joint hashtags #COVID-19 and either #bladder cancer, #kidney cancer, or #prostate cancer were identified on the Twitter platform from January 1, 2020 to July 30, 2020. The Twitter handle responsible for each tweet was categorized as an Academic, Medical Education, Patient Advocacy Groups/Non-Profits, Pharmaceutical, or Other entity based on content domain. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data on Twitter handle characteristics stratified by disease category (bladder, kidney, and prostate). Median/interquartile range and percentages were used to summarize continuous and categorical data, respectively. Number of tweets containing the relevant joint hashtags were tracked over time in relation to the cumulative United States case count of COVID-19. RESULTS: The content of 730 total tweets containing the joint hashtags COVID-19 and either #bladder cancer (138 tweets), #kidney cancer (137 tweets), or #prostate cancer (455 tweets) from January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 were analyzed. We identified 326 unique Twitter handles across all disease states (62 bladder, 47 kidney, and 217 prostate-related). Academic Twitter handles accounted for the greatest number of tweets containing the joint hashtags (31%). Temporal tracking of tweets with regard to monthly U.S. COVID cases revealed that communication surged in March of 2020 and peaked in April for both bladder and kidney cancer, whereas related prostate cancer Twitter communication peaked in May of 2020.

Evaluation of the effects of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and lower urinary tract symptoms on sexual function is often biased by their common association with other pelvic floor disorders, such as pelvic organ prolapse, which also affect sexual satisfaction. Indeed, these complexities are reflected in the literature, which shows considerable disparity in sexual functional characteristics in women with incontinence both before and after treatment. This discordance is further emphasized by heterogeneity in study design, quality and analysis. Here, we describe the nature of sexual dysfunction in women with incontinence, including coital incontinence. The various treatments for SUI, which include transvaginal tape surgeries, can also affect sexual function, positively or negatively. Coital incontinence seems to be a good predictor of an improvement in postoperative sexual parameters: its cure, achieved by >90% of women, to a large extent explains the sexual benefits reported in several studies. By contrast, deterioration in sexual function is sometimes reported after surgery, with de novo or worsened dyspareunia being the most common cause.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Australian Black Summer Bushfires on health behaviours in people with MS. METHODS: People with MS, carers, healthcare and advocacy professionals were recruited online between May-July 2020 for an online survey and telephone interviews. RESULTS: Survey items relating to health behaviours were completed by 113 people with MS, and 18 people with MS, 4 MS advocates, 5 healthcare professionals, and 2 carers were interviewed. The bushfires affected 34.5% and the pandemic affected 74.3% of survey participants with MS. The pandemic and bushfires caused a decrease in physical activity in 53.8% and 55.3% of participants respectively, as well as increases in unhealthy eating (43.6% and 24.3% respectively) and alcohol consumption (35.4% and 10.5% respectively), and a decrease in typical sleeping patterns (40.5% and 39.5% respectively). Conversely, 27.5% of participants reported an increase in physical activity during the pandemic. Interview data detailed the circumstances and motivations for changes in health behaviours, as well as consequences, including reduced mobility, fitness, mood disturbances, and weight gain.

Patients on dialysis may be exposed to greater risk of infection due to an inability to isolate. Consideration of these competing risks is important before restarting suspended transplant programs. This study compared outcomes in kidney and kidney/pancreas transplant recipients with those on the waiting list, following admission with COVID-19 in a high prevalence region. METHODS: Audit data from all 6 London transplant centres were amalgamated. Demographic and laboratory data were collected and outcomes included mortality, intensive care (ITU) admission and ventilation. Adult patients who had undergone a kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant, and those active on the transplant waiting list at the start of the pandemic were included. RESULTS: 121 transplant recipients (TR) and 52 waiting list patients (WL) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 36 TR died (30%), whilst 14 WL patients died (27% p=0.71). There was no difference in rates of admission to ITU or ventilation. 24% of TR required renal replacement therapy, and 12% lost their grafts.

The rates were higher among male children showing difficult-to-manage behaviors such as hyperactivity, but less so for children of fathers with higher levels of education. The lack of alternative management strategies may be a significant driver for the use of psychotropic medications in Iran and other Low and Middle Income countries, despite their known side effects, and their failure to address the developmental needs of the children.

Serum melatonin levels and sleep parameters of children with the diagnosis of COVID-19 who had mild and moderate disease (i.e., COVID-19 group) were compared with those of children admitted with non-COVID-19 non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (i.e., control group). The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) questionnaire was applied to the participants' primary caregivers to analyze their sleep patterns at present and six months before symptom onset and to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on sleep patterns. RESULTS: The entire study cohort consisted of 106 patients. The COVID-19 group included 80 patients, while the control group consisted of 26 patients. The mean serum melatonin levels were 136.72 pg/mL and 172.63 pg/mL in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively (p=0.16).

Aim: This manuscript describes the system development, collaborative efforts and the challenges encountered in developing an in-house clinical intelligence dashboard. Methods: Through a longitudinal, interdepartmental collaboration, a COVID-19 clinical intelligence dashboard was created using Microsoft Power BI and Cerner Computer Language (CCL) to demonstrate clinical severity of patients and patient location in a single screen. A color-coding schema was applied to produce a red highlight for patients whose condition is deteriorating, whether due to increasing oxygen demand or worsening laboratory values. An additional function enabled users to drill down into the patient's clinical and laboratory parameters for the past 5 days, and ultimately to the respective patient chart for further assessment. Results: The development of an in-house clinical intelligence dashboard is a feasible, effective tool to allow frontline clinicians to monitor patient status in multiple wards and proactively intervene as clinically necessary and transfer patients to the appropriate level of care. Comparing the 30 days before and 30 days after the implementation of the dashboard, the percentage of patients who required urgent intubation or cardiac resuscitation on the general medical ward, rather than a critical care setting, declined by over 50% (8 out of 34, 33% vs. 7 out of 55, 13%; two-tailed p < 0.05 by Fisher's exact test; OR 3.43; CI 1.07 to 10.95).

Firstly, to use the non-parametric method correctly, the symmetric Gauss kernel and asymmetric Gamma kernel are applied to estimate the density of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China. The result confirms that the Gamma kernel provides a more reasonable density estimation of bounded data than the Gauss kernel.

To drive fusion, these proteins undergo large conformational changes that must occur at the right place and at the right time. Understanding the elements which control the stability of the prefusion state and the initiation of conformational changes is key to understanding the function of these important proteins. The construction of mutations in the fusion protein transmembrane domains (TMDs) or the replacement of these domains with lipid anchors has implicated the TMD in the fusion process. However, the structural and molecular details of the role of the TMD in these fusion events remain unclear. Previously, we demonstrated that isolated paramyxovirus fusion protein TMDs associate in a monomer-trimer equilibrium, using sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. Using a similar approach, the work presented here indicates that trimeric interactions also occur between the fusion protein TMDs of Ebola virus, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), and rabies virus. Our results suggest that TM-TM interactions are important in the fusion protein function of diverse viral families. IMPORTANCE Many important human pathogens are enveloped viruses that utilize membrane-bound glycoproteins to mediate viral entry. Factors that contribute to the stability of these glycoproteins have been identified in the ectodomain of several viral fusion proteins, including residues within the soluble ectodomain. Although it is often thought to simply act as an anchor, the transmembrane domain of viral fusion proteins has been implicated in protein stability and function as well. Here, using a biophysical approach, we demonstrated that the fusion protein transmembrane domains of several deadly pathogensEbola virus, influenza virus, SARS CoV, and rabies virusself-associate. This observation across various viral families suggests that transmembrane domain interactions may be broadly relevant and serve as a new target for therapeutic development.","output":"Transmembrane Domains of Highly Pathogenic Viral Fusion Proteins Exhibit Trimeric Association In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and the ensuing global pandemic, has resulted in an unprecedented response to identify therapies that can limit uncontrolled inflammation observed in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.

The main protease (MPro) plays a critical role in viral replication and maturation, thus can serve as the primary drug target. To understand the structural evolution of MPro, we have performed phylogenetic and SSN analysis, that depicted divergence of Coronaviridae MPro in five clusters specific to viral hosts. This clustering was also corroborated with the comparison of MPro structures. Furthermore, it has been observed that backbone and binding site conformations are conserved despite variation in some of the residues. This conservation can be exploited to repurpose available viral protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 MPro. In agreement with this, we performed screening of the custom-made library of ~7100 molecules including active ingredients present in the Ayurvedic anti-tussive medicines, anti-viral phytochemicals and synthetic anti-virals against SARS-CoV-2 MPro as the primary target. We identified several natural molecules that strongly binds to SARS-CoV-2 MPro among which top seven molecules are d-Viniferin, Myricitrin, Taiwanhomoflavone A, Lactucopicrin 15-oxalate, Nympholide A, Biorobin and Phyllaemblicin B. Most of the predicted lead molecules are from Vitis vinifera, also reported for anti-tussive and/or antiviral activities. These molecules also showed strong binding with other main targets RdRp and hACE-2. We anticipate that our approach for identification of multi-target-directed ligand will provide new avenues for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Discovery of Multi-Target-Directed Ligands by Targeting Host-specific SARS-CoV-2s Structurally Conserved Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are autoantibodies that recognize the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Genetically diverse RFs are produced in rheumatoid arthritis patients; however, in hematologic diseases, such as cryoglobulinemia and B cell lymphoma, RFs from a limited combination of heavy chain V-region genes and J-region genes are produced in large quantities and forms immune complexes with IgG. These genetically limited RFs have historically been used for the immunochemical characterization of RFs. Among them, RFs derived from the heavy-chain germline gene IGHV1-69 are the most common. Recently, the crystal structure of an IGHV1-69-derived RF named YES8c was elucidated in complex with human IgG1-Fc. Based on the structure and mutant analyses, a recognition mechanism for the autoantigen (IgG-Fc) common to IGHV1-69-derived RFs was proposed. This review summarizes the immunochemical character of the IGHV1-69-derived RFs, and then focuses on the recognition mechanism of the IGHV1-69-derived RFs, referring the structural features of the IGHV1-69-derived neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Structural Basis of a Conventional Recognition Mode of IGHV1-69 Rheumatoid Factors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research-oriented universities are known for prolific research activity that is often supported by students in faculty-guided research. To maintain ethical standards, universities require on-going training of both faculty and students to ensure Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR). However, previous research has indicated RCR-based training is insufficient to address the ethical dilemmas that are prevalent within academic settings: navigating issues of authorship, modeling relationships between faculty and students, minimization of risk, and adequate informed consent. U.S. universities must explore ways to identify and improve RCR concerns for current (faculty) and future researchers (students). This article reports the findings of a self-study (N = 50) of research stakeholders (students and faculty) at a top tier research institution. First, we report on their perceived importance of applying RCR principles. Second, we explore relationships between stakeholder backgrounds (e.g., prior training, field, and position) and how they ranked the degree of ethical concerns in fictitious vignettes that presented different unethical issues university students could encounter when conducting research. Vignette rankings suggested concerns of inappropriate relationships, predatory authorship and IRB violations which were judged as most unethical, which was dissimilar to what sampled researchers reported in practice as the most important RCR elements to understand and adhere to for successful research. Regression models indicated there was no significant relationship between individuals vignette ethics scores and backgrounds, affirming previous literature suggesting that training can be ineffectual in shifting researcher judgments of ethical dilemmas.

METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study investigating incidence of and risk factors for UTI after office testing. Inclusion criteria included women presenting for either cystoscopy or UDS from September 2019 to February 2020. Modified Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to identify risk factors for UTI after cystoscopy and UDS in a female population. RESULTS A total of 274 patients met inclusion criteria. One hundred eighty-five patients underwent office cystoscopy. Nine (4.8%) had a postcystoscopy UTI. Significant risk factors for postcystoscopy UTI included recurrent UTI (relative risk, 7.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-34.05) and a history of interstitial cystitis (relative risk, 4.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-13.73). Of those with recurrent UTI, 13.7% had a postcystoscopy UTI. Among patients with interstitial cystitis, 25% had a postcystoscopy UTI. One hundred ninety-two patients underwent UDS. Ten (5.2%) developed a post-UDS UTI. No risk factors were identified. CONCLUSIONS Patients with recurrent UTI were 7.51 times more likely to develop a UTI after cystoscopy, whereas those with interstitial cystitis were 4.56 times more likely to develop a UTI after cystoscopy. The incidence of UTI after UDS was low overall.

The objective of this study is to systematically review COVID-19 related mHealth apps and highlight gaps to inform the development of future mHealth initiatives in Indonesia. METHODS: A systematic search strategy using a PRISMA flowchart was used to identify mHealth apps available in Google Play and Apple Play stores. We searched mHealth apps using certain specific terms related to COVID-19 outbreaks. The inclusion criteria were apps-based smartphone users related to COVID-19 using local language, free of cost, available in the Google Play and Apple Play Stores, and supported by the Indonesian government. We excluded games, apps on infectious diseases unrelated to COVID-19 specifically, and apps with non-Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian language). The selected mHealth apps were assessed based on two measures: (1) the WHO guidelines on digital health intervention and (2) the four dimensions of the mHealth technology fit framework. In addition, user feedback from experienced and non-experienced users was conducted to evaluate four dimensions of the apps. RESULTS: A total of 339 mHealth apps were generated from the initial search, remaining seven selected apps that met inclusion criteria. The results highlighted that mHealth apps reviewed had still not been widely used by the general public. The applications were purposed to disseminate information, conduct a self-risk assessment, provide an online community forum, and telemedicine or teleconsultation regarding COVID-19. Data services, including data storage, aggregation, and data exchange, are available in most apps. The rarest function found was contact tracing and assisting health management and health workers, such as the availability of testing facilities, reporting test results, and prescribing medication. The main issues reported were the lack of data security and data privacy protection, integration and infrastructures, usability, and usefulness.

Identifying and understanding populations at a heightened risk of acquisition is essential to more effectively target outreach and prevention efforts. Objective: This study aimed to compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with and without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and, among those with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, to compare characteristics of those who reported coronavirus disease symptoms and those who were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Study Design: This retrospective cohort study includes pregnant women who delivered or intended to deliver at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after initiation of a universal testing protocol on admission (April 8, 2020-May 31, 2020). Women were dichotomized by whether they had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Among women with a positive test result, women were further dichotomized by whether they reported symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. Bivariable analysis and parametric tests of trend were used for analyses. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders and to examine effect modification between race and ethnicity and any other identified risk factors. Results: During the study period, 1418 women met inclusion criteria, of whom 101 (7.1%) had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Of the 101 women who had a positive test result, 77 (76.2%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Compared with women who had a negative test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, those with a positive test result were younger and were more likely to have public insurance, to identify as black or African American or Latina, to be unmarried, to be obese, to have preexisting pulmonary disease, and to have living children. An increasing number of living children was associated with an increasing risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and this finding persisted after controlling for potential confounders. There was no effect modification between race or ethnicity and having living children with regard to the risk of infection. There were no significant differences identified between women who were symptomatic and asymptomatic. Conclusion: Many risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in pregnancy are similar to the social and structural determinants of health that have been reported in the general population.

SARS-CoV-2 can decrease cell surface ACE2 directly by internalization of ACE2 bound to the virus and indirectly by increased ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17)-mediated shedding of ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature, kidney and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where it counteracts the deleterious effects of angiotensin II (AngII) by catalyzing the conversion of AngII into the vasodilator peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to describe an implementation study using a multimodal approach combining noninvasive biomarkers, social contact patterns, mobile surveying, and face-to-face interviews in order to validate technologies that help us better understand child development in poor countries at a high frequency. METHODS: We carried out a mixed study based on a transversal descriptive analysis and a longitudinal prospective analysis in Malawi. In each village, children were sampled to participate in weekly sessions in which data signals were collected through wearable devices (electrocardiography [ECG] hand pads and electroencephalography [EEG] headbands). Additionally, wearable proximity sensors to elicit the social network were deployed among children and their caregivers. Mobile surveys using interactive voice response calls were also used as an additional layer of data collection. An end-line face-to-face survey was conducted at the end of the study. RESULTS: During the implementation, 82 EEG/ECG data entry points were collected across four villages. The sampled children for EEG/ECG were 0 to 5 years old. EEG/ECG data were collected once a week. In every session, children wore the EEG headband for 5 minutes and the ECG hand pad for 3 minutes. In total, 3531 calls were sent over 5 weeks, with 2291 participants picking up the calls and 984 of those answering the consent question. In total, 585 people completed the surveys over the course of 5 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study achieved its objective of demonstrating the feasibility of generating data through the unprecedented use of a multimodal approach for tracking child development in Malawi, which is one of the poorest countries in the world. Above and beyond its multiple dimensions, the dynamics of child development are complex. It is the case not only that no data stream in isolation can accurately characterize it, but also that even if combined, infrequent data might miss critical inflection points and interactions between different conditions and behaviors. In turn, combining different modes at a sufficiently high frequency allows researchers to make progress by considering contact patterns, reported symptoms and behaviors, and critical biomarkers all at once.

The nano-SiC has good cross-linking with MUF shell. When the nano-SiC was added in microPCMs, it behaves superior thermal conductivity and thermal storage properties. When the content of nano-SiC arrives 6 wt%, the performance of the microPCMs whose encapsulation efficiency is 65.7% is the best, and thermal conductivity increase by 59.2%. Due to the proper amount of nano-SiC added into the MUF shell, it can effectively fill the tiny holes on the MUF shell.

A treatment holiday was defined as a planned temporary break or delay in treatment for a patient with recurrent or advanced primary gynecologic malignancy for reasons other than pursuit of hospice or best supportive care, research protocol violation or unacceptable toxicity. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and then analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of 6 total patients identified for participation, 5 completed interviews with ages ranging from 57 to 80 years. Two participants returned to their previous treatment regimen after their holiday therapy, two switched therapies, and one remained on an extended break from systemic treatment. Treatment holidays were experienced as a break from the physical and psychological routine of being a cancer patient, but also brought about feelings of a lack of structure, uncertainty, and led to a confrontation with mortality issues. Overall, participants had favorable experiences which were initiated by their providers in whom they had a deep sense of trust.

This document provides best practice statements and recommendations for consultative management based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We pooled the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function tests abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. RESULTS: We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%-8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.4%). When we compared studies from China to studies from other countries in subgroup analyses, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China, with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (95% CI, 16.6%-20.1%). Isolated GI symptoms were reported rarely. We also summarized the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in <10% of patients. In studies outside of China, estimates are higher.

In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected.

Recent studies have reported that Covid-19 patients present oral manifestations with multiple clinical aspects. In this review, we aim to summarise main signs and symptoms of Covid-19 in the oral cavity, its possible association with oral diseases, and the plausible underlying mechanisms of hyperinflammation reflecting crosstalk between Covid-19 and oral diseases. Ulcers, blisters, necrotising gingivitis, opportunistic coinfections, salivary gland alterations, white and erythematous plaques and gustatory dysfunction were the most reported clinical oral manifestations in patients with Covid-19. In general, the lesions appear concomitant with the loss of smell and taste. Multiple reports show evidences of necrotic/ulcerative gingiva, oral blisters and hypergrowth of opportunistic oral pathogens. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits tropism for endothelial cells and Covid-19-mediated endotheliitis can not only promote inflammation in oral tissues but can also facilitate virus spread. In addition, elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators in patients with Covid-19 and oral infectious disease can impair tissue homeostasis and cause delayed disease resolution. This suggests potential crosstalk of immune-mediated pathways underlying pathogenesis. Interestingly, few reports suggest recurrent herpetic lesions and higher bacterial growth in Covid-19 subjects, indicating SARS-CoV-2 and oral virus/bacteria interaction.

METHODS Forty-four patients (19-60 years of age); scheduled to undergo general anesthesia with one-lung ventilation were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: DLT intubation with the McGrath videolaryngoscope (ML group [n = 22]); or conventional Macintosh laryngoscope (DL group [n = 22]). After manual in-line stabilization was applied as a way of simulating a difficult airway, the time required for intubation and the quality of glottic view were evaluated. RESULTS The time to successful intubation was not different between the 2 groups (ML group, 45 s [interquartile range, 38-52 s] versus DL group, 54 s [45-59 s]; P = .089).

In the latter case, host RppH is required to convert the triphosphate at 5'-end to a monophosphate. lpp(T) RNA, but not lpp and ompA mRNAs, required RppH for Srd-stimulated degradation, indicating that Srd stimulates both 5'-end-dependent and -independent cleavage activities of RNase E. Furthermore, pull-down and immunoprecipitation analyses strongly suggested that Srd physically associates with the N-terminal half of RNase E containing the catalytic moiety and the membrane target sequence. Finally, the growth of T4 phage was significantly decreased by the disruption of srd. These results strongly suggest that the stimulation of RNase E activity by T4 Srd is required for efficient phage growth.","output":"Rapid Degradation of Host mRNAs by Stimulation of RNase E Activity by Srd of Bacteriophage T4."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous evidence demonstrates that a public health crisis triggers and intensifies domestic violence, especially against women.

Studies showed that health professionals had psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress, among others. Objectives: To investigate the quality of sleep and the prevalence rate of sleeping disorders among physicians during COVID-19 pandemic, and identify the psychological and social factors associated with the condition. Methods: A cross-sectional study of an online questionnaire was applied for physicians in Brazil. Among the 332 participants included, 227 were women. Sociodemographic assessment was used in the questionnaire, as well as the scale of impact on the events of modifications caused by COVID-19, assessment on sleep quality (PSQI), presence and severity of insomnia (ISI), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7). Results: Most physicians (65.6%) had changes in sleep. Poor sleep quality was reported by 73.1%, depressive symptoms were present in 75.8%, and anxiety in 73.4%. Conclusion: Our study found that more than 70% of the physicians assessed had impaired sleep quality, characterizing insomnia symptoms during COVID-19 outbreak. Related factors included an environment of isolation, concerns about COVID-19 outbreak and symptoms of anxiety and depression.

METHODS: 20,228 blood donors aged between 18 and 72 years resident in four Austrian federal states were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody between 5th of June and 4th of December 2020. To evaluate the impact of sex, age, AB0-blood group and donation period on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, multiple logistic regression was done. RESULTS: Our data reveal an anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 2.5% overall, significantly depending on the time point of blood donation: after the first Austrian lockdown the seroprevalence was lower compared to the following months, when the rate was constantly rising. While younger blood donors showed significantly higher seroprevalence, no differences were found concerning sex or AB0 blood group.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to construct an effective model for the early identification of COVID-19 that would also distinguish it from CAP. METHODS: The clinical laboratory indicators (CLIs) of 61 COVID-19 patients and 60 CAP patients were analyzed retrospectively. Random combinations of various CLIs (ie, CLI combinations) were utilized to establish COVID-19 versus CAP classifiers with machine learning algorithms, including random forest classifier (RFC), logistic regression classifier, and gradient boosting classifier (GBC). The performance of the classifiers was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and recall rate in COVID-19 prediction using the test data set. RESULTS: The classifiers that were constructed with three algorithms from 43 CLI combinations showed high performance (recall rate >0.9 and AUROC >0.85) in COVID-19 prediction for the test data set. Among the high-performance classifiers, several CLIs showed a high usage rate; these included procalcitonin (PCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), uric acid, albumin, albumin to globulin ratio (AGR), neutrophil count, red blood cell (RBC) count, monocyte count, basophil count, and white blood cell (WBC) count. They also had high feature importance except for basophil count. The feature combination (FC) of PCT, AGR, uric acid, WBC count, neutrophil count, basophil count, RBC count, and MCHC was the representative one among the nine FCs used to construct the classifiers with an AUROC equal to 1.0 when using the RFC or GBC algorithms. Replacing any CLI in these FCs would lead to a significant reduction in the performance of the classifiers that were built with them. CONCLUSIONS: The classifiers constructed with only a few specific CLIs could efficiently distinguish COVID-19 from CAP, which could help clinicians perform early isolation and centralized management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Establishing Classifiers With Clinical Laboratory Indicators to Distinguish COVID-19 From Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, COVID-19 was firstly recognized in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly to all of the provinces of China.

The aim of the present study was to investigate potential factors that may have put young adults at risk or protected against FAD during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A sample of 447 young adults (280 females, 167 males; range 18-26) completed an online survey during the country's nationwide lockdown composed of self-reported measures assessing FAD behaviors, alcohol consumption, compensatory behaviors, eating and weight concerns, social support, emotion regulation strategies, and living arrangement. RESULTS: Our findings showed that FAD was significantly and positively correlated to alcohol consumption, use of laxatives, self-induced vomiting, eating and weight concerns, and expressive suppression, and negatively correlated to social support and living with family. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that alcohol consumption, eating concern, and expression suppression positively predicted FAD, while social support and living with family were negative predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that during the COVID-19 lockdown, preoccupation with eating and the use of expressive suppression may have increased vulnerability to FAD; conversely, perceived social support and living with family may have been a source of protection against this dysfunctional behavior.

Specifically, remote learning due to school closure, increased screen time for virtual learning, greater sedentary exposure, less exercise and potential changes to diet. These risk factors pose a potential threat for significant increase in weight gain leading to further increase in obesity among children and young people (CYP). This might eventually translate to the increased incidence of complications due to obesity including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).ObjectivesA case series to find the incidence of T2DM in children and young people in a large UK teaching hospital during the COVID-19 related lockdown period.MethodsWe prospectively collected data on children aged <17 years admitted to a large UK teaching hospital with newly diagnosed T2DM. Data was collected between May 2020 and November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined demographic, clinical and biochemical data.ResultsSix newly diagnosed children (five males, one female), four from minority ethnic backgrounds, mean (SD) age 14.4 (2.2) years, weight 84 (27) kg and BMI 32 (6) kg/m2 (BMI Z score +1.92 (0.5). 3 (50%) children had learning difficulties and all presented with classic features across the spectrum of severity from osmotic symptoms to one child with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 50% had acanthosis nigricans at presentation and a mean (SD) blood glucose of 18.38 (4.5) mmol/L. Mean (SD) HbA1c was 89.5 (23.8) mmol/mol. All six children had negative diabetes antibodies. All of them tested negative for COVID-19. Most parents reported that their children gained weight during lockdown. For comparison, in the preceding years, on average two children (age <17 years) per year are diagnosed with T2DM in the same centre.ConclusionsWe are seeing an increased incidence of T2DM in children and young people (CYP) in a large UK teaching hospital during the ongoing UK lockdown. This was reflected by a significant threefold increase in children with newly diagnosed T2DM. We draw attention to whether environmental and societal changes during lockdown have conferred an increased risk of obesity among CYP which have led to this significant increase in the incidence of T2DM. Alternatively this could be an indirect effect of the current pandemic. Both highlight the importance of adequate measures to be implemented to restore the physical and mental health of these CYP. In light of this we propose that parents, children and school authorities should work together to motivate CYP to participate in regular physical activities that are practically feasible during lockdown. Furthermore, there may be a delay in accessing healthcare services due to various psychosocial factors as seen in children with type 1 diabetes resulting in delayed diagnosis. All these highlight the importance of increased awareness among the public and healthcare professionals to diagnose these children early and initiate treatment.","output":"Are greater numbers of children with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus a further example of collateral damage from the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of the Mucoralean fungi physiology is a neglected field that the lack of effective genetic tools has hampered in the past.

Some universities around the world require students to register for law subjects to graduate. Malaysia is in a similar situation. Students enrolled in courses such as Bachelor of Accountancy, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Public Administration, and Bachelor of Sports Science must register for required law subjects to complete the course. All students studying law must be able to read legal cases. Legal cases are important for legal writing. A good legal writing must be supported by legal cases. Traditionally, these legal cases can be found in the library. Nowadays, students may also lookup for legal cases on the internet by using Google. In Malaysia, a few websites offer access to legal cases, such as The Malayan Law Journal (mlj), The Malaysian Current Law Journal (clj), and eLaw, to name a few. The cases found on these websites are cases that include lengthy facts and judgment. For these non-law students, the large volume of cases on the internet and lengthy cases is challenging. They need assistance to understand the cases as well as finding the most relevant legal cases. This research aims to create an application (app) that will assist non-law students in finding the most pertinent legal cases to their issues at hand. The cases stored in the app are cases that the authors have summarized. Summarization is done to ensure that the non-law students understand cases very well. In this study, the waterfall methodology was used, which is a common software development process. The study developed an app which is called CaseFinder. The most challenging aspect of creating the software was making it user-friendly for non-law students. As a result, the app is limited to only five areas of law which are the most relevant to non-law students' subjects. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia, the government has mandated that all universities conduct online distance learning (ODL).

Arabiodpsis thaliana--tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) provides an experimentally suitable pathosystem to explore the interplay between genetic variation in host's susceptibility and virus diversity. Systemic infection of A. thaliana with TEV is controlled by three dominant loci, with different ecotypes varying in susceptibility depending on the genetic constitution at these three loci. Here, we show that the TEV adaptation to a susceptible ecotype allowed the virus to successfully infect, replicate and induce symptoms in ecotypes that were fully resistant to the ancestral virus. The value of these results is twofold. First, we showed that the existence of partially susceptible individuals allows for the emerging virus to bypass resistance alleles that the virus has never encountered.

Preclinical studies in vitro and on animals show umifenovir activity against a number of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and others. Umifenovir, in combination with other antiviral drugs, symptomatic or traditional medicine, was used in China to treat patients with COVID-19, resulting in reduced mortality, virus elimination, the frequency of more severe course and complications in middle severity. However, antiviral therapy for the treatment of severe patients, with ARDS, did not lead to improved outcomes. In comparative clinical studies, umifenovir showed similar effectiveness with other antiviral drugs, and lower frequency of adverse reactions.

Understanding these differences in mortality amongst different sectors of society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk and vulnerabilities to be determined to enable strategies exit the lockdown. However, epidemiological models do not account for the variability encountered in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups. To overcome this limitation, it is proposed that a modiffed SEIR model, namely SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A Monte Carlo simulation indicates a large number of deaths could be avoided by slightly decreasing the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. From this modelling a number of mechanisms can be proposed to limit the exposure of vulnerable individuals to the disease in order to reduce the mortality rate among this group. One option could be the provision of a wristband to vulnerable people and those without a contact-tracing app. By combining very dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be protected and kept safer.

Clinically, the standard for diagnosing OSA involves nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). However, this requires expert human intervention and considerable time, which limits the availability of OSA diagnosis in public health sectors. Therefore, electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods for OSA detection have been proposed to automate the polysomnography procedure and reduce its discomfort. So far, most of the proposed approaches rely on feature engineering, which calls for advanced expert knowledge and experience. This paper proposes a novel fused-image-based technique that detects OSA using only a single-lead ECG signal. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network extracts features automatically from images created with one-minute ECG segments. The proposed network comprises 37 layers, including four residual blocks, a dense layer, a dropout layer, and a soft-max layer. In this study, three timeCfrequency representations, namely the scalogram, the spectrogram, and the WignerCVille distribution, were used to investigate the effectiveness of the fused-image-based approach. We found that blending scalogram and spectrogram images further improved the systems discriminative characteristics. Seventy ECG recordings from the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database were used to train and evaluate the proposed model using 10-fold cross validation. The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed classifier can perform OSA detection with an average accuracy, recall, and specificity of 92.4%, 92.3%, and 92.6%, respectively, for the fused spectral images.","output":"A fused-image-based approach to detect obstructive sleep apnea using a single-lead ECG and a 2D convolutional neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) score is a semiquantitative score of lung damage severity. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the gold standard method to evaluate the severity of lung involvement from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Few studies have investigated the clinical significance of LUS and HRCT scores in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic yield of LUS and of HRCT in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We carried out a multicenter, retrospective study aimed at evaluating the prognostic yield of LUS and HRCT by exploring the survival curve of COVID-19 inpatients. LUS and chest CT scores were calculated retrospectively by 2 radiologists with >10 years of experience in chest imaging, and the decisions were reached in consensus. LUS score was calculated on the basis of the presence or not of pleural line abnormalities, B-lines, and lung consolidations. The total score (range 0C36) was obtained from the sum of the highest scores obtained in each region. CT score was calculated for each of the 5 lobes considering the anatomical extension according to the percentage parenchymal involvement. The resulting overall global semiquantitative CT score was the sum of each single lobar score and ranged from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three COVID-19 inpatients (mean age 65  15 years; 65% M), including 23 (15%) in-hospital deaths for any cause over a mean follow-up of 14 days were included. Mean LUS and CT scores were 19  12 and 10  7, respectively. A strong positive linear correlation between LUS and CT scores (Pearson correlation r = 0.754; R2 = 0.568; p < 0.001) was observed. By ROC curve analysis, the optimal cut-point for mortality prediction was 20 for LUS score and 4.5 for chest CT score. According to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, in-hospital mortality significantly increased among COVID-19 patients presenting with an LUS score 20 (log-rank 0.003; HR 9.87, 95% CI: 2.22C43.83) or a chest CT score 4.5 (HR 4.34, 95% CI: 0.97C19.41).

Therefore, it is important to identify a valuable prognostic biomarker for HCC. The present study aimed to identify novel prognostic biomarkers for HCC and evaluate the potential role of hub genes in HCC. METHODS: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and proteinCprotein interaction analysis were performed to identify important potential prognostic genes. The expression of hub genes was confirmed by the GEPIA, Oncomine, UALCAN, and HPA database. Furthermore, survival analysis of hub genes was performed using the KaplanCMeier plotter database. Finally, we investigated the association between hub genes and immune factors in HCC through GSEA, the TIMER, and TISIDB database. RESULTS: HSD17B6 expression was significantly lower in HCC than in normal tissues. Low HSD17B6 expression is associated with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival in HCC patients, particularly at medium disease stages (stage II and III or grade III). HSD17B6 showed a strong correlation with tumor-infiltrating B cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Somatic copy number alteration might be the main cause of the negative correlation between HSD17B6 expression and immune infiltration. HSD17B6 expression in HCC negatively correlated with the expression of several immune cell markers, including exhausted T cell markers, PD-1 and CTLA-4, suggesting its role in regulating tumor immunity. CONCLUSIONS: HSD17B6 is a potential prognostic biomarker that determines cancer progression and is correlated with tumor immune cells infiltration in HCC.

Having practices in Saudi Arabia and Spain, Dr Delia Corts-Guiral saw how the former country controlled the epidemic through a strict lockdown of travel and closure of holy pilgrimage sites and social gatherings. In contrast, upon her return to her native country, she experienced the near-breakdown of the health care system by the suddenness of the outbreak. \\"There are now no specialists now, she says.\\" All of the specialties are treating COVID-19 patients and all of us are learning at the same time how to deal with this disease.\\"It is a nightmare now here in Spain\\".","output":"Lessons Learned and Experiences Shared From the Front Lines: Milan and Madrid."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper demonstrates the importance of bank capital in improving local resilience and the complementarity of bank capital and government aid programs.

Such losses were heavily borne by low-income workers. We also find that areas with a less capitalized banking sector received disproportionately less Paycheck Protection Program funding. Using a dynamic model of firm entry and exit with bank borrowing, we formulate the mechanism of how bank capital can mitigate the impact of adverse aggregate shocks on employment and firm exit.

This study aimed to elicit HCWs' perceptions of the adequacy of protective measures in high-risk clinical areas and the factors associated with these perceptions. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in April 2020. An anonymous electronic survey was sent via email to operating theatre (OT) and intensive care unit (ICU) staff of Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore. RESULTS: Of the 358 eligible participants, 292 (81.6%) responded to the survey. 93.2% of the participants felt that precautionary measures at work were sufficient and 94.9% acknowledged that adequate training was provided. More than 60% of the participants opined that their chances of contracting COVID-19 were moderate to high. Female gender, nursing occupation and duration of service < 10 years were significantly associated with increased fear of contracting COVID-19, less control over occupational exposure and lower perceived need to care for COVID-19 patients. Having young children at home did not significantly affect these perceptions. The most important ICU precautions were availability of personal protective equipment outside the rooms of COVID-19 positive patients (95.3%) and having visitor restrictions (95.3%). The most important OT measures were having a dedicated OT for COVID-19 positive patients (91.2%) and having simulation as part of protocol familiarisation (91.7%). CONCLUSION: Overall, there was high confidence in the adequacy of COVID-19 protective measures to prevent healthcare transmission in Singapore.

The peculiarities of the Yakut population are the rarity of cavities and the relative frequency of dental pathologies leading to death. Dental health evolves only two centuries after the contact; assimilation into the Russian Orthodox culture has decreased tooth wear and increased tooth loss. A comparison with historical data suggests that this evolution is not linked to the increasing importance of sucrose, but to the combined action of the substitution of dendrophagia with cereal flour; a decrease in immunity associated with the development of chronic infectious diseases; smoking as well as the mandibular torus: a risk factor favoring apical cysts. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: contact between indigenous and European populations has often resulted in changes in oral health attributed to the introduction of sucrose. Most studies are per tooth over considerable periods and with few ethnological references. (2) Aim: dental epidemiology of 96 autochthonous frozen bodies from Yakutia between the early 17th century and the late 19th century; comparisons with historical texts and ethnographic data. (3) Material and methods: we use descriptive statistics and discriminant factorial analyses to identify dominant variables in the dataset and compare periods and subjects, considering all variables. (4) Results: the peculiarities of the population are the rarity of cavities and the relative frequency of dental pathologies leading to death. Assimilation into the Russian Orthodox culture has led to decreased tooth wear and an increase in tooth loss. Dental health evolves only two centuries after the contact. (5) Conclusions: the confrontation with historical data suggests that changes are not related to the growing importance of sucrose but to a combined action: the substitution of dendrophagy by cereal flour; the decrease in immunity linked to the development of chronic infectious diseases; tobacco addiction and the mandibular torus: a risk factor promoting apical cysts.","output":"Sucrose Is Not the Whole Story: Risk Factors and Oral Health at the Contact (Yakutia, Siberia-16th/19th)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The issue of unblinded outcome-assessors and patients has repeatedly been stressed as a flaw in allegedly double-blind antidepressant trials. Unblinding bias can for example result from a drug's marked side effects. If such unblinding bias is present for a given drug, then it might be expected that the placebos of that drug are rated significantly less effective than that of other antidepressants. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, the present exploratory analysis conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the efficacy of 19 different placebos in placebo-controlled trials provided in the dataset by Cipriani et al. (Lancet 2018; 391: 1357-66). Primary outcome was efficacy (continuous) estimated on the standardized mean difference (SMD) scale and defined as the pre-post change on the Hamilton Depression scale (HAMD-17), on which information was available in N = 258 trials. RESULTS: Comparative placebo ranking suggested mirtazapine-placebo (SMD -2.0 [- 5.0-1.0 95% CrI]) to be the most, and amitriptyline- (SMD 1.2 [- 1.6-3.9 95% CrI]) and trazodone- (SMD 2.1 [- 0.9-5.2 95% CrI]) placebos to be the least effective placebos. Other placebos suggested to be more effective than amitriptyline- and trazodone-placebos (based on 95% CrIs excluding zero) were citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine placebos. These NMA results were corroborated by the observation that the relative efficacy between drug and placebo was considerably larger for amitriptyline and trazodone than for instance mirtazapine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine, supported by a small and insignificant correlation between drug-efficacy and placebo-efficacy (r = - 0.202, p = 0.408). DISCUSSION: The present exploratory NMA indicates that distinguishable side effects of older drugs may unblind outcome-assessors thus resulting in overestimation of the average drug-placebo difference and underrating bias in placebo-arms, particularly for the older antidepressant drugs amitriptyline and trazodone. If confirmed in prospective studies, these findings suggest that efficacy rankings for antidepressants are susceptible to bias and should be considered unreliable or misleading. The analysis is limited by the focus on the single-comparison placebos (76%, i.e., placebos assessed in two-arm trials), since double-comparison placebos (25%, i.e., placebos assessed in three-arm trials) are hard to interpret and therefore not included in the present interpretation. Another limitation is the problem of multiplicity, which was only approximately accounted for in the Bayesian NMA by modelling treatment effects as exchangeable.","output":"Comparative efficacy of placebos in short-term antidepressant trials for major depression: a secondary meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In October 2020 SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among hospital healthcare workers (HCW) of two Irish hospitals was 15% and 4.1% respectively. We compare seroprevalence in the same HCW population six months later, assess changes in risk factors for seropositivity with progression of the pandemic and serological response to vaccination. Methods All staff of both hospitals (N=9038) were invited to participate in an online questionnaire and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in April 2021. We measured anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike antibodies. Frequencies and percentages for positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were calculated and adjusted relative risks for participant characteristics were calculated using multivariable regression analysis. Results 5085 HCW participated. Seroprevalence increased to 21% and 13% respectively; 26% of infections were previously undiagnosed. Black ethnicity (aRR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2, p<.001), lower level of education (aRR 1.4 for secondary level education, 95% CI 1.1-1.8, p=0.002), living with other HCW (aRR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4, p=0.007) were significantly associated with seropositivity. Having direct patient contact also carried a significant risk (being a healthcare assistant (aRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.3, p<.001), being a nurse (aRR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.8, p=0.022), daily contact with COVID-19 patients (aRR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7, p=0.002), daily contact with patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (aRR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p=0.013) Breakthrough infection occurred in 23/4111(0.6%) of fully vaccinated participants; all had anti-S antibodies. Conclusion The increase in seroprevalence reflects the magnitude of the third wave of the pandemic in Ireland. Genomic sequencing is needed to apportion risk to the workplace versus the household/community. Concerted efforts are needed to mitigate risk factors due to ethnicity and lower level of education, even at this stage of the pandemic. The undiagnosed and breakthrough infections call for ongoing infection prevention and control measures and testing of HCW in the setting of close contact. Vaccinated HCW with confirmed infection should be actively assessed, including SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing (WGS), serology testing and assessment of host determinants, to advance understanding of the reasons for breakthrough infection.","output":"Prevalence of Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection and vaccination in Irish Hospital Healthcare Workers; changing epidemiology as the pandemic progresses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Ogilvie syndrome, or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), represents a pathological entity, potentially with a severe outcome, due to the acute important dilation of the large bowel, in the absence of a mechanical luminal obstruction.

METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset. Patients aged  18 years who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 during a hospital stay in England that was completed between March 1st and July 31st, 2020 were included.

These events play a pivotal role in the natural course of the disease and are associated with a progressive decline in lung function, reduced health status, a low physical activity level, tremendous health care costs, and increased mortality. Although most exacerbations have an infectious origin, the underlying mechanisms are heterogeneous and specific predictors of their occurrence in individual patients are currently unknown. Accurate prediction and early diagnosis of exacerbations is essential to develop novel targets for prevention and personalized treatments to reduce the impact of these events. Several potential biomarkers have previously been studied, these however lack specificity, accuracy and do not add value to the available clinical predictors. At present, microbial composition and host-microbiome interactions in the lung are increasingly recognized for their role in affecting the susceptibility to exacerbations, and may steer towards a novel direction in the management of COPD exacerbations.

M. Alto and K. Orth, Cold Spring Harbor Perspect Biol 4:a006114, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a006114). The type III secretion system 1 of the marine pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus utilizes the sequential action of four effectors to induce a rapid, proinflammatory cell death uniquely characterized by a prosurvival host transcriptional response (D. L. Burdette, M. L. Yarbrough, A Orvedahl, C. J. Gilpin, and K. Orth, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:12497C12502, 2008, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0802773105; N. J. De Nisco, M. Kanchwala, P. Li, J. Fernandez, C. Xing, and K. Orth, Sci Signal 10:eaa14501, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.aal4501). Herein, we show that this prosurvival response is caused by the action of the channel-forming effector VopQ that targets the host V-ATPase, resulting in lysosomal deacidification and inhibition of lysosome-autophagosome fusion. Recent structural studies have shown how VopQ interacts with the V-ATPase and, while in the ER, a V-ATPase assembly intermediate can interact with VopQ, causing a disruption in membrane integrity. Additionally, we observed that VopQ-mediated disruption of the V-ATPase activates the IRE1 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in an IRE1-dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. We also find that this early VopQ-dependent induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is terminated by the VopS-mediated inhibitory AMPylation of Rho GTPase signaling. Since VopS dampens VopQ-induced IRE1-dependent ERK1/2 activation, we propose that IRE1 activates ERK1/2 phosphorylation at or above the level of Rho GTPases. This study illustrates how temporally induced effectors can work as in tandem as agonist/antagonist to manipulate host signaling and reveals new connections between V-ATPase function, UPR, and MAPK signaling. IMPORTANCE Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a seafood-borne pathogen that encodes two type 3 secretion systems (T3SS). The first system, T3SS1, is thought to be maintained in all strains of V. parahaemolyticus to maintain survival in the environment, whereas the second system, T3SS2, is linked to clinical isolates and disease in humans. Here, we found that first system targets evolutionarily conserved signaling systems to manipulate host cells, eventually causing a rapid, orchestrated cells death within 3 h. We have found that the T3SS1 injects virulence factors that temporally manipulate host signaling. Within the first hour of infection, the effector VopQ acts first by activating host survival signals while diminishing the host cell apoptotic machinery. Less than an hour later, another effector, VopS, reverses activation and inhibition of these signaling systems, ultimately leading to death of the host cell. This work provides example of how pathogens have evolved to manipulate the interplay between T3SS effectors to regulate host signaling pathways.","output":"Manipulation of IRE1-Dependent MAPK Signaling by a Vibrio Agonist-Antagonist Effector Pair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of a highly infectious and contagious respiratory viral disease known as COVID-19 has vastly impacted human lives and overloaded the health care system. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and accurate diagnostic system for the timely identification of COVID-19 infected patients and thus to help control its spread. METHODS: This work proposes a new deep CNN based technique for COVID-19 classification in X-ray images. In this regard, two novel custom CNN architectures, namely COVID-RENet-1 and COVID-RENet-2, are developed for COVID-19 specific pneumonia analysis. The proposed technique systematically employs Region and Edge-based operations along with convolution operations. The advantage of the proposed idea is validated by performing series of experimentation and comparing results with two baseline CNNs that exploited either a single type of pooling operation or strided convolution down the architecture. Additionally, the discrimination capacity of the proposed technique is assessed by benchmarking it against the state-of-the-art CNNs on radiologist's authenticated chest X-ray dataset. Implementation is available at https://github.com/PRLAB21/Coronavirus-Disease-Analysis-using-Chest-X-Ray-Images. RESULTS: The proposed classification technique shows good generalization as compared to existing CNNs by achieving promising MCC (0.96), F-score (0.98) and Accuracy (98%). This suggests that the idea of synergistically using Region and Edge-based operations aid in better exploiting the region homogeneity, textural variations, and region boundary-related information in an image, which helps to capture the pneumonia specific pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The encouraging results of the proposed classification technique on the test set with high sensitivity (0.98) and precision (0.98) suggest the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

PURPOSE: To analyze the influence of zirconia implant topography on first bone implant contact (fBIC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective two-center cohort investigation 63 zirconia implants were evaluated at implant placement, prosthetic delivery, 1, 3, and 5 years. The distance (DIB) between implant shoulder and fBIC was measured at each time point in periapical radiographs at mesial and distal sites. Two-way ANOVA/Bonferroni was used to analyze the effects of time and center (&#945; < 0.05). RESULTS: Between the centers, the mean DIB varied significantly at implant placement (Freiburg [FR]: 1.4  0.6 mm; Zurich [ZH]: 0.8  0.5 mm). Thereafter, no statistically significant difference in DIB was observed, neither between centers nor between time points (prosthetic delivery: FR: 1.9  0.6 mm, ZH: 1.7  0.8 mm; 1 year: FR: 1.8  0.6 mm, ZH: 1.6  0.8 mm; 3 years: FR: 1.9  0.8 mm, ZH: 1.7  0.8 mm; 5 years: FR: 1.9  0.8 mm, ZH 1.8  0.6 mm). The overall mean DIB at prosthetic delivery to 5 years of both centers (1.8  0.7 mm) is located within the transition zone between the smooth neck and the moderately rough intraosseous part (1.6-2.0 mm from the implant shoulder). However, individual DIB values are ranging from 0.1 to 4.2 mm overlapping the transition zone. CONCLUSIONS: The standard deviation of the DIB indicates that the fBIC establishes on moderately rough and smooth surfaces. Consequently, soft tissue adapts to both topographies as well.","output":"Influence of zirconia implant surface topography on first bone implant contact within a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The world is experiencing the evolving situation associated with the outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) virus, and there is more of need than ever for stress management and self-care.

However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we explore whether activated microglia aggravate white matter injury via complement C3-C3aR pathway after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 80) underwent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 7, 14, and 28 days. Cerebral vessel density and blood flow were examined by synchrotron radiation angiography and three-dimensional arterial spin labeling. Neurobehavioral assessments, CLARITY imaging, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate activation of microglia and C3-C3aR pathway. Furthermore, C3aR knockout mice were used to establish the causal relationship of C3-C3aR signaling on microglia activation and white matter injury after hypoperfusion. Results: Cerebral vessel density and blood flow were reduced after hypoperfusion (p<0.05). Spatial learning and memory deficits and white matter injury were shown (p<0.05). These impairments were correlated with aberrant microglia activation and an increase in the number of reactive microglia adhering to and phagocytosed myelin in the hypoperfusion group (p<0.05), which were accompanied by the up-regulation of complement C3 and its receptors C3aR (p<0.05). Genetic deletion of C3ar1 significantly inhibited aberrant microglial activation and reversed white matter injury after hypoperfusion (p<0.05). Furthermore, the C3aR antagonist SB290157 decreased the number of microglia adhering to myelin (p<0.05), attenuated white matter injury and cognitive deficits in chronic hypoperfusion rats (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that aberrant activated microglia aggravate white matter injury via C3-C3aR pathway during chronic hypoperfusion.

The phenolic composition (total phenolics and total flavonoids content) and antioxidant capacity (assessed through ABTS and DPPH assays) were measured revealing a high phenolic potential for all fruits, except tomato, while uva-da-serra is particularly rich in flavonoids. In relation to the antioxidant capacity, the highest values were obtained for pitanga and uva-da-serra extracts. The bioactive potential was also assessed through the ability of the extracts to inhibit digestive enzymes linked to diabetes (-amylase, - and -glucosidases) and hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE). The results obtained point to a very high bioactive potential with the selected samples exhibiting very important ACE anti-enzymatic capacities. A statistical analysis of the obtained data reveals a very strong correlation between ABTS and TPC, and a strong contribution of the fruit polyphenols for enzyme inhibition, and thus, presenting high antihypertensive and antidiabetic capacities.

Objective To describe the prevalence and severity of cardiac MRI findings of myocarditis in a population of competitive student athletes recovering from COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants In this case series, an electronic health record search was performed at our institution (University of Wisconsin) to identify all competitive athletes (a consecutive sample) recovering from COVID-19, who underwent gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI between January 1, 2020, and November 29, 2020. The MRI findings were reviewed by 2 radiologists experienced in cardiac imaging, using the updated Lake Louise criteria. Serum markers of myocardial injury and inflammation (troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), an electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, and relevant clinical data were obtained. Exposures COVID-19 infection, confirmed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence and severity of MRI findings consistent with myocarditis among young competitive athletes recovering from COVID-19. Results A total of 145 competitive student athletes (108 male and 37 female individuals; mean age, 20 years; range, 17-23 years) recovering from COVID-19 were included. Most patients had mild (71 [49.0%]) or moderate (40 [27.6%]) symptoms during the acute infection or were asymptomatic (24 [16.6%]). Symptoms were not specified or documented in 10 patients (6.9%). No patients required hospitalization. Cardiac MRIs were performed a median of 15 days (range, 11-194 days) after patients tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients had MRI findings consistent with myocarditis (1.4% [95% CI, 0.4%-4.9%]). Of these, 1 patient had marked nonischemic late gadolinium enhancement and T2-weighted signal abnormalities over multiple segments, along with an abnormal serum troponin-I level; the second patient had 1-cm nonischemic mild late gadolinium enhancement and mild T2-weighted signal abnormalities, with normal laboratory values. Conclusions and Relevance In this case series study, based on MRI findings, there was a low prevalence of myocarditis (1.4%) among student athletes recovering from COVID-19 with no or mild to moderate symptoms.

We explain the role of new institutions prompted by policy failure precedence (Time 1) that at a later time period (Time 2) allow for the activation of PPPs with the aim to extend the political life of incumbent leaderships. Specifically, we examine the case of South Korea, a country in which a prior case of MERS in 2015 (Time 1) had established new policies for pandemic governance. In 2020, such policies were activated by the incumbent leadership in order to contain COVID-19 (Time 2). In particular, for swift and effective management of the pandemic, the South Korean government utilized partnerships with the private sector to exponentially increase the amount of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. We apply Policy Feedback Theory to demonstrate the political effects of failed policy precedents and how the political outcomes again shape new policies in a dynamic and cyclical manner. Empirically, we conduct a content analysis of South Koreas pharmaceutical sector in government procurement and exports of test-kits during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we investigated the protective effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on intimal hyperplasia and VSMC proliferation and migration, and the underlying mechanisms by which these events occur. A rat unilateral carotid artery was ligated to induce vascular injury and the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles were determined using miRNA microarray analysis. We observed that UDCA significantly reduced the degree of intimal hyperplasia and induced miR-21 dysregulation. Restoration of miR-21 by agomir-miR-21 reversed the protective effects of UDCA on intimal hyperplasia and proliferation in vivo. In vitro, UDCA suppressed PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation, invasion and migration in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the suppressive effect of UDCA was abrogated by overexpression of miR-21 in PDGF-BB-incubated VSMCs. Furthermore, we identified that miR-21 in VSMCs targeted the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumor suppressor gene, negatively modulated the AKT/mTOR pathway. More importantly, we observed that that UDCA suppressed AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the carotid artery injury model, whereas this pathway was reactivated by overexpression of miR-21.

Feedback was sought from a roundtable discussion forum and global organisations involved in comprehensive cleft care. Results: Foundational principles were agreed to enable recommendations to be globally relevant and two areas of focus within the specified topic were identified. First the safety aspects of cleft surgery protocols were scrutinised and COVID adaptions, specifically in the pre and peri-operative periods, were highlighted. Second, surgical operations and access to services were prioritized according to their relationship to functional outcomes and time-sensitivity. The operations assigned the highest priority were emergent interventions for breathing and nutritional requirements and primary palatoplasty. The cleft services assigned the highest priority were new-born assessments, paediatric support for children with syndromes, management of acute dental or auditory infections and speech pathology intervention. Conclusions: A collaborative, interdisciplinary and international working group delivered consensus recommendations to assist with the provision of cleft care in low- and middle-income countries. At a time of global cleft care delays due to COVID-19, a united approach amongst global cleft care providers will be advantageous to advocate for children born with cleft lip and palate in resource-constrained settings.","output":"Adapting cleft care protocols in low- and middle-income countries during and after COVID-19: a process-driven review with recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the pressure on hospital workers keeps growing, they are generally more dissatisfied with their comfort than other occupants in hospitals or offices. To better understand the comfort of outpatient workers in hospitals, clusters for preferences and perceptions of the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and social comfort were identified in a previous study before the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This qualitative study explains the outpatient workers main preferences for comfort during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews and photo-elicitation were used. Contextual changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic were included. The questions in the interviews were based on the characteristics of the profiles, corresponding with the clusters. The data were analyzed with content analysis according to the steps defined by Gioia. Seventeen outpatient workers who had been part of the previous study participated. For some outpatient workers differentiation of preferences was illogical due to interrelations and equal importance of the comfort aspects. The main changes in perceptions of comfort due to the pandemic were worries about the indoor air quality and impoverished interaction. Because the occupants preferences for comfort can change over time, it was suggested that further development of occupant profiles needs to accommodate changes.","output":"Preferences for Indoor Environmental and Social Comfort of Outpatient Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic, an Explanatory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of a large number of online learning platforms changes the learners' demands and learning styles, thus the society puts forward higher requirements for the personalization, intelligentization and adaptability of learning resource platforms.

METHODS: We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020-10.04.2020). The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). RESULTS: We included 388 patients (median age 66 years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]). Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%-11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 h of hospital admission. Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.","output":"Venous and arterial thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients admitted to an academic hospital in Milan, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Direct marketing enables businesses to identify customers that could be interested in product offerings based on historical customer transactions data. Several machine learning (ML) tools are currently being used for direct marketing. However, the disadvantage of ML algorithmic models is that even though results could be accurate, they lack relevant explanations. The lack of detailed explanations that justify recommendations has led to reduced trust in ML-based recommendations for decision making in some critical real-world domains. The telecommunication domain has continued to witness a decline of revenue in core areas such as voice and text messaging services which make direct marketing useful to increase profit. This paper presents the conceptual design of a machine learning process framework that will enable telecom subscribers that should be targeted for direct marketing of new products to be identified, and also provide explanations for the recommendations. To do this, a hybrid framework that employs supervised learning, case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning is proposed.

In a public health perspective, contextualizing these practices is essential in order to ensure their sustainability and efficiency. This article sheds light on the stakes of these partnerships and their advantages in responding to the health, social, and economic mark that has been left behind by the crisis accompanying the brutal onset of the Covid-19 epidemic. AIMS Improving the health care management for children with mental health problems or problems of a psychological nature implies taking into account their environment beyond the therapeutic framework. Interventional research, currently underway, is taking place in several sites in France: primary schools, Medical-psychological centers (CMP), and Local Committees on Mental Health (CLSM). The goal is to provide an inventory and an analysis of the partnership and interventional structures that are most efficient, based on the needs and available resources at each site. This research envisages a diversification and a contextualization of the offer of care, with great concern for equity and therapeutic efficacy, starting from school. RESULTS More than simple results, our aim is to make suggestions as to how to better accompany the end of confinement and the months to come. The development of partnerships in regions that are strongly marked by social and economic inequalities is a priority in terms of public health and the direction of local policies. These partnerships would contribute to a global strategy of evaluating the needs and the personalized accompaniment of children. Formalizing the intervention with the interface being the school sector will support the school staff in overcoming the health crisis that is affecting their institution. The steady rise of CLSMs will enhance local coordination and collaboration to help the most psychologically vulnerable children and aid their parents, given their situation, to support the development of their children. CONCLUSION Restoring human and material resources to existing structures, notably in the sector of child psychiatry so that it can accomplish its public service mission seems to be a priority today. Establishing school-CMP-CLSM partnerships can contribute to providing local policy direction in the interest of elaborating individual and collective strategies that can ensure needs-adapted care that is accessible to as many children as possible.","output":"[Rethinking partnerships between primary schools and child psychiatry public health services in times of COVID-19]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapidly growing evidence has now shown a high incidence of venous thrombosis in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome secondary to novel coronavirus 2, a disease now named COVID-19.

At the same time, a high level of blood safety must be guaranteed and different guidelines (GLs) deal with this topic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of different GLs in preventing transfusion-transmissible infections (TTI) in Italian feline blood donors. Methods Blood samples were collected from 31 cats enrolled as blood donors by the owners' voluntary choice over a period of approximately 1 year. Possible risk factors for TTI were recorded. Based on Italian, European and American GLs, specific TTI, including haemoplasmas, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia species, Bartonella species, Babesia species, Theileria species, Cytauxzoon species, Leishmania donovani sensu lato and feline coronavirus (FCoV), were screened. Rapid antigen and serological tests and biomolecular investigations (PCR) were used. Several PCR protocols for haemoplasma and FeLV DNA were compared. Results The presence of at least one recognised risk factor for TTI was reported in all cats. Results for FIV and FeLV infections were negative using rapid tests, whereas five (16.1%) cats were positive for FCoV antibodies. Four (12.9%) cats were PCR positive for haemoplasma DNA and one (3.2%) for FeLV provirus, the latter being positive only using the most sensitive PCR protocol applied. Other TTI were not detected using PCR. Conclusions and relevance Blood safety increases by combining the recommendations of different GLs. To reduce the risk of TTI, sensitive tests are needed and the choice of the best protocol is a critical step in improving blood safety. The cost and time of the screening procedures may be reduced if appropriate tests are selected. To this end, the GLs should include appropriate recruitment protocols and questionnaire-based risk profiles to identify suitable donors.","output":"Comparison of three blood transfusion guidelines applied to 31 feline donors to minimise the risk of transfusion-transmissible infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Instagram (IG) is becoming one of the larger resource tools within medicine.

Additionally, several serological assays have been developed and are currently used for the detection of antibodies against PEDV. Molecular assays such as real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) became the methods of choice for the diagnosis of PEDV infection, providing sensitive, specific and rapid detection of the virus RNA in clinical samples.

The control group included subjects that matched controls without mucormycosis confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction at our tertiary care center during April-May 2021. Probable predisposing factors, such as duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), history of recent hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, mode of the received oxygen supplementation, and use of steroids, zinc, vitamin c, and any other specific drugs were collected and compared between the two groups. Moreover, the laboratory parameters, like glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were analyzed to find out the significant association with CAM RESULTS: DM (Odds ratio=7.7, 95% CI 3.30-18.12; P=<0.0001) and high glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c>7.5 gm %) (odds ratio=6.2, 95% CI 1.4-26.7; P=0.014) were significant risk factors for the development of invasive mucormycosis among the COVID-19 cases. A higher number of mild COVID-19 cases developed CAM, compared to the moderate to severe cases (59.7% vs 40.3%). Use of systemic corticosteroids (odd ratio=5 with 95% CI 1.5-16.9; P=0.007) was found to be a risk factor for invasive mucormycosis only in mild COVID-19 cases.

Despite implementation of successful vaccination campaigns and efficient drugs, the increasing emergence of pathogenic vaccine or treatment resistance demands novel therapeutic strategies. The development of traditional therapies using small molecule drugs is based on modulating protein function and activity through occupation of active sites, such as enzyme inhibition or ligand-receptor binding. These pre-requisites result in the majority of host and pathogenic disease-relevant, non-enzymatic and structural proteins being labelled 'undruggable'. Targeted protein degradation (TPD) emerged as a powerful strategy to eliminate proteins of interest, including those of the 'undruggable' variety. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are rationally designed hetero-bifunctional small molecules that exploit the cellular ubiquitin-proteasome system to specifically mediate the highly selective and effective degradation of target proteins. PROTACs have shown remarkable results in the degradation of various cancer-associated proteins and several candidates are already in clinical development. Significantly, PROTAC mediated TPD holds great potential for targeting and modulating pathogenic proteins, especially in the face of increasing drug-resistance to the best-in-class treatments.

Protecting those at high risk of infection/transmission, whilst addressing the multiple health and social needs of this group, is of utmost importance. This study aimed to document the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who were experiencing homelessness in one city centre in Scotland, and how services adapted in response. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals with lived/living experience of homelessness (n = 10), staff within onethird sector service (n = 5), and external professionals (n = 5), during April-August 2020, using a rapid case study design. These were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, and analysed using Framework. Analysis was informed by inclusion health and equity-orientated approaches to meeting the needs of people with multiple and complex needs, and emerging literature on providing harm reduction in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: Those with lived/living experience of homelessness and problem substance use faced a range of additional challenges during the pandemic. Mental health and use of substances were affected, influenced by social isolation and access to services. A range of supports were provided which flexed over the lockdown period, including housing, health and social care, substance use treatment, and harm reduction. As well as documenting the additional risks encountered, findings describe COVID-19 as a 'path-breaking' event that created opportunities to get evidence into action, increase partnership working and communication, to proactively address risks.

The research method employed in this study consists of semi structured interviews with the management team members from eight educational institutions. The interviews focus on the crisis management strategies and approaches implemented in their schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion concludes with a connection between crisis management and educational sustainability and sets an agenda for future research. ?

Considerably fewer studies have assessed the effects on innate immune cells. Here, we characterized NK cells in healthy individuals and immunocompromised patients in the course of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA prospective, open-label clinical vaccine trial. See trial registration description in notes. Results revealed preserved NK cell numbers, frequencies, subsets, phenotypes, and function as assessed through consecutive peripheral blood samplings at 0, 10, 21, and 35 days following vaccination. A positive correlation was observed between the frequency of NKG2C(+) NK cells at baseline (Day 0) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab titers following BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination at Day 35. The present results provide basic insights in regards to NK cells in the context of mRNA vaccination, and have relevance for future mRNA-based vaccinations against COVID-19, other viral infections, and cancer.

METHODS: This retrospective review included 499 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia between February 11 and March 8, 2020. Subgroups sharing the CT features were identified using LCA. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the association between clinical types and the LCA-derived subgroups. RESULTS: Two radiological subgroups were identified using LCA. There were 228 subjects (45.69%) in class 1 and 271 subjects (54.31%) in class 2. The CT findings of class 1 were smaller pulmonary infection volume, more peripheral distribution, more GGO, more maximum lesion range  5 cm, a smaller number of lesions, less involvement of lobes, less air bronchogram, less dilatation of vessels, less hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and less pleural effusion than the CT findings of class 2. Univariate analysis demonstrated that older age, therapy, presence of fever, presence of hypertension, decreased lymphocyte count, and increased CRP levels were significant parameters associated with an increased risk for class 2. Multivariate analyses revealed that the patients with clinically severe type disease had a 1.97-fold risk of class 2 than the patients with clinically moderate-type disease. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic and clinical differences between the two radiological subgroups based on the LCA were significantly different. Two radiological subgroups were significantly associated with clinical moderate and severe types. KEY POINTS: ? Two radiological subgroups were identified using LCA. ? Older age, therapy, presence of fever, presence of hypertension, decreased lymphocyte count, and increased CRP levels were significant parameters with an increased risk for class 2 defined by LCA. ?

Nonetheless, inefficient conversion of glycerol to ethanol by natural Saccharomyces cerevisiae limits its use in these processes. Here, we have developed an efficient glycerol-converting yeast strain by genetically modifying the oxidation of cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by an O2-dependent dynamic shuttle and abolishing both glycerol phosphorylation and biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae D452-2 strain, as well as vigorous expression of whole genes in the DHA-pathway (Candid utilis glycerol facilitator, Ogataea polymorpha glycerol dehydrogenase, endogenous dihydroxyacetone kinase, and triosephosphate isomerase). The engineered strain showed conversion efficiencies (CE) up to 0.49 g ethanol/g glycerol (98% of theoretical CE), with production rate >1 g/L-1h-1 when glycerol was supplemented in a single fed-batch fermentation in a rich medium. Furthermore, the engineered strain converted a mixture of glycerol and glucose into bioethanol (>86 g/L) with 92.8% CE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported titer of bioethanol produced from glycerol and glucose. Notably, we developed a glycerol-utilizing transformant from parent strain, which cannot utilize glycerol as a sole carbon source. The developed strain converted glycerol to ethanol with a productivity of 0.44 g/L-1h-1 on minimal medium under semi-aerobic conditions. Our findings will promote the utilization of glycerol in eco-friendly biorefineries and integrate bioethanol and plant-oil industries. IMPORTANCE With the development of efficient lignocellulosic biorefineries, glycerol has attracted attention as an eco-friendly biomass-derived solvent that can enhance the dissociation of lignin and cell wall polysaccharides during the pretreatment process. Co-conversion of glycerol with the sugars released from biomass after glycerolysis increases the resources for ethanol production and lowers the burden of component separation. However, low conversion efficiency from glycerol and sugars limits the industrial application of this process. Therefore, the generation of an efficient glycerol-fermenting yeast will promote the applicability of integrated biorefineries. Hence, metabolic flux control in yeast grown on glycerol will lead to the generation of cell factories that produce chemicals, which will boost biodiesel and bioethanol industries. Additionally, the use of glycerol-fermenting yeast will reduce global warming and generation of agricultural waste, leading to the establishment of a sustainable society.","output":"Efficient Conversion of Glycerol to Ethanol by an Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae Strain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted the further virtualization of medical education. The satisfaction level of specific users such as cardiology residents with virtual education can augment its quality; hence, the significance of a valid and reliable questionnaire to obtain feedback is needed. This study aimed to design and measure validity and reliability of a satisfaction questionnaire for virtual education of cardiology residents during COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a self-administered questionnaire was developed by the faculty members of Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center. Reliability was tested utilizing Cronbach's alpha and intercorrelation which was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient test (ICC). Factor analysis was done by the KaiserCMeyerCOlkin measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's sphericity test. The statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS software version 22. RESULTS: The face validity index was determined via an assessment of the relevance, clarity, and simplicity of each item, and values >0.79 were accepted. The total Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated 0.93. Concerning testCretest reliability, the correlation between two rounds of evaluation was >80 (P > 0.001) and ICC was 0.99 (P = 0.001). The content validity evaluation yielded an index of 0.95 and a ratio of 0.91. The principal component factor analysis, conducted to investigate construct validity, generated four domains.

Despite these changes, there is still a commonly held assumption that objectivity always leads to and is the only way to achieve fairness in assessment. However, there are well-documented limitations to using objectivity as the 'gold standard' to which assessments are judged. Fairness, on the other hand, is a fundamental quality of assessment and a principle that almost no one contests. Taking a step back and changing perspectives to focus on fairness in assessment may help re-set a traditional objective approach and identify an equal role for subjective human judgement in assessment alongside objective methods. This paper explores fairness as a fundamental quality of assessments. This approach legitimises human judgement and shared subjectivity in assessment decisions alongside objective methods. Widening the answer to the question: 'What is fair assessment' to include not only objectivity but also expert human judgement and shared subjectivity can add significant value in ensuring learners are better equipped to be the health professionals required of the 21st century.","output":"The pursuit of fairness in assessment: Looking beyond the objective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) receptor as an entry point. Insights on S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with ACE2 receptor and drug repurposing has accelerated drug discovery for the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finding small molecule binding sites in the S protein and ACE2 interface is crucial in the search of effective drugs to prevent viral entry. In this study, we employed molecular dynamics simulations in mixed solvents together with virtual screening to identify small molecules that could be potential inhibitors of S protein ACE2 interaction. Observation of organic probe molecule localization during the simulations revealed multiple sites at the S protein surface related to a small molecule, antibody, and ACE2 binding. In addition, a novel conformation of the S protein was discovered that could be stabilized by small molecules to inhibit attachment to ACE2. The most promising binding site on the RBD-ACE2 interface was targeted with virtual screening and top-ranked compounds (DB08248, DB02651, DB03714, and DB14826) are suggested for experimental testing.

The effectiveness of inactivated vaccines against this variant is not fully understood. Methods Using data from a recent large-scale outbreak of B.1.617.2 SARS-COV-2 infection in Jiangsu, China, we conducted a real-world study to explore the effect of inactivated vaccine immunization on the course of disease in patients infected with the Delta variant. Results Out of 476 patients with B.1.617.2 infection, 184 were unvaccinated, 105 were partially vaccinated, and 187 were fully vaccinated. Forty-two (8.8%) patients developed severe illness, of which 27 (14.7%), 13 (12.4%), and 2 (1.1%) were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated, respectively (P <0.001). All 15 (3.2%) patients who required mechanical ventilation were unvaccinated. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, fully vaccinated patients had an 88% reduced risk of progressing to severe illness (ORadjusted: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.45). However, this protective effect was not observed in partially vaccinated patients (ORadjusted: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.51-2.36). Full immunization offered 100% protection from severe illness among women. The effect of the vaccine was potentially affected by underlying medical conditions (ORadjusted: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.03-1.23). Conclusion Full vaccination with inactivated vaccines is highly effective at preventing severe illness in Delta variant-infected patients.

We therefore aimed to characterise the sensitivity of the omicron variant to neutralisation. Methods For this cross-sectional study, we cloned the sequence encoding the omicron spike protein from a diagnostic sample to establish an omicron pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay. We quantified the neutralising antibody ID50 (the reciprocal dilution that produces 50% inhibition) against the omicron spike protein, and the fold-change in ID50 relative to the spike of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (ie, the pandemic founder variant), for one convalescent reference plasma pool (WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin [20/136]), three reference serum pools from vaccinated individuals, and two cohorts from Stockholm, Sweden: one comprising previously infected hospital workers (17 sampled in November, 2021, after vaccine rollout and nine in June or July, 2020, before vaccination) and one comprising serum from 40 randomly sampled blood donors donated during week 48 (Nov 29CDec 5) of 2021. Furthermore, we assessed the neutralisation of omicron by five clinically relevant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Findings Neutralising antibody responses in reference sample pools sampled shortly after infection or vaccination were substantially less potent against the omicron variant than against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (seven-fold to 42-fold reduction in ID50 titres). Similarly, for sera obtained before vaccination in 2020 from a cohort of convalescent hospital workers, neutralisation of the omicron variant was low to undetectable (all ID50 titres <20). However, in serum samples obtained in 2021 from two cohorts in Stockholm, substantial cross-neutralisation of the omicron variant was observed. Sera from 17 hospital workers after infection and subsequent vaccination had a reduction in average potency of only five-fold relative to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (geometric mean ID50 titre 495 vs 105), and two donors had no reduction in potency. A similar pattern was observed in randomly sampled blood donors (n=40), who had an eight-fold reduction in average potency against the omicron variant compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (geometric mean ID50 titre 369 vs 45). We found that the omicron variant was resistant to neutralisation (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] >10 g/mL) by mAbs casirivimab (REGN-10933), imdevimab (REGN-10987), etesevimab (Ly-CoV016), and bamlanivimab (Ly-CoV555), which form part of antibody combinations used in the clinic to treat COVID-19. However, S309, the parent of sotrovimab, retained most of its activity, with only an approximately two-fold reduction in potency against the omicron variant compared with ancestral D614G SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 01C02 g/mL). Interpretation These data highlight the extensive, but incomplete, evasion of neutralising antibody responses by the omicron variant, and suggest that boosting with licensed vaccines might be sufficient to raise neutralising antibody titres to protective levels.

Even a small change in medical images (especially in the region of interest (ROI)) can mislead the doctors/practitioners for deciding further treatment. Therefore, the protection of the images against intentional/unintentional tampering, forgery, filtering, compression and other common signal processing attacks are mandatory. This manuscript presents a multipurpose medical image watermarking scheme to offer copyright/ownership protection, tamper detection/localization (for ROI (region of interest) and different segments of RONI (region of non-interest)), and self-recovery of the ROI with 100% reversibility. Initially, the recovery information of the host images ROI is compressed using LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) algorithm. Afterwards, the robust watermark is embedded into the host image using a transform domain based embedding mechanism. Further, the 256-bit hash keys are generated using SHA-256 algorithm for the ROI and eight RONI regions (i.e. RONI-1 to RONI-8) of the robust watermarked image. The compressed recovery data and hash keys are combined and then embedded into the segmented RONI region of the robust watermarked image using an LSB replacement based fragile watermarking approach. Experimental results show high imperceptibility, high robustness, perfect tamper detection, significant tamper localization, and perfect recovery of the ROI (100% reversibility). The scheme doesnt need original host or watermark information for the extraction process due to the blind nature.

Public policies such as school closures have had a disproportionate impact on those facing adverse social determinants. There has been a dramatic increase in reports of abuse-related injuries, and other injuries indicative of child abuse during the pandemic. In addition, there are disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 based on race and ethnicity within the United States.

METHODS AND RESULTS In February 2018, liver NMP was introduced for routine use in marginal organs, logistical challenges and complex recipients at our institution. In a multidisciplinary effort between transplant coordinators, perfusionists, transplant surgeons, anesthesia, nurses, blood bank as well as laboratory staff, a clinical routine was established and 34 NMP cases were performed without critical incidents or organ loss. Nine livers were discarded due to poor organ quality and function observed during NMP. Twenty-five livers were successfully transplanted after preservation of up to 38 hours. The ECD rate was 100% and 92% in discarded and transplanted livers. Nighttime procedures and parallel transplantations were eventually omitted. Graft and patient survival was 88% at 20 months. No cholangiopathy was observed despite the use of extended criteria donor organs in 92% of cases.

We used a multiple least square regression to predict the cross-regional variation in mortality observed from the onset of the epidemic to 23 September 2020. RESULTS: Four independent variables best explained the cross-regional differences in the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19: the force of infection, population density, number of elderly living in assisted facilities and the standard rate of diabetes. The semi-partial correlation coefficients suggest that the force of infection and the number of elderly residents in nursing homes were the dominant predictors of the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE(S): : The purpose of this study was to evaluate which factors can predict the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these specifically immunosuppressed patients. STUDY DESIGN: : Specific anti Spike (S) antibody responses were assessed in a cohort of 117 Allo-HSCT recipients after two injections of BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (V1 and V2). Factors considered liable to influence the antibody response and analyzed in this series were the interval between Allo-HSCT and V1, donor source, recipient and donor age, current immunosuppressive/chemotherapy (I/C) treatment and levels of CD4(+)and CD8(+) T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells at the time of V1. RESULTS: : Overall, the S-antibody response rate, evaluated at a median of 35 days after V2, was 82.9% for the entire cohort, with 71 patients (61%) reaching the highest titre. In univariate analysis, a lower pre-V1 median total lymphocyte count, lower CD4+ T-cell and B-cell counts as well as ongoing I/C treatment and a haploidentical donor were characteristic of non-humoral responders. However, multiparameter analysis showed that B-cell aplasia was the only factor predicting the absence of a specific immune response (Odd Ratio 0.01, 95%CI [0.00 C 0.10], p <10(?3)). Indeed, the rate of humoral response was 9.1% in patients with B-cell aplasia, vs 95.9% in patients with a B-cell count higher than 0 (p<10(?9)). CONCLUSION(S): : These results advocate for the prescription of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in Allo-HSCT recipients as early as peripheral B-cell levels can be detected, suggesting also a need for a close monitoring of B-cell reconstitution after Allo-HSCT.","output":"B-cell aplasia is the most powerful predictive marker for poor humoral response after BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Over recent years, brand semiotics have been gaining the marketing practitioners' attention for designing their brand strategy. Hence, to address this gap, the current study investigates the effect of semiotic product packaging on brand experience dimensions, brand trust and purchase intent of reputed major brands of fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) products. Design/methodology/approach The data for this study were collected by administering a questionnaire-based survey from 254 respondents from the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) of India, using systematic sampling. Structural equation modeling has been used to test the conceptual model and examine the hypotheses developed in the study. Findings The results present evidence of the growing influence of semiotic product packaging upon consumer brand trust and purchase intentions.

Materials and Methods Chitosan NPs were prepared and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and zeta potential measurement. MSCs CM were prepared and entrapped into MSCs CM-CS NPs composite and its release efficiency was measured. Antibacterial efficacy of nano structures was determined by disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Antibiofilm activity was assessed by crystal violet assay. Results BM-MSCs were characterized to be negative for CD34 and CD45 markers, positive for CD73 and CD44 markers, and able to differentiate into osteoblast and adipocyte cells. The mean particle size of 96.6% of chitosan NPs was 414.9 nm with a suitable zeta potential and SEM morphology. Entrapment efficiency of MSCs CM-CS NPs was 76.9%. Unstimulated MSCs CM-CS NPs composite as a novel and proficient therapeutic nanostructure against MDR V. cholerae strains showed the synergistic activity of the two components of MSCs CM and CS NPs, leading to greater bacterial killing compared to control groups. MSCs CM more efficiently inhibited biofilm formation, although MSCs CM-CS NPs was also appeared to be effective in inhibiting biofilm formation compared to CS NPs and control group. Conclusion The designed nanodrug composite showed the best release in conditions mimicking the physiological conditions of the intestinal lumen.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Histopathologic findings in post-mortem lung tissue from eight patients who died from COVID-19 pneumonia were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed to detect virus. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was seen in all cases with a spectrum of acute phase and/or organising phase. IHC with monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein and spike protein detected virus in areas of acute but not organising DAD, with intracellular viral antigen and RNA expression seen predominantly in patients with duration of illness less than 10 days. Major vascular findings included thrombi in medium- and large-calibre vessels, platelet microthrombi detected by CD61 IHC and fibrin microthrombi. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by NGS early in the disease course and expression of viral antigen by IHC exclusively in the acute, but not in the organising phase of DAD, suggests that the virus may play a major role in initiating the acute lung injury of DAD, but when DAD progresses to the organising phase the virus may have been cleared from the lung by the patient's immune response. These findings suggest the possibility of a major change during the disease course of COVID-19 pneumonia that may have therapeutic implications.

Inclusion criteria were limited to human studies, English language and cardiac patients. All manuscripts concerning the use of NIRS in every area of catheterization and electrophysiology were included. The literature search yielded eleven observational studies and five case reports concerning the research question. No randomized trials could be retrieved. Six studies evaluated NIRS during supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, one during transcatheter aortic valve implantations, and four studies assessed the use of NIRS in pediatric catheterization procedures. Overall, the studies demonstrated that NIRS provides a very quick representation of cerebral oxygen saturation and that it might identify changes that could not be predicted from standard hemodynamic monitoring.

Laboratory testing using the RT-PCR platform for HIV infection is limited by poor access, logistical support, and delays in relaying test results and initiating therapy in low-resource settings. The use of rapid diagnostic tests at or near the point-of-care (POC) can increase access to early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants and children less than 18 months of age and timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). OBJECTIVES: To summarize the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care nucleic acid-based testing (POC NAT) to detect HIV-1/HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less exposed to HIV infection. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (until 2 February 2021), MEDLINE and Embase (until 1 February 2021), and LILACS and Web of Science (until 2 February 2021) with no language or publication status restriction. We also searched conference websites and clinical trial registries, tracked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and consulted experts for potentially eligible studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We defined POC tests as rapid diagnostic tests conducted at or near the patient site. We included any primary study that compared the results of a POC NAT to a reference standard of laboratory NAT RT-PCR or total nucleic acid testing to detect the presence or absence of HIV infection denoted by HIV viral nucleic acids in infants and children aged 18 months or less who were exposed to HIV-1/HIV-2 infection. We included cross-sectional, prospective, and retrospective study designs and those that provided sufficient data to create the 2  2 table to calculate sensitivity and specificity. We excluded diagnostic case control studies with healthy controls. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted information on study characteristics using a pretested standardized data extraction form. We used the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns of the included studies. Two review authors independently selected and assessed the included studies, resolving any disagreements by consensus. The unit of analysis was the participant. We first conducted preliminary exploratory analyses by plotting estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on forest plots and in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. For the overall meta-analyses, we pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate meta-analysis model at a common threshold (presence or absence of infection). MAIN RESULTS: We identified a total of 12 studies (15 evaluations, 15,120 participants). All studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. The ages of included infants and children in the evaluations were as follows: at birth (n = 6),  12 months (n = 3),  18 months (n = 5), and  24 months (n = 1). Ten evaluations were field evaluations of the POC NAT test at the point of care, and five were laboratory evaluations of the POC NAT tests.The POC NAT tests evaluated included Alere q HIV-1/2 Detect qualitative test (recently renamed m-PIMA q HIV-1/2 Detect qualitative test) (n = 6), Xpert HIV-1 qualitative test (n = 6), and SAMBA HIV-1 qualitative test (n = 3). POC NAT pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval (CI)) against laboratory reference standard tests were 98.6% (96.1 to 99.5) (15 evaluations, 1728 participants) and 99.9% (99.7 to 99.9) (15 evaluations, 13,392 participants) in infants and children  18 months. Risk of bias in the included studies was mostly low or unclear due to poor reporting. Five evaluations had some concerns for applicability for the index test, as they were POC tests evaluated in a laboratory setting, but there was no difference detected between settings in sensitivity (-1.3% (95% CI -4.1 to 1.5)); and specificity results were similar.

Methods: The Japan Stroke Society and the MHLW registry of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke conducted a national annual survey of hospitalization volumes for acute ischemic stroke, intracranial cerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in PSCs. Number of acute stroke patients was defined as sum of three stroke subtypes admitted within 7 days after the onset. Monthly acute stroke volumes were compared between 2019 and 2020, among COVID-19 waves, and regional infectious rates. Results: The stroke volume data was completed in 530 PSCs. The annual acute stroke volume was declined 2.5% from 179,893 in 2019 to 174,385 in 2020. Number of acute stoke patients was declined during COVID-19 expanding periods (1 wave, Mar-May;2 wave Jul-Aug;3 wave NovDec), whereas it was increased in the other months. The mean decline rate of stroke volumes from 2019 to 2020 was greater in 125 PSCs located in prefectures with high estimated SARS-CoV 2 infected rate (more than 2,300 per million people) than in 405 PSCs of the other regions (-4.615.4% vs -0.120.0%, P=0.008), especially during COVID-19 expanding periods (-8.217.9% vs -3.121.3%, P=0.009). Conclusions: Acute stroke volumes were declined in 2020 from 2019 in Japanese PSCs, especially during COVID-19 expanding periods and in highly infected regions. The overwhelmed health care system and infection control practices may have associated with decline of number of acute stroke patients during COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on number of acute stroke patients in Japan: A nationwide survey in primary stroke centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To obtain breast vascular map and to assess correlation between predominant feeding vessel and tumor location with a semi-automatic method compared to conventional radiologic reading. METHODS 148 malignant and 75 benign breast lesions were included. All patients underwent bilateral MR imaging. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients before MRI. The local ethics committee granted approval for this study. Semi-automatic breast vascular map and predominant vessel detection was performed on MRI, for each patient. Semi-automatic detection (depending on grey levels threshold manually chosen by radiologist) was compared with results of two expert radiologists; inter-observer variability and reliability of semi-automatic approach were assessed. RESULTS Anatomic analysis of breast lesions revealed that 20% of patients had masses in internal half, 50% in external half and the 30% in subareolar/central area. As regards the 44 tumors in internal half, based on radiologic consensus, 40 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (61% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 14% by lateral thoracic vessels, 16% by both thoracic vessels and 9% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01), based on semi-automatic detection, 38 tumors demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (66% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 11% by lateral thoracic vessels, 9% by both thoracic vessels and 14% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01). As regards the 111 tumors in external half, based on radiologic consensus, 91 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (25% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 39% by lateral thoracic vessels, 18% by both thoracic vessels and 18% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01), based on semi-automatic detection, 94 demonstrated a predominant feeding vessel (27% were supplied by internal thoracic vessels, 45% by lateral thoracic vessels, 4% by both thoracic vessels and 24% had no predominant feeding vessel-p<0.01). An excellent agreement between two radiologic assessments (k = 0.81) and between radiologic consensus and semi-automatic assessment (k = 0.80) was found to identify origin of predominant feeding vessel. An excellent reliability for semi-automatic assessment (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96) was reported.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Rho is immediately activated in left ventricles after pressure overload, and that Rho signalling plays crucial regulatory roles in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement during cardiac hypertrophic responses. However, the mechanisms by which Rho and its downstream proteins control actin dynamics during hypertrophic responses remain not fully understood. In this study, we identified the pivotal roles of mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous (mDia) 1, a Rho-effector molecule, in pressure overload-induced ventricular hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male wild-type (WT) and mDia1-knockout (mDia1KO) mice (10-12 weeks old) were subjected to a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham operation. The heart weight/tibia length ratio, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, left ventricular wall thickness, and expression of hypertrophy-specific genes were significantly decreased in mDia1KO mice 3 weeks after TAC, and the mortality rate was higher at 12 weeks. Echocardiography indicated that mDia1 deletion increased the severity of heart failure 8 weeks after TAC. Importantly, we could not observe apparent defects in cardiac hypertrophic responses in mDia3-knockout mice. Microarray analysis revealed that mDia1 was involved in the induction of hypertrophy related genes, including immediate early genes, in pressure overloaded hearts. Loss of mDia1 attenuated activation of the mechanotransduction pathway in TAC-operated mice hearts. We also found that mDia1 was involved in stretch-induced activation of the mechanotransduction pathway and gene expression of c-fos in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). mDia1 regulated the filamentous/globular (F/G)-actin ratio in response to pressure overload in mice. Additionally, increases in nuclear myocardin-related transcription factors and serum response factor were perturbed in response to pressure overload in mDia1KO mice and to mechanical stretch in mDia1 depleted NRVMs. CONCLUSIONS: mDia1, through actin dynamics, is involved in compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: Heart disease is associated with increased cardiac mass resulting from hypertrophic growth and remodelling in response to excessive mechanical stress. Although numerous signalling pathways have been shown to influence cardiac hypertrophy, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy have remained incompletely understood. Here, we present evidence that the cardioprotective functions of actin polymerization by mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous 1, a Rho-effector molecule, in response to mechanical stress. Understanding this mechanotransduction pathway may provide new prospects for identifying a novel strategy for pressure overload-induced cardiovascular disease.","output":"Disruption of Actin Dynamics Regulated by Rho Effector mDia1 Attenuates Pressure Overload-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophic Responses and Exacerbates Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the dynamics of equilibration processes in quantum systems as well as their interplay with dissipation and fluctuation is a major challenge in quantum many-body theory.

Although visiting restrictions are instituted to prolong the life of nursing home residents, they may detrimentally affect their quality of life. The aim of this study is to capture perspectives from the relatives of nursing home residents on nursing home visiting restrictions. Design A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. Setting and participants: A convenience sample of Dutch relatives of nursing home residents (n = 1997) filled in an online survey on their perspectives regarding nursing home visiting restrictions. Methods The survey included Likert-item, multi-select, and open answer questions targeting four key areas: (1) communication access to residents, (2) adverse effects of visiting restrictions on residents and relatives, (3) potential protective effect of visiting restrictions, (4) important aspects for relatives during and after visiting restrictions. Results Satisfaction of communication access to nursing home residents was highest when respondents had the possibility to communicate with nursing home residents by nurses informing them via telephone, contact behind glass, and contact outside maintaining physical distance. Satisfaction rates increased when respondents had multiple opportunities to stay in contact with residents. Respondents were concerned that residents had increased loneliness (76%), sadness (66%), and decreased quality of life (62%) while study respondents reported personal sadness (73%) and fear (26%). There was no consensus amongst respondents if adverse effects of the visiting restrictions outweighed the protective effect for nursing home residents. Respondents expressed the need for increased information, communication options, and better safety protocols. Conclusion and Implications Providing multiple opportunities to stay in touch with nursing home residents can increase satisfaction of communication between residents and relatives.

To mitigate the pandemic, China authority has taken unprecedentedly strict measures across the country. That provides a precious window to study how the air quality response to quick decline of anthropogenic emissions in terms of national scale, which would be critical basis to make atmospheric governance policies in the future. In this work, we utilized observations from both remote sensing and in-situ measurements to investigate impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on different air pollutions in different regions of China. It is witnessed that the PM2.5 concentrations exhibited distinct trends in different regions, despite of plunges of NO2 concentrations over the whole country. The steady HCHO concentration in urban area provides sufficient fuels for generations of tropospheric O3, leading to high concentrations of O3, especially when there is not enough NO to consume O3 via the titration effect. Moreover, the SO2 concentration kept steady at a low level regardless of cities. As a conclusion, the COVID-19 lockdown indeed helped reduce NO2 concentration. However, the atmospheric quality in urban areas of China has not improved overall due to lockdown measures. It underscores the significance of comprehensive control of atmospheric pollutants in cleaning air. Reducing VOCs (volatile organic compounds) concentrations in urban areas would be a critical mission for better air quality in the future.","output":"Response of major air pollutants to COVID-19 lockdowns in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Aims We continuously monitored right ventricular pressures and the estimated diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (ePAD) for up to 30 days in mechanically ventilated patients with severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome in order to detect and treat right ventricular and pulmonary artery hypertension. Methods and Results We retrospectively evaluated right ventricular pressures and the ePAD measured in 30 invasively ventilated COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients between 1 October 2020 and 31 March 2021. We divided the patients into two groups, survivors and non-survivors based on their 60 day mortality. Primary outcome variables were the values of right ventricular pressures and the ePAD over time after insertion of the right ventricular probe. Right ventricular systolic pressure [RVSP, (IQR;25th to 75th percentile)] was significantly lower on the first and the last measurement day in the survivors compared with the non-survivors [Day 1: 38 (27?45) vs. 46 (44?49), P = 0.036;last day: 36 (27?44) vs. 51 (40?57) mmHg, P = 0.006]. 16/22 survivors and 7/8 non-survivors received sildenafil orally, one survivor received additionally inhaled nitric oxide and one survivor and one non-survivor each inhaled iloprost. On the last measurement day, both right ventricular pressure amplitude [31 (26?37) vs. 38 (35?47) mmHg, P = 0.027] and ePAD [22 (16?26) vs. 31 (23?34) mmHg, P = 0.043] were significantly lower in the survivors compared with the non-survivors. Four patients in the survivor group developed excessive high RVSP in the course of their disease (peak: 57/61/78/105 mmHg). After sildenafil 20 mg every 8 h, additional inhaled nitric oxide (20 ppm) in one and additional inhaled iloprost 20 ?g every 4 h in another patient RVSP consecutively decreased substantially in all four patients until the end of the measurement period (47/23/42/47 mmHg). Conclusions The RVSP and right ventricular pressure amplitude both were significantly lower in the survivors compared with those in the non-survivors with a significant decrease in RVSP over time in the survivors suggesting successful lowering by pulmonary vasodilators.

Responses from 242 carers were compared against benchmark data from the IDEAL cohort collected pre\\\\pandemic. Analyses were conducted for the full sample of carers and spousal/partner carers only. RESULTS: In total 48.8% of carers thought their healthcare needs were negatively affected during the pandemic. Compared with pre\\\\pandemic data carers were more lonely and experienced less life satisfaction. There was little impact on carers' experience of caregiving, although carers felt trapped in their caregiving role. Carers were more optimistic and had higher social contact with relatives. There were changes in the methods carers used for contacting relatives and friends. Most carers coped very or fairly well during the pandemic. There was little difference in the experiences of spousal/partner carers and the full sample. CONCLUSIONS: After a long period of providing care under pandemic conditions carers require additional support. This support needs to be focused on alleviating feelings of loneliness and increasing life satisfaction. Services need to consider how to improve access to health care, particularly resuming face\\\\to\\\\face appointments.","output":"Impact of COVID\\\\19 on carers of people with dementia in the community: Findings from the British IDEAL cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bisulfite sequencing detects 5mC and 5hmC at single-base resolution. However, bisulfite treatment damages DNA, which results in fragmentation, DNA loss, and biased sequencing data. To overcome these problems, enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) was developed. This method detects 5mC and 5hmC using two sets of enzymatic reactions. In the first reaction, TET2 and T4-BGT convert 5mC and 5hmC into products that cannot be deaminated by APOBEC3A. In the second reaction, APOBEC3A deaminates unmodified cytosines by converting them to uracils. Therefore, these three enzymes enable the identification of 5mC and 5hmC. EM-seq libraries were compared with bisulfite-converted DNA, and each library type was ligated to Illumina adaptors before conversion. Libraries were made using NA12878 genomic DNA, cell-free DNA, and FFPE DNA over a range of DNA inputs. The 5mC and 5hmC detected in EM-seq libraries were similar to those of bisulfite libraries. However, libraries made using EM-seq outperformed bisulfite-converted libraries in all specific measures examined (coverage, duplication, sensitivity, etc.). EM-seq libraries displayed even GC distribution, better correlations across DNA inputs, increased numbers of CpGs within genomic features, and accuracy of cytosine methylation calls. EM-seq was effective using as little as 100 pg of DNA, and these libraries maintained the described advantages over bisulfite sequencing. EM-seq library construction, using challenging samples and lower DNA inputs, opens new avenues for research and clinical applications.","output":"Enzymatic methyl sequencing detects DNA methylation at single-base resolution from picograms of DNA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A motor-assisted elliptical trainer is being used clinically to help individuals with physical disabilities regain and/or retain walking ability and cardiorespiratory fitness. Unknown is how the device's training parameters can be used to optimize movement variability and regularity. This study examined the effect of motor-assisted elliptical training speed as well as body weight support (BWS) on center of pressure (CoP) movement variability and regularity during training. METHODS: CoP was recorded using in-shoe pressure insoles as participants motor-assisted elliptical trained at three speeds (20, 40 and 60 cycles per minute) each performed at four BWS levels (0 %, 20 %, 40 %, and 60 %). Separate two-way repeated measures ANOVAs (3a?a?4) evaluated impact of training speed and BWS on linear variability (standard deviation) and non-linear regularity (sample entropy) of CoP excursion (anterior-posterior, medial-lateral) for 10 dominant limb strides. FINDINGS: Training speed and BWS did not significantly affect the linear variability of CoP in the anterior-posterior or medial-lateral directions. However, sample entropy in both directions revealed the main effect of training speed (pa?<a?0.0001), and a main effect of BWS was observed in the medial-lateral direction (pa?=a?0.004). Faster training speeds and greater levels of BWS resulted in more irregular CoP patterns. INTERPRETATION: The finding that speed and BWS can be used to manipulate CoP movement variability when using a motor-assisted elliptical has significant clinical implications for promoting/restoring walking capacity. Further research is required to determine the impact of motor-assisted elliptical speed and BWS manipulations on functional recovery of walking in individuals who have experienced a neurologic injury or illness.","output":"Effect of motor-assisted elliptical training speed and body weight support on center of pressure movement variability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe illness and poor outcome are mainly associated with aging or certain medical comorbidities, especially chronic diseases. However, factors for unfavorable prognosis have not been well described owing to relatively small sample sizes and single-center reports. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the contribution of comorbidities in the development of critical conditions in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Pooled estimates of relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by conducting a meta-analysis and network meta-analysis of 18 studies. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most strongly associated with the overall critical condition (RR = 4.22, 95% CI = 3.12 - 5.69), followed by cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR = 3.00, 95% CI = 2.41 - 3.73), malignancy (RR = 2.91, 95% CI = 2.16 - 3.91), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (RR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.95 - 4.19), diabetes (RR = 2.10, 95% CI = 2.16 - 3.91), hypertension (RR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.82 - 2.23), and chronic kidney disease (RR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.36 - 2.94). The presence of comorbidities except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease significantly increased the risk of severe infection, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and cardiac injury in the subgroup analysis by types of critical conditions. Preexisting hypertension and diabetes additionally increased the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among comorbidities, COPD had the highest probability of leading to severe COVID-19, ICU admission, and liver injury, while malignancy was most likely to cause ARDS and cardiac injury. In summary, preexisting COPD, CVD, CVA, hypertension, diabetes, and malignancy are more likely to worsen the progression of COVID-19, with severe infection, ICU admission requirement, and cardiac injury development.","output":"Comparison of Comorbidities in Relation to Critical Conditions among Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients: A Network Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with COVID-19 frequently have non-typical ECG changes in the QRS and T-wave morphology The novel CineECG uses using the mean temporal spatial isochrones (mTSI) to relate the activation and recovery pathway to the cardiac anatomy The aim of this feasib ility study is to use the novel CineECG to separate normal from abnormal ECGs The ECGs of 100 normal controls were used to obtain the normal mTSI paths values for the QRS, ST segment and T-wave These normal CineECG values were used to classify the COVID-19 ECGs as either as normal or abnormal of 107 patients being treatedfor COVID-19 in the University Medical Center Utrecht The CineECG was able to classify 98% of the normal ECG correctly and 94% of the abnormal ECG in comparison to expert ECG classifications The ability of the CineECG to relate the ECG to the cardiac anatomy supports the detection of abnormal ECGs The CineECG might be a novel ECG screening tool to detect potential cardiac involvement of the COVID-19 disease for non-ECG experts ? 2020 Creative Commons;the authors hold their copyright","output":"The Electro-Anatomical Pathway for Normal and Abnormal ECGs in COVID Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While single-cell RNA sequencing provides a new window on physiologic and pathologic tissue biology and heterogeneity, it suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and a high dropout rate at the individual gene level, thus challenging quantitative analyses.

BACKGROUND: Burnout is a serious problem among nursing staff internationally with negative impacts on the quality of care and patient safety. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online study among 1,004 Iranian nurses through the convenience sampling technique. Data were collected using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, five items of questions related to self-reported poor patient care quality and estimated occurrence of AEs. RESULTS: Prevalence of high burnout among nurses was 31.5%. The risk of AEs ranged from 26.1% to 71.7%. Self-reported quality of patient care was found to be poor. A positive correlation was found between emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores and patient care quality, whereas a negative correlation was found between personal accomplishment scores and all poor care item scores. Depersonalization was found to increase the risk of the onset of all AEs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06-1.08). Also, Personal accomplishmentreduced the risk of occurrence of 'medication errors' (OR = 0.99) and the onset of 'patient and their family verbal abuse' (OR = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the hypothesis that a higher degree of burnout is correlated with a perceived higher number of AEs and reduced perceived patient care quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Reducing burnout among nurses through implementing interventions may be an effective strategy to enhance patient care quality and reduce the number of AEs in Iranian public hospitals. Therefore, in order to minimize work burnout, primary approaches include access to psychosocial support, including Web-based services, psychological first aid, mental support hotlines and self-care techniques during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Burnout and its relationship to self-reported quality of patient care and adverse events during COVID-19: A cross-sectional online survey among nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has impacted heavily on global health. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current diagnostic method, challenges for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) necessitate cheaper, higher-throughput, reliable rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the documented performance characteristics of available COVID-19 RDTs to understand their public health utility in the ongoing pandemic, especially in resource-scarce LMIC settings. METHODS: Using a scoping review methodology framework, common literature databases and documentary reports were searched up to 22 April 2020, irrespective of geographical location. The search terms included SARS-CoV-2 AND serological testing and COVID-19 AND serological testing. RESULTS: A total of 18 RDTs produced in eight countries, namely China (6; 33.33%), the United States (4; 22.22%), Germany (2; 11.11%), Singapore (2; 11.11%), Canada, Kenya, Korea and Belgium (1 each; 5.56%), were evaluated. Reported sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 100% (average = 84.7%), whereas specificity ranged from 90.6% to 100% (average = 95.6%). The testing time ranged from 2 min to 30 min. Of the 12 validated RDTs, the IgM/IgG duo kit with non-colloidal gold labelling system was reported to elicit the highest sensitivity (98% C 100%) and specificity (98% C 99% for IgG and 96% C 99% for IgM).

A surgery on COVID-19 patients not only involves a risk of spread of the disease but also there is a serious concern for the patient's surgical outcomes and resources requirement. AIM: The retrospective study is aimed to provide a protocol for pre-operative testing of SARS CoV-2 using RT-PCR in the patient undergoing cardio-thoracic surgeries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To analyze the impact of pre-operative testing of SARS- CoV-2 using RT-PCR in the patient undergoing elective cardio-thoracic surgeries. The patient who underwent surgical interventions during the COVID-19 lockdown period was divided into two phases. Phase I (without COVID-19 RT-PCR testing) and Phase II (with pre-operative COVID-19 RT-PCR testing). The retrospective comparison between the two study groups was done using Student t-test, MannCWhitney U, and Chi square ((2)) test depending upon the clinical variable to be analyzed. RESULTS: During the early phase (phase I), 26 patients underwent cardio-thoracic surgery without COVID-19 RT-PCR test. Whereas, during phase II, all patients were tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR, preoperatively and a total of 64 surgeries were performed during this phase. One patient planned for CABG was positive on RT-PCR for COVID-19 and was sent to the quarantine ward. The difference in the pre-operative hospital stay between two groups was found to be statistically significant and a significant decrease in the number of PPE kits used, during the phase I.

The so-called COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) represents a key aspect in the genesis of organ damage from SARS-CoV-2. The main coagulative alterations described in the literature are represented by high levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen. Although CAC has some common features with disseminated intravascular coagulation and sepsis-induced coagulopathy, there are important differences between these clinical pictures and the phenotype of CAC is unique. The pathogenesis of CAC is complex and is affected by the strong interconnection between the inflammatory system and coagulation, in the phenomenon of immunothrombosis and thrombo-inflammation. Several mechanisms come into play, such as inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils, the complement system as well as an alteration of the fibrinolytic system. Finally, an altered platelet function and especially endothelial dysfunction also play a central role in the pathophysiology of CAC. Heparin has several potential effects in CAC, in fact in addition to the anticoagulant effect, it could have a direct antiviral effect and anti-inflammatory properties.

METHODS: Whole-saliva samples were collected from 10 systemically and orally healthy participants, whose forepart and midstream segments of saliva were collected under unstimulated and stimulated conditions, with the salivary flow rate of each sample recorded. The concentrations and secretion rates of salivary steroids including testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and progesterone were measured by ELISA, with the multiple of change calculated. RESULTS: The results indicated mechanical stimulation used in collection of saliva samples could affect concentrations and secretion rates of steroids, whereas forepart and midstream segments had little differences in levels of salivary steroids, which effects could be partly influenced by individual specificity. The asynchronism in change of secretion rate of steroids with that of salivary flow rate might play an important role during this course.

METHODS We examined 1151 infants with a gestational age of 36 weeks or greater. We assessed for the presence of ventricular enlargement when apparent space was observed in the frontal horn or body of lateral ventricle by a transfontanel ultrasound scan. RESULTS Two hundred and forty-eight infants had ventricular enlargement. The atrial widths in most infants were less than 10 mm. Ventricular enlargement correlated with Cesarean delivery, gestational age, birth weight, respiratory disturbance at delivery and respiratory inhibition after crying (RIAC). Ventricular enlargement could be divided into three types by ultrasound findings. Forty-five infants showed only enlargement of the anterior horn (Type A), 97 infants showed enlargement from the body to the posterior horn (Type B), and 108 infants showed whole enlargement from the anterior to the posterior horn (Type C). The infants with Type A correlated with intrauterine growth restriction, placenta previa, male gender and birth weight. The infants with Type B correlated with cesarean delivery.

These models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) values as low as 0.128 on [0,1] normalized incidence data for a municipality with the highest dengue prevalence in Brazil's Espirito Santo. When predicting cases aggregated over geographical ecoregions, the models achieved accuracy improvements up to 16.5%, using only 6.5% of incidence data from ranked feature sets. The paper also includes two techniques for windowing time series data: fixed-sized windows and outbreak detection windows. Both of these techniques perform comparably, while the window detection method uses less data for computations. The framework presented in this paper is application-independent, and it could improve the performances of prediction models where data from spatially adjacent locations are available.","output":"A windowed correlation based feature selection method to improve time series prediction of dengue fever cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: E-learning is increasingly used during the COVID-19 pandemic, however the impact of this change on students is not known. This study aimed to evaluate perception and satisfaction of health sciences students towards E-learning during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A structured questionnaire was distributed to 2000 health care students either through email or social media platforms. The questionnaire was divided into two sections: the first section addressed demographic information such as age, education level, course of study, number of lectures attended and country. The second section gathered information on perception and satisfaction of students using 13 close-ended questions. Frequencies and percentages were assessed for demographic data, perception and satisfaction level of students. The paired sample t-test, independent t test and Spearman correlation were applied to evaluate statistical significance between different variables of the study. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Data from 1255 participants were included at a response rate of 66.4%. More than one third (37%) of the students took 25 or more online E-learning sessions and 47% preferred Zoom as an online platform. Participants belonged to 11 countries from developed and developing nations. 41% reported interference of E-learning due to network problems. 60% considered that clinical and practical skills are best learned in clinics and laboratories. More than one third of the students preferred classroom teaching and 34% of the students did not feel confident enough to take exit exams after E-learning sessions. CONCLUSION: E-learning satisfaction levels were better among developed countries (7.34) compared to developing countries (5.82). The majority of participants agreed that E-learning was satisfactory in acquiring knowledge, however not effective in acquiring clinical and technical skills. As the COVID-19 lockdown eases, there is a need for improvement in the methods employed in E-learning and more blended learning among healthcare students is recommended.","output":"E-Learning perception and satisfaction among health sciences students amid the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD8+ T cells are crucial for anti-viral immunity, however, understanding T cell responses requires the identification of epitopes presented by Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we have characterised eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A*02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response towards these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01.","output":"The presentation of SARS-CoV-2 peptides by the common HLA-A*02:01 molecule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic after it spread to 213 countries and has the highest total number of cases worldwide.

In this exploratory study, we distributed a survey comprised of close- and open-ended questions through convenience sampling in late July 2020 with the aim of understanding (1) if and how sense of belonging to urban green space (UGS) has shifted since the start of the pandemic and (2) how do changes in UGS use, satisfaction, and sense of belonging relate to sociodemographic characteristics of New York City (NYC) neighborhoods. Participants (N = 138) were racially diverse, predominantly female and between 18-44yo with a neighborhood median income of $67,500. While the level of satisfaction that people feel in relation to their UGS did not change with the offset of the pandemic, how much people use these spaces and how much they feel at home in them did. Participants reported higher use of UGS currently in comparison to their use of these spaces pre-pandemic. This increased use of UGS was particularly evident among White participants and participants living in more upper-middle- and upper-income areas. The same trend is evident when it comes to sense of belonging. New Yorkers in general reported a stronger sense of belonging to UGS spaces as a result of the pandemic. As with UGS use, while both reported a favorable sense of belonging, White and more affluent participants had a stronger sense of belonging pre-pandemic, and their sense of belonging showed greater rise due to the pandemic. Overall, our research suggests that COVID-19 has widened existing socio-spatial disparities in NYC, with the lowest income neighborhoods most effected.

This is difficult in the context of human anatomy, a subject contingent primarily on the use of human cadaveric tissues for learning through face-to-face practical laboratory sessions. Although anatomy has been taught using online resources including 3D models and anatomy applications, feedback from students and academic staff does not support the replacement of face-to-face teaching. At Charles Sturt University, we were obligated to cancel all classes on-campus in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We ran exclusive online anatomy practical classes replacing classes usually run on campus. We designed an alternative program that consisted of twenty pre-recorded videos that were prepared in the anatomy laboratory using cadaveric tissues, and then discussed in live (and interactive) tutorials. Furthermore, innovative approaches to learning were shown and encouraged by the lecturer. Student survey responses indicated a positive response to both the anatomical videos and the innovative learning approaches. The results obtained by students showed a statistically significant increase in high distinctions and marked decrease in the amount of fail grades, compared with the previous three years (not online). The use of these videos and the encouragement of innovative learning approaches was a novel experience that will add valuable experiences for improved practice in online anatomy teaching.

AIM The aims of this study were to evaluate psychological impact on health care workers in the Fangcang shelter hospitals and analyze potential risk factors associated with these symptoms, including PTSS, symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress. METHODS This cross-sectional study used an online survey to assess mental health problems of 522 health care workers in a Jianghan Fangcang shelter from February 21 to February 28, 2020. RESULTS Overall, 25.3%, 25.3%, 51.0%, 58.0%, 14.8%, and 39.1% of all participants reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that, occupation and technical title were associated with all investigated outcomes. Nurses were more likely to endorse posttraumatic stress symptoms (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 2.43-8.82; p < .001), anxiety symptom (OR, 4.58; 95% CI, 2.76-7.62; p < .001), depression symptom (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.17-5.64; p < .001).

Nasal lavage fluids and turbinate epithelial cells were collected prospectively from 111 CRS patients and 50 controls. Multiplex PCR was used to identify common respiratory viruses in both sample types and the infection rate was compared between groups.

This randomized, controlled, cross-over study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of Macintosh, Miller, McCoy and McGrath laryngoscopes during with or without chest compressions in the scope of a simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario. METHODS The time required for successful tracheal intubation, number of attempts, dental trauma severity and the need for optimization manoeuvres were recorded during cardiopulmonary resuscitation with and without chest compressions. The experience with computer games during the last 10 years were asked to the participants and recorded. RESULTS McCoy laryngoscope yielded the shortest time for successful tracheal intubation both in the presence of and without chest compressions. During the use of McCoy laryngoscopes, fewer tracheal intubation attempts, lower incidence of dental trauma and lower visual analogue scale scores on the ease of intubation were recorded. Participants who are experienced computer game players using Macintosh, McCoy and McGrath achieved successful tracheal intubation in a significantly shorter time during resuscitation without chest compressions. Dental trauma incidence and number of tracheal intubation attempts did not show any significant difference between the four laryngoscopes being related to the rate of playing computer games. CONCLUSION McGrath video laryngoscopes do not appear to have advantages over direct laryngoscopes for securing a smooth and successful tracheal intubation during rhythmic chest compressions.

The survey included sociodemographic data and the following validated instruments: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Basic Need General Satisfaction Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to examine variation in anxiety levels and BPN satisfaction according to PA category (low, moderate, and high). Spearman's Rho correlations coefficients were used to determine the association between anxiety levels and psychological needs. Individuals presenting a higher level of PA revealed lower levels of anxiety-state (H = 20.14;p &lt; 0.01). Differences between elements from different levels of PA were found for the autonomy (H = 23.52;p &lt; 0.001), competence (H = 18.89;p &lt; 0.001), and relatedness (H = 24.42;p &lt; 0.001) psychological needs, suggesting that those who feel their BPN as more satisfied have higher levels of PA.

We approach this question by means of a series of human experiments, using an artificial language communication game paradigm. Our results across four experiments match the previous cross-linguistic findings: all other things being equal, speakers do prefer to colexify similar concepts. However, we also find evidence supporting the communicative need hypothesis: when faced with a frequent need to distinguish similar pairs of meanings, speakers adjust their colexification preferences to maintain communicative efficiency, and avoid colexifying those similar meanings which need to be distinguished in communication. This research provides further evidence to support the argument that languages are shaped by the needs and preferences of their speakers.","output":"Conceptual similarity and communicative need shape colexification: an experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Worldwide spread of COVID-19 disease highlights the need for assessment of long-term humoral immunity in convalescent subjects. Our objectives were to evaluate long-term IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and B-cell memory response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from a cohort of subjects recovering from COVID-19 disease and from healthy subjects that donated blood. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were quantitatively detected by ELISA using anti-S1 spike IgG. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG memory B-cells were evaluated in a randomly selected group of COVID-19 recovering subjects by reversed B-cell FluroSpot based on human IgG SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain. Statistical analysis was performed with clinical variables and time post-COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Antibody response was not detected in 26 of 392 (6.6%) COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Over a period of 9 months, the level of antibodies decreased by 50% but stabilized at 6 months and prevailed a protective level up to 9 months. No differences were found regarding IgG SARS-COV-2 antibody levels for age, gender, and major blood types, over-time. COVID-19 asymptomatic subjects did not differ in antibody level overtime from subjects with mild to severe disease. Repeated paired IgG SARS-COV-2 antibody level analyses disclosed that over 6 and 9 months, 15.3% (9 of 59) and 15.8% (3 of 19) of subjects became SARS-COV-2 IgG seronegative, respectively, all with low antibody level at 3 months.

Materials and Methods: We searched multiple COVID-19 databases (WHO, CDC, LIT-COVID) for longitudinal studies globally reporting mortality and severity published before January 18th, 2021. Meta-analyses were performed using 53 studies for mortality outcome and 43 for the severity outcome.

CASE SUMMARY: In this case report, we described a 48-year-old diabetic man who presented with the chief complaint of persistent hiccups (<48h) to the emergency room with no history of malignancy, GI, cardiovascular, or neurological diseases. The patient also mentioned intermittent cough and mild dyspnea initiated the morning of admission day. On physical examination, other than mild tachycardia and tachypnea, there were no notable findings. Following an abnormal chest X-Ray, a chest CT scan was carried out, and peripheral ground-glass opacities along with scattered round opacities were identified in both lungs' fields. Given the strong suspicion of COVID-19, an RT-PCR test was performed, and the symptomatic treatment was initiated. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 following the PCR result release. The treatment was initiated per the protocol, and the patient was transferred to the isolated room and discharged after four days following the relief of the symptoms.

Although the effects of the pandemic on mental health may change as it evolves, the majority of reports have been web-based, cross-sectional studies. We performed a study assessing acute stress in frontline health workers during two consecutive epidemic waves. After screening for trait anxiety/depression and dissociative experiences, we evaluated changes in acute stress, considering resilience, state anxiety, burnout, depersonalization/derealization symptoms, and quality of sleep as cofactors. During the first epidemic wave (April 2020), health workers reported acute stress related to COVID-19, which was related to state anxiety. After the first epidemic wave, acute stress decreased, with no increase during the second epidemic wave (December 2020), and further decreased when vaccination started. During the follow-up (April 2020 to February 2021), the acute stress score was related to bad quality of sleep. However, acute stress, state anxiety, and burnout were all related to trait anxiety/depression, while the resilience score was invariant through time. Overall, the results emphasize the relevance of mental health screening before, during, and after an epidemic wave of infections, in order to enable coping during successive sanitary crises.","output":"Acute Stress in Health Workers during Two Consecutive Epidemic Waves of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although research has been mainly focused on effective treatment for SARS-COV-2 infection, psychosocial aspects of the infection it is vital to be taken into consideration.

RESULTS: Females and younger than 40 years old had more worries and fears on discharge day. Significant factors were days of hospitalization, days of fever and need of oxygen therapy. Patients who hospitalized more than 10 days, particularly in isolation negative pressure rooms, with persistent fever more than 7 days and need of oxygen therapy had more anxiety, worries for their clinical condition and fear of stigma. The majority of patients (80%) were expecting to face moderate to severe problems with family members, friends and colleagues underlying the dimensions of stigma. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to evaluate the psychosocial aspects of this infection and limit the stigma which patients may face returning to their daily routine. Further studies are needed with larger patient series and with the usage of psychometric instruments.","output":"SARSCoV-2 Psychosomatic Effects and Fear of Stigma on the Discharge Day of Infected Individuals: SAPFO Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public Health England guidance stipulates the use of filtering facepiece (FFP3) masks for healthcare workers engaged in aerosol-generating procedures. Mask fit-testing of respiratory protective equipment is essential to protect healthcare workers from aerosolized particles. AIM: To analyse the outcome of mask fit-testing across National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Using the Freedom of Information Act, 137 NHS hospitals were approached on May 26th, 2020 by an independent researcher to provide data on the outcome of fit-testing at each site. FINDINGS: Ninety-six hospitals responded to the request between May 26th, 2020 to October 29th, 2020. There was a total of 86 mask types used across 56 hospitals, 13 of which were used in at least 10% of these hospitals; the most frequently used was the FFP3M1863, used by 92.86% of hospitals. Overall fit-testing pass rates were provided by 32 hospitals with mean pass rate of 80.74%. The most successful masks, in terms of fit-test failure rates, were the Alpha Solway 3030V and the Alpha Solway S-3V (both reporting mean fit-test failures of 2%). Male- and female-specific pass and failure rates were provided by seven hospitals. Across the seven hospitals, 20.1% of men tested failed the fit-test for all masks used, whereas 19.9% of women tested failed the fit-test for all masks used. Failure rates were significantly higher in staff from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds 644/2507 (25.69%) across four hospitals. CONCLUSION: Twenty percent of healthcare workers tested during the first response to the pandemic failed fit-testing for masks.

However, the risk factors associated with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are yet to be described in detail. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the information of 1525 cases from the Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were generated to explore the relationship between procalcitonin (PCT) level and the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between disease severity in hospitalized patients and their PCT levels. Survival curves and the cumulative hazard function for COVID-19 progression were conducted in the two groups. To further detect the relationship between the computed tomography score and survival days, curve-fitting analyses were performed. Results: Patients in the elevated PCT group had a higher incidence of severe and critical severity conditions (P < 0.001), death, and higher computed tomography (CT) scores. There was an association between elevated PCT levels and mortality in the univariate ((hazard ratio [1], 3.377; 95% confidence interval [2], 1.012-10.344; P = 0.033) and multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR, 4.933; 95% CI, 1.170-20.788; P = 0.030). Similarly, patients with elevated PCT were more likely to have critically severe disease conditions in the univariate (odds ratio [2], 7.247; 95% CI, 3.559-14.757; P < 0.001) and multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR, 10.679; 95% CI, 4.562-25.000; P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed poorer prognosis for patients with elevated PCT (P = 0.024). The CT score 1 for patients with elevated PCT peaked at day 40 following the onset of symptoms then decreased gradually, while their total CT score was relatively stable. Conclusion: PCT level was shown as an independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Compared with inpatients with normal PCT levels, inpatients with elevated PCT levels had a higher risk for overall mortality and critically severe disease. These findings may provide guidance for improving the prognosis of patients with critically severe COVID-19.","output":"Association of procalcitonin levels with the progression and prognosis of hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider the stochastic contextual bandit problem under the high dimensional linear model.

Early prediction for optimal treatment results has received growing attention, but there is presently a lack of evidence regarding what information such proactive management should be based on. This study protocol, therefore, presents our planned systematic review and meta-analysis on important predictive factors for health and work-related outcomes following multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MDR) in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS We aim to perform a synthesis of the available evidence together with a meta-analysis of published peer-reviewed original research that includes predictive factors preceding MDR. Included are prospective studies of adults with benign, chronic (> 3 months) musculoskeletal pain diagnoses who have taken part in MDR. In the studies, associations between personal and rehabilitation-based factors and the outcomes of interest are reported. Outcome domains are pain, physical functioning including health-related quality of life, and work ability with follow-ups of 6 months or more. We will use a broad, explorative approach to any presented predictive factors (demographic, symptoms-related, physical, psychosocial, work-related, and MDR-related) and these will be analyzed through (a) narrative synthesis for each outcome domain and (b) if sufficient studies are available, a quantitative synthesis in which variance-weighted pooled proportions will be computed using a random effects model for each outcome domain. The strength of the evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. DISCUSSION The strength of this systematic review is that it aims for a meta-analysis of prospective cohort or randomized controlled studies by performing an extensive search of multiple databases, using an explorative study approach to predictive factors, rather than building on single predictor impact on the outcome or on predefined hypotheses. In this way, an overview of factors central to MDR outcome can be made and will help strengthen the evidence base and inform a wide readership including health care practitioners and policymakers.

The real-time estimation involves a number of important statistical problems to consider, and this chapter comprehensively describes commonly used estimation methods and their pitfalls. When estimating the case fatality risk (CFR) during the course of an epidemic, the data are right-censored because of the time delay from illness onset to death. A conventional survival analysis technique is employed for addressing right censoring. Identification of risk factors of death also requires the care for censored nature of the data, and we have devised a method that combines the survival analysis and logistic regression. Ascertainment bias is always a practical issue in interpreting the absolute value of the CFR or comparing CFR between different groups, and recent studies have shown that observational effort including seroepidemiological survey has to be made to overcome this bias.","output":"Chapter 6 Real-Time Estimation of the Case Fatality Ratio and Risk Factors of Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To present the impact of national lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of persistent secretory otitis media in children. Patients: Children aged from four to 13 years who were surgically treated from 1st January 2017 to 31th December 2020 at the University Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital Center Osijek. Methods: Patients underwent otomicroscopy, tympanometry, tone audiometry and fiberendoscopy of the epipharynx. After confirmation of the existence of secretory otitis the children were treated surgically, using adenotomy and myringotomy by inserting ventilation tubes in the equilateral ear. Results: This study included 107 children who were surgically treated with adenotomy and myringotomy by inserting ventilation tubes. The results showed a significant decline in the number of operations in 2020 compared to the previous three years, presumably due to national lockdown closures. We recorded the largest difference comparing 2018 and 2020, when the number of operations decreased by 87%. Conclusions: Drastic reduction of activities during the national lockdown closure, schooling from home and emphasizing the proper and regular implementation of personal hygiene have contributed to reducing the incidence of one of the most common infections in children. Lower frequency of acute otitis media has a positive effect on reducing the frequency of development of secretory otitis in children. Compared to the previous three years, there has been a significant decline in the number of children requiring surgical treatment.

Antibiotics, however, interfere with critical bacterial metabolic activities that can be required by phages. Explicit testing of antibiotic antagonism of phage infection activities, though, is not a common feature of phage therapy studies. Here we use optical density-based lysis-profile assays to assess the impact of two antibiotics, colistin and ciprofloxacin, on the bactericidal, bacteriolytic, and new-virion-production activities of three Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages. Though phages and antibiotics in combination are more potent in killing P. aeruginosa than either acting alone, colistin nevertheless substantially interferes with phage bacteriolytic and virion-production activities even at its minimum inhibitory concentration (1 MIC). Ciprofloxacin, by contrast, has little anti-phage impact at 1 or 3 MIC. We corroborate these results with more traditional measures, particularly colony-forming units, plaque-forming units, and one-step growth experiments. Our results suggest that ciprofloxacin could be useful as a concurrent phage therapy co-treatment especially when phage replication is required for treatment success. Lysis-profile assays also appear to be useful, fast, and high-throughput means of assessing antibiotic antagonism of phage infection activities.","output":"Friends or Foes?

METHODS RNA sequencing was employed to detect differentially circulating microRNA (miR) associated with VEGF in DM (Diabetes mellitus), NPDR (non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy) and PDR patients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the concentration of miR-15b in the serum of DM patients (n=115), NPDR (n=47) or PDR (n=76). The effects of miR-15b on DR and regulation of VEGF and endothelial cell function were also characterized. RESULTS We demonstrated that circulating miR-15b was directly associated with VEGF compared to other miRs in PDR patients. We found a significant inverse relationship between low levels of miR-15b and high levels of VEGF in patients with PDR when compared to the DM or NPDR groups. We found that miR-15b regulates the expression of VEGF by targeting the 3'-UTR regions to inhibit its transcription. Similarly, overexpression of miR-15b suppressed vascular abnormalities in vivo in diabetic GK rats, inhibiting endothelial tube formation, and VEGF expression.

In mice, XX female somatic cells show transcriptional X chromosome upregulation of their single active X chromosome, while the other X chromosome is inactive. Moreover, the inactive X chromosome is reactivated during development in the inner cell mass and in germ cells through X chromosome reactivation, which can be studied in vitro by reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. How chromatin processes and gene regulatory networks evolved to regulate X chromosome dosage in the somatic state and during X chromosome reactivation remains unclear. RESULTS: Using genome-wide approaches, allele-specific ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq, in female embryonic fibroblasts and during reprogramming to pluripotency, we show that chromatin accessibility on the upregulated mammalian active X chromosome is increased compared to autosomes. We further show that increased accessibility on the active X chromosome is erased by reprogramming, accompanied by erasure of transcriptional X chromosome upregulation and the loss of increased transcriptional burst frequency. In addition, we characterize gene regulatory networks during reprogramming and X chromosome reactivation, revealing changes in regulatory states. Our data show that ZFP42/REX1, a pluripotency-associated gene that evolved specifically in placental mammals, targets multiple X-linked genes, suggesting an evolutionary link between ZFP42/REX1, X chromosome reactivation, and pluripotency. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal the existence of intrinsic compensatory mechanisms that involve modulation of chromatin accessibility to counteract X-to-Autosome gene dosage imbalances caused by evolutionary or in vitro X chromosome loss and X chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells.

AIM: To understand the organisation and perceived impact of GP clusters, including how they use quantitative data for improvement. DESIGN AND SETTING: Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (n = 17) and observations of GP cluster meetings (n = 6) in two clusters. METHOD: This analytical strategy was combined with a purposive (variation) sampling approach to the sources of data, to try to identify commonalities across diverse stakeholder experiences of working in or on the idea of GP clusters. Variation was sought particularly in terms of stakeholders level of involvement in improvement initiatives, and in their disciplinary affiliations. RESULTS: There was uncertainty as to whether GP clusters should focus on activities generated internally or externally by the wider healthcare system (for example, from Scottish Health Boards), although the two observed clusters generally generated their own ideas and issues. Clusters operated with variable administrative/managerial and data support, and variable baseline leadership experience and QI skills. Qualitative approaches formed the focus of collaborative learning in cluster meetings, through sharing and discussion of member practices own understandings and experiences. Less evidence was observed of data analytics being championed in these meetings, partly because of barriers to accessing the analytics data and existing data quality. CONCLUSION: Cluster development would benefit from more consistent training and support for cluster leads in small-group facilitation, leadership, and QI expertise, and data analytics access and capacity.

While control measures, such as quarantine, lockdown and social distancing, reduce infections and infection-related deaths, they have severe negative economic and social consequences. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of different infectious disease control measures, and examine how respondents trade off between economic and health outcomes. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was developed, with attributes covering: control restrictions, duration of restrictions, tracking, number of infections and of deaths, unemployment, government expenditure and additional personal tax. A representative sample of Australians (n = 1046) completed the survey, which included eight choice tasks. Data were analysed using mixed logit regression to identify heterogeneity and latent class models to examine heterogeneity. RESULTS: In general, respondents had strong preferences for policies that avoided high infection-related deaths, although lower unemployment and government expenditure were also considered important. Respondents preferred a shorter duration for restrictions, but their preferences did not vary significantly for the differing levels of control measures. In terms of tracking, respondents preferred mobile phone tracking or bracelets when compared to no tracking.

There is a greater accent on Virtual communication. This paper aims to establish a relationship between Emotional intelligence and the effectiveness of Virtual communication on Decision making. This empirical study is based on a sample drawn from 296 working professionals at five different levels of organizational hierarchy. A standardized questionnaire ( = 0.824) was used to collect the responses of Emotional intelligence, Virtual communication, and Decision-making effectiveness. Hierarchical regression using PROCESS Macro model 1 was used to identify the moderating effect of Emotional intelligence on Virtual communication and Decision making effectiveness. Since the p-value (p  .007) is found significant, Emotional intelligence acts as a moderator that affects the strength of the relationship between Virtual communication effectiveness and Decision making. Validation of Task Technology fit theory is the theoretical implication of the study. Manipulation of individual dimensions in the model can reduce the dependence on technology for task completion with enhanced performance effectiveness. The findings are relevant to educators, consultants, and any professional who need to adapt Virtual communication platforms on an ongoing basis. Since work-life balance is projected as a constraint in this study, policymakers can consider policy amendments to reduce the stress caused due to Virtual communication which intrudes into their personal space.

They do this by utilizing their natural ability to shuttle signaling molecules across the cellular microenvironment and promote paracrine signaling. Currently, exosomes are being explored for their potential as therapeutic agents for various degenerative diseases including cancer. The rationale behind their therapeutic ability is that they can transfer signaling biomolecules, and subsequently induce metabolic and physiological changes in diseased cells and tissues. In addition, exosomes can be used as a drug delivery system and may be very effective at reducing toxicity and increasing bioavailability of therapeutic molecules and drugs. Although exosomes were first believed to be a waste product of the cell, current research has demonstrated that these particles can serve as modulators of the immune system, act as cancer biomarkers, cause re-differentiation of cancer cells, and induce apoptosis in diseased cells. Extensive research has been performed specifically using amniotic fluid-derived extracellular vesicles, named cytosomes. While the use of cytosomes in clinical application is still in the early stages, researchers have shown great potential for these EVs in regenerative medicine as immune modulators, in controlling microbial infection and by inducing tissue repair through the activation of endogenous, tissue-specific stem cells. This review emphasizes the capabilities of specific subsets of extracellular vesicles that can potentially be used for cancer therapy, principally as a source of bi-informational reprogramming for malignant cells.","output":"Evaluation of exosome derivatives as bio-informational reprogramming therapy for cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding food safety hazard risks is essential to avoid potential negative heath impacts in the food supply chain in a post-COVID-19 pandemic era.

METHODS Interrupted time-series analysis (ITSA) comparing hospitalization rate and timing of hip-fracture surgeries between pre- and post-quarantine period. The same data observed in Piedmont the year before were included as a control time series with no \\"intervention\\" (quarantine) in the middle of the observation period. RESULTS We found that 70.3% and 69.4% of hip-fracture patients received surgery within 2 days of hospital admission in the 16 weeks before and after the national quarantine, respectively. One-day surgery went from 46.0% to 46.5%, and same-day surgery from 13.3% to 12.4%. Unchanged trends were confirmed by ITSA after controlling for the 32-week time-series observed the year before. In the second week of March 2020, there was a borderline significant decrease in weekly hospital admissions for hip fractures as compared with that of the same week of March 2019 (-1.95 per 100 000, 95% CI = -4.10 to 0.21, P value = .075), followed by a weekly significant increase in the hospitalization rate (+0.14 per 100 000, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.27, P value = .039), although the difference-in-differences of slopes failed to achieve statistical significance (0.19 per 100 000, 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.41, P value = .090).

An important strategy to free up in-hospital capacity was development of a remote monitoring platform to support at-home care or early discharge of lower-risk patients with mild/moderate Covid-19 symptoms. Methods: The monitoring platform consisted of a patient-facing app + pulse oximeter (Bluetoothconnected Nonin 3230) enabling patients to record symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, diarrhea;severity rated on a 10-point scale), temperature & oxygen saturation (SpO2). Patients were prompted to record measurement 4 times/day. Patient-recorded data was viewed in real time by their healthcare centre via a dedicated web-based monitoring portal. Criteria for remote monitoring included: Covid-19 symptoms, positive for SARS-CoV-2, young age, absence of serious concomitant conditions, need for continued observation post-discharge. Treatment centres emailed app installation instructions and supplied a pulse oximeter to their patients. Treatment centres & patients received alerts if pulse oximetry values crossed pre-defined thresholds. Results: Between 13 March and 31 October 2020, 1,045 patients at 8 primary & 15 secondary care centres had used the remote monitoring platform [median duration: 13 days (interquartile range 10-23 days)]. 11 patients were admitted to hospital and 12 previously hospitalized patients were readmitted. 933 patients (89%) gave consent to use of their pseudonymised data for research. Symptoms and physiological markers of severity of infection varied considerably. 871 patients recorded breathlessness data with 53 rating severity as 6/10 and 23 as 8/10. 300 patients recorded diarrhea data with 24 rating severity as 6/10 and 6 as 8/10 (see Figure).

Hence, this study is to report the long-term outcome of LSG as primary bariatric procedure and the result of revisional surgery. METHODS With retrospective analysis of a prospective bariatric database, participants who defaulted clinic follow-up were interviewed by telephone. A total of 667 LSG was performed as primary bariatric procedure (2006-2012) with mean age of 34.5  9.7 years old, female 74.7%, mean body mass index (BMI) 37.3  8.1 kg/m(2). A 36-F bougie was used for all cases. RESULTS There were 61 patients available with long-term data. The weight loss outcome at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years showed a mean BMI 26.3, 25.2, 25.3, 27.1, and 26.2 with mean excess weight loss (EWL) 76.0%, 79.6%, 77.3%, 73.4%, and 72.6% respectively. However, 17% patients developed de novo gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Eighteen patients (2.2%) needed surgical revisions due to weight regain (n = 6), persistent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; n = 2), stricture (n = 2), and GERD (n = 8). The revision resulted in an additional mean excess weight loss of 23.8% with mean BMI 24.9 kg/m(2) at 6 months postoperatively. There was a 23.7% mean reduction of HbA1c with one patient who was in complete diabetic remission at 1 year. CONCLUSION Our results showed LSG is a durable bariatric procedure with > 70% EWL at 5 years despite a high incidence of GERD.

METHODS: We conducted a case cohort study of autoimmune disease patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR) from February 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020, and compared them in a 1:3 ratio with uninfected patients who were matched based on race, age, sex, and comorbidity index. Patient demographics, clinical course, and outcomes were compared among these patient groups. RESULTS: A total of 70 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 56.6 years; 64% African American) were identified. The 34 (49%) patients who were hospitalized used oral glucocorticoids more frequently than those treated as outpatients (p < 0.01). All 10 patients using anti-TNF medications were treated as outpatients (p < 0.01). Those hospitalized with COVID-19 more often required ICU admission (17 (50%) vs 27 (26%), p = 0.01) and intubation (10 (29%) vs 6 (6%), p < 0.01) than uninfected patients and had higher mortality rates (6 (18%) vs 3 (3%), p < 0.01). Of the six COVID-19 patients who died, only one was of African ancestry (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic disease patients infected with COVID-19 were more likely to require ICU admission, ventilation, and died more frequently versus uninfected patients with autoimmune disease. Patients on anti-TNF medications were hospitalized less frequently, while those on chronic glucocorticoids were hospitalized more frequently.

Infected pigs would consume more feed and require protracted production time to reach market weight. In our observational longitudinal study, growth performance data from 728 control pigs and 193 infected pigs with known viral shedding time points were analyzed using mixed linear regression models to give estimates of the marginal effects of infection. Gaussian curves describing the variability of the estimates at the individual pig level formed the fundamental inputs to our stochastic models. The models were constructed to simulate the summed negative effects of the infection at the batch level of 150 fattening pigs growing from 33 to 100 kg. Other inputs of variability and uncertainty were 1) batch transmission points, 2) pig infection points to reflect the disease transmission dynamics of the virus, and 3) final prevalence of infected pigs in the batch. Monte Carlo random sampling gave 5,000 estimates on the outputs of the marginal effects for each pig. These results were summed up to provide estimates for a batch size of 150 pigs. This figure was adjusted by our final prevalence distribution function, which was also derived from the longitudinal study with 12 cohorts of infected pigs. For a 150-fattening-pig herd randomly selected from the population, the marginal effects of the infection were 1) 835 kg (fifth percentile) to 1,350 kg (95th percentile) increased feed intake and 2) 194 (fifth percentile) to 334 (95th percentile) pig days in excess of expected figures for an uninfected batch. A batch infected during growth phase 3 (81 to 100 kg BW) gave the worst results since the longitudinal study showed that a pig infected during growth phase 3 required more feed and a greater protracted production time compared to younger infected pigs. Sensitivity analysis showed that final prevalence had the greatest impact on the conditional mean and variation of the marginal effects of infections. Batch transmission point was the next most influential factor. Lowering the final prevalence and preventing older fattening pigs from being infected will have the greatest benefit in saving feed cost and reducing delay in getting the pigs to the market.","output":"Production impact of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection on fattening pigs in Norway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social constructs are known risk factors for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.

Here we show healthy human lung slices cultured ex vivo can be productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the cellular tropism of the virus and its distinct and dynamic effects on host cell gene expression can be determined by single cell RNA sequencing and reconstruction of infection pseudotime for individual lung cell types. This revealed the prominent SARS-CoV-2 target is a population of activated interstitial macrophages, which as infection proceeds accumulate thousands of viral RNA molecules per cell, comprising up to 60% of the cellular transcriptome and including canonical and novel subgenomic RNAs. During viral takeover, there is cell-autonomous induction of a specific host interferon program and seven chemokines (CCL2, 7, 8, 13, CXCL10) and cytokines (IL6, IL10), distinct from the response of alveolar macrophages in which neither viral takeover nor induction of a substantial inflammatory response occurs. Using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus, we show that entry into purified human lung macrophages depends on Spike but is not blocked by cytochalasin D or by an ACE2-competing monoclonal antibody, indicating a phagocytosis- and ACE2-independent route of entry. These results provide a molecular characterization of the initiation of COVID-19 in human lung tissue, identify activated interstitial macrophages as a prominent site of viral takeover and focus of inflammation, and suggest targeting of these macrophages and their signals as a new therapeutic modality for COVID-19 pneumonia and progression to ARDS.

However, staying abreast of current disease outbreaks requires scouring a continually growing number of disparate news sources and alert services, resulting in information overload. Our objective is to address this challenge through the HealthMap.org Web application, an automated system for querying, filtering, integrating and visualizing unstructured reports on disease outbreaks. DESIGN: This report describes the design principles, software architecture and implementation of HealthMap and discusses key challenges and future plans. MEASUREMENTS: We describe the process by which HealthMap collects and integrates outbreak data from a variety of sources, including news media (e.g., Google News), expert-curated accounts (e.g., ProMED Mail), and validated official alerts. Through the use of text processing algorithms, the system classifies alerts by location and disease and then overlays them on an interactive geographic map. We measure the accuracy of the classification algorithms based on the level of human curation necessary to correct misclassifications, and examine geographic coverage. RESULTS: As part of the evaluation of the system, we analyzed 778 reports with HealthMap, representing 87 disease categories and 89 countries.

Increasing numbers are reaching older age. We describe psychological and socioeconomic factors among women with HIV in England aged 45C60 and explore associations with ethnicity. METHODS: Analysis of cross-sectional data on 724 women recruited to the PRIME Study. Psychological symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 4 and social isolation with a modified Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Scale. RESULTS: Black African (BA) women were more likely than Black Caribbean or White British (WB) women to have a university education (48.3%, 27.0%, 25.7%, respectively, p<0.001), but were not more likely to be employed (68.4%, 61.4%, 65.2%, p=0.56) and were less likely to have enough money to meet their basic needs (56.4%, 63.0%, 82.9%, p<0.001). BA women were less likely to report being diagnosed with depression than WB women (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.40, p<0.001) but more likely to report current psychological distress (aOR 3.34, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We report high levels of poverty, psychological distress and social isolation in this ethnically diverse group of midlife women with HIV, especially among those who were BA. Despite being more likely to experience psychological distress, BA women were less likely to have been diagnosed with depression suggesting a possible inequity in access to mental health services.

These behavioral patterns affect and are affected by the quality of mother-infant interaction. In most studies with full-term infants, the Social-Positive Oriented pattern (i.e., the infant's ability to soothe his/her emotions in the context of reciprocal and positive interactions) is the most prevalent pattern, followed by the Distressed-Inconsolable and by the Self-Comfort Oriented patterns. However, these patterns are understudied in other populations beyond the US and European countries. The current research addresses this gap by studying the regulatory behavior patterns and their association with mother-infant interactions in Brazilian dyads and evaluating the association of these regulatory patterns with demographics. Analyses were based on data collected for 40 infants (20 boys, 20 girls) and their mothers. Infants' regulatory behavior patterns were evaluated in the Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm and mother-infant interaction was evaluated during free play at 3 months age. Notably, our findings indicate that Distressed-Inconsolable was the most prevalent pattern in this sample; followed by the Social-Positive Oriented and the Self-Comfort Oriented patterns.

To determine the patient surgical perspective and satisfaction in terms of pain control, return to normal activity, and overall results of surgery for two groups who underwent SP and Xi radical prostatectomy. The data from 71 consecutive patients who underwent SP RARP in a single center from June 2019 to April 2020 was compared to 875 patients who underwent Xi RARP in the same period. A single surgeon performed all procedures with a transperitoneal technique. After a propensity score match, two groups of 71 patients (SP and Xi) were selected and compared in the study. Patients were contacted by phone by two interviewers and a questionnaire was administered in English or Spanish. Patients were instructed not to disclose the type of robotic surgery they underwent, as interviewers were blinded to that information. A validated Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8) was used, along with an additional question from our institution asking about the satisfaction with the number of incision sites (GRI-1). Data were analyzed as continuous and discrete variables to compare the differences between the Xi and SP cohorts. A response rate of 85.9% (n = 61) in the Xi group and 73.2% (n = 52) in the SP group was captured. Overall satisfaction with surgical results was 80% and 88% in the Xi and SP cohorts, respectively. No statistical difference in responses was found between the Xi and SP cohorts for SSQ-8. However, GRI-1 demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) in terms of number of scars that favors the SP approach. Limitations of this study are the small sample size and recall bias. We found no statistical difference between the groups regarding the answers for SSQ-8 questionnaire; both groups were very satisfied. When assessing the number of incision sites with the GRI-1 question, patients who underwent MP had lower satisfaction rates compared to SP. These patients perceived the number of scars and their appearance as reason for lower satisfaction. We believe that future studies should consider patients postoperative perspective when adopting new platforms in order to combine adequate treatment with patient expectations. We performed a study assessing the postoperative satisfaction and perspectives of two groups of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with two different robots (SP and Xi). There was no difference in patient satisfaction with the results of either the da Vinci(?)

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for over 3.1 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of a second and a third wave of infection across the globe, and the rising record of multiple reinfections and relapses, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows no sign of abating. In addition, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with neurological symptoms that include early hyposmia, ischemic stroke, meningitis, delirium and falls, even after viral clearance. This may suggest chronic or permanent changes to the neurons, glial cells, and/or brain vasculature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Within the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as the central housekeepers against altered homeostatic states, including during viral neurotropic infections. In this review, we highlight microglial responses to viral neuroinfections, especially those with a similar genetic composition and route of entry as SARS-CoV-2. As the primary sensor of viral infection in the CNS, we describe the pathogenic and neuroinvasive mechanisms of RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 vis--vis the microglial means of viral recognition. Responses of microglia which may culminate in viral clearance or immunopathology are also covered. Lastly, we further discuss the implication of SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion on microglial plasticity and associated long-term neurodegeneration. As such, this review provides insight into some of the mechanisms by which microglia could contribute to the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae and disorders, including Parkinsons disease, which could be pervasive in the coming years given the growing numbers of infected and re-infected individuals globally.","output":"Microglial Implications in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19: Lessons From Viral RNA Neurotropism and Possible Relevance to Parkinsons Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not available.","output":"A third anti-SARS-Cov2 mRNA dose does not overcome the pejorative impact of anti-CD20 therapy and/or low immunoglobulin levels in patients with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been said that fewer or greater numbers of driver's licenses may be issued in future.

Contemporary in-service training for commercial pilots has shifted focus from extended practicing of general flight skills like navigation and radio use. Pilots now spend many hours each year in simulators training to building knowledge, experience and thus muscle memory for how to respond when the airplane's extensive interconnected collection of semi- and fully-autonomous fly-by-wire systems go awry. While the plane itself is actually flying for much of the time during most flights today, the pilot's license still attests to their ability to assume full control and complete the flight where it becomes necessary.

So, its important to determine the risk factors associated with Legionella colonization in health care centres. In recent years that is why new diagnostic techniques have been developed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risks factors for Legionella colonization using a novel and more sensitive Legionella positivity index. METHODS: A total of 204 one-litre water samples (102 cold water samples and 102 hot water samples), were collected from 68 different sampling sites of the hospital water system and tested for Legionella spp. by two laboratories using culture, polymerase chain reaction and a method based on immunomagnetic separation (IMS). A Legionella positivity index was defined to evaluate Legionella colonization and associated risk factors in the 68 water samples sites. We performed bivariate analyses and then logistic regression analysis with adjustment of potentially confounding variables. We compared the performance of culture and IMS methods using this index as a new gold standard to determine if rapid IMS method is an acceptable alternative to the use of slower culture method. RESULTS: Based on the new Legionella positivity index, no statistically significant differences were found neither between laboratories nor between methods (culture, IMS). Positivity was significantly correlated with ambulatory health assistance (p = 0.05) and frequency of use of the terminal points. The logistic regression model revealed that chlorine (p = 0.009) and the frequency of use of the terminal points (p = 0.001) are predictors of Legionella colonization. Regarding this index, the IMS method proved more sensitive (69%) than culture method (65.4%) in hot water samples. SIGNIFICANCE: We showed that the frequency of use of terminal points should be considered when examining environmental Legionella colonization, which can be better evaluated using the provided Legionella positivity index.

Patients younger than 14 years of age that had an oncological diagnosis and COVID-19 or multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) who were treated in the inpatient setting were included. The primary exposure was the diagnosis and treatment status, and the primary outcome was mortality. We defined new diagnosis as patients with no previous diagnosis of cancer, established diagnosis as patients with cancer and ongoing treatment and relapse as patients with cancer and ongoing treatment that had a prior cancer-free period. A frequentist analysis was performed including a multivariate logistic regression for mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred and ten patients were included in the study; 30 (14%) died during the study period and 67% of patients who died were admitted to critical care. Demographics were similar in survivors and non-survivors. Patients with low weight for age (<-2SD) had higher mortality (28 vs. 3%, p = 0.019). There was statistically significant difference of mortality between patients with new diagnosis (36.7%), established diagnosis (1.4%) and relapse (60%), (p <0.001). Most patients had hematological cancers (69%) and they had higher mortality (18%) compared to solid tumors (6%, p= 0.032). Patients with concomitant bacterial infections had higher mortality (40%, p = 0.001). MIS-C, respiratory distress, cardiovascular symptoms, altered mental status and acute kidney injury on admission were associated with higher mortality. Acidosis, hypoxemia, lymphocytosis, severe neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia on admission were also associated with mortality. A multivariate logistic regression showed risk factors associated with mortality: concomitant bacterial infection OR 3 95%CI (1.1C8.5), respiratory symptoms OR 5.7 95%CI (1.7C19.4), cardiovascular OR 5.2 95%CI (1.2C14.2), new cancer diagnosis OR 12 95%CI (1.3C102) and relapse OR 25 95%CI (2.9C214).

METHODS The study enrolled 39 patients who had fully recovered from COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. OCT-A image acquisitions were obtained using AngioVue software (version 2017.1.0.151) and the RTVue XR Avanti imaging system (Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA). Nonflow area in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area in the whole retinal vasculature, FAZ perimeter, acircularity index of FAZ, and foveal density were automatically obtained with the FAZ assessment tool. Vessel density (VD) at the SCP and deep capillary plexus were also measured. RESULTS Compared to the control group, the nonflow area and the FAZ area in the whole retina was greater in the COVID-19 group; however no statistically significant difference was observed (p > 0.05 respectively). As for vessel densities, all superficial parafoveal VD parameters were considerably higher in the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (p < 0.05 respectively).

Based on experimental infections with the North American and S large-DEL types, we also hypothesized that PEDV virulence may be linked to the S1 subunit of the S protein. To test this hypothesis, we have now assayed in gnotobiotic piglets various recombinant PEDVs generated by reverse genetics. Piglets inoculated with CV777 maintained in National Institute of Animal Health, along with piglets infected with a recombinant form of the same virus, developed subclinical to mild diarrhea. In contrast, severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, astasia, and high mortality were observed in piglets inoculated with recombinant strains in which the S gene was partially or fully replaced with corresponding sequences from the highly virulent Japanese PEDV isolate OKN-1/JPN/2013. Indeed, symptoms resembled those in piglets inoculated with the OKN-1/JPN/2013, and were especially pronounced in younger piglets. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the S1 subunit of the S protein is an important determinant of PEDV virulence, and advance development of new vaccine candidate.","output":"S1 Subunit of Spike Protein from a Current Highly Virulent Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Is an Important Determinant of Virulence in Piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous advanced MR imaging and computed tomographic techniques have been developed and implemented in clinical practice over the past several years resulting in increased diagnostic accuracy and improved patient care.

India recently experienced an unprecedented transmission surge, likely fueled by a premature reopening, the highly transmissible delta variant, and low vaccination rates. Indian media have reported high degrees of vaccine hesitancy, which could interfere with efforts to prevent future surges, making it crucial to better understand the reasons for such reluctance in vulnerable populations, such as people living with HIV. METHODS: We conducted telephone interviews with 438 people living with HIV who were participants in a longitudinal cohort, designed to examine and validate novel antiretroviral therapy ART adherence measures. Interviews were conducted in January and February 2021 and covered COVID-19Crelated questions on confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy, worries of vaccine side effects, trust in COVID-19 information from specific sources, and intent to get vaccinated. RESULTS: Over one-third of participants (38.4%, n = 168) met our definition of vaccine hesitant by reporting being either unlikely to get vaccinated at all or wanting to wait. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with lack of confidence in vaccine safety, concerns about side effects and efficacy, and distrust in common sources of vaccine-related information. DISCUSSION: These results highlight several challenges for vaccination efforts. Campaigns may benefit from using trusted sources, including antiretroviral therapy center staff, providing clear information about safety and efficacy and emphasizing the role of vaccines in preventing severe disease, hospitalizations and death, and the reduction of forward transmission to unvaccinated household members.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among PLWH in South India: Implications for Vaccination Campaigns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutrophils are being increasingly recognized as an important element in tumor progression.

Evaluating the public health threat posed by a new variant is essential for appropriately adapting response efforts when community transmission is detected. However, this assessment requires that a true comparison can be made between the new variant and its predecessors because factors other than the virus genotype may influence spread and transmission. In this study, we develop a framework that integrates genomic surveillance data to estimate the relative effective reproduction number (R(t)) of co-circulating lineages. We use Connecticut, a state in the northeastern United States in which the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 co-circulated in early 2021, as a case study for implementing this framework. We find that the R(t) of B.1.1.7 was 6C10% larger than that of B.1.526 in Connecticut in the midst of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. To assess the generalizability of this framework, we apply it to genomic surveillance data from New York City and observe the same trend. Finally, we use discrete phylogeography to demonstrate that while both variants were introduced into Connecticut at comparable frequencies, clades that resulted from introductions of B.1.1.7 were larger than those resulting from B.1.526 introductions.

Recent clinical data has highlighted that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease, and stroke. Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiorgan failure and increased mortality. The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 are due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endothelial cells via ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface. However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet, and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (eg, as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance. Several antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat, and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects. The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients are driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic complications and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications. The shifting paradigm of diagnostic and treatment strategies holds significant promise to reduce the burden of thrombotic complications and ultimately improve the prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","output":"The Emerging Threat of (Micro)Thrombosis in COVID-19 and Its Therapeutic Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The fibula free flap is a major workhorse in facial reconstruction. To decrease operative times, virtual surgical planning (VSP) has been implemented. Traditional VSP is costly and may delay operative planning. In this study, the authors present a novel algorithm using readily accessible software packages to perform VSP in a manner that is quick and cost-effective. METHODS A 6-part survey was administered to physicians with prior training in facial reconstruction. Fourteen physicians participated regarding outcomes on 10 patients who underwent mandibular or midfacial fibula free flap reconstruction. Participants were asked to match the true postoperative and VSP models and rate the similarity of the models using the Likert scale (0-10). The goal was to determine whether the VSP models accurately depicted the actual reconstruction, and whether they would use VSP in future clinical practice. RESULTS The physicians surveyed were able to match the models correctly 93.6% of the time. The mean score for the similarity between virtual and actual models ranged between 7.60 and 8.80. Most participants (90.9%) who answered stated they would use our VSP algorithm if they were trained in the protocol. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Virtual surgical planning models were created utilizing our novel algorithm. Participants matched the preoperative VSP plan with the postoperative model most of the time and rated the similarity well. Participants in our study are interested in learning more about physician performed VSP.

This study aimed to examine the public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines, the variance of these attitudes, and associated determinants within a large COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam. METHODS: Two focus group discussions were conducted online with 20 people from different socio-economic and profession backgrounds. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants. Discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Key themes were extracted using reflexive thematic analysis method. RESULTS: Four distinct, non-static attitudes including acceptance, conditional acceptance, hesitancy, and anti-vaccination were found. Themes identified as determinants of these attitudes were external factors, internal factors, and risk-benefit self-assessment regarding COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: We found mixed, non-static COVID-19 vaccination attitudes. People's vaccination risk-benefit self-assessment greatly determines the variance of their attitudes over time. Given high public trust in the authorities, the government should take the lead to counter COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. To increase acceptance, vaccine advertising campaigns should focus on providing information about the dangers of COVID-19, the ability to manage side-effects at the vaccination centers, and updated, precise information on both the outbreak and vaccines.

Several clinical trials are ongoing for therapeutic alternatives, however with little success rate. Considering that the time is crucial, the drug repurposing and data obtained from in silico models are one of the most important approaches to identify possible lead inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.

The Main Protease (Mpro), a key enzyme in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, is found close homolog to the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) protease and could be susceptible of blocking its activity by DAAs. In the current study, the DAAs were investigated as antivirals using structure based computational approach against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to propose them as new therapeutics. In total, 20 DAAs of HCV, including a reference compound O6K were docked against Mpro. The docked structures were examined and resulted in the identification of six highly promising DAAs i.e. beclabuvir, elbasvir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, simeprevir, and asunapevir exhibiting high theoretical binding affinity to Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to other DAAs. Furthermore, the post docking analysis revealed that Cys145, Glu166, His163, Thr26, His41, and Met165 played potential role for the binding of these DAAs inside binding site of Mpro.

For instance, COVID-19 and climate change affect deprived and vulnerable communities the most, which implies that effectively designed policies that mitigate these risks may also reduce the widening inequalities that they cause. Both problems can be characterized as low-probability-high consequence (LP-HC) risks, which are associated with various behavioral biases that imply that individual behavior deviates from rational risk assessments by experts and optimal preparedness strategies. One could view the COVID-19 pandemic as a rapid learning experiment about how to cope more effectively with climate change and develop actions for reducing its impacts before it is too late. However, the ensuing question relates to whether the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath will speed up climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, which depends on how individuals perceive and take action to reduce LP-HC risks. Using insights into behavioral biases in individual decisions about LP-HC risks based on decades of empirical research in psychology and behavioral economics, we illustrate how parallels can be drawn between decision-making processes about COVID-19 and climate change. In particular, we discuss six important risk-related behavioral biases in the context of individual decision making about these two global challenges to derive lessons for climate policy. We contend that the impacts from climate change can be mitigated if we proactively draw lessons from the pandemic, and implement policies that work with, instead of against, an individual's risk perceptions and biases.

Once these parameters have been estimated, we use the one-step method to predict the unobserved states evolution over time. This gives us unique insights into the evolution of happiness.

However, the inflammatory response in Corona virus disease-19 (Covid-19) and its potential to cause collateral organ damage has not been fully elucidated to date. This study aims to characterize the acute cytokine response in a cohort of critically ill Covid-19 patients. METHOD: 24 adults with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 were included at time of admission to intensive care a median of eleven days after initial symptoms. Eleven adult patients admitted for elective abdominal surgery with preoperative plasma samples served as controls. All patients were included after informed consent was obtained. 27 cytokines were quantified in plasma. The expression of inflammatory mediators was then related to routine inflammatory markers, SAPS3, SOFA score, organ failure and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A general increase in cytokine expression was observed in all Covid-19 patients. A strong correlation between respiratory failure and IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 expression was observed. Acute kidney injury development correlated well with increased levels of IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17a, IP-10 and MCP-1. Generally, the cohort demonstrated weaker correlations between cytokine expression and 30-day mortality out of which IL-8 showed the strongest signal in terms of mortality. CONCLUSION: The present study found that respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and 30-day mortality in critically ill Covid-19 patients are associated with moderate increases of a broad range of inflammatory mediators at time of admission.","output":"Increased levels of plasma cytokines and correlations to organ failure and 30-day mortality in critically ill Covid-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 vaccines provide high levels of protection against severe disease and hospitalization due to severe acute respiratory syndrome\\\\related coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection.

There is therefore a pressing need to develop a method to efficiently purify and enrich phosphopeptides derived from viral particles in biological samples. In this study, we utilized Phos-tag technology to analyze the functional phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein (N protein; NP) of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Viral particles were collected from culture supernatants of SARS-CoV-2-infected VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells by ultracentrifugation, and phosphopeptides were purified by Phos-tag magnetic beads for LC-MS/MS analysis. Analysis revealed that NP was reproducibly phosphorylated at serine 79 (Ser79). Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the Ser79 was a distinct phospho-acceptor site in SARS-CoV-2 but not in other beta-coronaviruses. We also found that the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 bound to the phosphorylated Ser79 in NP and positively regulated the production of viral particles. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have acquired the potent virus-host interaction during its evolution mediated by viral protein phosphorylation. Moreover, Phos-tag technology can provide a useful means for analyzing the functional phosphorylation of viral proteins. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional phosphorylation of SARS-CoV-2 NP. For this purpose, we used Phos-tag technology to purify and enrich virus-derived phosphopeptides with high selectivity and reproducibility. This method can be particularly useful in analyzing viral phosphopeptides from cell culture supernatants that often contain high concentrations of fetal bovine serum and supplements. We newly identified an NP phosphorylation site at Ser79, which is important for Pin1 binding. Furthermore, we showed that the interaction between Pin1 and phosphorylated NP could enhance viral replication in a cell culture model.","output":"Phosphopeptide enrichment using Phos-tag technology reveals functional phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Treatment (ttm) of cancer patients (pts) was compromised during the first wave of COVID19 pandemic due to collapse of healthcare systems. Standard of care (SOC) for LA-HNSCC pts had to be adapted as operating rooms were temporarily unavailable, and to reduce risk of COVID19 exposure. The IMPACCT study evaluated the outcome of LA-HNSCC pts treated at the Catalan Institute of Oncology during the first semester of 2020 and compared it to a control cohort previously treated in the same institution. Methods: Retrospective single institution analysis of two consecutively-treated cohorts of newly-diagnosed HNSCC pts: from January to June of 2020 (CT20) and same period of 2018 and 2019 (CT18-19). Pt demographics and disease characteristics were obtained from our in-site prospective database. Ttm modifications from SOC as per COVID19- contingency protocol in CT20 for LA-HNSCC were collected. Chi-squared was used to compare variables and ttm response between cohorts. One-year recurrence-free survival (1yRFS) and overall survival (1yOS) of LA-HNSCC pts were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by Log-rank test. Results: A total of 306 pts were included: CT20=99;CT18- 19=207. Baseline characteristics were balanced between cohorts (Table1). In pts treated with conservative ttm (non-surgical approach), persistence disease was higher in CT20 vs CT18- 19 (26 vs. 10% p=0.02). Median follow-up of CT20 and CT18-19 was 6.8 months (IQR 5.1-7.9) and 12.3 (6.7-18.4), respectively. A trend towards lower 1yRFS and 1yOS was observed in CT20 vs CT18-19 (72 vs 83% p=0.06;80 vs 84% p=0.07), respectively. Within CT20, 37 pts (37%) had one or more ttm modifications: switch from surgery to conservative ttm (n=13);altered radiotherapy fractionation (n=14);reduced cisplatin cumulative dose to 200mg/m2 (n=19);no adjuvant ttm (n=1). Pts who received modified ttm had no differences in 1yRFS vs those who did not (80 vs 66% p=0.31), but higher 1yOS was observed (97 vs 67% p&lt;0.01).

Conclusions: COVID19 pandemic had a negative impact on ttm outcomes and survival in LA-HNSCC pts when compared to our historical cohort. Ttm modifications based on COVID19-contingency protocol did not compromise ttm efficacy in terms of RFS and was associated with better OS in Stage III/IVA.","output":"Impact of COVID19 pandemic on treatment outcome of locallyadvanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC): IMPACCT study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: No epidemiological data exists for the association between mental disorders and the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Aims: To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. Methods: We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on the national health insurance data. Each patient with a mental or behavioral disorder (diagnosed during six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index with up to four patients without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk and risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 230,565 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33,653 (14.6%) had mental disorders, 928/33,653 (2.76%) tested positive, and 56/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariate analysis with the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.12); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.81). Among confirmed cases, mortality risk significantly increased in patients with mental disorders (OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 1.07-3.15).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China in April 2020. METHODS: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme were recruited in tertiary education institutions/universities in Hong Kong and Putian. The participants completed the questionnaire with six scales: Social Distancing Scale; Personal Hygiene Scale; Empathic Responding Scale; Wishful Thinking Scale; Perceived Stress Scale and Perceived Threat Scale. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the preventive measures outcomes. p value < .05 was considered as statistical significance. RESULTS: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing (SoD) and personal hygiene measures (PHM). Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance with SoD and PHM. The final model constructed demonstrated a very good fit to the data. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance with the COVID-19 preventive measures. IMPACT: The predictive model constructed is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance with infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. As the infection control behaviours of healthcare students, whom are still under training and are the high-risk group of being infected and infecting others in the community, are rarely reported in literature, this study has provided empirical evidence to nurses and other healthcare professionals to identify students susceptible to poor compliance and provide early monitoring and education to suppress the COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Associations between demographic characteristics, perceived threat, perceived stress, coping responses and adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures among Chinese healthcare students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, older adults from vulnerable ethnoracial groups are at high risk of infection, hospitalization, and death.

METHODS: We summarized the epidemic prevention and control policies in Japan, Italy, China, and Singapore, and analyzed the policy effects of these four countries by using the data published by Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. RESULTS: As of May 27, 2020, the growing trend of new cases in Japan, Italy, China and Singapore has stabilized. However, the cumulative number of confirmed cases (231139) and case-fatality rate (14.3%) in Italy far exceeded those in the other three countries, and the effect of epidemic control was inferior. Singapore began to experience a domestic resurgence after April 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases reaching 32,876, but the case-fatality rate remained extremely low (0.1%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in China (84547) was almost stagnant, and the case-fatality rate was low (5.5%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in Japan (16661) increased slowly, and the case-fatality rate (4.8%) was slightly lower than that in China. CONCLUSION: This study divided the epidemic prevention and control policies of the four countries into two categories: the blocking measures adopted by China and Singapore, and the mitigation measures adopted by Japan and Italy. According to the Epidemic control results of these four countries, we can conclude that the blocking measures were generally effective. As the core strategy of blocking measures, admitting mild patients into hospital and cases tracing helped curb the spread of the outbreak in Singapore and China. Countries should choose appropriate response strategies on the premise of considering their own situation, increase investment in health resources to ensure global health equity, and eventually control the spread of infectious diseases in the world effectively.","output":"Policy disparities in fighting COVID-19 among Japan, Italy, Singapore and China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions may impact lifestyle and therefore also physical (in)activity patterns in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of lockdown on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. METHODS: A total of 1565 Dutch CVD patients participated in this prospective cohort study, in which we compared physical activity and sedentary behaviour before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Baseline measures were assessed in 2018 and data on follow-up measures were collected between 17 and 24 April 2020 (5 weeks after the introduction of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions). Validated questionnaires were used to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviour. RESULTS: Moderate-to-vigorous physical activities increased from 1.6 (0.9, 2.8) to 2.0 (1.0, 3.5)a?h/day [median (interquartile range)] (pa?<a?0.001) during the COVID-19 lockdown, mainly due to an increase in time spent walking and doing odd jobs. In contrast, time spent exercising significantly declined [1.0 (0.0, 2.3) to 0.0 (0.0, 0.6)a?h/week], whereas sedentary time increased from 7.8 (6.1, 10.4) to 8.9 (6.8, 11.4)a?h/day (pa?<a?0.001). The absolute increase in physical activity was 13 (-36, 81) min/day, whereas sedentary behaviour increased by 55 (-72, 186) min/day. CONCLUSION: Despite a small increase in physical activities, the larger increase in sedentary time induced a net reduction in habitual physical activity levels in Dutch CVD patients during the first-wave COVID-19 lockdown. Since a more inactive lifestyle is strongly associated with disease progression and mortality, we encourage CVD patients and their caregivers to explore novel solutions to increase physical activity levels and reduce sedentary time during (and beyond) the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity and sedentary behaviour in Dutch cardiovascular disease patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alexithymia is defined as the lack of words to describe emotions and is associated with different psychopathologies.

Validation of such a tool in different cultures allows cross-cultural health psychology studies and facilitates knowledge transfer in the field. We aimed to examine the psychometric features of the PAQ in the Farsi-speaking population in Iran.

METHODS Seven patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University Yuedong Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and their clinical features, serological and radiological longitudinal changes were analyzed. RESULTS Among the 7 patients, all (100%) had a clear epidemiological history. The most common symptoms were respiratory symptoms 6 (85.7%), and only 2 (28.6%) of the patients had fever at their first visit. The cohort included 4 (57.1%) common types and 3 (42.9%) severe types. Two (28.6%) common type patients developed to severe type in a short time. All of the 7 patients (100%) had abnormal liver function, normal renal function, and normal procalcitonin. The detection time of specific antibody in 7 patients was 5 - 13 days after symptoms. Before the specific antibody could be detected, the absolute value of lymphocytes decreased in 2 (28.6%) common type cases transferred to severe type cases accompanied with obvious progress in pulmonary imaging. The phenomenon of decreased albumin and elevated globulin occurred in 6 patients (85.7%). The predominant pattern of lung lesions observed was bilateral (71.4%) and mainly near the pleura at the first diagnosis. Bilateral pulmonary involvement occurred in 6 cases (85.7%) during the course of disease. In 4 cases (57.1%) with obvious pulmonary lesions, the absolute value of lymphocytes decreased, albumin decreased, and globulin increased during the course of the disease.

OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of digital interventions in asthma with regards to acceptability and outcomes and evaluate the potential of digital initiatives for monitoring or treating patients with asthma. METHODS We evaluated digital interventions using a scoping review methodology via literature search and review. Of 871 articles identified, 121 were evaluated to explore intervention characteristics, the perception and acceptability of digital interventions to patients and physicians, and effects on asthma outcomes. Interventions were categorized by their level of interactivity with the patient. RESULTS Interventions featuring non-individualized content sent to patients appeared capable of promoting improved adherence to inhaled corticosteroids, but with no identified improvement in asthma burden, and data-gathering interventions appeared to have little effect on adherence or asthma burden. Evidence of improvement in both adherence and patients' impairment due to asthma were seen only with interactive interventions involving two-way responsive patient communication. Digital interventions were generally positively perceived by patients and physicians. Implementation was considered feasible, with certain preferences for design and features important to drive usage.

Utilising a case study of Italian vaccination policy, the article considers counterfactuals and the challenges of governing health policy in an age of disinformation. It counterposes two methods of governing vaccination compliance: discipline, which uses public institutions to inculcate the population with favourable attitudes and practices, and modulation, which uses access to public institutions as a form of control. The Italian government ineffectively employed discipline for a number of years. Epistemological and organisational constraints stymied its efforts to tackle a significant childhood vaccination compliance problem. With a loss of control over the information environment, vaccinations were not served well by exogenous crises, the sensationalism of the news cycle and online misinformation. Hampered by austerity, lack of capacity and epistemic shortcomings, the Italian government did not protect the public legitimacy of the vaccination programme. Instead of employing communications to reassure a hesitant population, they focused on systemic and delivery issues, until it was too late to do anything except make vaccinations mandatory (using modulation). The apparent short-term success of this measure in generating population compliance does not foreclose the need for ongoing governance of vaccine confidence through effective discipline. This is evident for the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, with many Italians still indicating that they would not accept a vaccine despite the devastation that the disease has wrought throughout their country.","output":"Inaction, under-reaction action and incapacity: communication breakdown in Italy's vaccination governance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the outlook for overcoming the global COVID-19 pandemic has improved.

Much of that progress has culminated from detailed scientific studies conducted in nontraditional laboratory settings, frequently at collaborating zoological parks but also under more primitive conditions, including in the field. A mobile laboratory approach is described, which incorporates a diverse array of disciplines and research techniques. This approach has been extremely useful, especially for conducting gamete characterization and function studies as well as reproductive surveys, and for facilitating the development of assisted reproductive technology. With continuing advances in assisted reproduction in rare felids, more procedures are being conducted primarily as service-related activities, targeted to increase effectiveness of species propagation and population management. It can be a challenge for both investigators and institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) to differentiate these service-based procedures from traditional research studies (that require IACUC oversight). For research with rare cat species, multi-institutional collaboration frequently is necessary to gain access to scientifically meaningful numbers of study subjects. Similarly, for service-based efforts, the ability to perform reproductive procedures across institutions under nonstandard laboratory conditions is critical to applying reproductive sciences for managing and preserving threatened cat populations. Reproductive sciences can most effectively assist population management programs (e.g., Species Survival Plans) in addressing conservation priorities if these research and service-related procedures can be conducted \\"on the road\\" at distant national and international locales.

We describe the lung pathological and immunohistochemical post-mortem findings at the autopsy of 9 patients who died of SARS-COV 2 associated disease. We found in the lung tissues of all patients histological changes consistent with diffuse alveolar damage in various evolution phases ranging from acute exudative to acute proliferative to fibrotic phase. Alveolar damage was associated a prominent involvement of the vascular component in both the interstitial capillaries and in the mid-size vessels, with capillary fibrin micro-thrombi, as well as organized thrombi even in medium sized arteries, in most cases not related to sources of embolism. Eosinophilic infiltrate was also seen, probably reactive to pharmacological treatment. Viral RNA of SARS-COV 2 was detected from the lung tissues of all the nine patients. Immunohistochemistry for the receptor of the SARS-COV 2, ACE2, and its priming activatorTMPRSS2 revealed that both proteins co-localize in airway cells. In particular, the ACE2 protein was expressed in both endothelial cells and alveolar type I and II pneumocytes in the areas of histological diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Pneumocytes but not endothelial cells also expressed TMPRSS2. There are no distinctive histological features of SARS-COV 2 infection with respect to SARS-COV 1 and other DAD with different aetiology.

Adults with mental disorders have also been reported to have attenuated post vaccine immune response. The COVID-19 pandemic has invited the need to determine whether individuals with mental disorders exhibit differential immune response following the administration of vaccines for other infections. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and PsycInfo was conducted from inception to May 2021 investigating vaccine response in persons with mental disorders, as measured by biological markers of immunity (i.e., antibodies, cytokines). RESULTS: Thirteen articles were identified which evaluated vaccine efficacy in persons with mental disorders. Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) or schizophrenia revealed attenuated immune response to vaccination, or no statistical difference compared to control subjects. Individuals with anorexia nervosa or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) displayed no attenuated post-vaccination antibody level. Individuals with insomnia displayed lower levels of antibodies after vaccination, whereas individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) displayed no difference in vaccine response compared to control subjects. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this review include the relatively few articles included (n = 13) and small sample sizes (less than thirty subjects) in the majority of articles. CONCLUSION: Vaccine response in adults with a mental disorder remains inconclusive. Notwithstanding the heterogeneity and relatively small number of studies, available evidence does suggest attenuated immune response across disparate vaccinations.

METHODS: In total, 45 surgical masks and 69 respirators were decontaminated. Visual integrity, air permeability, burst resistance, pressure differential and particulate filtration efficiency of new and decontaminated surgical masks and respirators were evaluated. In addition, 14 used respirators were analysed after work shifts before and after decontamination using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culturing. Finally, reprocessed respirators were evaluated by users in terms of functionality and comfort. RESULTS: Oven decontamination (75 C for 45 min) was found to be the simplest decontamination method. Physical and filtration assays indicated that all reprocessing methods were safe after one cycle. Oven decontamination maintained the characteristics of surgical masks and respirators for at least five reprocessing cycles. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in two of the 14 used respirators.

SETTING: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted between 6 and 22 May 2020, 2 months after the introduction of the UK COVID-19 Action Plan, allowing GPs to adapt to the new changes and reflect on their impact. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen GPs working in NWL were interviewed, until data saturation was reached. OUTCOME MEASURES: The impact of COVID-19 policies on the management and safety of complex elderly patients in primary care from the GPs' perspective. RESULTS: Participants' average experience was fourteen years working in primary care for the NHS. They stated that COVID-19 policies have affected primary care at three levels, patients' behaviour, work conditions, and clinical practice. GPs reflected on the impact through five major themes; four of which have been adapted from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) framework, changes in primary care (at the three levels mentioned above), involvement of GPs in policy making, communication and coordination (with patients and in between medical teams), stressors and worries; in addition to a fifth theme to conclude the GPs' suggestions for improvement (either proposed mitigation strategies, or existing actions that showed relative success).

Illness-specific symptom search interest on GT can be used to alert the healthcare system to prepare and allocate resources needed ahead of time.","output":"The relationship between Google search interest for pulmonary symptoms and COVID-19 cases using dynamic conditional correlation analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Assistive technology users may encounter challenges and inequality in having an access to health information and care during the emergency or in a crisis time. This issue seems to be understudied in most developing countries. The aim of this study was to explore the challenges faced by Iranian people with disabilities faced during the COVID-19 pandemic as far as the use of assistive technology is concerned. METHOD A thematic analysis approach was employed to collect and analyse the data. We interviewed 10, 12 and 20 participants with physical, visual, and hearing disability, respectively during the pandemic between May to July 2020. A six-step thematic analysis method was used to identify categories and main themes. RESULTS The results revealed that people with disability were faced with some challenges in accessing information or receiving it on time during the emergency time. The lack of clear information may increase uncertainty about providing, using or maintaining assistive products. With no clear information or instruction, increased fear of infection, as well as the lack of necessary infrastructure for using available online applications, people with a disability had to rely more on others and seemed to feel disempowered. CONCLUSION Assistive technology (AT) users may not receive enough care and attention during health crisis, nor may be included in crisis management programs. Actions to create preparedness plans to meet the needs of AT users in possible future crisis seem to be necessary.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONAssistive technology users' voice and needs should be given priority in crisis management programs.Web accessibility barriers and information accessibility challenges need more research attention in order to create effective and timely information dissemination programs.There seems to be a research gap about AT users during health crisis, and more research in this area is needed.","output":"COVID-19 and challenges of assistive technology use in Iran."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer diagnosis using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can significantly improve treatment and survival but has several technical limitations.

We show that we can detect twenty-one different tumor-types with higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods using a neomer-based classifier. Refinement of this classifier via supervised learning identified additional cancer features with even greater precision. We also demonstrate that neomers can precisely diagnose cancer from cfDNA in liquid biopsy samples.

VISITECT?CD4 is an instrument-free, low-cost point-of-care CD4 test with a cut-off of 350 CD4 cells/L. This study aimed to evaluate VISITECT?CD4 test's diagnostic accuracy. METHODS Two hundred HIV-positive patients attending a tertiary HIV centre in South India were recruited. Patients provided venous blood for reference and VISITECT?CD4 tests. An additional finger-prick blood sample was obtained for VISITECT?CD4. VISITECT?CD4's diagnostic performance in identifying individuals with CD4 counts 350 cells/L was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) taking flow cytometry as the reference. RESULTS The overall agreement between VISITECT?CD4 and flow cytometry was 89.5% using venous blood and 81.5% using finger-prick blood. VISITECT?CD4 showed better performance using venous blood [sensitivity: 96.6% (95% confidence interval: 92.1%-98.9%), specificity: 70.9% (57.1%-82.4%), PPV: 89.7% (83.9%-94.0%) and NPV: 88.6% (75.4%-96.2%)] than using finger-prick blood [sensitivity: 84.8% (77.9%-90.2%), specificity: 72.7% (59.0%-83.9%), PPV: 89.1% (82.7%-93.8%) and NPV: 64.5% (51.3%-76.3%)].

Whether working from home is the key or impediment to academics efficiency and work-life balance became a daunting question for both scientists and their employers. The recent pandemic brought into focus the merits and challenges of working from home on a level of personal experience. Using a convenient sampling, we surveyed 704 academics while working from home and found that the pandemic lockdown decreased the work efficiency for almost half of the researchers but around a quarter of them were more efficient during this time compared to the time before. Based on the gathered personal experience, 70% of the researchers think that in the future they would be similarly or more efficient than before if they could spend more of their work-time at home. They indicated that in the office they are better at sharing thoughts with colleagues, keeping in touch with their team, and collecting data, whereas at home they are better at working on their manuscript, reading the literature, and analyzing their data. Taking well-being also into account, 66% of them would find it ideal to work more from home in the future than they did before the lockdown.

In support of this concept, we used a modified form of the transcription factor STAT1 to achieve hyper-responsiveness to interferon without toxicity and markedly improve antiviral function in transgenic mice and transduced human cells. We found that the improvement depended on expression of a PARP9-DTX3L complex with distinct domains for interaction with STAT1 and for activity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acted on host histone H2BJ to promote interferon-stimulated gene expression and on viral 3C proteases to degrade these proteases via the immunoproteasome. Thus, PARP9-DTX3L acted on host and pathogen to achieve a double layer of immunity within a safe reserve in the interferon signaling pathway.

A healthy emotional state is one significant highlight to improve personal satisfaction. On the other hand, bad emotional health can prompt social or psychological well-being issues. Recognizing or detecting feelings in online health care data gives important and helpful information regarding the emotional state of patients. To recognize or detection of patients emotion against a specific disease using text from online sources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of patients emotions in healthcare data using supervised machine learning approaches. For this purpose, we created a new dataset named EmoHD, comprising of 4,202 text samples against eight disease classes and six emotion classes, gathered from different online resources. We used six different supervised machine learning models based on different feature engineering techniques. We also performed a detailed comparison of the chosen six machine learning algorithms using different feature vectors on our dataset. We achieved the highest 87% accuracy using MultiLayer Perceptron as compared to other state of the art models. Moreover, we use the emotional guidance scale to show that there is a link between negative emotion and psychological health issues. Our proposed work will be helpful to automatically detect a patients emotion during disease and to avoid extreme acts like suicide, mental disorders, or psychological health issues.

It has been reported that right from the beginning of the outbreak in Lombardy up to 20% of the doctors and nurses became infected. Under these circumstances, the regular operation of health institutions already suffering from a shortage of staff becomes difficult. This has led to complete or partial shutdowns of hospitals, either due to a lack of uninfected personnel or because of uncontrollable chains of infection endangering patients. In one of the largest university perinatal center in Bavaria with more than 3000 births per year, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in March 2020, affecting 36 staff members, including doctors, nurses, and midwives. Here, we describe the outbreak and present the measures contributing to the successful containment of the outbreak within three weeks. At the same time, clinical services could be maintained, however, not without deployment of personnel exposed to employees infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apart from massive testing of personnel in pre-defined phases and increased hygiene measures, including a general obligation to wear surgical face masks, we identified the need to monitor cases of illness across all groups of employees, to ensure social distancing within personnel and to evaluate contacts of clinical personnel outside of the hospital environment, in order to be able to interpret chains of infections and to disrupt them.

Barbed suturing is a new technology that has the potential to greatly facilitate laparoscopic suturing. AIM To compare surgical outcomes and vaginal vault healing between barbed sutures and traditional sutures in the repair of the vaginal vault during single-port TLH. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between August 2013 and June 2015, we performed single-port TLH in 85 consecutive patients for benign or premalignant gynecological conditions. The first 48 patients underwent single-port TLH with traditional interrupted sutures, and the next 37 patients underwent single-port TLH with absorbable unidirectional knotless barbed sutures for repair of the vaginal vault. RESULTS The patient characteristics (age, body mass index), procedures performed, uterine weight, and uterine disease were similar between the groups. There were no differences in blood loss, hemoglobin change, length of hospital stay, or perioperative complications. Operative time and the time required for vaginal cuff suturing were significantly shorter in the barbed suture group than in the traditional suture group (57.8 13.5 vs. 80.1 18.7 min, p < 0.001; 5.5 1.7 vs. 12.9 3.5 min, p < 0.001). Moreover, the use of barbed sutures significantly reduced the incidence of vaginal granulation tissue formation (2.7% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Use of barbed sutures in single-port TLH reduced the operative time, suturing time of the vaginal vault, and formation of vaginal granulation tissue.

We evaluated the efficiency of oil-degrading bacterial consortium and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with or without fertilizer to remediate soils collected from petroleum waste contaminated oil fields. Physicochemical characteristics of control soil and petroleum contaminated soils were assessed. Four oil-degrading strains, namely Bacillus pumilus (KY010576), Exiguobacteriaum aurantiacum (KY010578), Lysinibacillus fusiformis (KY010586), and Pseudomonas putida (KX580766), were selected based on their in vitrohydrocarbon-degrading efficiency. In a lab experiment, contaminated soils were treated alone and with combined amendments of the bacterial consortium, AgNPs, and fertilizers (ammonium nitrate and diammonium phosphate). We detected the degradation rate of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) of the soil samples with GC-FID at different intervals of the incubation period (0, 5, 20, 60, 240 days). The bacterial population (CFU/g) was also monitored during the entire period of incubation. The results showed that 70% more TPH was degraded with a consortium with their sole application in 20 days of incubation. There was a positive correlation between TPH degradation and the 100-fold increase in bacterial population in contaminated soils. This study revealed that bacterial consortiums alone showed the maximum increase in the degradation of TPHs at 20 days. The application of nanoparticles and fertilizer has non-significant effects on the consortium degradation potential. Moreover, fertilizer alone or in combination with AgNPs and consortium slows the rate of degradation of TPHs over a short period. Still, it subsequently accelerates the rate of degradation of TPHs, and a negligible amount remains at the end of the incubation period.","output":"Comparative Analysis of Microbial Consortiums and Nanoparticles for Rehabilitating Petroleum Waste Contaminated Soils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sedentary behavior is an emerging public health issue.

STUDY DESIGN: We estimated the number of clinical visits and clinical contacts (any worker a patient may come into physical contact with during their visit) under the current policy landscape, compared to the number of visits and contacts if the following regulations were repealed: (1) State mandatory in-person counseling visit laws that necessitate two visits for abortion, (2) State mandatory-ultrasound laws, (3) State mandates requiring the prescribing clinician be present during mifepristone administration, (4) Federal Food and Drug Administration Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for mifepristone. If these laws were repealed, \\"no-test\\" telemedicine abortion would be possible for some patients. We modeled the number of visits averted if a minimum of 15 percent or a maximum of 70 percent of medication abortion patients had a \\"no-test\\" telemedicine abortion. RESULTS: We estimate that 12,742 in-person clinic visits (50,978 clinical contacts) would be averted each month if counseling visit laws alone were repealed, and 31,132 visits (142,910 clinical contacts) would be averted if all four policies were repealed and 70 percent of medication abortion patients received no-test telemedicine abortions. Over 2 million clinical contacts could be averted over the projected 18-month COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries in the Northern Hemisphere have been affected the most, including the United States and European countries. Contrary to the common knowledge that infectious diseases are more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, COVID-19 appears to affect wealthy countries more. This paper attempts to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 infections and levels of economic development with data from the U.S. and Europe. Methods: Public domain data on the confirmed COVID-19 cases during January 1 and May 31, 2020 by states and territories in the U.S. and by countries in Europe were included. Incidence rate was estimated using the 2019 total population. COVID-19 cases were associated with 2019 GDP using regression models after a logarithmic transformation of the data. The U.S. data and European data were analyzed separately, considering significant heterogeneity between the two. Results: A total of 2 451 691 COVID-19 cases during a 5-month period were analyzed, including 1 787 414 from 50 U.S. states and territories and 664 277 from 28 European countries. The overall incidence rate was 5.393/1000 for the U.S. and 1.411/1 000 for European countries with large variations. Lg (total cases) was significantly associated with lg (GDP) for U.S. states (= 1.2579, P < 0.001) and European countries (= 0.7156, P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a positive correlation between COVID-19 case incidence and GDP.

PATIENTS OR MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a retrospective study of 46 patients admitted for COVID-19 infection. Venous duplex ultrasound of lower limbs was performed in all patients at Day 0 and Day 5. All patients had antithrombotic-prophylaxis upon admission using low molecular weight heparin with Enoxaparin. Demographics, comorbidities and laboratory parameters were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Elevated AT were reported in 28 patients (61%). 10 had acute VTE events of which eight (17.4%) had aminotransferases disorders. They had been treated with curative Enoxaparin. After a follow-up of 15 and/or 30 days, six of them were controlled, and treated with direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) after normalization of aminotransferases. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of aminotransferases disorders associated with acute VTE events in patients infected with COVID-19 is significant. The use of DOACs appear pertinent in these patients.

The amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunosorbent assay (AlphaLISA) method, which incorporates glutathione donor beads and anti-human IgG acceptor beads, was used to evaluate serum antibody levels. SEREX screening identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-associated protein 1 (LRPAP1) as a target antigen of serum IgG antibodies in the sera of patients with ESCC or AIS. Antigens, including recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fused LRPAP1 protein, were prepared to examine serum antibody levels. AlphaLISA revealed significantly higher antibody levels against the LRPAP1 protein in patients with solid cancers such as ESCC and colorectal carcinoma and some atherosclerosis-related diseases such as AIS and diabetes mellitus compared with healthy donors. Correlation analysis revealed that the elevated serum antibody levels against LRPAP1 were associated with smoking, a well-known risk factor for both cancer and atherosclerosis.

In the United States, COVID-19 is not only causing physical suffering to patients, but also great levels of adverse sentiment (e.g., fear, panic, anxiety) among the public. Such secondary threats can be anticipated and explained through sentiment analysis of social media, such as Twitter. Methods - We obtained a dataset of geotagged tweets on the topic of COVID-19 in the contiguous United States during the period of 11/1/2019 - 9/15/2020. We classified each tweet into \\"adverse\\" and \\"non-adverse\\" using the NRC Emotion Lexicon and tallied up the counts for each category per county per day. We utilized the space-time scan statistic to find clusters and a three-stage regression approach to identify socioeconomic and demographic correlates of adverse sentiment. Results - We identified substantial spatiotemporal variation in adverse sentiment in our study area/period. After an initial period of low-level adverse sentiment (11/1/2019 - 1/15/2020), we observed a steep increase and subsequent fluctuation at a higher level (1/16/2020 - 9/15/2020). The number of daily tweets was low initially (11/1/2019 - 1/22/2020), followed by spikes and subsequent decreases until the end of the study period. The space-time scan statistic identified 12 clusters of adverse sentiment of varying size, location, and strength. Clusters were generally active during the time period of late March to May/June 2020. Increased adverse sentiment was associated with decreased racial/ethnic heterogeneity, decreased rurality, higher vulnerability in terms of minority status and language, and housing type and transportation. Conclusions - We utilized a dataset of geotagged tweets to identify the spatiotemporal patterns and the spatial correlates of adverse population sentiment during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The characteristics of areas with high adverse sentiment may be relevant for communication of containment measures. The combination of spatial clustering and regression can be beneficial for understanding of the ramifications of COVID-19, as well as disease outbreaks in general.","output":"Understanding Adverse Population Sentiment Towards the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now still an emerging, evolving pandemic, causing more than 64 million people infected. Hypertension, a common cardiovascular condition, has been reported as a risk factor for higher mortality. In order to a better management, it is necessary to know the clinical course and identify the factors associated with clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.Methods and results: A total of 148 COVID-19 cases who had pre-existing hypertension with clarified outcomes (discharge or deceased) were included in this study. Medical history, clinical manifestation, epidemiological, and laboratory data were analyzed. 45 (30.4%) patients had died during hospitalization, multivariate COX regression analysis revealed some predicted factors at admission for in-hospital death including elevated level of hs-cTn (HR: 3.98, 95% CI:1.95-8.16) and IL-6 (HR: 3.31, 95% CI: 1.42-7.72). Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (n = 52) which were defined as systolic BP  140 mmHg or diastolic BP  90 mmHg for more than once ( 2 times) during hospitalization, were more likely to have ICU admission (P=0.037), invasive mechanical ventilation(P=0.028), and renal injury(P=0.005). With a stricter criterion which was defined as systolic BP  130 mmHg or diastolic BP  80 mmHg for more than once ( 2 times) during hospitalization, 105 (70.9%) patients with uncontrolled BP had higher mortality rate (P=0.046). In our study, there were 35 (23.6%) patients taking renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) suppressor including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and spironolactone. Patients with these RAAS suppressors treatment were less likely to be admitted to ICU (P = 0.048). And treatment with RAAS suppressors didn't have an obvious influence in mortality.Conclusion: Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, elevated hs-cTn and IL-6 at admission were associated with higher mortality, suggesting that they could possibly be used as predictors for fatal outcomes. Blood pressure control with a stricter criterion of less than 130/80mmHg during hospitalization is associated with better prognosis.

In spring 2020, nurse managers at 81 U.S. centers with neonatology and maternal-fetal medicine fellowship programs were asked to identify the individual most knowledgeable in their NICU's bereavement support services; these individuals were invited by email to complete an original online survey. Chi testing and odds ratios (ORs) compared responses from centers reporting involvement of palliative care teams (PCT) in NICU sibling bereavement versus no PCT. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent (45 of 80) of invitees responded. Most (77%) NICUs permitted perimortem sibling visitation. Challenges included sparse community resources and limited direct sibling contact. Sixty-nine percent (n = 31) of centers were grouped as PCT. PCT respondents reported eightfold higher chances of providing direct education to the sibling (OR, 7.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-34; p = 0.01). Views on appropriateness of sharing educational information with extended family, babysitters, and teachers did not differ. While notifying pediatricians of families experiencing NICU death was more common in PCT (p = 0.02), most respondents reported having \\"no individual responsible for such communications\\" (52% PCT vs. 100%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite limited direct contact with siblings of NICU patients who die, efforts are made to involve them in bereavement activities. Opportunities to support these children were identified. Where available, palliative care teams can help provide bereaved siblings with direct education. We recommend formalizing communication mechanisms to ensure that if a NICU patient dies and has surviving siblings, the outpatient physicians caring for these siblings are informed.

The anti-nociceptive effects of indigo were assessed through acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate test, and formalin test, and spontaneous locomotor activity and motor performance were evaluated. The mechanisms of activities of indigo were explored by evaluating the expression levels of I&#954;B kinase (IKK)?, p-IKK?, inhibitor &#954;B (I&#954;B)&#945;, p-I&#954;B&#945;, p65 nuclear factor (NF)-kB, p-p65 NF-&#954;B, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) through western blotting and the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-1?

The results showed that indigo significantly reduced xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, and acetic acid-induced vascular permeation. In addition, indigo significantly inhibited nociception induced by acetic acid and formalin. However, the level of nociception was not decreased by indigo in the hot plate test, and indigo did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity and motor performance.

This study examines racial/ethnic and income-based disparities in vaccine hesitancy in Los Angeles County, a recent epicenter of the pandemic in the US, immediately after the Food and Drug Administration issued its emergency use authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted online, stratified cross-sectional surveys of 1,984 adults living in Los Angeles County between December 2020 and January 2021 to assess hesitancy towards getting a COVID-19 vaccine. We used multivariable logistic regression to predict vaccine hesitancy after adjusting for covariates and calculated weighted population level estimates of hesitancy and reasons for hesitancy. Blacks and Hispanics were significantly more likely to be hesitant than Whites (AOR=3.3, P<0.001; AOR=2.1, P=0.008) as were those in the lowest income group (annual income <$20,000 compared to >$100,000) (AOR=1.8, P=0.009). Additionally, those having no confidence in doing things online (AOR=3.3, P<0.001) were less likely to accept the vaccine than those who were confident. Compared to hesitant White respondents, Black respondents had higher mistrust of the government (36.1% vs 22.1%, P=0.03) and Black and Hispanic respondents were more likely to want to wait to see how the vaccine works (41.2% and 42.0% vs 27.3%, P=0.02 and P=0.006).

Such yields would be 220 to 600 times the current world average annual wheat yield of 3.2 t/ha. Independent of climate, season, and region, indoor wheat farming could be environmentally superior, as less land area is needed along with reuse of most water, minimal use of pesticides and herbicides, and no nutrient losses. Although it is unlikely that indoor wheat farming will be economically competitive with current market prices in the near future, it could play an essential role in hedging against future climate or other unexpected disruptions to the food system.

Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner. For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection. More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis.

The scientific field of redox biology tries to understand how redox homeostasis is regulated and maintained and which mechanisms are derailed in diverse pathological developments of diseases, where oxidative or reductive stress is an issue. The term oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the generation of oxidants and the local antioxidative defense. Key mediators of oxidative stress are reactive species derived from oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur that are signal factors at physiological concentrations but can damage cellular macromolecules when they accumulate. However, therapeutical targeting of oxidative stress in disease has proven more difficult than previously expected. Major reasons for this are the very delicate cellular redox systems that differ in the subcellular compartments with regard to their concentrations and depending on the physiological or pathological status of cells and organelles (i.e., circadian rhythm, cell cycle, metabolic need, disease stadium). As reactive species are used as signaling molecules, non-targeted broad-spectrum antioxidants in many cases will fail their therapeutic aim.

The impact of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia (CRS) is even greater than that of treatment resistance in terms of severe and persistent symptoms, relapses and hospitalizations, poorer quality of life, and healthcare costs. Such serious consequences often compel clinicians to try different augmentation strategies to enhance the inadequate clozapine response in CRS. Unfortunately, a large body of evidence has shown that antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, electroconvulsive therapy, and cognitive-behavioural therapy are mostly ineffective in augmenting clozapine response. When beneficial effects of augmentation have been found, they are usually small and of doubtful clinical significance or based on low-quality evidence. Therefore, newer treatment approaches that go beyond the evidence are needed. The options proposed include developing a clinical consensus about the augmentation strategies that are most likely to be effective and using them sequentially in patients with CRS. Secondly, newer approaches such as augmentation with long-acting antipsychotic injections or multi-component psychosocial interventions could be considered. Lastly, perhaps the most effective way to deal with CRS would be to optimize clozapine treatment, which might prevent clozapine resistance from developing. Personalized dosing, adequate treatment durations, management of side effects and non-adherence, collaboration with patients and caregivers, and addressing clinician barriers to clozapine use are the principal ways of ensuring optimal clozapine treatment. At present, these three options could the best way to manage CRS until research provides more firm directions about the effective options for augmenting clozapine response.","output":"Clozapine resistant schizophrenia: Newer avenues of management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are characterized by disturbances in perceptions, thought contents, moods, and behaviors. The causes for these symptoms are connected to factors related to the people with dementia (PWD), his/her caregivers, and environmental factors as well as the interrelationship between these three. Disruptions of routine due to confinements during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic has led to the onset/worsening of BPSD, thereby increasing distress levels in caregivers, and risks of self\\\\injury, hospitalization, and death for PWD. Our aim is to describe the onset/ worsening of BPSD during COVID\\\\19 pandemic confinement. METHOD: This is a longitudinal study in patients and caregivers of people with Alzheimers disease from the Instituto Peruano de Neurociencias in Lima, Per. A structured confinement interview was delivered to caregivers exploring how the caregiver's activities have been affected or modified by the confinement measures. All patients have neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and functional assessments performed six months before the onset of the confinement. BPSD was assessed using the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire (NPI). RESULT: A total of 91 patients with Alzheimers disease and caregivers participated in the study. The average age of the patients was 73.4 years. Most patients had a CDR score of 0.5\\\\1. Caregivers reported that the pandemic affected their mood by 74%. Percentage of time spent caring increased from 15% to 25% (p<0.001). Worsening and new onset of behavioral and psychological symptoms were reported. The NPI (Fig 1.) and ADCS_ADL scores increased significantly during quarantine from baseline (6.6 and 10, respectively) (p<0.001). Delusions (75%), sleep disorder (71.7%), and hallucinations were the most frequently reported worsening symptoms. Sleep disorder (71.1%), agitation (68.6%) and depression (53.3%) were the most frequently reported new symptoms (p<0.001) (Table 1). Profile of BPSD did not vary according to the CDR score. CONCLUSION: Quarantine induces increases in behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with early stages of Alzheimers disease. Caregivers spent more time with the patient with AD and their emotions were affected by the pandemic.

PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr) hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 at participating hospitals from February 2020 to January 2021. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included hospital and ICU duration of stay and ICU, hospital, and 28-day mortality. A total of 874 children with coronavirus disease 2019 were reported to Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study registry from 51 participating centers, majority in the United States. Median age was 8 years (interquartile range, 1.25C14 yr) with a male:female ratio of 1:2. A majority were non-Hispanic (492/874; 62.9%). Median body mass index (n = 817) was 19.4 kg/m(2) (16C25.8 kg/m(2)), with 110 (13.4%) overweight and 300 (36.6%) obese. A majority (67%) presented with fever, and 43.2% had comorbidities. A total of 238 of 838 (28.2%) met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 404 of 874 (46.2%) were admitted to the ICU. In multivariate logistic regression, age, fever, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and pre-existing seizure disorder were independently associated with a greater odds of ICU admission. Hospital mortality was 16 of 874 (1.8%). Median (interquartile range) duration of ICU (n = 379) and hospital (n = 857) stay were 3.9 days (2C7.7 d) and 4 days (1.9C7.5 d), respectively. For patients with 28-day data, survival was 679 of 787, 86.3% with 13.4% lost to follow-up, and 0.3% deceased. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational, multicenter registry of children with coronavirus disease 2019, ICU admission was common.

AIMS: In this study, we investigated the availability and safety of the algorithm. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort METHODS: Consecutive patients; administered hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled into digital ECG recording program which includes QTc follow-up algorithm. RESULTS: Patients were classified into three groups as those, excluded promptly from the QTc follow-up based on two consecutive ECG findings (early rule out, n = 92) and those, for whom the follow-up was continued (n = 12) and usual care group (n = 68). Of note, 237 ECG tracings were performed in our algorithm population contrary to standard practice of daily recommended ECG monitoring which could have yielded 975 ECG tracings along with accompanied risks of exposure. This way; we ended in 738 (75.7%) fewer ECG tracings. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death was not observed in the entire patient population. CONCLUSIONS: It is safe to rely on telemedicine-based early rule out algorithm in COVID-19 patients, receiving hydroxychloroquine treatment.

In doing so, we draw on (i) existing frameworks on the role of qualitative research alongside trials and (ii) our experience of integrated qualitative research conducted as part of the feasibility study of the SAFER trial (Screening for Atrial Fibrillation with ECG to Reduce stroke), a cluster randomised controlled trial of screening people aged 70 and above for atrial fibrillation in primary care in England. The activities and presence of the qualitative team contributed to important changes in the design, conduct and day-to-day running of the SAFER feasibility study, and the subsequent main trial, informing diverse decisions concerning trial documentation, trial delivery, timing and content of measures and the information given to participating patients and practices. These included asking practices to give screening results to all participants and not just to screen positive participants, and greater recognition of the contribution of practice reception staff to trial delivery. These changes were facilitated by a one research team approach that underpinned all formal and informal working processes from the outset and maximised the value of both qualitative and trial coordination expertise. The challenging problems facing health services require a combination of research methods and data types. Our experience and the literature show that the benefits of embedding qualitative research in trials are more likely to be realised if attention is given to both structural factors and relationships from the outset. These include sustained and sufficient funding for qualitative research, embedding qualitative research fully within the trial programme, providing shared infrastructure and resources and committing to relationships based on mutual recognition of and respect for the value of different methods and perspectives.

OBJECTIVES To analyse and describe the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic surgery at Groote Schuur Hospital, a tertiary academic hospital in South Africa. METHODS The number of orthopaedic surgical cases, emergency theatre patient waiting times, and numbers of outpatient clinic visits, ward admissions, bed occupancies and total inpatient days for January - April 2019 (pre-COVID-19) were compared with the same time frame in 2020 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 timeframe included initiation of a national 'hard lockdown' from 26 March 2020, in preparation for an increasing volume of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS April 2020, the time of the imposed hard lockdown, was the most affected month, although the number of surgical cases had started to decrease slowly during the 3 preceding months. The total number of surgeries, outpatient visits and ward admissions decreased significantly during April 2020 (55.2%, 69.1% and 60.6%, respectively) compared with April 2019 (p<0.05). Trauma cases were reduced by 40% in April 2020. Overall emergency theatre patient waiting time was 30% lower for April 2020 compared with 2019. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 and the associated lockdown has heavily impacted on both orthopaedic inpatient and outpatient services. Lockdown led to a larger reduction in the orthopaedic trauma burden than in international centres, but the overall reduction in surgeries, outpatient visits and hospital admissions was less. This lesser reduction was probably due to local factors, but also to a conscious decision to avoid total collapse of our surgical services.","output":"Drastic reduction of orthopaedic services at an urban tertiary hospital in South Africa during COVID-19: Lessons for the future response to the pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new virus pandemic, COVID-19, has instigated substantial damage to human wellness in terms of death and ailment, economic compromises along with restriction of daily routine life.

COVID-19 patients develop severe hypoxemia early in the course of the disease, which is silent most of the time. Small fibrinous thrombi in pulmonary arterioles and a tumefaction of endothelial were observed in the autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases. Studies showed that the viral infection induces a vascular process in the lung, which included vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Further, the proportions of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes were strongly reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estradiol is connected with CD4+ T cell numbers and increases T-reg cell populations, affecting immune responses to infection. It is known that estradiol exerts a protective effect on endothelial function, activating the generation of nitric oxide (NO) via endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Estrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia. It exerts a variety of rapid actions, which are initiated after its coupling with membrane receptors, which in turn, may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flow.

However, out-of-hospital management is not codified. STUDY OBJECTIVE The objective of the present study was to evaluate the role of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I in out-of-hospital management of NSTEMI by Emergency Medical Services (EMS). METHODS This monocentric, retrospective, observational study analyzed the files of all patients having received a troponin assay in the EMS of Beaujon University Hospital, AP-HP (Paris region, France) from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Patients were classified as low risk, high risk, or very high risk according to the ESC 2020 algorithm at the time of their hospital treatment. The relationship between troponin in point-of-care and risk level according to time to onset of pain was analyzed using logistic regression. A search for predictors of risk level was performed using multivariate analysis. A P value <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Out of 309 patients in the file, 233 were included. Men were 61% and the median age was 63 years. A positive troponin assay was associated with high-risk or very high-risk stratification regardless of the time to onset of pain (P <.0001). Predictive factors for being classified as high or very high risk in hospital were: a history of atrial fibrillation (P = .03), electrocardiogram (ECG) modifications such as negative T wave or ST-segment depression (P <.0001), and positive troponin (P <.0001). CONCLUSION The use of point-of-care troponin in EMS, combined with clinical and electrical criteria, allows risk stratification of NSTEMI patients from the prehospital management stage and optimization of referral to an appropriate care pathway. Patients classified as low risk should be referred to the emergency department (ED) and patients classified as high risk or very high risk to the cardiac intensive care unit or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center.","output":"Predictors of Risk Stratification and Value of Point-of-Care of High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin-I in EMS Management of Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: A Retrospective Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Impacts from the coronavirus pandemic have depressed market returns to corn and soybean farmers in the Midwest, extending pressures that have existed since 2013 and which were made worse by trade disputes with China.

As COVID-19 infections and deaths increase in the pediatric population, characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in children would enable data-driven public health guidance. METHODS: Nasal swabs collected from children with COVID-19 were analyzed. Viral load was quantified by RT-PCR; viral culture was assessed by direct observation of cytopathic effects and semiquantitative viral titers. Correlations with age or symptom duration were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome amplification was compared with contemporaneous Massachusetts sequences to assess for clustering patterns. RESULTS: Ninety-seven children with COVID-19 (median age 10 years, range 2 weeks-22 years) were included in this study. Age did not impact SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasal secretions: children of all ages were equally likely to carry live, replicating virus. Children within the first five days of illness had higher viral loads and rates of culture positivity, and viral load in hospitalized children (n=30) did not differ from hospitalized adults (n=21) with similar duration of symptoms. While pediatric SARS-CoV-2 sequences were representative of those in the community, novel variants were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Children can carry high quantities of live, replicating virus, creating a potential reservoir for transmission and evolution of genetic variants. As guidance around social distancing and masking evolves following vaccine uptake in older populations, a clear understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in children is critical for rational development of public health policies and vaccination strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.","output":"Virologic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Microvascular invasion (MVI) affects recurrence after treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) of 3 cm in size.

The PET waste bricks (PWBs) were produced through different proportioning (PW: FS) of 20%, 30%, and 40% of the dry mass of FS. The PWBs produced were tested for durability and compressive and tensile strengths and compared to fired clay bricks to evaluate their load-bearing capacity under compression and tension. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests were employed to analyze the morphological structure of the bricks. The test results revealed that the PWBs recorded an appreciable strength of 1.5C2 times that of fired clay bricks, and lower water absorption whilst retaining their ultimate strengths after complete immersion in water and acidic concentrations. The morphology of PWB possessed greater intercluster bonds on the surface compared to clay bricks.

METHODS We reviewed the COVID-19 vaccination guidance for pregnant and breastfeeding women published to date and evidence from preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies, and discuss their implications. RESULTS Pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines resulting in limited data on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. As a result, since December 2020, there has been conflicting advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities on this matter. From the end of 2020 up to now, some consensus guidance has been published with a prevalent precautionary approach on the administration of vaccines in pregnant women, in breastfeeding ones, or for those who are planning a pregnancy (either spontaneously or with assisted technologies). After the first few months of vaccine administration in some countries, more permissiveness seems to prevail, although with inconsistencies. At the moment, the results obtained by preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies suggest that the risks of the maternal COVID-19 outweigh the undocumented and hypothetical risks of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Also, until two viral vector COVID-19 vaccines were associated with very rare thromboembolic events, all guidance had agreed that all approved COVID-19 vaccines could be administered in pregnancy.

Neither full-time employees nor full-time students, volunteers undertook a unique hybrid role bolstering the front-line health workforce. Using reflective qualitative inquiry, 17 volunteers evaluated reasoning for entering practice in acute hospitals.

Six themes were identified, including sense of duty, and opting-in or out. These highlighted the importance of collaboration and the tripartite relationship between University, host and student during placement, and the influence of these on the learning experience. Several significant insights emerged for nurse education and curricula during pandemics related to patient safety, safety climate and governance. The insights were used to develop a Student Nurses Placement Framework with recommendations for Pre-During-Post placement, offering a guide for future nursing workforce recruitment and retention.","output":"Student Nurses Undertaking Acute Hospital Paid Placements during COVID-19: Rationale for Opting-In?

Mortality estimates at the local level are even more uncertain as they require stringent conditions, such as granularity and accuracy of the data at hand, which are rarely met. The official approach adopted by public institutions to estimate the excess mortality during the pandemic draws on a comparison between observed all-cause mortality data for 2020 and averages of mortality figures in the past years for the same period. In this paper, we apply the recently developed machine learning control method to build a more realistic counterfactual scenario of mortality in the absence of COVID-19. We demonstrate that supervised machine learning techniques outperform the official method by substantially improving the prediction accuracy of the local mortality in ordinary years, especially in small- and medium-sized municipalities. We then apply the best-performing algorithms to derive estimates of local excess mortality for the period between February and September 2020. Such estimates allow us to provide insights about the demographic evolution of the first wave of the pandemic throughout the country.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This manuscript presents selected patient cases from the pivotal pathfinder clinical trial program, which included a number of clinical studies in adults (pathfinder 2 and 3) and children (pathfinder 5); overall results published previously. Clinical data and outcomes described in this manuscript are more detailed and derived from several interesting patient cases (five adults from pathfinder 2 and two children from pathfinder 5), who received N8-GP as prophylaxis (PPX) for their severe hemophilia A. Three of the five adults described here also underwent multiple major surgeries (for which they moved from pathfinder 2 into pathfinder 3 and later returned to pathfinder 2). New analyses on pediatric joint health from pathfinder 5 are also summarized here. Outcomes assessed included bleeding complications, improvements in quality of life, intraoperative hemostatic response, blood loss during surgery, number of blood transfusions, and annualized bleeding rates. For the pediatric patients, target joint resolution, adverse events, and annualized joint bleeding rate were also assessed, all by the treating physician. RESULTS: Considerable improvements in treatment adherence, bleeding rates, and overall physical activity levels were demonstrated in two adult cases from the pathfinder 2 trial. N8-GP demonstrated good or excellent hemostatic coverage in three adult patients undergoing multiple major surgeries. The benefits of N8-GP for joint health and in support of children and adolescents with evolving active lifestyles were reported for several pediatric cases. CONCLUSION: These patient cases highlight the benefits of EHL products, such as N8-GP, for patients with severe hemophilia A. They include more challenging scenarios relating to improvements in previously poor adherence to PPX, children with active sporting lifestyles, and patients requiring multiple major surgeries.","output":"Illustrative Cases from the Pathfinder Clinical Trials of Patients with Hemophilia A Treated with Turoctocog Alfa Pegol (N8-GP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In late 2020, the advent of COVID-19 variants which presented an increased level of risk to global or worldwide public health were categorised as Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs).

PURPOSE: Medication reconciliation (MR) is a complicated and tedious process but is crucial to prevent errors when ordering patients' discharge medications during a hospital admission. Our institution currently uses a variety of methods to gather a patient's medication history, including review of the medical records and electronic pharmaceutical claims data (EPCD) from a commercial health information exchange organization, as well as a patient or caregiver interview. Occasionally, more information is needed to obtain the most accurate history. To augment current methods, EPCD can also be accessed for patients with Medicaid insurance using a state Medicaid Web portal. We aimed to evaluate the utility of the Medicaid Web portal for reducing medication errors during the MR process at hospital admission. SUMMARY: A single-center, prospective, quality improvement initiative was conducted to evaluate 100 patient medication lists for all nonobstetric Medicaid patients admitted to our institution to identify discrepancies in medication lists when the state Medicaid Web portal was used in addition to standard MR methods. We found that, when EPCD from commercial organizations were available, they matched the patient's current medication list 64% of the time. One in 4 patients had at least 1 discrepancy on their verified medication list that was identified using the Medicaid Web portal. The discrepancies identified were addressed and corrected in real time to improve patient care. CONCLUSION: EPCD from the state Medicaid Web portal could supplement the use of current methods to obtain a more accurate medication history and reduce the number of erroneously ordered discharge medications during hospital admission.","output":"A prospective assessment of the Medicaid Web portal for admission medication reconciliation at a community hospital in Montana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) is clinical laboratory testing conducted close to the site of patient care.

Major emphasis to date has been ADP-ribosylation's role in cancer; however, there is growing interest in its role in inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Despite a recent boom in ADP-ribosylation mass spectrometry-based proteomics, there are limited computational resources to evaluate the quality of reported ADP-ribosylated (ADPr) proteins. We recently developed a novel mass spectral annotation strategy (RiboMaP) that facilitates identification and reporting of ADPr peptides and proteins. This strategy can monitor the fragmentation properties of ADPr peptide-unique fragment ions, termed m-ions and p-ions, that in turn provide spectral quality scores for candidate ADP-ribosyl peptides. In this study, we leveraged the availability of publicly available ADP-ribosylome data, acquired on various mass spectrometers, to evaluate the broader applicability of RiboMaP. We observed that fragmentation spectra of ADPr peptides vary considerably across datasets; nonetheless, RiboMaP improves ADPr peptide spectral annotation across all studies. We then reanalyzed our own previously published in vitro ADP-ribosylome data to determine common responses to the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IFN-. We conclude that despite these recent advances in the field of ADPr proteomics, studies in the context of inflammation and cardiovascular disease still require further bench-to-informatics workflow development in order to capture ADPr signaling events related to inflammatory pathways.","output":"The RiboMaP Spectral Annotation Method Applied to Various ADP-Ribosylome Studies Including INF--Stimulated Human Cells and Mouse Tissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Both primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) and primary splenic lymphoma (PSL) represent rare entities. PPL typically arises in the head of the pancreas but may arise in other locations also. PSL usually presents with nonspecific symptoms, including left upper quadrant pain, weight loss, and fever. This report describes a patient with a large left upper quadrant mass, which initially was believed to be a primary pancreatic mass, but which on final pathology appeared to be consistent with a PSL. Presentation: The patient is a 64-year-old woman who initially presented with symptoms of left upper quadrant abdominal pain and distension; she subsequently was found to have an 18 cm heterogeneous mass arising from the pancreatic tail. She underwent a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Final pathology confirmed a diffuse large B cell lymphoma arising from the splenic parenchyma. Conclusions: Both PPL and PSL are rare causes of left upper quadrant masses.

This support was prepared by sequentially reacting 5 m silica particles with vinyltrimethoxysilane and then thioglycolic acid. The carboxy-silica thus obtained was subsequently functionalized with octadecylamine, 2-naphthylamine or 2-aminoanthracene by on-column reactions via a carbodiimide conjugation reaction. The carbodiimide with its zero-length carboxyl-to-amine coupling ability works by activating the surface carboxyl groups of the precursor support for direct reaction with the primary amines of octadecylamine, 2-naphthylamine or 2-aminoanthracene via amide bond formation. These reactions series, which are applied for the first time in HPLC column fabrication, yielded the octadecyl-, naphthyl- and anthracenyl-silica columns. The three columns were evaluated for their reversed-phase chromatography retention properties with alkylbenzenes, alkylphenyl ketones, nitroalkanes, benzene and toluene derivatives, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and nitro-substituted amino acids. The naphthyl- and anthracenyl-silica exhibited a good selectivity and efficiency towards most of the aromatic analytes when compared to the octadecyl-silica. Nitro-substituted amino acids containing electron withdrawing groups showed greater selectivity than other analytes on the aromatic-based columns than the C18 column.

COVID-19 vaccines are commonly administered intramuscularly to the arm. Axillary lymphadenopathy has been reported as an adverse event after COVID-19 vaccination. In patients with breast cancers who received COVID-19 vaccination, presence of ipsilateral (or contralateral) lymphadenopathy poses diagnostic dilemma. This systematic review aims to evaluate the incidence and clinical characteristics of vaccine associated axillary lymphadenopathy. METHODS: . The systematic review was conducted with accordance to the PRISMA statement. The search terms used were Vaccine OR Vaccination AND Lymphadenopathy OR Lymph node AND Covid-19. RESULTS: . 31 studies or reports were identified using the predefined keywords from the systematic review protocol. After excluding irrelevant papers (such as guidelines, reviews, opinions and commentaries), 10 studies or reports were included in the review.Pooled incidence of clinically detectable lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination was 91/22532 (0.4%). Mean size of the vaccine associated axillary lymphadenopathy was 18.2mm (Range 16 C 21mm). Mean duration from vaccination to occurrence of axillary lymphadenopathy was 6.9 days (Range 2 C 18 days).

Using cell-free synthesized ORF7b, we experimentally show that ORF7b assembles into stable multimers. The ORF7b sequence shows a transmembrane segment, which multimerizes through a leucine zipper. We hypothesize that ORF7b has the potential to interfere with important cellular processes that involve leucine-zipper formation, and present two particularly striking examples. First, leucine zippers are central in heart rhythm regulation through multimerization of phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Second, epithelial cell-cell adhesion relies on E-cadherins, which dimerize using a transmembrane leucine zipper. Most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including heart arrythmias, odor loss, impaired oxygen uptake and intestinal problems, up to multiorgan failure, can be rationalized by a possible interference of ORF7b with the functions of these proteins.

Many current therapies have dose-limiting adverse effects and are limited by their short duration of action. This review examines the evidence for the efficacy and safety of cryoanalgesia in postoperative pain. Materials and methods This review was registered in PROSPERO and prepared in accordance with PRISMA. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched until July 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults evaluating perioperatively administered cryoanalgesia for postoperative pain relief. Results Twenty-four RCTS were included. Twenty studies examined cryoanalgesia for thoracotomy, two for herniorrhaphy, one for nephrectomy and one for tonsillectomy. Meta-analysis was performed for thoracic studies. We found that cryoanalgesia with opioids was more efficacious than opioid analgesia alone for acute pain (mean difference [MD] 2.32 units, 95 % confidence interval [CI] -3.35 to -1.30) and persistent pain (MD 0.81 units, 95 % CI -1.10 to -0.53) after thoracotomy. Cryoanalgesia with opioids also resulted in less postoperative nausea compared to opioid analgesia alone (relative risk [RR] 0.23, 95 % CI 0.06 to 0.95), but there was no difference in atelectasis (RR 0.38, 95 % CI 0.07 to 2.17).

This trial was conducted to test the efficacy of ivermectin in mild and moderate coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). METHODS A double blind, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted among adult COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease severity on admission in a COVID dedicated tertiary healthcare of eastern India. Enrolment was done between 1st August and 31st October 2020. On day 1 and 2 post enrolment, patients in the intervention arm received ivermectin 12 mg while the patients in the non-interventional arm received placebo tablets. RESULTS About one-fourth (23.6%) of the patients in the intervention arm and one-third (31.6%) in the placebo arm were tested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) negative for SARS-CoV-2 on 6th day. Although this difference was found to be statistically insignificant [rate ratio (RR): 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4-1.4; p=0.348].

The pandemic has led to the cancellation of many religious, political, and cultural events around the world. A huge number of people have been stuck within their homes because of unprecedented lockdown measures taken globally. This paper examines the reaction of individuals to the virus outbreak-through the analytical lens of specific hashtags on the Instagram platform. The Instagram posts are analyzed in an attempt to surface commonalities in the way that individuals use visual social media when reacting to this crisis. After collecting the data, the posts containing the location data are selected. A portion of these data are chosen randomly and are categorized into five different categories. We perform several manual analyses to get insights into our collected dataset. Afterward, we use the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network for classifying the images associated with the posts, and attention-based LSTM networks for performing the caption classification. This paper discovers a range of emerging norms on social media in global crisis moments.

Since then, ETs have been identified in different populations of cells involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Much of the knowledge has been obtained from in vitro or ex vivo studies; however, in vivo evaluations in experimental models and human biological materials have corroborated some of the results obtained. Two types of ETs have been describedsuicidal and vital ETs, with or without the death of the producer cell. The studies showed that the same cell type may have more than one ETs formation mechanism and that different cells may have similar ETs formation mechanisms. ETs can act by controlling or promoting the mechanisms involved in the development and evolution of various infectious and non-infectious diseases, such as autoimmune, cardiovascular, thrombotic, and neoplastic diseases, among others. This review discusses the presence of ETs in neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and recent evidence of the presence of ETs in B lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and CD8+ T lymphocytes.

We therefore expected subjects to change their attitude toward the unchosen alternative, deeming it less valuable. We then presented subjects with a choice between the unchosen option and an option that was originally as attractive as both options in the first choice. Both groups preferred the novel over the unchosen option in this experimental condition, but not in a control condition in which they did not take part in the first decision. These results provide the first evidence of decision rationalization in children and nonhuman primates.

The framework can efficiently predict whether or not a CT scan contains pneumonia while simultaneously identifying pneumonia types between COVID-19 and Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) caused by other viruses. In the proposed method, two 3D-ResNets are coupled together into a single model for the two above-mentioned tasks via a novel prior-attention strategy. We extend residual learning with the proposed prior-attention mechanism and design a new so-called prior-attention residual learning (PARL) block. The model can be easily built by stacking the PARL blocks and trained end-to-end using multi-task losses. More specifically, one 3D-ResNet branch is trained as a binary classifier using lung images with and without pneumonia so that it can highlight the lesion areas within the lungs. Simultaneously, inside the PARL blocks, prior-attention maps are generated from this branch and used to guide another branch to learn more discriminative representations for the pneumonia-type classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of COVID-19 screening. Compared to other methods, it achieves a state-of-the-art result. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to other similar clinical applications such as computer-aided detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in CT images, glaucoma lesions in Retina fundus images, etc.","output":"Prior-Attention Residual Learning for More Discriminative COVID-19 Screening in CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans are highly susceptible to infection with respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus. While some viruses simply cause symptoms of the common cold, many respiratory viruses induce severe bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and even death following infection. Despite the immense clinical burden, the majority of the most common pulmonary viruses lack long-lasting efficacious vaccines. Nearly all current vaccination strategies are designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies, which prevent severe disease following a subsequent infection. However, the mucosal antibody response to many respiratory viruses is not long-lasting and declines with age. CD8 T cells are critical for mediating clearance following many acute viral infections in the lung. In addition, memory CD8 T cells are capable of providing protection against secondary infections. Therefore, the combined induction of virus-specific CD8 T cells and antibodies may provide optimal protective immunity. Herein, we review the current literature on CD8 T cell responses induced by respiratory virus infections. Additionally, we explore how this knowledge could be utilized in the development of future vaccines against respiratory viruses, with a special emphasis on RSV vaccination.","output":"The CD8 T Cell Response to Respiratory Virus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study introduces machine learning predictive models to predict the future values of the monitored vital signs of COVID-19 ICU patients. The main vital sign predictors include heart rate, respiration rate, and oxygen saturation. We investigated the performances of the developed predictive models by considering different approaches. The first predictive model was developed by considering the following vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial, pulse pressure), respiration rate, and oxygen saturation. Similar to the first approach, the second model was developed using the same vital signs, but it was trained and tested based on a leave-one-subject-out approach. The third predictive model was developed by considering three vital signs: heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO [Formula: see text]). The fourth model was a leave-one-subject-out model for the three vital signs. Finally, the fifth predictive model was developed based on the same three vital signs, but with a five-minute observation rate, in contrast with the aforementioned four models, where the observation rate was hourly to bi-hourly. For the five models, the predicted measurements were those of the three upcoming observations (on average, three hours ahead). Based on the obtained results, we observed that by limiting the number of vital sign predictors (i.e., three vital signs), the prediction performance was still acceptable, with the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) being [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] for heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiration rate, respectively. Moreover, increasing the observation rate could enhance the prediction performance to be, on average, [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] for heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiration rate, respectively.

The aim of this scoping review is therefore to identify available guidelines, consensus statements, the standard of practice, and practice recommendations on reproductive health service provision during the COVID-19 pandemics. METHODS: We searched guideline databases and websites of professional associations and international organizations working on sexual and reproductive health. We looked for practice recommendations on sexual reproductive health services (SRH) during COVID-19 pandemics. Additionally, we searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Data extraction was done by two independent reviewers using a customized tool that was developed to record the key information of the source thats relevant to the review question. The difference between the two authors on data extraction was resolved by discussion. RESULTS: A total of 21 records were included in the review. Identified recommendations were classified into thematic areas. The records addressed approaches to antenatal care, labour and delivery, postnatal care, safe abortion, contraception, gender-based violence, and artificial reproduction.

Inadequate knowledge on COVID-19 and poor practices and preventive measures among healthcare workers may lead to the rapid spread of the disease thereby limiting the ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the level of knowledge, risk perception, preparedness for COVID-19 and vaccine acceptability among healthcare workers in Kenya. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2020 to January 2021 to assess healthcare workers level of knowledge, perception of risk and preparedness to handle COVID-19 in Kenya. A link to an online self-administered questionnaire hosted on the Research Electronic Data Capture application (REDCap) was disseminated to health workers across the country via text messages, emails and social media. We collected data on demographics, knowledge, perception of risk and preparedness for COVID-19 and vaccine acceptance. Data collected in REDCap was then transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariate correlation analyses were used to determine associations between variables. P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsA total of 997 participants including doctors (34%), nurses (26%), clinical officers (21%) and lab technologists (12%) were enrolled in the study. About half (53%) of the participants were female. The mean age was 36.54 years (SD = 8.31) and 46% of the participants were aged between 31-40years. About half (55%) of participants worked in county facilities and 64% of the respondents had at least bachelors degree. The overall knowledge score of health workers for COVID-19 was 80%. Most of the health workers (89%) perceived that they were at high risk of infection. Seventy-two percent of the participants felt that they were either partially or fully prepared to handle patients with COVID-19. Overall, 71% of all health workers would take a vaccine if provided free by the government. ConclusionKnowledge of health workers on transmission, clinical manifestations and risk factors for development of severe COVID-19 was good.

Often, the introduction of labels is simply impossible in such measurements, and the application of label-free methods is the only reliable choice. By measuring the binding kinetics of Ni(II) ions to genetically modified flagellin layers, we demonstrate that: (1) Grating-Coupled Interferometry (GCI) is well suited to resolve the binding of ions, even at very low protein immobilization levels; (2) it supplies high quality kinetic data from which the number and strength of available binding sites can be determined, and (3) the rate constants of the binding events can also be obtained with high accuracy. Experiments were performed using a flagellin variant incorporating the C-terminal domain of the nickel-responsive transcription factor NikR. GCI results were compared to affinity data from titration calorimetry. We found that besides the low-affinity binding sites characterized by a micromolar dissociation constant (Kd), tetrameric FliC-NikRC molecules possess high-affinity binding sites with Kd values in the nanomolar range. GCI enabled us to obtain real-time kinetic data for the specific binding of an analyte with molar mass as low as 59 Da, even at signals lower than 1 pg/mm2.","output":"Grating-coupled interferometry reveals binding kinetics and affinities of Ni ions to genetically engineered protein layers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is aimed at the problem of scheduling surgeries in operating rooms.

This study assessed whether this threshold or a lower one would predict accurately weaning failure from mechanical ventilation. Twitch pressure was compared to ultrasound measurement of diaphragm function. METHODS In patients undergoing a first spontaneous breathing trial, diaphragm function was evaluated by twitch pressure and by diaphragm ultrasound (thickening fraction). Receiver operating characteristics curves were computed to determine the best thresholds predicting failure of spontaneous breathing trial. RESULTS Seventy-six patients were evaluated, 48 (63%) succeeded and 28 (37%) failed the spontaneous breathing trial. The optimal thresholds of twitch pressure and thickening fraction to predict failure of the spontaneous breathing trial were, respectively, 7.2 cmH2O and 25.8%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.80 (95% CI 0.70-0.89) for twitch pressure and 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.93) for thickening fraction. Both receiver operating characteristics curves were similar (p = 0.83). A twitch pressure value lower than 11 cmH2O (the traditional cutoff for diaphragm dysfunction) predicted failure of the spontaneous breathing trial with a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 72-98%) and a specificity of 45% (95% CI 30-60%).

In this research, we investigate its potential effects on people's mental health. Many people have experienced social isolation, as countries attempt to stem the spread of the disease through confinement and other forms of social distancing. Intuitively, such social isolation may increase feelings of loneliness, and people may take logical steps to reduce their feelings of social isolation and loneliness. One route is through the use of social networking apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and messaging and VoIP apps (e.g., WhatsApp, iMessage). In this research, we investigate the effects of pandemic-induced social isolation on social networking and messaging apps, and potential related effects on loneliness. We surveyed young adults (N = 334) who are part of the Centennial cohort (born after 1995) from three different countries (Italy, Argentina, UK) and obtained their screen time usage data over a 4-week period starting from mid-March 2020. This sampling procedure allowed us to obtain data from respondents who were experiencing different degrees of mandated social isolation (lockdowns), which enabled us to determine whether social network and messaging app usage increased as a function of social isolation, and to test potential effects on levels of loneliness. Results showed that only social network usage increased in the initial stage of confinement as a function of lockdown initiation. Additionally, social network app usage was associated with increased feelings of loneliness, and this relation was mediated by fear of missing out (FOMO). In contrast, messaging app usage was associated with decreased feelings of loneliness, and was unrelated to FOMO.

Comprehensive experimental data on the production of many viruses using the Vero cell line can be found in the literature. However, the vast majority of these processes is relying on the microcarrier technology. While this system is established for the large-scale manufacturing of viral vaccine, it is still quite complex and labor intensive. Moreover, scale-up remains difficult and is limited by the surface area given by the carriers. To overcome these and other drawbacks and to establish more efficient manufacturing processes, it is a priority to further develop the Vero cell platform by applying novel bioprocess technologies. Especially in times like the current COVID-19 pandemic, advanced and scalable platform technologies could provide more efficient and cost-effective solutions to meet the global vaccine demand. Herein, we review the prevailing literature on Vero cell bioprocess development for the production of viral vectors and vaccines with the aim to assess the recent advances in bioprocess development. We critically underline the need for further research activities and describe bottlenecks to improve the Vero cell platform by taking advantage of recent developments in the cell culture engineering field.","output":"Vero cell upstream bioprocess development for the production of viral vectors and vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Swine coccidiosis, a protozoan disease caused by coccidia, can result in diarrhoea and weight loss in piglets and even economic losses in the pig industry. Here, we report the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of coccidia (including Eimeria spp. and Cystoisospora suis) in pigs in China. METHODS: Five databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP) were searched and 50 studies (46,926 domestic pigs, 22 provinces) ultimately identified pertaining to the prevalence of coccidia infection from 1980 to 2019. We incorporated the effect size using the random-effects model in the \\"meta\\" package in R software and conducted univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence rate of coccidia in pigs was 21.9%, including the C. suis infection rate of 9.1%. The highest prevalence of coccidia (39.6%) was found in northwest China, and this region also presented the lowest prevalence of C. suis (4.7%). In the subgroup analysis based on sampling year, the highest prevalence of coccidia was detected in 2001 or earlier (32.6%), whereas the lowest rate was found in 2012 or later (14.3%). An opposite trend was observed for C. suis (5.5% in 2000 or earlier vs 14.4% in 2000 or later). The prevalence of coccidia in extensive farming systems (29.5%) was higher than that in intensive farming systems (17.3%). In contrast, the point estimate of C. suis prevalence was lower in the extensive farming systems (5.1%) than in the intensive farming systems (10.0%), but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). Among the four age categories, the highest total coccidia prevalence (26.2%) was found in finishing pigs, followed by suckling piglets (19.9%), whereas the highest prevalence of C. suis (14.9%) was observed in suckling piglets. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that coccidia infection in Chinese pigs is common, although the prevalence of C. suis in pigs does not receive sufficient attention. We recommend the rational use of anticoccidial drugs to avoid drug resistance and the development of preventive and control measures for C. suis to reduce the incidence of swine coccidiosis.","output":"Prevalence of coccidia in domestic pigs in China between 1980 and 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes myocardial injury by inducing a cytokine storm in severe cases.

Faced with this unknown disease, public health authorities were forced to experiment, in a short period of time, with various combinations of interventions at different scales. However, as the pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for tools and methodologies to quickly analyze the effectiveness of responses against COVID-19 in different communities and contexts. In this perspective, computer modeling appears to be an invaluable lever as it allows for the in silico exploration of a range of intervention strategies prior to the potential field implementation phase. More specifically, we argue that, in order to take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of the individual response or the spatial aspect of containment strategies, the branch of computer modeling known as agent-based modeling is of immense interest. We present in this paper an agent-based modeling framework called COVID-19 Modeling Kit (COMOKIT), designed to be generic, scalable and thus portable in a variety of social and geographical contexts. COMOKIT combines models of person-to-person and environmental transmission, a model of individual epidemiological status evolution, an agenda-based 1-h time step model of human mobility, and an intervention model. It is designed to be modular and flexible enough to allow modelers and users to represent different strategies and study their impacts in multiple social, epidemiological or economic scenarios. Several large-scale experiments are analyzed in this paper and allow us to show the potentialities of COMOKIT in terms of analysis and comparison of the impacts of public health policies in a realistic case study.","output":"COMOKIT: A Modeling Kit to Understand, Analyze, and Compare the Impacts of Mitigation Policies Against the COVID-19 Epidemic at the Scale of a City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By conducting ordinary least square estimations using the Fama and French Three-Factor and Five-Factor models on thirty U S based industry portfolios, the significant rate of all the variables is compared Using the comparison, the impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the markets and the Fama and French models are significant As a result, the significance level of all the independent variables has increased during the COVID-19 Pandemic The Five-Factor model fares a more substantial increase in efficiency during the Pandemic, and some variables, such as HML and CMA, see tremendous changes The market becomes less sophisticated during the Pandemic, and the Fama and French Five-Factor model may be more suitable for estimation under certain market environments, contrary to many previous studies","output":"Research on the application of Fama and French three-factor and five-factor models in American industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Mutations or copy number abnormalities of genes involved in homologous recombination (HR) occur in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). DNA-based measures of HR deficiency (HRD) have been developed and may help identify tumors with better response to DNA-damaging agents. This study aimed to describe the HR pathway mutations and HRD status and determine their association with treatment response and outcome in patients with PDAC. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of tumor samples from patients treated at Indiana University for locally advanced or metastatic PDAC. Patients were included if they received gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (control) or fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX) and had adequate follow-up to assess survival and response to therapy. Tumor analysis generated a three-biomarker HRD score and mutation data for 44 genes. RESULTS Ninety-one samples met inclusion criteria, and 78 samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded, n = 15; fine-needle aspiration, n = 63) generated mutation data. HRD analysis was successful for 57 samples (HRD score: median, 18; range, 5 to 61); the primary cause of failure was low tumor cellularity. Six BRCA1/2 mutations were detected, four with HRD scores in the top decile (P = .011). There was no statistically significant correlation between HRD score and radiographic response (odds ratio per interquartile range, 1.40; P = .32 adjusted for treatment) in either treatment group. In patients treated with FOLFIRINOX, HRD score dichotomized at the median was not associated with progression-free survival (median, 5.3 v 9.4 months for low v high HRD score, respectively; P = .083) or overall survival (median, 11.9 v 10.7 months for low v high HRD score, respectively; P = .76). CONCLUSION Mutations in DNA repair genes occur in PDAC, and HRD scores can be generated in the majority of patients. The HRD score was not significantly associated with higher response rate or prolonged survival in patients treated with FOLFIRINOX.","output":"Homologous Recombination Deficiency in Patients With Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Response to Chemotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Italy is the second exposed country worldwide, after China, and Lombardia is the most affected region in Italy, with more than half of the national cases, with 13% of whom being healthcare professionals.

We sought to determine whether PE in Corona virus patients were more likely thrombotic or embolic in etiology, and the role of IVC filters in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: A single-center retrospective analysis evaluating all CT pulmonary angiograms (684) that were completed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic between March 15, 2020, and May 31, 2020, at a tertiary care center in an urban setting. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was defined as iliocaval or femoropopliteal thrombus on lower extremity Doppler or CT with lower extremity runoff, or brachial, axillary, subclavian, or internal jugular vein thrombus on upper extremity Doppler. PE was considered thrombotic in patients in the absence of DVT and embolic in the presence of DVT during their inpatient stay. COVID-19 status was based on the most recent results prior to the patients CT pulmonary angiogram, if testing was not conducted, the patient was considered negative for COVID-19. Chi-square analysis was carried out to determine the difference in rates between thrombotic versus embolic PE in Corona virus positive and negative patients. Results: Imaging confirmed acute PE in 112 patients during this period, of which 43 (38%) tested positive for COVID-19, and 69 (62%) tested negative. Of patients testing positive for Corona virus with PE, imaging confirmed concurrent lower or upper extremity DVT in 4 of 43 patients (9%) and ruled out DVT in 24 of 43 patients (56%). Whereas, in COVID-19 negative patients with PE, imaging confirmation of DVT was seen in 19 of 69 patients (28%) and DVT was ruled out in 21 of 69 patients (30%). This correlated with a chi-square value of 8.12 (P = 0.004). Conclusions: Pulmonary emboli in COVID-19 patients are more likely to be thrombotic rather than embolic in etiology, limiting the utility of IVC filters in Corona virus patients.","output":"Abstract No. 183 Search for the offending clot and to filter or not: embolic versus thrombotic pulmonary embolism in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic inhibition of the p110 isoform of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) can increase murine lifespan, enhance mitochondrial function and alter tissue specific oxidative balance. Here, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of the p110 isoform of PI3K induces similar enhancement of mitochondrial function in middle-aged mice. Eight-month old male and female mice were fed a diet containing 0.3 g/kg of the p110-selective inhibitor BYL-719 (BYL) or a vehicle diet (VEH) for six weeks. Mice consuming BYL-719 had higher fed blood glucose and insulin, and tended towards decreased body weight. After 72 h, gene expression of the mitochondrial biogenesis mediators Pgc1, Tfam and Nrf1 was greater in liver of BYL-719 males only, but unchanged in skeletal muscle of either sex. Six weeks of BYL-719 treatment did not affect mitochondrial content or function in the liver or skeletal muscle of either sex. In livers of males only, the expression of the antioxidant genes Nfe2l2, Cat, Sod1 and Sod2 increased within 72 h of BYL-719 treatment, and remained higher after six weeks. This was associated with an increase in hepatic GSH content and catalase protein expression, and lower H2O2 levels. Our results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of p110 in adult mice does not affect liver or skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, but does show sex- and tissue-specific effects on upregulation of antioxidant response. Given BYL-719 was well-tolerated and improved oxidative balance, it may have potential to influence aging-associated metabolic decline in the long-term.","output":"Prolonged treatment with a PI3K-p110 inhibitor causes sex- and tissue-dependent changes in antioxidant content, but does not affect mitochondrial function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic called COVID-19 disease has an exponential course since the first cases were reported showing in 9th of May, 2020, more than 4 million cases of COVID-19 United States and European Council (EC), together with other European Union institutions, were closely monitoring the situation in order to take quick action Objective: The aim of this article is to analyze the response to COVID 19 pandemic outbreak in term of strategy and money flow of Romanian health system in order to identify the strength and weakness and prepare for other similar provocative challenges Global and national strategy: United States Government is delivering a comprehensive package of services to support international partners around the world in combatting this disease adding American expertise for global benefit, saving lives by improving international partners abilities to respond to the COVID-19, and reducing secondary impacts Meanwhile European Union is focused on 6 major coordinates limit the spread of the virus, ensure and provide medical supplies, decrease negative economic impact, support jobs, promoting research and help European citizens to repatriate Despite all negative elements a proper and relatively quick response of Romanian Public Health System was noticed and the taken measures were harmonized and synchronized with the European coordinates, prioritize initiatives, build an action plan, establish a communication plan, workforce optimization and management strategy Conclusion: Global shock needs global response, with little or no government interventions, economic costs will be huge","output":"CoViD-19 disease, Romanian health system response to outbreak and economic impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our article Gallacher and Hossain (2020) contains coding errors.

The exact role of public transportation and risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not known. Methods: : Participants (n=121 374) were untested adult Norwegian residents recruited through social media who in the spring of 2020 completed a baseline questionnaire on demographics and use of public transport. Incident cases (n=1069) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test registered at the Norwegian Messaging System for Infectious Diseases by January 27, 2021. We investigated the association between use of public transport and SARS-CoV-2 using logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age, calendar time, gender, municipality, smoking, income level, fitness and underlying medical conditions were estimated. Frequency of use of public transport was reported for 2 week-periods. Results: : Before lockdown, those who tested positive on SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to have used public transport 1-3 times (OR =1.28, CI 1.09-1.51), 4-10 times (OR=1.49, CI 1.26-1.77) and 11 times (OR=1.50, CI 1.27-1.78, p for trend<0.0001) than those who had not tested positive.

COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) have higher mortality than non-ICU patients. Critical illness has consistently posed a challenge not only in terms of mortality, but also in regard to long-term outcomes of survivors. Patients who survive acute critical illness including, but not limited to, pulmonary and systemic insults associated with ARDS, pneumonia, systemic inflammation, and mechanical ventilation, will likely suffer from Post-ICU Syndrome (PICS), a phenomenon of cognitive, psychiatric, and/or physical disability following treatment in the ICU. Post-ICU morbidity and mortality continues to be a cause for concern when considering large-scale studies showing 12-month mortality risks of 11.8% to 21%. Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple mechanisms, including cytokine release, mitochondrial dysfunction and even amyloids may lead to end-organ dysfunction in patients. We hypothesize that COVID-19 infection will lead to PICS via potentially similar mechanisms as other chronic critical illness and cause long-term morbidity and mortality in patients.

The gain in pool testing over normal procedure is quantified by the percentage of tests required compared to individual testing. RESULTS: The percentage of tests required by the pool testing strategy varies according to the different splitting procedures, the size of the pooled sample, and the probability of an individual being infected in the population. If the probability of infection is 0.05, then for a pool size of 32, only 14 tests, are sufficient to detect every infected individual.

However, therapies targeting this pathway have proven effective in only a few cancers, as cancers inevitably develop resistance. Puzzling observations suggest that MAPK targeting fails in tumors due to early compensatory RAS overexpression, albeit by unexplained mechanisms. We identified a novel mechanism of drug tolerance to MEK inhibitors (MEKi) that involves Processing Bodies (PBs), a membraneless organelle (MLO). MEKi promoted translation of the oncogenes KRAS and NRAS, which in turn triggered BRAF phosphorylation. This overexpression, which occurred in the absence of neotranscription, depended on PB dissolution as the source of the RAS mRNA. Moreover, in response to MEKi removal, the process was dynamic as PBs rapidly reformed and reduced MAPK signaling. These results highlight a dynamic spatiotemporal negative feedback loop of MAPK signaling via RAS mRNA sequestration. Furthermore, we observed a phenotype with a low number of PBs along with strong KRAS and NRAS induction capacities. Overall, we describe a new intricate mechanism involving PBs in the translational regulation of essential cellular signaling pathways like MAPKs, paving the way for future therapies altering MLO and thereby improving targeted cancer therapies.","output":"Processing body dynamics drive non-genetic MEK inhibitors tolerance by fine-tuning KRAS and NRAS translation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can spread rapidly in high-risk congregate settings such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) (1).

In this study, we detect that chemokine CCL5 was highly expressed, while expression of its receptor, CCR1, was downregulated in respiratory epithelial cells after RSV infection. When we overexpressed CCR1 on respiratory epithelial cells in vivo/in vitro, viral load was significantly suppressed, which can be restored by the neutralizing antibody for CCR1. Interestingly, the antiviral effect of CCR1 was not related to type I interferon (IFN-I), apoptosis induction or viral adhesion or entry inhibition; in contrast, it was related to the preferential recruitment and activation of adaptor Gi, which promoted inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3) expression, leading to inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, explicitly, phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 was verified to be among the important factors regulating the activity of HSP90, which has been previously reported to be a chaperone of RSV RNA polymerase.

There was sharp decline of insulin levels in SG animals over time, whereas insulin levels in DJOS and DJOS + SG were preserved. GIP levels were significantly larger in both groups containing a sleeve at all three time points, whereas GLP-1 was equal in all groups at all time. Bile acid levels were significantly higher in the DJOS compared to the SG group at all time points. Interestingly, the additional SG in the DJOS + SG group led to lower bile acid levels 1 and 6 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION The effect of SG on glucose control was transient, whereas a duodenal exclusion was the more effective procedure in this model due to a sustained pancreatic function with a preserved insulin secretion.","output":"Duodenal Exclusion but Not Sleeve Gastrectomy Preserves Insulin Secretion, Making It the More Effective Metabolic Procedure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recurrent outbreaks of novel zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) diseases in recent years have highlighted the importance of developing therapeutics with broad-spectrum activity against CoVs. Because all CoVs use ?1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (?1 PRF) to control expression of key viral proteins, the frameshift signal in viral mRNA that stimulates ?1 PRF provides a promising potential target for such therapeutics. To test the viability of this strategy, we explored whether small-molecule inhibitors of ?1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 also inhibited ?1 PRF in a range of bat CoVsthe most likely source of future zoonoses. Six inhibitors identified in new and previous screens against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated against the frameshift signals from a panel of representative bat CoVs as well as MERS-CoV. Some drugs had strong activity against subsets of these CoV-derived frameshift signals, while having limited to no effect on ?1 PRF caused by frameshift signals from other viruses used as negative controls. Notably, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat suppressed ?1 PRF significantly for multiple CoV-derived frameshift signals. These results suggest it is possible to find small-molecule ligands that inhibit ?1 PRF specifically in a broad spectrum of CoVs, establishing frameshift signals as a viable target for developing pan-coronaviral therapeutics.","output":"Identifying Inhibitors of ?1 Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in a Broad Spectrum of Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Connected objects are deployed all over the world. Thus, they are contributing to improving communications. In urban areas, technological challenges are gradually being overcome, and advances in this area are exponential. Unfortunately, isolated territories such as northern Quebec do not beneficiate from this technological progress. Yet, northern Quebec relies on abundant natural resources, with notably its huge hydroelectric dams and iron mines, and therefore, the region's economic life revolves essentially around the exploitation of these resources and is heavily reliant on rail transportation. However, according to Transport Canada, 1246 railroad accidents were reported in 2019 to the Transportation Safety Board (TSB). Thirty-eight people described as trespassers lost their lives, and five railroad employees were fatally injured. In this context, we present the implementation of a security system in an isolated environment for employees intervening on the railroad track to warn them of the imminent arrival of a train. Due to the context of the isolated environment, i.e., without an electrical network, without internet, and without an LTE network, a solution for employees has been developed using a Zigbee telecommunication system and a connected watch. A case study on a train operating in a remote and isolated area in northern Quebec is presented to validate the performance of the proposed system based on an open-source and customizable solution.","output":"Development and Validation of a Railway Safety System for Nordic Trains in Isolated Territories of Northern Quebec Based on IEEE 802.15.4 Protocol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this White Paper, we outline recommendations from the perspective of health psychology and behavioural science, addressing three research gaps: (1) What methods in the health psychology research toolkit can be best used for developing and evaluating digital health tools?

Currently available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens (Ag) have sensitivity well below PCR. The correlation of Ag and RNA quantities in clinical nasopharyngeal (NP) samples is unknown.Methods: An ultrasensitive, quantitative electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (the MSD? S-PLEX? CoV-2 N assay) was used to measure Ag in clinical NP samples from adults and children previously tested by PCR.Results: The S-PLEX Ag assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.16 pg/mL and a cutoff of 0.32 pg/mL. Ag concentrations measured in clinical NP samples (collected in 3.0 mL media) ranged from less than 160 fg/mL to 2.7 ug/mL. Log-transformed Ag concentrations correlated tightly with Ct values. In 35 adult and 101 pediatric PCR-positive samples, sensitivity was 91% (95% CI, 77-98%) and 79% (70-87%), respectively. In samples with Ct &#8804; 35, sensitivity was 100% (88-100%) and 96% (88-99%), respectively. In 50 adult and 40 pediatric PCR-negative specimens, specificity was 100% (93-100%) and 98% (87-100%), respectively.Conclusions: Nucleocapsid concentrations in clinical NP samples span 8 orders of magnitude and correlate closely with RNA concentrations (Ct values). The S-PLEX Ag assay had 96-100% sensitivity in samples from children and adults with Ct values &#8804; 35, and 98-100% specificity. These results clarify Ag concentration distributions in clinical samples, providing insight into the performance of Ag RDTs and offering a new approach to diagnosis of COVID-19.","output":"Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA concentrations in nasopharyngeal samples from children and adults using an ultrasensitive and quantitative antigen assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introductory chapter reviews the meaning and fundamental features of the advance of development, what is later detailed and exemplified in the other parts of the book.

Environment-development dilemmas are actually much broader and more complicated than suggested by simplistic narratives of progress and conservation. The main attention of the first chapter is on the socio-cultural construction of development frontiers as spaces of opportunity and likely rewards for those who persevere helps to maintain social inequalities. Interrogating the frontier is a formidable challenge for critical, left-wing thinking (primarily concentrated on justice and equality), considering that frontier making is by definition a generation and perpetuation of inequalities.

PROBLEM: Our State Legislature mandated that public schools equip themselves with bleeding control kits resulting in thousands of school staff needing training. APPROACH: Our nursing school used a service learning model to aid schools. Nursing students coordinated the program, and student learning occurred through a learning-by-teaching strategy. OUTCOMES: We trained 656 community members, taught in 5 counties, and students received 320 clinical hours. If not for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), numbers would have been doubled.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The databases of three institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent endovascular treatment of PICA aneurysms using a reconstructive technique where the LVIS Jr stent was totally or partially deployed into the PICA were included in the analysis. Clinical presentation, aneurysm and PICA sizes, procedural complications, and clinical and angiographic follow-up information was recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Seven patients who underwent endovascular treatment of PICA aneurysms with an LVIS Jr stent were identified. Four aneurysms were treated in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There were no symptomatic complications. One patient had spasm distal to the stent as a result of mechanical straightening of the vessel. One patient was treated in the acute phase of SAH and required a gycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor after the stent was implanted. This patient needed to be re-treated to complete embolization. All patients had good clinical outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale 5). No in-stent stenosis or occlusion was seen on short-term angiographic follow-up and the aneurysms were occluded. CONCLUSIONS This small series suggests that the use of a reconstructive technique with the LVIS Jr stent for the treatment of PICA aneurysms is feasible, safe and effective in the short term.","output":"Endovascular treatment of PICA aneurysms with a Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS Jr) device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article examines how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the current state of Chinese-African relations Difficulties which the dialogue of the parties goes through, in particular in the aspect of Africa's indebtedness exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis, are described too The paper also reveals the impact that the pandemic may have on the implementation of the \\"Belt and road\\" initiative in its African part The issue of China's \\"soft power\\" in Africa is touched upon in the light of the adverse consequences of COVID-19 in the sphere of humanitarian relations  ѧ ѧާѧڧӧѧ֧ ӧ  , ܧѧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ COVID-19 ӧݧڧ֧ ߧ ֧ܧ֧ ߧڧ ܧڧѧۧܧ-ѧڧܧѧߧܧڧ ߧ֧ߧڧ ѧѧܧ֧ڧ٧ ߧӧ ӧ٧ӧ  էߧ,  ܧާ ѧݧܧڧӧѧ֧ էڧѧݧ ,  ѧߧ,  ӧ ٧ѧէݧا֧ߧߧ ѧڧܧѧߧܧڧ ѧ ֧֧ ڧѧ֧, ҧڧӧ֧ާ  ֧٧ݧѧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧԧ ܧڧ٧ڧ ާ֧ѧ֧ ѧܧا   ӧ٧է֧ۧӧڧ, ܧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ҧߧ ܧѧ٧ѧ ߧ ֧ѧݧڧ٧ѧڧ ѧڧܧѧߧܧ ѧ ܧڧѧۧܧԧ ֧ܧ ?  ? ѧѧԧڧӧѧ֧ ֧ާ ?ާԧܧ ڧݧ? ڧѧ  ڧܧ  ӧ֧ ߧ֧ҧݧѧԧڧߧ ݧ֧էӧڧ COVID-19 էݧ ԧާѧߧڧѧߧ ߧ֧ߧڧ ","output":"Features of Chinese-African Relations during the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The village-owned enterprises (BUMDesa) in Sidoarjo namely Sukses Bersama.

This work aims at evaluating the impact of a reduction in chronic use of benzodiazepine on the future burden of dementia in France. Using estimations of dementia incidence and of benzodiazepine use and nation-wide projections of mortality and population sizes, a Monte Carlo approach based on an illness-death model provided projections of several indicators of dementia burden. With no change in benzodiazepine consumption, the prevalence of dementia between age 65 and 99 in France in 2040 was estimated at 2.16 millions (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-2.38), with a life expectancy without dementia at 65 years equal to 25.0 years (24.7-25.3) for women and 23.8 years (23.5-24.2) for men. Assuming a disappearance of chronic use of benzodiazepine in 2020, the prevalence would be reduced by about 6.6% in 2040 and the life expectancy without dementia would increase by 0.99 (0.93-1.06) year among women and 0.56 (0.50-0.62) among men.

METHODS: We identified recurrent themes in the existing literature on doctors experience of telephone consultations with a view to determining the applicability of these themes to a group of Irish psychiatrists. A questionnaire was developed based on themes in the literature. This was sent to all psychiatrists working in a busy psychiatric service in Dublin. RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 72% (n = 26/35). Diagnostic challenges, the effect of phone consultation on the therapeutic alliance, challenges associated with the use of technology and ethical concerns were identified as issues. Flexibility in the working day and convenience were identified as possible benefits to telephone consultations. CONCLUSIONS: The group that participated in this research study identified a number of challenges to carrying out successful phone consultations.

In Survey 1, pet owners (n = 686) responded during the final week of the five-week Alert Level 4 lockdown (highest level of restrictions-April 2020), and survey 2 involved 498 respondents during July 2020 whilst at Alert Level 1 (lowest level of restrictions). During the lockdown, 54.7% of owners felt that their pets' wellbeing was better than usual, while only 7.4% felt that it was worse. Most respondents (84.0%) could list at least one benefit of lockdown for their pets, and they noted pets were engaged with more play (61.7%) and exercise (49.7%) than pre-lockdown. Many respondents (40.3%) expressed that they were concerned about their pet's wellbeing after lockdown, with pets missing company/attention and separation anxiety being major themes. In Survey 2, 27.9% of respondents reported that they continued to engage in increased rates of play with their pets after lockdown, however, the higher levels of pet exercise were not maintained. Just over one-third (35.9%) of owners took steps to prepare their pets to transition out of lockdown. The results indicate that pets may have enjoyed improved welfare during lockdown due to the possibility of increased human-pet interaction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-one patients with CRCLM undergoing thermal ablation at our institute from 2009 to 2013 were identified and analysed to formulate a prognostic nomogram. The concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve were calculated to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the nomogram. The nomogram was compared with two current prognostic nomograms for patients with CRCLM who had undergone hepatectomy (Kattan) and selective internal radiation therapy (Fendler). Predictive validity was assessed in the validation cohort of 25 patients who had undergone thermal ablation from 2014 to 2016. RESULTS The median OS in the primary cohort was 26.4 months, whereas the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 72.2%, 37.2% and 17%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 4.2 months. After univariate and multivariate analysis, a prognostic nomogram was formulated based on four predictors, including the number of tumours, maximum diameter of the tumour, CA19-9 level and ablation margin. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.815. Based on the patients of this study, the C-index was significantly higher than that of the Fendler nomogram (C-index, 0.698) and Kattan nomogram (C-index, 0.514, p < 0.001).

This single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study was conducted to validate this criteria. METHODS: Present study included the IgAN patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 in the Juntendo University Hospital. Remission of hematuria was defined as three consecutive dipstick test results of ( -) to ( ) or a red blood cell count < 5 in urinary sediment per high-power field during at least 6 months. Remission of proteinuria was defined as three consecutive dipstick results of ( -) to ( ) during at least 6 months. We categorized four groups according to the remission status which was assessed 2 years after the renal biopsy. The primary outcome was a 50% increase in the serum creatinine over the baseline. We evaluated the slope of eGFR decline (mL/min/1.73 m2/year) and a decrease in the eGFR of 30% from baseline eGFR as the secondary outcome, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients (male: 47.3%, median age: 30 years) were included and were followed for a median of 86.5 months. During the period, forty-one patients achieved neither remission of proteinuria nor hematuria (NR). Twelve patients met the primary study outcome.

Hand-held spirometers have emerged relatively recently and offer several advantages over conventional desktop systems. There remains, however, a need for reassurance of high-quality spirometry testing with next-generation portable spirometers that connect over Bluetooth(?) to smart device applications. In this study, we examine the accuracy and repeatability of lung function measurements of a novel hand-held ultrasonic spirometer, the Spirohome Clinic and compare its clinical performance to a reference device, the EasyOne Air. METHODS: Benchtop validation of the spirometers was conducted using a lung simulator device according to ATS/ERS guidelines and the ISO 26782 standard waveforms. Subsequently, 48 volunteers (pediatric patients between 6 and 11 years of age and adolescent patients between 12 and 18 years of age) performed spirometry with both the Spirohome Clinic and the EasyOne Air spirometer during their clinic visits. Spirometric data including repeated FEV(1), FVC, FEV(6), FEF(25-75), and PEF measurements were collected. RESULTS: Both the Spirohome Clinic and the EasyOne Air successfully passed requirements for accuracy stated in relevant guidelines and standards for spirometry. The only statistically significant (p<0.05) difference was for FVC measurement accuracy. Clinical comparisons revealed strong correlation between spirometers in the measurement of key pulmonary function parameters including FEV(1) and FVC with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.99. BlandCAltman plots showed good agreement between mean differences of FEV(1) and FVC with the majority measurements remaining between the limits of 95% agreement for both the entire patient cohort and also in age and gender subsets. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that the Spirohome Clinic spirometer conforms to ATS/ERS performance requirements and validates the clinical comparability of its measurement accuracy and repeatability to the EasyOne Air. These findings support the indicated use of the Spirohome Clinic for high-quality lung function testing in clinical settings.","output":"Clinical Validation of the Spirohome Clinic Ultrasonic Spirometer in Child and Adolescent Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endothelial cell (EC) activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary microvascular occlusion, which is a hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consistent with EC activation, increased plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) levels have been reported in COVID-19. Importantly however, studies in other microangiopathies have shown that plasma VWF propeptide (VWFpp) is a more sensitive and specific measure of acute EC activation. In the present study, we further investigated the nature of EC activation in severe COVID-19. Markedly increased plasma VWF:Ag [median (interquatile range, IQR) 6088 (531-830)iu/dl] and pro-coagulant factor VIII (FVIII) levels [median (IQR) 2619 (170-315) iu/dl] were seen in patients with severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Sequential testing showed that these elevated VWF-FVIII complex levels remained high for up to 3 weeks. Similarly, plasma VWFpp levels were also markedly elevated [median (IQR) 3246 (267-524) iu/dl]. Interestingly however, the VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio was reduced, demonstrating that decreased VWF clearance contributes to the elevated plasma VWF:Ag levels in severe COVID-19. Importantly, plasma VWFpp levels also correlated with clinical severity indices including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that sustained fulminant EC activation is occurring in severe COVID-19, and further suggest that VWFpp may have a role as a biomarker in this setting.","output":"Von Willebrand factor propeptide in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): evidence of acute and sustained endothelial cell activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe how the COVID pandemic changed the epidemiology and management of pediatric otolaryngologic diseases, which may influence clinical decision-making in the future. FINDINGS: Many changes were made to the structure of healthcare delivery to minimize transmission of coronavirus. As a result, there was a widespread adoption of telehealth. Additionally, guidelines were published with new protocols for evaluation and management of common pediatric otolaryngologic conditions, which in many circumstances, delayed or replaced surgical intervention. Now, as we evaluate the impact of these clinical changes, we have gained new understanding about the pathophysiology of certain pediatric conditions, namely otitis media, for which upper respiratory infection (URI) exposure may play a larger role than previously thought.

It is becoming increasingly clear that peoples behavioural responses in the USA during this fast-changing pandemic are associated with their preferred media sources. The polarisation of US media has been reflected in politically motivated messaging around the coronavirus by some media outlets, such as Fox News. This resulted in different messaging around the risks of infection and behavioural changes necessary to mitigate that risk. This study determined if COVID-related behaviours differed according to trust in left-leaning or right-leaning media and how differences changed over the first several months of the pandemic. METHODS: Using the nationally representative Understanding America Study COVID-19 panel, we examine preventive and risky behaviours related to infection from COVID-19 over the period from 10 March to 9 June for people with trust in different media sources: one left-leaning, CNN and another right-leaning, Fox News. Peoples media preferences are categorised into three groups: (1) those who trust CNN more than Fox News; (2) those who have equal or no preferences and (3) those who trust Fox News more than CNN. RESULTS: Results showed that compared with those who trust CNN more than Fox news, people who trust Fox News more than CNN engaged in fewer preventive behaviours and more risky behaviours related to COVID-19. Out of five preventive and five risky behaviours examined, people who trust Fox News more than CNN practised an average of 3.41 preventive behaviours and 1.25 risky behaviours, while those who trust CNN more than Fox News engaged in an average of 3.85 preventive and 0.94 risky behaviours, from late March to June. The difference between these two groups widened in the month of May (p0.01), even after controlling for access to professional information and overall diversity of information sources. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that behavioural responses were divided along media bias lines. In such a highly partisan environment, false information can be easily disseminated, and health messaging, which is one of the few effective ways to slowdown the spread of the virus in the absence of a vaccine, is being damaged by politically biased and economically focused narratives. During a public health crisis, media should reduce their partisan stance on health information, and the health messaging from neutral and professional sources based on scientific findings should be better promoted.","output":"Media trust and infection mitigating behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease that has claimed >150,000 lives and infected millions in the United States thus far, especially the elderly population.

SARS-CoV-2 also affects patients, families, and societys mental health at large. There is growing evidence of re-infection in some patients. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, its mechanism of infection, diagnostics, therapeutics, and treatment strategies, while also focusing on less attended aspects by previous studies, including nutritional support, psychological, and rehabilitation of the pandemic and its management.

The deduced sequence contains a probable cleaved signal peptide sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane helix, indicating that protein X4 is likely to be a type I membrane protein. This study was conducted to demonstrate whether the protein X4 was expressed and its essential function in the process of SARS-CoV infection. METHODS The prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein X4-expressing plasmids were constructed. Recombinant soluble protein X4 was purified from E. coli using ion exchange chromatography, and the preparation was injected into chicken for rising specific polyclonal antibodies. The expression of protein X4 in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and lung tissues from patients with SARS was performed using immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry technique. The preliminary function of protein X4 was evaluated by treatment with and over-expression of protein X4 in cell lines. Western blot was employed to evaluate the expression of protein X4 in SARS-CoV particles. RESULTS We expressed and purified soluble recombinant protein X4 from E.coli, and generated specific antibodies against protein X4. Western blot proved that the protein X4 was not assembled in the SARS-CoV particles. Indirect immunofluorescence assays revealed that the expression of protein X4 was detected at 8 hours after infection in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. It was also detected in the lung tissues from patients with SARS. Treatment with and overexpression of protein X4 inhibited the growth of Balb/c 3T3 cells as determined by cell counting and MTT assays.

Among novel alternative therapies, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has emerged as a promising cancer treatment in recent years. The limited clinical applications of ACT, despite its advantages over standard-of-care therapies, can be attributed to (i) time-consuming and cost-intensive procedures to screen for potent anti-tumor immune cells and the corresponding targets, (ii) difficulties to translate in-vitro and animal-derived in-vivo efficacies to clinical efficacy in humans, and (iii) the lack of systemic methods for the safety assessment of ACT. Suitable experimental models and testing platforms have the potential to accelerate the development of ACT. Immunocompetent microphysiological systems (iMPS) are microfluidic platforms that enable complex interactions of advanced tissue models with different immune cell types, bridging the gap between in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Here, we present a proof-of-concept iMPS that supports a triple culture of three-dimensional (3D) colorectal tumor microtissues, 3D cardiac microtissues, and human-derived natural killer (NK) cells in the same microfluidic network. Different aspects of tumor-NK cell interactions were characterized using this iMPS including: (i) direct interaction and NK cell-mediated tumor killing, (ii) the development of an inflammatory milieu through enrichment of soluble pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, and (iii) secondary effects on healthy cardiac microtissues. We found a specific NK cell-mediated tumor-killing activity and elevated levels of tumor- and NK cell-derived chemokines and cytokines, indicating crosstalk and development of an inflammatory milieu. While viability and morphological integrity of cardiac microtissues remained mostly unaffected, we were able to detect alterations in their beating behavior, which shows the potential of iMPS for both, efficacy and early safety testing of new candidate ACTs.","output":"An Immunocompetent Microphysiological System to Simultaneously Investigate Effects of Anti-Tumor Natural Killer Cells on Tumor and Cardiac Microtissues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR) serves as an entry receptor for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and soluble PDGFR-Fc can neutralize HCMV at a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of about 10 ng/ml. While this indicates a potential for usage as an HCMV entry inhibitor PDGFR-Fc can also bind the physiological ligands of PDGFR (PDGFs), which likely interferes with the respective signaling pathways and represents a potential source of side effects. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that interference with PDGF signaling can be prevented by mutations in PDGFR-Fc or combinations thereof, without losing the inhibitory potential for HCMV. To this aim, a targeted mutagenesis approach was chosen. The mutations were quantitatively tested in biological assays for interference with PDGF-dependent signaling as well as inhibition of HCMV infection and biochemically for reduced affinity to PDGF-BB, facilitating quantification of PDGFR-Fc selectivity for HCMV inhibition. Mutation of Ile 139 to Glu and Tyr 206 to Ser strongly reduced the affinity for PDGF-BB and hence interference with PDGF-dependent signaling. Inhibition of HCMV infection was less affected, thus increasing the selectivity by factor 4 and 8, respectively. Surprisingly, the combination of these mutations had an additive effect on binding of PDGF-BB but not on inhibition of HCMV, resulting in a synergistic 260fold increase of selectivity. In addition, a recently reported mutation, Val 242 to Lys, was included in the analysis. PDGFR-Fc with this mutation was fully effective at blocking HCMV entry and had a drastically reduced affinity for PDGF-BB. Combining Val 242 to Lys with Ile 139 to Glu and/or Tyr 206 to Ser further reduced PDGF ligand binding beyond detection. In conclusion, this targeted mutagenesis approach identified combinations of mutations in PDGFR-Fc that prevent interference with PDGF-BB but maintain inhibition of HCMV, which qualifies such mutants as candidates for the development of HCMV entry inhibitors.","output":"Targeted mutagenesis on PDGFR-Fc identifies amino acid modifications that allow efficient inhibition of HCMV infection while abolishing PDGF sequestration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a fair allocation approach, this paper identifies and examines important concerns arising from the Philippines COVID\\\\19 response while focusing on difficulties encountered by various sectors in gaining fair access to needed societal resources.

We explore community responses and resilience through case study Quebrada Verde, Peru, a small rural community in the Andes Mountains. Specifically, we report on a qualitative examination involving in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key informants from the community, supplemented by relevant documentary analysis. Drawing on community resilience and social networks perspectives, we find that the community's preparedness to both threats is unbalanced. On one hand, the community eco-tourism system has developed sufficient tools to adapt to the temporary effects of COVID-19 derived from the community's self-organization skills and topophilia. Specifically, the community possesses a cohesive social structure, it has a solid cultural identity rooted in its customs and traditions, and maintains a social humour that enables it to see the positive aspects of adversity. On the other hand, the analysis of the measures towards strengthening the resilience to climate change delivers mixed results. In particular, the relationship that the community has built with other local organizations to successfully prevent and react to climate change is weak. Therefore, stronger efforts towards bridging this gap must be implemented in order to sustain the wider social network of such organizations, of which the community is a part. This would enable further development and implementation of appropriate risk management strategies to counteract climate change, enhancing the community's resilience of its eco-tourism system to this emergent threat.

Understanding the overall and differential impacts of disruption of nutritional (school feeding) services is critical for designing effective post-COVID-19 recovery policies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19-induced disruption of school feeding services on household food security in Nigeria. METHODS: We combined household-level, pre-COVID-19 in-person survey data with postpandemic phone survey data, along with local government area (LGA)-level information on access to school feeding services. We used a difference-in-difference approach and examined temporal trends in the food security of households with and without access to school feeding services. Of the sampled households, 83% live in LGAs with school feeding services. RESULTS: Households experienced an increase in food insecurity in the post-COVID-19 survey round. The share of households skipping a meal increased by 47 percentage points (95% CI: 44-50 percentage points). COVID-19-induced disruptions of school feeding services increased households' experiences of food insecurity, increasing the probability of skipping a meal by 9 percentage points (95% CI: 3-17 percentage points) and the likelihood of going without eating for a whole day by 3 percentage points (95% CI: 2-11 percentage points). Disruption of school feeding services is associated with a 0.2 SD (95% CI: 0.04-0.41 SD) increase in the food insecurity index. Households residing in states experiencing strict lockdown measures reported further deterioration in food insecurity. Single mothers and poorer households experienced relatively larger deteriorations in food security due to disruption of school feeding services.

Computed tomography images reveal that these children have abnormal inner ears in the form of a sac, with the semicircular canals missing or truncated. Little is known about how this inner ear abnormality affects central vestibular development. At present, mice with the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 mutation are the most common model for studying congenital vestibular disorders, despite forming multiple diverse inner ear phenotypes and inducing abnormal cerebellar and visual system development. To identify the effects of a sac-like inner ear on central vestibular development, we have designed and implemented a new model, the anterior-posterior axis rotated otocyst (ARO) chick, which forms a sac-like inner ear in 85% of cases. The ARO chick is produced by anterior-posterior rotation of the otocyst at embryonic day 2. Here, we describe for the first time the 15% of ARO chicks that form three small semicircular canals and rename the ARO chicks forming sacs (ARO/s chicks). The basic features of the vestibular sensory organs in ARO/s chicks are similar to those found in patients sacs, and ARO/s hatchlings experience balance and walking problems like patients. Thus, ARO/s chicks have a reproducible inner ear phenotype without abnormalities in vestibular-related structures, making the model a relatively simple one to evaluate the relationship between the sac-like inner ear pathology and formation of the central vestibular neural circuitry. Here, we describe unpublished details on the surgical approaches to produce ARO chicks, including pitfalls and difficulties to avoid. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This paper describes simple techniques for chick otocyst rotation resulting in a sac-like inner ear (85%), the common phenotype in congenital vestibular disorders. We now describe anterior-posterior axis rotated otocyst chicks, which form three small canals (15%), and rename chicks forming a sac (ARO/s chicks). Basic protocols and potential complications of otocyst rotation are described. With the use of ARO/s chicks, it will be possible to determine how the vestibular neural circuit is modified by sac-like inner ear formation.","output":"Implementing the chick embryo model to study vestibular developmental disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The diversification of virus can be attributed to random mutations leading to the development of drug resistance. The variations can be inherited from one generation to the other rendering the drug ineffective. However, a pharmacologically induced selection pressure can be countered by introducing drugs better adapted to work under rapid mutations. In this study we try to explore the effect of site directed and random substitution mutations simulated in the ligand binding region of SARS-CoV2 protease. Amongst six currently studied anti-protease drugs for COVID-19, Indinavir and Hydroxychloroquine were chosen for the study based on their high binding affinity scores, -6.81, and -4.81 respectively. The effect of mutations in protein-ligand binding was analysed in two steps. Initially, analysis of over 90 homologous protease and 100 SARS-CoV-2 orf1ab regions revealed un-conserved residues in the ligand binding sites. Gly170 and Thr190 were identified and interchanged with polar residues such as ARG, ASN and non-polar residues such as ALA, ILE. The resulting mutants were modelled, minimized and docked with Indinavir and Hydroxychloroquine. A higher binding affinity was observed for Indinavir;however, less variance in the binding affinity was observed for the latter. These results were consistent for random mutations as well. A Bio.seqIO based pipeline was build to simulate changes in the ligand binding site. Under the assumption that the ligand binding region has an equal probability of mutation over a given range for continuous distribution, 200 cycles of mutation was carried out in the nucleotide region corresponding to the ligand binding site. A paired t-test revealed a significant difference between the binding affinity of these mutant Indinavir and Hydroxychloroquine-protease complexes. Further, mean and variance was found to be higher for Indinavir-protease complex but Hydroxychloroquine displayed lesser variance pointing at a constant binding capability towards the mutant. Our study highlights the role of Hydroxychloroquine as a drug that can complement an evolving SARS-CoV2 main protease.","output":"Comparison of random and site directed mutation effects on the efficacy between lead SARS-CoV2 anti-protease drugs Indinavir and Hydroxychloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions worldwide since March 2020. The experience of the 1918 influenza pandemic demonstrated that decreases in the infection rates of COVID-19 do not guarantee continuity of the trend. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a precise spread model of COVID-19 with time-dependent parameters via deep learning to respond promptly to the dynamic situation of the outbreak and proactively minimize damage. METHODS: In this study, we investigated a mathematical model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning based on forward-inverse problems. We used data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University for Korea and the other countries, respectively. Because the data consist of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, we selected the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and found approximated solutions as well as model parameters. Specifically, we applied fully connected neural networks to the solutions and parameters and designed suitable loss functions. RESULTS: We developed an entirely new SIR model with time-dependent parameters via deep learning methods. Furthermore, we validated the model with the conventional Runge-Kutta fourth order model to confirm its convergent nature. In addition, we evaluated our model based on the real-world situation reported from the KCDC, the Korean government, and news media. We also crossvalidated our model using data from the CSSE for Italy, Sweden, and the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology and new model of this study could be employed for short-term prediction of COVID-19, which could help the government prepare for a new outbreak. In addition, from the perspective of measuring medical resources, our model has powerful strength because it assumes all the parameters as time-dependent, which reflects the exact status of viral spread.","output":"Real-World Implications of a Rapidly Responsive COVID-19 Spread Model with Time-Dependent Parameters via Deep Learning: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the framework of the, Mandatory Social Distancing the objective of this research was to survey and describe the perception about emotions, sociodemographic, institutional, psycho-physical, communication, leisure and study conditions of university students from public and private institutions Method: the application of a survey through a Google form and the Moodle platform, to 337 higher education students between 18 to 35 years old, males and females Preliminary results: Since the implementation of remote education is still in force, it is pertinent to make a brief assessment of the most frequent perceived emotions There are also references to some expectations and to the opinion regarding whether it is convenient to continue with this learning modality Preliminary conclusions: Such a novel situation that goes on over time, in a context of uncertainty and constant postponements, necessarily impacts on the psychological well-being and the evaluation of one's own freedoms Stress, worry and anxiety are some of the emerging perceptions in individuals who are still not very clear that distance learning is totally valid for them","output":"Emotional and Learning Perceptions due to Mandatory Social I Distancing by COVID-19 of University Students (Argentina)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uncertainties pervade our health choices, particularly in the context of a novel pandemic.

On the other hand, how patients are affected by these communications over time, particularly in the face of conflicting information, has received little attention. This is particularly important in the context a novel pandemic where uncertainty is rife and information changes over time. To fill this gap, we conducted an online study with UK participants on hypothetical communications relating to COVID-19 vaccines. Participants first read a vaccine announcement, which either communicated with certainty or uncertainty, and then received information which conflicted with the announcement. Those who were exposed to the certain announcement reported a greater loss of trust and vaccination intention than those who were exposed to the uncertain announcement. This shows that communicating with unwarranted certainty can backfire in the long-term, whereas communicating uncertainties can protect people from the negative impact of exposure to conflicting information.","output":"The negative consequences of failing to communicate uncertainties during a pandemic:The case of COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019, a pandemic of global concern, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has severely revealed the need for public monitoring and efficient screening techniques.

A home chemotherapy program was implemented between 2011 and 2019 in an Italian region. This pilot study investigates its safety and feasibility, along with parental satisfaction. METHODS: Patients between 0 and 18 years diagnosed with malignancy were included. Deceased patients and patients whose families moved abroad or interrupted contact with the service were excluded. Adverse events comprised immediate deterioration of the patients condition, equipment failure, errors in drug storage, dose or patient identification and personnel safety issues. Parental satisfaction was explored through an email survey of 32 Likert-type and short open questions. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients received 419 doses of intravenous chemotherapy at home (cytarabine, vincristine, vinblastine). No adverse events were reported. Twenty-three families out of 25 eligible completed the survey. Most reported being very satisfied with the possibility of maintaining a work/domestic routine and reducing time and financial burden of hospital access. Most were very satisfied with the opportunity for their child of being less troubled by the treatment. Besides, most reported being very satisfied with the chance for healthy siblings of maintaining their routine and coping with their brother/sisters disease. Most perceived the program as safe.

In two experimental sessions, we collected 55 healthy males resting EEG, their self-reported prosocial concern and values, and their incentivized prosocial behavior across different reward domains (money, time) and social contexts (collective, individual). By means of EEG microstate analysis we identified the temporal coverage of four canonical resting networks (microstates A, B, C, and D) and their mutual communication in order to examine their association with an aggregated index of prosociality. Participants with a higher coverage of microstate A and more transitions from microstate C to A were more prosocial. Our study demonstrates that temporal dynamics of intrinsic brain networks can be linked to complex social behavior.

DRG-based payment can be combined with other payment mechanisms to avoid unintended consequences of inadequate payment. The aim of this study was to analyze these other payment mechanisms for acute inpatient care across six countries (Germany, Denmark, England, Estonia, France, the United States [Medicare]). METHODS Information was collected about elements excluded from DRG-based payment, the rationale for exclusions, and payment mechanisms complementing DRG-based payment. A conceptual framework was developed to systematically describe, visualise and compare payment mechanisms across countries. RESULTS Results show that the complexity of exclusion mechanisms and associated additional payment components differ across countries. England and Germany use many different additional mechanisms, while there are only few exceptions from DRG-based payment in the Medicare program in the United States. Certain areas of care are almost always excluded (eg, certain areas of cancer care or specialized pediatrics). Denmark and England use exclusion mechanisms to steer service provision for highly complex patients to specialized providers. CONCLUSION Implications for researchers and policy-makers include: (1) certain areas of care might be better excluded from DRG-based payment; (2) exclusions may be used to incentivize the concentration of highly specialized care at specialized institutions (as in Denmark or England); (3) researchers may apply our analytical framework to better understand the specific design features of DRG-based payment systems.","output":"How Denmark, England, Estonia, France, Germany, and the USA Pay for Variable, Specialized and Low Volume Care: A Cross-country Comparison of In-patient Payment Systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The repurposing of colchicine for the treatment of COVID-19 was suggested based in its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral properties.

The four-component lipid nanoparticle synthetic delivery systems consisting of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and a PEG-conjugated lipid, assembled by microfluidic or T-tube technology, have been extraordinarily successful for delivery of mRNA to provide Covid-19 vaccines. Recently, we reported a one-component multifunctional sequence-defined ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimer (IAJD) synthetic delivery system for mRNA relying on amphiphilic Janus dendrimers and glycodendrimers developed in our laboratory. Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers consist of functional hydrophilic dendrons conjugated to hydrophobic dendrons. Co-assembly of IAJDs with mRNA into dendrimersome nanoparticles (DNPs) occurs by simple injection in acetate buffer, rather than by microfluidic devices, and provides a very efficient system for delivery of mRNA to lung. Here we report the replacement of most of the hydrophilic fragment of the dendron from IAJDs, maintaining only its ionizable amine, while changing its interconnecting group to the hydrophobic dendron from amide to ester. The resulting IAJDs demonstrated that protonated ionizable amines play dual roles of hydrophilic fragment and binding ligand for mRNA, changing delivery from lung to spleen and/or liver. Replacing the interconnecting ester with the amide switched the delivery back to lung. Delivery predominantly to liver is favored by pairs of odd and even alkyl groups in the hydrophobic dendron. This simple structural change transformed the targeted delivery of mRNA mediated with IAJDs, from lung to liver and spleen, and expands the utility of DNPs from therapeutics to vaccines.","output":"Targeted Delivery of mRNA with One-Component Ionizable Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fossil-fuelled climate crisis brings risk and uncertainty, whereas solutions would bring safety and sustainability.

Several COVID-19 guidelines included age as an explicit factor and practices of both triage and 'anticipatory triage' likely limited access to hospital care for elderly patients, especially those in care homes. To ensure the legitimacy of triage guidelines, which affect the public, it is important to engage the public's moral intuitions. Our study aimed to explore general public views in the UK on the role of age, and related factors like frailty and quality of life, in triage during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants generally accepted the need for triage but strongly rejected 'fair innings' and 'life projects' principles as justifications for age-based allocation. They were also wary of the 'maximise life-years' principle, preferring to maximise the number of lives rather than life years saved. Although they did not arrive at a unified recommendation of one principle, a concern for three core principles and values eventually emerged: equality, efficiency and vulnerability. While these remain difficult to fully respect at once, they captured a considered, multifaceted consensus: utilitarian considerations of efficiency should be tempered with a concern for equality and vulnerability.

Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.

Covid myocarditis Conclusion: It is apparent that STEMI in covid-19 infected patients is not the same disease process as STEMI that without covid-19 infection. Patients with STEMI and covid-19 have a higher risk of heart failure, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, greater intracoronary thrombosis and stent thrombosis, resulting in higher cardiac and non-cardiac mortality. Aggressive antithrombotic treatment is recommended. Even in the covid era it is essential to insist on timely treatment of STEMI. Training of cardiac catheterization personnel on how to use personal protective equipment as well as vaccination are crucial to limit the risk of acquiring infection.

The occurrence of ARDS in COVID 19 patients is thought to occur secondary to an exaggerated immunologic response. In this meta-analysis, we aim to comprehensively study the various levels of immunological parameters in patients with COVID 19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and medRxiv with the search terms, \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"Interleukin\\". The outcome of interest was prognosis in COVID 19 patients. RESULTS: We performed meta analysis of 16 studies. Higher counts of CD4 and CD8 with Lower Levels of TNF-a, IL2R, IL6, IL8 were observed on patients with good prognosis compared to patients with poor prognosis; -0.57 (pg/mL) (-1.10, -0.04, p = 0.04), (I2 91%, p < 0.001); -579.84 (U/mL) (-930.11, -229.57, p < 0.001), (I2 96%, p < 0.001); -1.49 (pg/mL) (-1.97, -1.01, p < 0.001), (I2 94%, p < 0.001); -0.80 (pg/mL) (-1.21, -0.40, p < 0.001), (I2 79%, p < 0.001); -2.51 (pg/mL) (-3.64, -1.38, p < 0.00001), (I2 98%, p < 0.001) respectively.

Blood clots occluding branches of the pulmonary artery (PA) are traditionally considered to originate from thrombi in deep veins (usually in legs). However, growing evidence suggests that occlusion of the vessels in the lungs can develop without preceding deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In this work, we used an inferior vena cava (IVC) complete ligation model of DVT in Wistar rats to explore the possibility and mechanisms of PA thrombosis under the conditions where all routes of thrombotic mass migration from peripheral veins are blocked. We demonstrate that rats both with normal and reduced neutrophil counts developed thrombi in the IVC, although, neutropenia caused a substantial decrease in thrombus size and a shift from fresh fibrin toward mature fibrin and connective tissue inside the thrombus. Massive fibrin deposition was found in the PA branches in the majority of DVT rats with normal neutrophil counts, but in none of the neutropenic animals. Neutrophil ablation also abolished macroscopic signs of lung damage. Altogether, the results demonstrate that thrombi in the lung vasculature can form in situ by mechanisms that require local neutrophil recruitment taking place in the DVT setting.","output":"Neutrophils Mediate Pulmonary Artery Thrombosis In Situ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a serious concern in the medical community and has resulted in an unprecedented psychological impact on health care workers (HCWs), already working under high stress levels. The viral infection expanded internationally and World Health Organization announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify and measure the effects of this pandemic on anxiety levels and sleep disturbance and the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) among the HCWs in India. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study using piloted structured questionnaires with self-reported responses from 368 volunteer males and females HCWs from India. Study participants were identified through social networking sites: Facebook and WhatsApp. The degree of symptoms of anxiety, sleep quality and the availability of PPE was assessed by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale, Single Sleep Quality scale and questions on availability of PPE. RESULTS: Majority of the study subjects were in the age group 45-60 years and 52.2% were doctors. Severe anxiety scores (GAD>10) were observed in 7.3%; moderate, mild and minimal anxiety was observed in 12.5%, 29.3% and 50.8% HCWs respectively, and 31.5% had poor to fair sleep scores (<6). Univariate analysis showed female gender and inadequate availability of PPE significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (P= 0.01 and 0.01). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with age<30 years (P=0.04) and inadequate PPE (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that poorer quality of sleep was associated with higher anxiety levels (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has potentially caused a significant level of anxiety and sleep disturbance amongst HCWs, associated with female gender, younger age group, and availability of inadequate PPE, which puts HCWs at constant risk of contracting the infection themselves or transmitting it to their families. Early detection of at-risk HCWs and institution of situation-tailored mitigation measures will enable alleviation of the risk of long term, serious psychological sequelae as well as reduce HCWs' current anxiety.","output":"The \\"Wounded Healer\\" - Anxiety and Sleep Disturbance Amongst Healthcare Workers Facing COVID-19 Pandemic in India: A Cross-sectional Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital-based surveillance for adverse events was conducted on healthcare workers after they received the first dose of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine.

METHODS: Two groups of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively screened on the basis of plasma sodium level at admission: hyponatremic (sodium < 135 mM, n = 92) or normonatremic (sodium &#8805; 135 mM, n = 198) patients. Pearson's chi-2 (qualitative variables) and Student's T tests (quantitative variables) were used to compare the two groups. A multiple logistic regression model was used to explore the association between patients' clinical data and outcomes. RESULTS: Hyponatremia was frequent but generally mild. There were more male patients in the hyponatremic group (p = 0.014). Pulmonary lesions on the first thoracic CT-scan performed during hospitalization were significantly more extensive in the hyponatremic group (p = 0.010). ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death were significantly more frequent in hyponatremic compared to normonatremic patients (37 versus 14%; p < 0.001; 17 versus 6%; p = 0.003; 18 versus 9%, p = 0.042, respectively). Hyponatremia was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes (adjusted Odds-ratio: 2.77 [1.26-6.15, p = 0.011]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed an independent relationship between hyponatremia at admission and transfer to ICU, use of mechanical ventilation or death in COVID-19 patients.

Small animal models mirroring SARS-CoV-2 human disease are essential for medical countermeasure (MCM) development. Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promotor. In contrast to non-transgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to two different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals revealed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the lower dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice with 60% surviving infection whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared to female mice. This is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2. The K18-hACE2 murine model will be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the assessment of MCMs.","output":"Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe and fatal respiratory disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structure of synthetic mRNAs as used in vaccination against cancer and infectious diseases contain specifically designed caps followed by sequences of the 5 untranslated repeats of -globin gene. The strategy for successful design of synthetic mRNAs by chemically modifying their caps aims to increase resistance to the enzymatic deccapping complex, offer a higher affinity for binding to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (elF4E) protein and enforce increased translation of their encoded proteins. However, the cellular homeostasis is finely balanced and obeys to specific laws of thermodynamics conferring balance between complexity and growth rate in evolution. An overwhelming and forced translation even under alarming conditions of the cell during a concurrent viral infection, or when molecular pathways are trying to circumvent precursor events that lead to autoimmunity and cancer, may cause the recipient cells to ignore their differential sensitivities which are essential for keeping normal conditions. The elF4E which is a powerful RNA regulon and a potent oncogene governing cell cycle progression and proliferation at a post-transcriptional level, may then be a great contributor to disease development. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis manly inhibits the elF4E to proceed with mRNA translation but disturbance in fine balances between mTOR and elF4E action may provide a premature step towards oncogenesis, ignite pre-causal mechanisms of immune deregulation and cause maturation (aging) defects.","output":"Synthetic mRNAs; Their Analogue Caps and Contribution to Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Drosophila, nutrient status is sensed by the fat body, a functional homolog of mammalian liver and white adipocytes. The fat body conveys nutrient information to insulin-producing cells through humoral factors which regulate Drosophila insulin-like peptide levels and insulin signalling. Insulin signalling has pleiotropic functions, which include the management of growth and metabolic pathways. Here, we report that Edem1 (endoplasmic reticulum degradation-enhancing &#945;-mannosidase-like protein 1), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein involved in protein quality control, acts in the fat body to regulate insulin signalling and thereby the metabolic status in Drosophila Edem1 limits the fat body-derived Drosophila tumor necrosis factor-&#945; Eiger activity on insulin-producing cells and maintains systemic insulin signalling in fed conditions. During food deprivation, edem1 gene expression levels drop, which aids in the reduction of systemic insulin signalling crucial for survival. Overall, we demonstrate that Edem1 plays a vital role in helping the organism to endure a fluctuating nutrient environment by managing insulin signalling and metabolic homeostasis.","output":"Edem1 activity in the fat body regulates insulin signalling and metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 emerged in late 2019 and quickly became a serious public health problem worldwide. This study aimed to determine the average length of stay, occupancy bed rate and bed turnover rate for COVID-19 patients in Monastir university hospital between the 1st October 2020 and 28th february 2021. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that enrolled all hospitalizations for COVID19 in Monastir University hospital, the unique third level healthcare in this region, between the 1st October 2020 and 28th february 2021. The following indicators: the average length of stay, the occupancy bed rate and the bed turnover rate were calculated during the study period. RESULTS: We included 762 hospitalizations for COVID-19 during the study period. The average age of our population was 64,22 years (standard deviation= 14,17). Male predominance was noted with sex ratio=1,63. The median length of stay was significantly longer in the intensive care unit (ICU) than in the other departments (11 (7;16) days, versus 7(2;14) days), p = 0.008. The average number of beds available for COVID-19 patients during the study period was 13 in the ICU and 65 in the other wards. The bed turnover rate and the bed occupancy rate per month were respectively 2,66 patient/bed/month and 96,26% in the ICU versus 1,74 patient/bed/month and 62,26% in the other wards. The occupancy bed rate in the ICU exceeded the 100% during the outbreak of January and February 2021 (129,72% and 120,66% respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the efforts by the health services and social isolation measures in Tunisia, this study highlighted the saturation of our health system with an overload in intensive care units.

The occupancy bed rate, exceeding 100% in ICU, highlighted the health system collapse in managing COVID-19 patients.","output":"Health system saturation in managing COVID-19 patients in Monastir, Tunisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency department 2 days after ingestion of 50 castor beans. Her symptoms on admission were vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, agitation and anxiety. Initial laboratory tests showed a slightly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and mild liver and kidney dysfunction The patient was transferred to the medium care unit of our hospital where she was observed for possible organ failure. During the next days the kidney function improved and liver function started to recover. Four days after admission, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward. Urine, serum, plasma and whole-blood samples were analyzed for ricinine using a quantitative LC-MS-MS method. Initial values on admission (serum and urine) were very high in comparison with previously reported cases. Based on these values, the patient was monitored closely in the following days. The patient made a full recovery and during the course of hospitalization, concentrations of ricinine in plasma/serum, blood and urine gradually declined. The presence of ricinine in a patient's blood or plasma is proof of castor bean, hence, ricin exposure. However, based on this case and previous reported cases in literature, we can conclude that no clear correlation can be established between ricinine blood, plasma or urine levels and the severity of the intoxication. Clinicians should be aware of the potential danger of a ricin intoxication and patients should be monitored closely for several days due to the unpredictable outcome of the intoxication.","output":"Non-Lethal Intoxication by Ingestion of 50 Castor Beans: Serial Measurement of Ricinine in Blood, Plasma, and Urine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Set in the context of higher education, this paper focuses on professional development-related challenges faced by teachers and specifically how these difficulties have been exacerbated by the recent Work-From-Home policy. The study investigates how the integration of social media into educators professional development plans can support tutors in this new status quo and prepare them for similar situations in the future. A systematic review of literature, based on a methodological instrument called PRISMA, identified 28 relevant articles for detailed analysis from an initial pool of 65. This revealed that social media-enabled professional development should be promoted across universities. The benefits include social medias potential to provide tutors with a bespoke experience, that is specific to their evolving needs. Also notable, is social medias potential to clear physical and temporal hurdles, resulting in a significantly more extensive professional learning network. This leads to faculty who are likely to reap the benefits of networked learning, by using social media as the infrastructure through which to establish a higher volume of more geographically dispersed connections to like-minded individuals. Institutions will need to tackle hurdles, namely faculty resistance to using this novel platform, as well as the anxiety of participating in open online spaces.

This study assessed the readiness of pharmacists to receive, recommend and administer COVID-19 vaccines to clients in Nigeria. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which responses were collected from pharmacists in Nigeria through Google Form link. A 21-item questionnaire was developed and validated for the study. The link was shared on the WhatsApp groups of eligible respondents. The response was downloaded into Microsoft Excel (2019) and cleared of errors. This was uploaded into KwikTables (Beta Version 2021) for data analysis. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were used to describe the data. Chi-squared test was used to determine the relationship between all the responses and the practice areas of the pharmacists. Results A total of 509 pharmacists responded to the study, but 507 indicated their areas of practice. The highest response of 247(48.7%) was obtained from hospital pharmacists, then community pharmacists;157(31.0%). Hospital and community pharmacists accounted for 96 and 66 of the 191(37.7%) pharmacists that would probably accept the vaccine (p=0.126).

Factors such as increased social media exposure, weight gain memes, and peer conversations about appearance during lockdown might be the potential contributing factors, which need further exploration. The study examined the contribution of 'fat talk' and societal influences in determining body dissatisfaction among Indian women. The likely content of the 'fat talk' during the lockdown was also analyzed. METHODS The study followed a cross-sectional online based design. Participants comprised of 265 women, aged 15 to 50 years. The Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ-8c), Sociocultural Attitudes toward Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ-3), and Negative Body Talk Scale were used to measure body satisfaction, societal influences, and fat talk respectively. Further, participants were asked to respond to a friend's comment about her supposed weight gain in the pandemic (fat talk). RESULTS Fat talk, social influence, weight, and age were significantly correlated with body dissatisfaction. Multiple Regression models indicated that fat talk, social influence, weight, and age accounted for 53.33% of the variance in body satisfaction. Thematic analysis of responses to fat-talk conversations revealed two dominant themes: focus on exercise and diet, as well as acknowledging weight gain and normalizing it in the context of the pandemic. CONCLUSION Fat talk amongst peers, societal influence and body-image stereotypes were the most potent contributors in determining body dissatisfaction among Indian women during the pandemic, which can contribute to significant dysfunction.

METHODS: We performed a prospective longitudinal cohort study evaluating SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) IgG positivity along with consistent clinical symptoms in patients with IBD receiving infliximab or vedolizumab. Serum was also obtained following immunization with approved vaccines. The IgG antibody to the spike protein binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was assayed with a fluorescent bead-based immunoassay that takes advantage of the high dynamic range of fluorescent molecules using flow cytometry. A sensitive and high-throughput neutralization assay that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein onto a lentivirus and measures pseudoviral entry into ACE2-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells was used. RESULTS: There were 436 patients enrolled (mean age, 17 years, range 2C26 years; 58% male; 71% Crohns disease, 29% ulcerative colitis, IBD-unspecified). Forty-four (10%) of enrolled subjects had SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG antibodies. Compared to non-IBD adults (ambulatory) and hospitalized pediatric patients with PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, S-RBD IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in the IBD cohort and by 6 months post infection most patients lacked neutralizing antibody. Following vaccination (n = 33), patients had a 15-fold higher S-RBD antibody response in comparison with natural infection, and all developed neutralizing antibodies to both wild type and variant SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The lower and less durable SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG response to natural infection in IBD patients receiving biologics puts them at risk of reinfection.

Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein and a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute infection phase samples. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection cohort. Seroprevalence in a 'positive patient contacts' group (n=177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2% and the 'random selected' general population group (n=311) was reduced up to 45% reduction relative to S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and post-infection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection but that responses against N appear to wane in the post-infection phase while those against S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and post-infection phases used the native S protein trimer as binding antigen that has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe that these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.","output":"Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike versus Nucleoprotein Antibody Responses Impact the Estimates of Infections in Population-Based Seroprevalence Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For sustainable electrification of surface transportation, a viable charging infrastructure is necessary.

Many estimators use filtered data as input to compensate for fluctuations of reported cases. However, for daily-based estimations, this filtering leads to delays. Some approaches use small window sizes for filtering to overcome this issue. This, in turn, leads to an increased periodic behavior of estimators. To overcome these issues, in the present paper, we introduce an estimator for the reproduction number that uses an acausally filtered number of cases as input, hence avoiding both the periodic behavior and the delay. For the filter size, we suggest using a multiple of one week since reported cases often exhibit a weekly pattern. We show that this approach is more robust against periodicities, and that it does not exhibit any delays in the estimation compared to estimators with smaller filter sizes. Moreover, often it is hard to examine estimators in detail because a ground truth is missing. For analyzing different properties of the estimators, we propose a method to generate synthetic datasets that can be taken as ground truths. Importantly, the synthetic data contains all relevant real-world behavior. Finally, we apply the proposed estimator to the publicly available COVID-19 data for Germany. We compare the proposed estimator to two estimators used by the federal German Robert Koch Institute (RKI). We observe that our estimator is more stable than the benchmarks especially if the reproduction number is close to 1.

Here, the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in modulating the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) content in confluent primary human aortic endothelial cells (pHAECs) was investigated. TNF promoted an up to 2 folds increase in cellular cholesterol, which was resistant to ACAT inhibition. The cholesterol increase was associated with increased (125)I-LDL surface binding. Using the non-hydrolysable label, Dil, TNF could induce a massive increase in Dil-LDL by over 200 folds. The elevated intracellular Dil-LDL was blocked with excess unlabeled LDL and PCSK9, but not oxidized LDL (oxLDL), or apolipoprotein (apoE) depletion. Moreover, the TNF-induced increase of LDL-derived lipids was elevated through lysosome inhibition. Using specific LDLR antibody, the Dil-LDL accumulation was reduced by over 99%. The effects of TNF included an LDLR cell surface increase of 138%, and very large increases in ICAM-1 total and surface proteins, respectively. In contrast, that of scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) was reduced. Additionally, LDLR antibody bound rapidly in TNF-treated cells by about 30 folds, inducing a migrating shift in the LDLR protein. The effect of TNF on Dil-LDL accumulation was inhibited by the antioxidant tetramethythiourea (TMTU) dose-dependently, but not by inhibitors against NF-B, stress kinases, ASK1, JNK, p38, or apoptosis caspases. Grown on Transwell inserts, TNF did not enhance apical to basolateral LDL cholesterol or Dil release.

The survey consisted of two parts: sociodemographic and clinical data, and COVID-19 related data. Participants also filled out the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) - a well validated, self-questionnaire instrument. T-test for independent samples was used to evaluate the differences between the genders.ResultsOut of the initially sent 563 surveys, a total of 161 were included in further analyses (28.6% response rate). Mean age of the sample was 42.210.2 and 65.2% of the participants were female. Mean scores on DASS-21 were as follows: 8.786.66 on depression, 9.787.39 on anxiety and 7.767.14 on stress.

Whether such benefits apply to RTIs of viral origin and mechanisms supporting the effect remain unclear. AIM: To determine the role of gut microbiota modulation on clinical and laboratory outcomes of viral RTIs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles published in Embase and MEDLINE through 20 April 2020 to identify studies reporting the effect of gut microbiota modulation on viral RTIs in clinical studies and animal models. The incidence of viral RTIs, clinical manifestations, viral load and immunological outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: We included 58 studies (9 randomized controlled trials; 49 animal studies). Six of eight clinical trials consisting of 726 patients showed that probiotics administration was associated with a reduced risk of viral RTIs. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus followed by Bifidobacterium and Lactococcus. In animal models, treatment with probiotics before viral challenge had beneficial effects against influenza virus infection by improving infection-induced survival (20/22 studies), mitigating symptoms (21/21 studies) and decreasing viral load (23/25 studies). Probiotics and commensal gut microbiota exerted their beneficial effects through strengthening host immunity. CONCLUSION: Modulation of gut microbiota represents a promising approach against viral RTIs via host innate and adaptive immunity regulation.

Policies of health organizations for healthcare workers are inconsistent, with a change in policy in the US for universal face mask use. The aim of this study was to review the evidence around the efficacy of masks and respirators for healthcare workers, sick patients and the general public. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials on use of respiratory protection by healthcare workers, sick patients and community members was conducted. Articles were searched on Medline and Embase using key search terms. RESULTS: A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this study - 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used different interventions and outcome measures. In the community, masks appeared to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both together are more protective. Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also suggest a benefit, and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings. Trials in healthcare workers support the use of respirators continuously during a shift.

Currently, COVID19 has brought a secondary wave within U.S., India, Brazil and other parts of the world. However, its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear from the medical, mathematical and pharmaceutical aspects. Classical Suspect-Infection-Recovery model has limitations to describe the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it becomes necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infected cases in U.S. In this article, a dynamic model called RLIM based on classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections with a dynamic secondary infection rate  in assumption. An intermediate state called SI is introduced between recovery and infection statues to record the number of secondary infected cases from a latent period of recovery. Compared with other models, RLIM fits historical recovery cases and utilizes them to predict future infections. Because RLIM utilizes multiple information sources, and provides error back propagation schematics, it is reasonable to assert that its predictions are more accurate and persuasive. Projections of four U.S. COVID19 states show that with the secondary infectious rate  varies from 0.01 to 0.3 within a latent period of 14 days chosen, RLIM can predict the newly infected number from January 15 to February 15, 2021 with AFER lower to 14%.

METHOD A transversal epidemiological survey was conducted on a randomly selected sample of the above practitioners between June and July 2008. The percentage of patients presenting on a routine working day with open a cutaneous lesion of any origin, location, size and duration was assessed. All local and systemic care performed on the patient during that day because of the wound was also recorded. RESULTS In total, 475 GPs, 453 specialists and 238 nurses participated (n=1166) and saw a total of 29 663 patients, of whom 3037 presented with one or more cutaneous wound. The overall non-weighted prevalence of patients with a wound was 10.2% (95%CI: 9.9%;10.6%). This prevalence was similar for GPs (6.0%) and for specialists (6.9%), but was higher for nurses (22.0%). Forty-three per cent of all wounds had a duration of over 6 weeks. These chronic wounds were predominantly leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers or pressure ulcers, but also included wounds of all aetiologies. For 33% of all patients with wounds, the impact on their health status was serious to severe. The overwhelming majority of wounds (95%) required local care, including in 65% of cases cleansing and debridement. CONCLUSION Despite its limitations, this initiative, the first of its type in France, strongly suggests that wound care constitutes an important part of routine care given by health professionals in the community, and for a substantial number of these patients, wounds represent a serious morbidity.

Low socioeconomic status and other social determinants have been discussed as possible causes for the higher burden in African American communities compared with white communities. Beyond the social determinants, the biochemical mechanism that predisposes individual subjects or communities to the development of excess and serious complications associated with COVID-19 infection is not clear. Virus infection triggers massive ROS production and oxidative damage. Glutathione (GSH) is essential and protects the body from the harmful effects of oxidative damage from excess reactive oxygen radicals. GSH is also required to maintain the VD-metabolism genes and circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)VD). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is necessary to prevent the exhaustion and depletion of cellular GSH. X-linked genetic G6PD deficiency is common in the AA population and predominantly in males. Acquired deficiency of G6PD has been widely reported in subjects with conditions of obesity and diabetes. This suggests that individuals with G6PD deficiency are vulnerable to excess oxidative stress and at a higher risk for inadequacy or deficiency of 25(OH)VD, leaving the body unable to protect its oxidative immune-metabolic physiological functions from the insults of COVID-19. An association between subclinical interstitial lung disease with 25(OH)VD deficiencies and GSH deficiencies has been previously reported. We hypothesize that the overproduction of ROS and excess oxidative damage is responsible for the impaired immunity, secretion of the cytokine storm, and onset of pulmonary dysfunction in response to the COVID-19 infection. The co-optimization of impaired glutathione redox status and excess 25(OH)VD deficiencies has the potential to reduce oxidative stress, boost immunity, and reduce the adverse clinical effects of COVID-19 infection in the AA population.","output":"The potential link between inherited G6PD deficiency, oxidative stress, and vitamin D deficiency and the racial inequities in mortality associated with COVID-19()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with opioid use disorders are overrepresented in correctional facilities, and are at high risk of opioid overdose.

Study 1 with a student sample in Hong Kong revealed that greater fluctuations of perceived stress associated with COVID-19 were correlated with greater emotional variability, especially when the intensity of stress was high. Study 2 with a community sample in mainland China replicated the findings. It further revealed that the moderating effect of stress intensity was not significant when the stressor was not specified, suggesting the specificity of psychological impact of the pandemic. The present research highlights the importance of understanding the nuanced role of different stressors in shaping individuals' emotional experiences during the pandemics.","output":"Dynamics of Stress and Emotional Experiences During COVID-19: Results From Two 14-Day Daily Diary Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Abnormal movements in Covid-19 patients have been reported with varying degree of frequency, prompting neurologic consultation and additional diagnostic evaluation. We sought to evaluate the frequency and etiology of abnormal movements among hospitalized Covid-19 patients undergoing neurologic consultation. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the first 50 consecutive patients with confirmed Covid-19 hospitalized at our tertiary medical care center who underwent acute inpatient neurology consultation from March 2020 through May 2020. Indication for neurologic consultation and diagnostic studies performed were identified by electronic medical record review. RESULTS: Of the 50 initial consultation requests, 11 (22.0%) patients were evaluated for abnormal movements (nine male and two female). Myoclonus was diagnosed in 6/11 (54.5%) patients. Additionally, two patients were diagnosed with seizures (confirmed on EEG in one), while two additional patients were diagnosed with tremor (physiologic and probable functional). A single case of serotonin syndrome was also identified. CONCLUSION: Abnormal movements observed in hospitalized Covid-19 patients can have a wide range of etiologies and were a frequent initial indication for neurologic consultation. Myoclonus was the most frequent type of abnormal movement observed. Early clinical recognition and directed diagnostic work-up is essential for accurate diagnoses in these patients.","output":"Abnormal movements in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide.

The optimal duration of DAPT after PCI remains controversial at present. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy and safety of short-term DAPT in patients undergoing PCI. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of science from inception to September 2019 were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials were included to compare short term (3 months or less) with a standard 12-months DAPT in patients undergoing PCI. Random effect model and fixed effect model wereused to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each endpoint. This meta-analysis included 38479 patients undergoing PCI from 8 randomized clinical trials. No difference was observed in the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80-1.06, P = 0.25), cardiovascular death (RR 0.88, 0.69-1.12, P = 0.29), myocardial infarction (RR 1.05, 0.94-1.19, P = 0.38), definite or probable stent thrombosis (RR 1.05, 0.80-1.36, P = 0.73), and stroke (RR 1.02, 0.80-1.30, P = 0.89) between short term and standard DAPT.

Consequently, few descriptive studies from this region are available. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 infection in Gabon, from March to June 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center, cross-sectional study of 837 patients with COVID-19 was conducted from March to June 2020 in the Armed Forces Hospital in Libreville, Gabon. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Demographic and clinical characteristics and imaging findings of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 837 patients enrolled, 572 (68.3%) were men, and 264 (31.5%) were women (male to female ratio, 2:1); the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 35 (30-45) years (mean [SD] age, 38.0 [12.2] years. The mortality rate associated with COVID-19 was low (1.4%). Of these 837 patients, 524 (62.6%) were categorized as having no symptoms, 282 (33.7%) as having mild symptoms, and 31 (3.7%) as having severe symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms were older (mean [SD] age, 46.1 [14.7] years) than patients with mild symptoms (mean [SD] age, 41.3 [12.5] years) and those with no symptoms (mean [SD] age, 35.7 [11.3] years) (Kruskal-Wallis (2)(2) = 53.5; P < .001). History of diabetes was the principal risk factor associated with both severe symptoms in 5 of 31 patients (16.1%) and mild symptoms in 11 of 282 (3.9%) compared with no symptoms in 5 of 524 (0.9%) (Pearson (2)(2) = 30.9; P < .001).

This study assessed the psychological status of healthcare workers who were exposed to different risk-levels in China and explored the factors that affected their mental health. METHODS: Demographic, occupational characteristics, and mental health measurements were collected from 810 workers in 41 hospitals in China, through online questionnaires from February 11 to March 3, 2020. The degree of symptoms for fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia were assessed using the Chinese versions of the Fatigue Severity Scale, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health symptoms. RESULTS: All 810 participants completed the relevant questionnaires without missing data. The prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms was 74.3, 73.7, and 61.7%, respectively. Nurses, women, and workers exposed to high-risk areas were more likely to report mental health problems (P < 0.05). After controlling for confounders, exposure to high-risk areas was independently associated with increased symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia (fatigue among high-risk areas: OR, 3.87; 95% CI, 2.26C6.61; P < 0.001; anxiety among high-risk areas: OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.58C4.51; P < 0.001; insomnia among high-risk areas: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.68C4.79, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated significant differences in psychological symptoms among healthcare workers exposed to different levels of risk, and those in high-risk areas were more vulnerable to experiencing mental health symptoms.

Objective: To determine whether social isolation, in Brazil, led to higher signs of psychological distress, and which intra- and inter-psychic variables mediated this effect. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) in isolated individuals, loneliness activates distancing and escape-avoidance coping strategies with intensities that are directly correlated with symptoms of anxiety and common health disorders;2) in isolated individuals, poor reliance on social support coping strategies increase the effects of loneliness on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders;3) in isolated individuals, External Entrapment moderates the effects of loneliness such that the higher the feelings of entrapment, the higher the effects of loneliness on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders. 4) in both isolated and non-isolated individuals, intense reliance on positive reappraisal coping strategies decrease (moderate) the effects of information consumption on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders. No a priori hypothesis on the specific nature of the subjective experiences of social isolation were established. We proposed that the semantic field of social isolation should present a complex and multidimensional nature. Design: Two phases of web-based surveys were applied to participants between May 25th 2020 and August 19th 2020. Setting: Brazilian participants responded surveys on the web. Participants: For Phase 1, 440 participants responded to the survey. Participants were a volunteer sample of Brazilian nationality and above 18 years old. For Phase 2, a sub-sample of 55 participants was drawn from the pool of the first phase. Main outcomes and measures: For Phase 1, the primary endpoint was score in the SRQ-20 scale (an instrument to screen symptoms of common mental disorders), and the secondary endpoint was score in an anxiety scale that screened feelings of anxiety related to illness and medical procedures. Results: For Phase 1, 51% of the sample reported leaving the house less than once a week during the period of the research, 27.6% reported leaving the house 1-2 times per week, 9.8% reported leaving the house 3-4 times per week, and 11.6% reported leaving the house every day. Using SRQ-20, we found that 76.9% of the female respondents and 58.0% of the male respondents that reported leaving their houses less than once a week showed clinically significant symptoms, while these proportions fell below 65% for females and 44% for males that reported leaving their houses more than 3 times per week. Reliance on escape/avoidance as well as distancing coping strategies were significant mediators of the effect of isolation-induced loneliness. We did not find support for the hypothesis that reliance on social support coping strategies significantly altered the effects of social isolation-induced loneliness on psychological distress, nor for the hypothesis that external entrapment moderated the effects of loneliness. We also found that the impact of reliance on positive reappraisal coping strategies on the relationship between frequency of media use for COVID-19-related information and psychological distress depended on the type of media, with individuals which sought information from print or online newspapers, social networks, and podcasts at higher frequencies consistently showing more psychological distress;however, higher levels of positive reappraisal coping strategies increased this impact instead of decreasing it. In Phase 2 (qualitative survey), 47.3% of the sample reported leaving the house less than once a week during the period of the research, 21.8% reported leaving the house 1-2 times per week, 10.9% reported leaving the house 3-4 times per week, and 20% reported leaving the house every day. At the qualitative survey we found that individuals interpreted isolation as producing self-assessme t with protective and introspective dimensions, but also ruminative and emotional experiences of distress. Conclusions and relevance: Our results reveal that social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased psychological distress at clinically relevant rates, with loneliness being an important predictor of this effect. We also found that escape-avoidance and distancing coping strategies mediated this effect. Psychological distress was also related to high consumption of COVID-19-related information in social networks, print or online newspapers, and podcasts, but that relying on positive reappraisal coping strategies increased this effect instead of decreasing it. Our results suggest the need for policies that diminish the impact of social isolation on mental health;the need to assess and teach alternative coping strategies in clinical settings;and the need to address the impact of Internet-based sources.","output":"COVID-19, social isolation, and psychological distress in a Brazilian sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and study aims The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major disruption in the healthcare system This study determined the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on the number and outcome of patients hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in Hong Kong Patients and methods Records of all patients hospitalized for UGIB in Hong Kong public hospitals between October 2018 and June 2020 were retrieved The number and characteristics of patients hospitalized for UGIB after COVID-19 was compared by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model prediction and historical cohort Results Since the first local case of COVID-19, there was an initial drop in UGIB hospitalizations (observed 29 8 vs predicted 35 5 per week;P = 0 05) followed by a rebound (39 8 vs 26 7 per week;P Conclusions There was a dynamic change in the number of patients hospitalized for UGIB in Hong Kong during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, with more obvious impact during the initial phase only","output":"Impact of first wave of COVID-19 on outcomes of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Hong Kong: a population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The aim of this systematic review was to describe the incidence and mortality of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma in Spain.

The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated and statistical heterogeneity was measured using the I(2) index. A random-effects model was used to perform the meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of the data. RESULTS Thirty-two papers were included in the systematic review. The crude incidence rate for basal cell carcinoma was 113.05 (95% CI, 89.03-137.08) cases per 100 000 person-years for the studies based on the registration methodology normally used by registries (in which only 1 tumor with histological confirmation is counted per person). However, the same incidence rate calculated on the basis of clinical and histologic criteria and counting tumors rather than individual patients was 253.23 (95% CI, 273.01-269.45) cases per 100 000 person-years.

African Americans are more likely to contract COVID-19, develop complications and die from the virus. Amid the growing research on COVID-19, this manuscript pays particular attention to African American women who are disproportionately represented as 'essential' or frontline workers, yet often lack job security and risk contagion. Faced with limited testing centers, they are also at risk of having their symptoms minimized or dismissed by medical practitioners even when they show visible symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: Using the theoretical framework of intersectionality developed by scholars like Kimberl Crenshaw and Patricia Hill Collins, this manuscript examines the impact of COVID-19 on African American women. It emphasizes that African American women are vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the twin legacies of racism and sexism. Intersectionality theory espouses that racism and sexism often combine with social determinants of health such as economic stability and socio-environmental factors to shape health outcomes. Within the context of COVID-19, this work underscores that African American women are susceptible to the virus due to their higher likelihood of co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. They are also likely to face eviction and homelessness if they are laid off or furloughed as a result of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This manuscript asserts that decades of racism and discrimination have isolated communities of color and made them particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus. As many African American women deal with unemployment or continue to work as 'essential workers', the intersectionality framework sheds light on the continued legacies of racism and sexism. It asserts that targeted policy interventions are needed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 and lessen the devastating impact(s) it has had on African American communities.","output":"'Essential and undervalued: health disparities of African American women in the COVID-19 era'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess the patterns and trends of influenza and pneumonia-attributed deaths among cancer patients in the United States.

The primary endpoint of the study is standardized mortality rate (SMR; calculated as observed/Expected (O/E) ratio for death from influenza and pneumonia among cancer patients). Competing risk analysis was additionally conducted to evaluate the impact of age on influenza/pneumonia-attributed deaths among selected tumor types. RESULTS The current study evaluates a total of 3,579,199 cancer patients (diagnosed 1975-2016) within the SEER-9 registries; and influenza and pneumonia-attributed deaths represent 1.5% of the recorded deaths for this cohort. SMR for influenza/pneumonia-attributed death within the first year following cancer diagnosis was 1.88 (1.83-1.94); while SMR for influenza/pneumonia-attributed death following the first year was 1.11 (1.10-1.12). Within the first year following cancer diagnosis, SMR from influenza/pneumonia was higher among individuals with black race (SMR for white race: 1.75 (95% CI: 1.69-1.81) while SMR for black race: 2.90 (95% CI: 2.65-3.16), lung cancer (SMR for lung cancer: 4.39 (95% CI: 4.11-4.69)), head and neck cancer (SMR for oral cavity/pharynx cancer: 4.02 (95% CI: 3.50-4.59)), lymphomas (SMR for lymphoma: 3.28 (95% CI: 2.92-3.68)), leukemias (SMR for leukemia: 3.32 (95% CI: 2.89-3.80)) and myeloma (SMR for myeloma: 3.91 (95% CI: 3.28-4.63)).

The topic has been of interest for the local researchers and physicians for over two decades. The objective of this narrative review was to provide an overview of the research activities in the area from 2000 to early 2021. METHODS: We performed a narrative literature review. The search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different research topics on schistosomiasis and the national control programme, and included grey literature. RESULTS: A total of 159 articles was screened, and 42 were included into the review in addition to the grey literature. During the past two decades, the work on schistosomiasis originated from five out of the nine provinces of the country, with diverse aspects of the disease investigated; including immunology, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment. Several studies investigated various aspects of schistosomiasis-related morbidity in the respective study populations. The body of work demonstrates that much effort was made to understand the details of the host immune response to schistosomiasis, and the immune profile changes induced in patients treated with praziquantel. Although some MDA campaigns were conducted in the country; little, however, is known on the epidemiological situation of the disease, particularly of its distribution within the population, as well as co-infections with other parasitic diseases also endemic in the area. CONCLUSION: Progress has been made over the past two decades in the understanding of schistosomiasis in the country, including disease-related morbidity and its interaction with other parasitic infections, and the immunology and epidemiology of the disease. However, for optimising control of the disease, there is a need to fine-tune these findings with detailed local epidemiological and malacological data. We call for such studies to accomplish the knowledge of schistosomiasis in the country, particularly in areas of moderate or high endemicity, and recommend this approach to comparable schistosomiasis-endemic areas elsewhere.","output":"Schistosomiasis in Gabon from 2000 to 2021 - A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock around the world Manufacturing sectors are among the hardest hit As the initial negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic start to recede, the manufacturing sectors must work collaboratively to develop strategies for transition to much more sustainable and resilient industries These circumstances have created a number of research opportunities in sustainability science and engineering This technical note discusses challenges and research needs in the effort to introduce new aspects to enhance existing sustainability metrics systems and to develop powerful decision analysis and decision-making methodologies and tools for reshaping technology innovations Copyright ? 2020 by ASTM International, 100 Barr Harbor Drive, PO Box C700, West Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959","output":"Reinforcing sustainability assessment and reshaping technology innovation for highly sustainable manufacturing in the PostCCOVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17C25) with a prediction interval of 3%C67% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31% (95% CI 26%C37%, prediction interval 24%C38%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95% CI 0.10C1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.","output":"Occurrence and transmission potential of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: A living systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the stress experienced by emergency medicine physicians working in emergency departments during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the factors they stated to be effective against stress, and their coping approaches to stressful situations. Materials and Methods: The study was designed in a general screening model, and 200 emergency medicine physicians participated via e-mail who work in emergency departments in Turkey. The sources of stress related to the pandemic, the factors that they find effective in combating stress, and their strategies to cope with stress were investigated with relation to their gender, marital status, after-shift accommodation, manner of working in a shift, smoking behavior, having a chronic disease, having children, and spouse's job as a healthcare professional. Results: While the primary source of stress of emergency medicine physicians during the pandemic was the risk of transmitting the virus to their families, the most influential factor in combating stress was leisure activities. Emergency physicians' approaches to coping with stress were significantly predicted by the variables of using full personal protective equipment while working, having an adequate sleep and resting opportunities, obtaining additional economic income, and not knowing the pandemic's end date. Conclusion: Emergency medicine physicians used active problem-oriented approaches, and among these, they used the social support seeking approach the most during the pandemic. It is necessary to provide social support, take precautions to care for healthcare workers' families and arrange emergency physicians' shifts to allocate their time to their leisure activities appropriately to reduce stress.","output":"Emergency Medicine Physicians' Approaches to Coping with Stress in COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States has more confirmed deaths from coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) than any other country in the world.

FINDINGS: 91 patients were included between March and August 20 20. NPS and saliva viral loads were correlated (r = 0.315, p = 0.01). Symptomatic patients had significantly higher NPS and saliva viral loads than asymptomatic patients. Serial NPS and saliva viral load measurements showed that the log(10) NPS (r = ?0.532, p < 0.001) and saliva (r = ?0.417, p < 0.001) viral loads for all patients were inversely correlated with the days from symptom onset with statistical significance. Patients with cough, sputum, and headache had significantly higher saliva, but not NPS, viral loads. Higher saliva, but not NPS, viral loads were associated with total lymphopenia, CD3 and CD4 lymphopenia (all p < 0.05), and were inversely correlated with total lymphocyte (r = ?0.43), CD3 (r = ?0.55), CD4 (r = ?0.60), CD8 (r = ?0.41), B (r = ?0.482), and NK (r = ?0.416) lymphocyte counts (all p < 0.05).

In addition, the appearance of effective therapies for GD1 (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT and later substrate reduction therapy, SRT) has shifted the paradigm of care, and recommendations for GD management should now include strategies for patients without treatment, long-term treated patients, reproductive health, and transition of care from children to adults. Here we present the results of a Delphi survey on the follow-up of GD patients in specific clinical situations in Spain. Sixteen face-to-face meetings with experts were held to discuss daily clinical practice and to identify controversies regarding the management of GD. With this information, a questionnaire with 93 recommendations for different clinical scenarios was designed, and a Delphi survey among 86 physicians with experience in GD patient care was conducted. Results show consensus in 73 out of the 93 items. Recommendations on follow-up of adult and pediatric patients were in line with current guidelines, and underscored the importance of a patient-tailored approach. For the follow-up of stable patients receiving long-term treatment, consensus was reached on the importance of multidisciplinary team collaborating with the expert physician in GD, and specialists with GD knowledge (nurses, primary care, specialized radiologists, etc.), when required. Consensus was reached on the frequency of follow-up depending on the disease evolution time, whether or not patients received treatment, clinical disease stability, and specific recommendations for pregnant patients were also stated. Experts stressed on the importance of asking about symptoms reflecting quality of life such as pain, use of analgesics, antidepressants, etc. Lastly, recommendations on how to adapt GD management during a COVID-19 pandemic were collected.

We describe a framework that has been used to prioritise therapeutic research in previous pandemics which could be used to progress clinical pharmacology and therapeutics research in COVID\\\\19. This is particularly relevant as discussion has already moved on from antiviral therapeutics, to delineating the treatment of the host from treatment and elimination of the infective agent. Focussing on the host brings together three concepts; host treatment, the damage response framework and therapeutic repurposing. The integration of these three areas play to the traditional strength of pharmaceuticals in providing a period of stabilization to permit time for the development of novel anti\\\\viral drugs and vaccines. In integrating approaches to repurposing, host treatment and damage response we identified three key properties that a potentially effective repurposed drug must possess by way of a framework. There must be homology i.e. the same or similar relation, with the pathogenesis of the disease, ideally targeted to the conserved pathophysiological outcomes of the viral attack, have a defined locus within the spectrum from prevention to severe disease and draw upon the historical dose and safety experience of the repurposed drug.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how social media has altered the foci and methods in public health research remains lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine research themes, the role of social media, and research methods in social mediaCbased public health research published from 2000 to 2018. METHODS: A dataset of 3419 valid studies was developed by searching a list of relevant keywords in the Web of Science and PubMed databases. In addition, this study employs an unsupervised text-mining technique and topic modeling to extract research themes of the published studies. Moreover, the role of social media and research methods adopted in those studies were analyzed. RESULTS: This study identifies 25 research themes, covering different diseases, various population groups, physical and mental health, and other significant issues. Social media assumes two major roles in public health research: produce substantial research interest for public health research and furnish a research context for public health research. Social media provides substantial research interest for public health research when used for health intervention, human-computer interaction, as a platform of social influence, and for disease surveillance, risk assessment, or prevention. Social media acts as a research context for public health research when it is mere reference, used as a platform to recruit participants, and as a platform for data collection. While both qualitative and quantitative methods are frequently used in this emerging area, cutting edge computational methods play a marginal role.

Currently, observations within US contexts are lacking; therefore, we report on the rapid implementation of telepsychiatry and workflow experiences in a psychiatric practice based within a large health care system in southeast Texas with a national catchment area. We discuss the logistics of the implementation, including modes of communication, scheduling, coordination, and capacity; the psychological effects of web-based services, including both the loss of the physical therapeutic environment and the unique interpersonal dynamics experienced in the virtual environment; and postadoption patterns of engagement with our services and with other clinical functions affected by the rapid adaptation to telemedicine. Our art therapy group programming serves as an applied case study, demonstrating the value of a well-managed web-based program (eg, patients were receptive and well-engaged, and they appreciated the continuity of accessible service) as well as the challenges (eg, the need for backup plans and technological fallbacks, managing interruptions and telecommunication learning curves, and working around the difference in resources for art and music therapy between a well-stocked clinical setting versus clients' home spaces). We conclude from our experience that the overall strengths of telepsychiatry include receptive and well-engaged responses from patients as well as the expansion of boundaries, which provides a directly contextualized view into patients' home lives. Challenges and corresponding recommendations include the need for more careful safety planning for high-risk patients; maintaining professional boundaries in the newly informal virtual setting; designing the physical space to both frame the patient encounter and maintain work-life balance for the therapist; allowing for delays and interruptions (including an initial acclimation session); and preserving interprofessional care team collaboration when the physical locations that normally facilitate such encounters are not accessible.

No approved/proper therapeutics is currently available which can effectively combat this outbreak. Several attempts have been undertaken in the search of effective drugs to control the spread of SARS CoV-2 infection. The main protease (Mpro), key component for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein, is considered to be one of the important drug targets for treating COVID-19. Various phytochemicals, including polyphenols and alkaloids, have been proposed as potent inhibitors of Mpro. The alkaloids from leaf extracts of Justicia adhatoda have also been reported to possess anti-viral activity. But whether these alkaloids exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is far from clear. To explore this in detail, we have adopted computational approaches. Justicia adhatoda alkaloids possessing proper drug-likeness properties and two anti-HIV drugs (lopinavir and darunavir; having binding affinity -7.3 to -7.4 kcal/mol) were docked against SARS CoV-2 Mpro to study their binding properties. Only one alkaloid (anisotine) had interaction with both the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro and exhibited good binding affinity (-7.9 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns) revealed that Mpro-anisotine complex is more stable, conformationally less fluctuated; slightly less compact and marginally expanded than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complex. Even the number of intermolecular H-bonds and MM-GBSA analysis suggested that anisotine is a more potent Mpro inhibitor than the two previously recommended antiviral drugs (lopinavir and darunavir) and may evolve as a promising anti-COVID-19 drug if proven in animal experiments and on patients.","output":"Identification of alkaloids from Justicia adhatoda as potent SARS CoV-2 main protease inhibitors: An in silico perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Persistent symptoms after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome(PCS).

Methods: Consecutive patients with persistent symptoms 3 months after an acute COVID-19 were prospectively evaluated at a multi-disciplinary PCS unit. All patients were screened for IST and those with confirmed criteria underwent comprehensive CV examination: ECO, 24h Holter (assessment of the cardiac autonomic function), QoL Questionnaire (MLHFQ), six-min walking test (6MWT) and blood sample with inflammation and myocardial biomarkers. Two control patients, matched by age and gender, were assigned to each case: one with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection without PCS (group 2,recovered asymptomatic) and one without prior COVID (group 3,uninfected). Results: IST were met in 43/200 PCS patients (21%) being more common in young (mean age 39y) woman (91%) without clinical history and with mild COVID (not requiring hospital admission during the acute phase).

Objective The aim of this study was to assess the risk perception and behavioral response of teachers to COVID-19 in Gamo zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods The study was conducted in Gamo zone from February to march, 2021. An Institution-based-cross sectional study design was employed and multi stage sampling technique was utilized to select 634 study participants. The data were collected using Kobo collect survey tool through interviewer administered questionnaire. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 25. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factor associated with risk perception and behavioral response. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the level of significance;in multivariable analysis, variables with a P value less than 0.05 with 95% confidence interval were considered as statistically significant. Results About 79.1% and 75.1% of the teachers had high risk perception and good protective behavior, respectively. Having children ((AOR=1.84, 95% CI: 1.15C2.94), COVID-19 update (AOR=3.7, 95% CI: 1.66C8.59) and good protective behavior (AOR= 1.98, 95% CI: 1.18C3.34) were associated with high risk perception.

Conclusion Although majority of the teachers had good protective behavior, some protective measures were not frequently adopted. There were few individuals who had low risk perception;this could be a potential cause for the occurrence of school outbreak.

Due to limited evidence, guidance on appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures such as the wearing of face masks varied. Here, we applied whole virus genome sequencing (WvGS) to analyse transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-acquired (HA) COVID-19. METHODS: An investigation was undertaken for all HA cases of COVID-19 from March to April 2020. Fifty SARS-CoV-2 samples were analysed by WvGS and their phylogenetic relationship established. RESULTS: WvGS identified transmission events previously undetected by epidemiological analysis and provided evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between healthcare workers (HCW) and patients and among HCW themselves. The majority of HA COVID-19 cases occurred in patients highly dependent on nursing care, suggesting the likely route of transmission was by close contact or droplet, rather than aerosol, transmission. Mortality among HA COVID-19 infections was recorded as 33%. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs to patients. Interventions including comprehensive screening of HCWs for COVID-19 symptoms, PCR testing of asymptomatic HCWs upon identification of HA cases and implementation of universal use of surgical masks for all clinical care is indicated to prevent viral transmission.

In this context, global vaccination campaigns of companion animals, as well as wildlife reservoirs vaccination, are key factors to achieve the Zero by 30 plan that pursues the eradication of dog-mediated human rabies by 2030. Rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) play an essential role in the disease protection, as it correlates with an adequate immune response and allows evaluating pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis efficacy. Hence, counting with reliable, accurate, and robust serological tests is of paramount importance. Currently, RFFIT and FAVN are the gold standard VNAs tests recommended by both the WHO and the OIE. Despite these methodologies are efficient and widely used, they present several drawbacks, as they are less easily to standardize and require the use of live rabies virus, containment facilities, and skilled professionals. Thus, in this review, we describe the state-of-the-art of alternative analytical methodologies currently available for rabies serology, with novel approaches based on pseudotyped recombinant viruses and emphasizing in the antigen binding methodologies that detect and quantify antibodies against the rabies glycoprotein. We discussed the wide range of assays that are interesting tools for a faster measurement of anti-rabies glycoprotein antibodies and, in some cases, less complex and more versatile than the gold standard methods. Finally, we discussed the key issues during the design and optimization steps of ELISA assays, highlighting the importance of validation and standardization procedures to improve rabies serology tests and, as a consequence, their results. KEY POINTS: ? An exhaustive revision of rabies serology testing was made. ? No rabies serology assay can be thought as better than others for all intents and purposes. ?

We aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of the residents in Eastern Ethiopia toward COVID-19. Method: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on May 1C30, 2020 among the residents of Dire Dawa, Eastern Ethiopia. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire on the awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices toward COVID-19. We used random sampling to select the participants. Data was entered into the statistics and data (STATA) version for data cleaning and analysis. Binary logistic regression models with 95% CI were used to conduct bivariable [crude odds ratio (COR)] and multivariable [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)] analyses. Result: A total of 415 community residents responded to the questionnaire. Of those participants, 52.5% (95% CI 47.7C57) had adequate knowledge, 31.6% (95% CI 27C36) had favorable attitudes, and 49% (95% CI 45C50) had good practice toward the precautionary measures of COVID-19. Adequate knowledge had a significant association with urban residence (AOR = 5, 95% CI 3.1C8.4) and literacy (AOR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.5C6.7). Good preventions practices had a significant association with place of residence (AOR = 4.1, 95% CI 2.3C7.2), literacy (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1,2C7.4), adequate knowledge (AOR = 3.5, 95% CI 2.3C5.8), and favorable attitude (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.4C3.8) about the disease.

Methods: A retrospective study of COVID-19 pneumonia patients in the Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, was conducted. Serial assessments, including pulmonary volumes (TLC), spirometry (VC, FVC, FEV1), pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO, DLCO/VA), and chest high-resolution CT were collected 3 months after discharge. Results: Forty-six patients completed the serial assessments. There were 38 non-severe and 8 severe cases. Abnormalities were detected in pulmonary function tests in 17 patients (37.8%). One (2.2%), 2 (4.3%), and 17 (37.8%) patients had FEV1/FVC ratio, TLC, and DLCO values less than 80% of predicted values, respectively. Twenty-eight patients (60.9%) had abnormal CT findings.

METHODS: The United States opioid mortality rate was compared in states and District of Columbia that had implemented marijuana legalization with states that had not, by applying joinpoint methodology to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Variables included race/ethnicity and fentanyl-type opioids (fentanyls). RESULTS: After the same rates during 2010-2012, the opioid mortality rate increased more rapidly in marijuana-legalizing than non-legalizing jurisdictions (2010-2020 annual pairwise comparison pa?=a?0.003 for all opioids and pa?=a?0.0004 for fentanyls). During the past decade, all four major race/ethnicities in the U.S. had evidence for a statistically-significant greater increase in opioid mortality rates in legalizing than non-legalizing jurisdictions. Among legalizing jurisdictions, the greatest mortality rate increase for all opioids was in non-Hispanic blacks (27%/year, pa?=a?0.0001) and for fentanyls in Hispanics (45%/year, pa?=a?0.0000008). The greatest annual opioid mortality increase occurred in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with non-Hispanic blacks having the greatest increase in legalizing vs. non-legalizing opioid-death-rate difference, from 32% higher in legalizing jurisdictions in 2019 to more than double in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Instead of supporting the marijuana protection hypothesis, ecologic associations at the national level suggest that marijuana legalization has contributed to the U.S.'s opioid epidemic in all major races/ethnicities, and especially in blacks. If so, the increased use of marijuana during the 2020-2022 pandemic may thereby worsen the country's opioid crisis.","output":"United States marijuana legalization and opioid mortality epidemic during 2010-2020 and pandemic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pharmacy workers in Bangladesh play an important role in managing pregnancy complications by dispensing, counselling and selling drugs to pregnant women and their families. This study examined pharmacy workers' drug knowledge and practice for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (PE/E) management, including antihypertensives and anticonvulsants, and determine factors associated with their knowledge. METHODS A cross-sectional survey with 382 pharmacy workers in public facilities (government) and private pharmacies and drug stores assessed their knowledge of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs. 'Pharmacy workers' include personnel who work at pharmacies, pharmacists, family welfare visitors (FWVs), sub-assistant community medical officers (SACMOs), drug storekeepers. Exploratory and multivariate logistic models were used to describe association between knowledge of medicines used in pregnancy and demographic characteristics of pharmacy workers. RESULTS Overall, 53% pharmacy workers interviewed were drug store owners in private pharmacies while 27% FWVs/SACMOs, who are government service providers also work as drug prescribers and/or dispensers in public facility pharmacies. Majority of pharmacy workers had poor knowledge compared to correct knowledge on both antihypertensive (77.8% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001) and anticonvulsant drugs (MgSO4) (82.2% vs 17.8%; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed SACMOs and FWVs were greater than 4 times more likely to have correct knowledge on anti-hypertensives (AOR = 4.2, 95% CI:1.3-12.3, P < 0.01) and anticonvulsant drugs (AOR = 4.9, 95% CI:1.3-18.1, P < 0.01) compared to pharmacists. Pharmacy workers who had received training were more likely to have correct knowledge on antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs than those who had no training. CONCLUSIONS Pharmacy workers' knowledge and understanding of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs, particularly for prevention and management of PE/E is limited in Bangladesh. Most pharmacies surveyed are private and staffed with unskilled workers with no formal training on drugs. Expansion of maternal and newborn health programs should consider providing additional skills training to pharmacy workers, as well as regulating these medicines at informal pharmacies to mitigate any harmful practices or adverse outcomes of unauthorized and incorrectly prescribed and used drugs.

This study aimed to assess the nutritional status (NS) and its association with IHFD among reproductive-age-group women along with exploring the perspectives of the stakeholders regarding inequitable food distribution. Materials and methods The quantitative part of the convergent parallel mixed-methods design study was conducted among 150 WRA, selected by cluster random sampling from 15 slum areas of Hooghly District, between December 2020 and May 2021. Data were collected using a predesigned pretested schedule with anthropometric measurements. IHFD was quantified by the relative dietary energy adequacy ratio (RDEAR). Ordinal logistic regression was performed to obtain adjusted-proportional odds ratios (aPOR) for higher categories of NS (underweight: reference category). Stratified subgroup analysis was done to assess the influencers of IHFD. For the qualitative part, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight purposively selected in-laws of study participants, and the data were interpreted by thematic analysis. Results The mean age of the study participants was 28.66.3 years. The proportion of malnutrition and inequitable IHFD (RDEAR<1) among them was 50% and 46%, respectively. Higher categories of NS were found to be significantly associated with an increase in RDEAR (aPOR=22.6, 95% CI: 2.75-185.45, p-value=0.004). Among underweight and normal NS women, those who were earning members and directly involved in food preparation/production had a greater allocation of food within their households. Physiological intolerance, incapacity of earning, and traditional customs were the most recurring themes transcribed as the barriers to equitable food distribution.

To date, the list of animal species susceptible to astrovirus infection has expanded to 22 animal species or families, including domestic, synantropic and wild animals, avian, and mammalian species in the terrestrial and aquatic environments. Astrovirus infections are considered among the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children, second only to rotavirus infections, but in animals their association with enteric diseases is not well documented, with the exception of turkey and mink astrovirus infection. Genetic variability has been described in almost all astrovirus species sufficiently examined infecting mammals and birds; however, antigenic variability has been demonstrated for human astroviruses but is far less investigated in animal viruses. Interestingly, there is an increasing evidence of recombination events occurring in astroviruses, which contributes to increase the genetic variability of this group of viruses. A wide variety of species infected, the evident virus genetic diversity and the occurrence of recombination events indicate or imply either cross-species transmission and subsequent virus adaptation to new hosts or the co-infection of the same host with different astroviruses. This can also favor the emergence of novel astroviruses infecting animals or with a zoonotic potential. After more than 30years from their first description in humans, there are many exciting streams of research to be explored and intriguing questions that remain to be answered about the relatively under-studied Astroviridae family. In the present work, we will review the existing knowledge concerning astrovirus infections in humans and animals, with particular focus on the molecular biology, interspecies transmission and zoonotic potential of this group of viruses.","output":"Astrovirus infections in humans and animals C Molecular biology, genetic diversity, and interspecies transmissions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Children and young adults were initially reported as largely spared from severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the impact to this population has been significant Methods: This observational retrospective cohort study includes 420 symptomatic children and young adults with lab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated between March 15 and June 16, 2020 at Children's National Hospital in Washington DC We identified and compared cohorts of non-hospitalized (N=324) and hospitalized (N=96) patients, including non-critically ill (N=64) and critically ill hospitalized (N=32) patients Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records Results: Of 420 SARS-CoV-2-infected symptomatic patients, 23% required hospitalization, of which 67% were non-critically ill and 33% were critically ill All age groups were represented in the symptomatic cohort, with a median age of 8 6 years Patients &gt; 15 years of age represented 44% of critical care admissions Males and females were equally represented in all cohorts Underlying medical conditions were present in 36%, but more common in hospitalized (59 %) and critically ill (66 %) patients The most frequent underlying diagnosis overall was asthma (16 %), but also included neurologic (6 %), diabetes (3 %), obesity (3 %), cardiac (3 %), hematologic (3 %) and oncologic (1 %) conditions The majority (66 %) of SARSCoV- 2 infected patients presented with respiratory symptoms with or without fever Other symptoms were also present, including diarrhea/vomiting (21 %), myalgia (11 %), chest pain (8 %) and loss of sense of smell or taste (7%) Hospitalized patients required varying levels of respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation, BiPAP, RAM cannula and HFNC Additional presentations included diabetic hyperglycemia, sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis, vascular complications, and multisystem inflammation Treatment included remdesivir, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab and other therapies Conclusion: Although children/young adults have been less affected than elderly adults, the impact of SARS-CoV2 on this population has been significant in Washington DC and informs other regions anticipating their surge","output":"Severe COVID-19 in children and young adults in the Washington DC metropolitan region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A unique feature of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 is the dramatic elevation of IL-10.

The purpose of this study is to test the mediated effect of self-efficacy in the relationship between vulnerable personality and postpartum depression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with pregnant women aged 20 years from February to April 2021 in Zhengzhou, China. We recruited 587 pregnant women, and 429 pieces of data were available. The demographic characteristics questionnaire, General Self efficacy Scale (GSES) and Vulnerable Personality Style Questionnaire (VPSQ) were distributed in the prenatal survey. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to screen postpartum depression symptoms at one month through WeChat and telephone follow-up. A mediated model was constructed to explain the relationship of variables and test the mediated effect of self-efficacy. RESULTS: The valid questionnaires were 429 (effective response rate: 90.7%). The vulnerable personality and low self-efficacy were related to postpartum depression (all P< 0.01). The self-efficacy of pregnant women was inversely associated with vulnerable personality (= ?0.415) and postpartum depression (= ?0.216). The vulnerable personality and self-efficacy can explain 29.0% of the variation in postpartum depression. It was confirmed that a partial mediating effect of self-efficacy accounted for 18.0% (0.090/0.501) of the total effect. CONCLUSION: Maternal self-efficacy partly mediates the relationship between vulnerable personality traits and postpartum depression.

The prevalence of RV species among HIV-infected children in South Africa is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses, including RV species, associated with HIV status and other clinical symptoms in children less than two years of age with and without ALRI in Pretoria, South Africa. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 105 hospitalized ALRI cases and 53 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR, and RV species and genotypes were identified by semi-nested PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were more common among ALRI cases than controls (83.8% vs. 69.2%; p = 0.041). RV was the most commonly identified virus in cases with pneumonia (45.6%) or bronchiolitis (52.1%), regardless of HIV status, as well as in controls (39.6%). RV-A was identified in 26.7% of cases and 15.1% of controls while RV-C was identified in 21.0% of cases and 18.9% of controls. HIV-infected children were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia than bronchiolitis (p < 0.01). RSV was not identified in any HIV-infected cases (n = 15) compared with 30.6% of HIV-uninfected cases (n = 85, p = 0.013), and was identified more frequently in bronchiolitis than in pneumonia cases (43.8% vs. 12.3%; p < 0.01).

During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it a long period of social isolation resulting in a change of behavior patterns and in return, the presentation of fractures to our local hospitals. The effects of this global pandemic on the presentation and management of clavicles were noted with particular interest to the change in mechanism and its future implications. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal observational study in 10 hospitals in the North West of England, reviewing all patients presenting with a clavicle fracture during six weeks in the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic and compared these with the same time period in 2019. Collection points included the patient demographics, fracture characteristics, mechanism of injury and management. RESULTS: A total of 427 clavicle fractures were assessed with lower numbers of patients presenting with a clavicle fracture during the COVID-2020 period (n=177) compared with 2019 (n=250). Cycling related clavicle fractures increased three fold during the pandemic compared to the 2019 control group. We also noted an overall increase in clavicle fractures resulting from higher energy trauma as opposed to low energy or fragility fracture. We also found a faster time to surgery in the COVID cohort by 2.7 days on average when compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Government restrictions and the encouragement of social distancing led to behavioral changes with a vast increase in cyclists on the road. This created a significant rise in clavicle fractures related to this activity. This is likely to be further driven by the Government pledge to double cyclists on the road by 2025 in the United Kingdom.(5) We forecast that this increase in cyclists, a behavior change accelerated by the pandemic, is a reliable predictor for future trauma trends.","output":"The COVID CLAVICLE Study: A predictor of future trauma trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Discussions about the recently identified deadly coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 are common around the globe now.

This study shows that three doses of the same synthetic peptide vaccine eliciting an exclusive CD8+ T cell response against one SARS-CoV-2 Spike epitope protected all mice against lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, while only a second vaccination with this T cell vaccine was insufficient to provide protection. The third vaccine dose of the single T cell epitope peptide resulted in superior generation of effector-memory T cells in the circulation and tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, and these tertiary vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells were characterized by enhanced polyfunctional cytokine production. Moreover, fate mapping showed that a substantial fraction of the tertiary effector-memory CD8+ T cells developed from remigrated TRM cells. Thus, repeated booster vaccinations quantitatively and qualitatively improve the CD8+ T cell response leading to protection against otherwise lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and spike protein are crucial for viral replication and transmission. Spike protein recognizes the human ACE2 receptor and transmits SARS-CoV-2 into the human body. Thus, Mpro, spike protein, and ACE2 receptor act as appropriate targets for the development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Spices are traditionally known to have anti-viral and immune-boosting activities. Therefore, we investigated the possible use of selected spice bioactives against the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational analysis. METHODS: Molecular docking analysis was performed to analyze the binding efficiency of spice bioactives against SARS-CoV-2 target proteins along with the standard drugs. Drug-likeness properties of selected spice bioactives were investigated using Lipinski's rule of five and the SWISSADME database. Pharmacological properties such as ADME/T, biological functions, and toxicity were analyzed using ADMETlab, PASS-prediction, and ProTox-II servers, respectively. RESULTS: Out of forty-six spice bioactives screened, six bioactives have shown relatively better binding energies than the standard drugs and have a higher binding affinity with at least more than two targets of SARS-CoV-2. The selected bioactives were analyzed for their binding similarities with the standard drug, remdesivir, towards the targets of SARS-CoV-2. Selected spice bioactives have shown potential drug-likeness properties, with higher GI absorption rate, lower toxicity with pleiotropic biological roles. CONCLUSIONS: Spice bioactives have the potential to bind with the specific targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Therefore, spice-based nutraceuticals can be developed for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Culinary spice bioactives as potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2: Computational investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China's manufacturing employees are confronted with unprecedent occupational and innovation challenges caused by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis coupled with the pressure of being replaced by digital technologies.

Responding to their call to address why patients were so effective in making long Covid visible and igniting action to improve its care, we use narrative inquiry - a field of research that investigates the place and power of stories and storytelling. We analyse a large dataset of narrative interviews and focus groups with 114 people with long Covid (45 of whom were healthcare professionals) from the United Kingdom, drawing on socio-narratology (Frank), therapeutic emplotment (Mattingly) and polyphonia (Bakhtin). We describe how storytelling devices including chronology, metaphor, characterisation, suspense and imagination were used to create persuasive accounts of a strange and frightening new condition that was beset with setbacks and overlooked or dismissed by health professionals. The most unique feature of long Covid narratives (in most but not all cases) was the absence, for various pandemic-related reasons, of a professional witness to them. Instead of sharing their narratives in therapeutic dialogue with their own clinician, people struggled with a fragmented inner monologue before finding an empathetic audience and other resonant narratives in the online community. Individually, the stories seemed to make little sense. Collectively, they provided a rich description of the diverse manifestations of a grave new illness, a shared account of rejection by the healthcare system, and a powerful call for action to fix the broken story. Evolving from individual narrative postings to collective narrative drama, long Covid communities challenged the prevailing model of Covid-19 as a short-lived respiratory illness which invariably delivers a classic triad of symptoms; undertook and published peer-reviewed research to substantiate its diverse and protracted manifestations; and gained positions as experts by experience on guideline development groups and policy taskforces.","output":"Long Covid - The illness narratives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus reportedly called 2019-nCoV started to spread around the world at the end of 2019.

However, older age is generally associated with better emotional well-being, despite increased likelihood of negative events (e.g. death of a spouse) with age. This study examined whether age moderated the relation between COVID-19 worries and mental health. METHODS: A national sample of U.S. adults (N = 848; aged 18-85 years) completed an online survey from March 30 to April 5, 2020. The survey assessed anxiety, depression, general concern about COVID-19, perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, social distancing, self-quarantining, current mood, health, and demographics. RESULTS: Older age was associated with better mental health (i.e. lower levels of anxiety and depression). Greater perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 was related to higher anxiety. However, this effect was moderated by age. At younger ages (18-49 years), the positive association between perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and anxiety was significant, but the association was not significant at older ages (50+ years).

In this respect, SIR epidemiological models, which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand and predict the collective emergent response. The present contribution addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model, suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training, and that further data are still required to achieve convergent -- and therefore reliable -- predictions.","output":"Simulation of Covid-19 epidemic evolution: are compartmental models really predictive?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutton is known as a source of fat Too much fat can cause high blood pressure and hypertension which is more vulnerable to get infected by COVID-19 This study has a purpose to observe if there is a correlation between meat consumption and the number of COVID cases in the USA and China This study is a quantitative type method with secondary data as a sample The samples are divided into two groups, report of mutton consumption, and report of positive coronavirus cases The result shows that the total import number of mutton does not have any negative impact on COVID cases Rather, the total number of imports itself could reduce the number of active case It can be concluded that the higher the total number of mutton imports, the lower of active case of COVID-19 ? 2020 EManuscript Technologies All rights reserved","output":"More meat, more covid-19 cases? comparative study between usa and china in importing mutton"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pain is a significant health concern for children living with cerebral palsy (CP).

Three hydrophilic amide prodrugs of celecoxib, celecoxib succinamidic acid (CSA), celecoxib maleamidic acid (CMA), and celecoxib acetamide (CAA) were synthesized and characterized for solubility and lipophilicity. In vitro melanin binding to natural melanin (Sepia officinalis) was estimated for all three prodrugs. In vitro transport studies across isolated bovine sclera and sclera-choroid-RPE (SCRPE) were performed. Prodrug with the highest permeability across SCRPE was characterized for metabolism and cytotoxicity and its in vivo transscleral delivery in pigmented rats. Aqueous solubilities of CSA, CMA, and CAA were 300-, 182-, and 76-fold higher, respectively, than celecoxib. Melanin binding affinity and capacity were significantly lower than for celecoxib for all three prodrugs. Rank order for the % in vitro transport across bovine sclera and SCRPE was CSA > CMA ~ CAA ~ celecoxib, with the transport being 8-fold higher for CSA than celecoxib. CSA was further assessed for its metabolic stability and in vivo delivery. CSA showed optimum metabolic stability in all eye tissues with only 10-20% conversion to parent celecoxib in 30 min.

Apart from the above vaccination controls, it is also assumed that the average of contagion contacts can be controlled via intervention measures, such as confinements or isolation measures, social distance rules, use of masks, mobility constraints, etc. The main objectives of the paper are the achievement of a strictly decreasing infection for all time periods and that of the susceptible individuals over the initial period if they exceed the disease-free equilibrium value. The monitoring mechanism is the combined activation of intervention measures to reduce the contagion contacts together with the impulsive vaccination to reduce susceptibility.

Rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane glycoprotein that has a viroporin domain (VPD), and NSP4 viroporin activity elevates cytosolic Ca(2+) in mammalian cells.

In conclusion, the reported difficulties and underlying conflicts of MAHs highlight the need for more effective, collaborative data collection strategies to generate new evidence on this topic.","output":"Experiences and Perspectives of Marketing Authorisation Holders towards Medication Safety Monitoring during Pregnancy: A Pan-European Qualitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of Delta strains in many regions of China, population health issues have aroused great concern in many industries. Therefore, it is necessary to intervene in population health management through a variety of means. This paper establishes an economic intervention model of cognitive computing to evaluate the health of population health management innovation, track the health risks of the population and actively manage the relationship between population health. This paper establishes a health assessment model based on cognitive computing and uses a population health survey to evaluate the physical condition, illness, and life index of 64 citizens in this city before and after the economic intervention. The results of the study show that when economic dynamics test indicators are added to the prediction model of the post-test scores of economic intervention and health status, the explanatory power R2 of the cognitive computing model increased by 4.8% and 3.5%, respectively. The score (=0.36, p <0.001), IPDT ( Inventory of Piaget's Developmental Tas) intervention score (=0.15, p = 0.025) and migration score (=0.18, p = 0.012) can significantly predict the post-economic intervention test score (R2=51.2%, p <0.001). The pre-test score on the health status test (=0.48, p <0.001) and the IPDT intervention score (=0.25, p = 0.014) can significantly predict the health status post-test score (R2=32.54%, p <0.001).","output":"Intervention of population health management innovation on economy based on cognitive computing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is probably the most relevant viral disease affecting pig farming. Despite the remarkable efforts paid in terms of vaccination administration and biosecurity, eradication and long-term control have often been frustrated. Unfortunately, few studies are currently available that objectively link, using a formal statistical approach, viral molecular epidemiology to the risk factors determining the observed scenario. The purpose of the present study is to contribute to filling this knowledge gap taking advantage of the advancements in the field of phylodynamics. Approximately one-thousand ORF7 sequences were obtained from strains collected between 2004 and 2021 from the largest Italian pig company, which implements strict compartmentalization among independent three-sites (i.e., sow herds, nurseries and finishing units) pig flows. The history and dynamics of the viral population and its evolution over time were reconstructed and linked to managerial choices. The viral fluxes within and among independent pig flows were evaluated, and the contribution of other integrated pig companies and rurally risen pigs in mediating such spreading was investigated. Moreover, viral circulation in Northern Italy was reconstructed using a continuous phylogeographic approach, and the impact of several environmental features on PRRSV strain persistence and spreading velocity was assessed. The results demonstrate that PRRSV epidemiology is shaped by a multitude of factors, including pig herd management (e.g., immunization strategy), implementation of strict-independent pig flows, and environmental features (e.g., climate, altitude, pig density, road density, etc.) among the others. Small farms and rurally raised animals also emerged as a potential threat for larger, integrated companies. These pieces of evidence suggest that none of the implemented measures can be considered effective alone, and a multidimensional approach, ranging from individual herd management to collaboration and information sharing among different companies, is mandatory for effective infection control.","output":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) Epidemiology in an Integrated Pig Company of Northern Italy: A Multilevel Threat Requiring Multilevel Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The neuroimmune system is required for normal neural processes, including modulation of cognition, emotion, and adaptive behaviors. Aberrant neuroimmune activation is associated with dysregulation of memory and emotion, though the precise mechanisms at play are complex and highly context dependent. Sex differences in neuroimmune activation and function further complicate our understanding of its roles in cognitive and affective regulation. METHODS: Here, we characterized the physiological sickness and inflammatory response of the hippocampus following intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of a synthetic viral mimic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), in both male and female C57Bl/6N mice. RESULTS: We observed that poly I:C induced weight loss, fever, and elevations of cytokine and chemokines in the hippocampus of both sexes. Specifically, we found transient increases in gene expression and protein levels of IL-1, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, TNF, CCL2, and CXCL10, where males showed a greater magnitude of response compared with females. Only males showed increased IFN and IFN in response to poly I:C, whereas both males and females exhibited elevations of IFN, demonstrating a specific sex difference in the anti-viral response in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that type I interferons are one potential node mediating sex-specific cytokine responses and neuroimmune effects on cognition. Together, these findings highlight the importance of using both males and females and analyzing a broad set of inflammatory markers in order to identify the precise, sex-specific roles for neuroimmune dysregulation in neurological diseases and disorders.","output":"Sex differences and similarities in the neuroimmune response to central administration of poly I:C"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus-2 pandemic has established a new set of challenges to health care delivery.

This work presents an impedimetric biosensing platform for following and detecting sialylation and desialylation processes. This platform is based on a native biantennary N-glycan substrate attached to a glassy carbon electrode. Changes in the molecular layer, as a result of enzymatic reactions, were detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, displaying high sensitivity to the enzymatic surface reactions. Increase in the molecular layer roughness in response to the sialylation was visualized using atomic force microscopy. After enzymatic sialylation, the presence of sialic acid was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry by coupling of the redox active marker aminoferrocene. The sialylation showed selectivity toward the N-glycan compared to another glycan substrate. A time dependent sialylation was followed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, proving that the new system can be applied to evaluate the enzymatic kinetics.

We wondered if these alterations would reverse the immune response in experimental leishmaniasis. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages from 2- and 18-month-old (senescent) C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice showed no marked difference in leishmanicidal functions. In vivo infections of resistant C57BL/6 mice with Leishmania major revealed no difference between senescent and young mice. However, among susceptible BALB/c mice, senescent animals showed less foot-pad swelling than young mice, and 40 to 60% of them even showed healing of ulcers, reduced parasite dissemination, and a Th1 cell response. These changes were associated with a spontaneous release of interleukin-12 (IL-12) by macrophages from aged but not from young mice. Since exogenous microbial stimulation can influence immune responses during aging, we also infected senescent mice who were raised under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. They showed neither resistance nor a Th1 response, but their macrophages still spontaneously released IL-12. A microbiological analysis showed that conventionally kept mice, but not SPF mice, had experienced infection with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), an infection associated with a Th1-like response. We conclude that for the reversal of the immune response, senescence is the premier requirement but needs to be completed by another mandatory event such as microbial stimulation. One of the age-related, but not environment-related, factors is the spontaneous release of IL-12 by macrophages, while confrontation with MHV presents an environment-related difference, with both having the potential to support a Th1 response.","output":"Senescent BALB/c mice are able to develop resistance to Leishmania major infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The long-term impact of COVID-19 on patient health has been a recent focus.

Table 1. COVID-19 related hospitalization or death, COVID-19 related medically attended visits or death, and Treatment Emergent Adverse Events [Image: see text] METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive intravenous (IV) RDV (200 mg on day 1, 100 mg on days 2 to 3) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was composite COVID-19 hospitalization or all-cause death by day 28 and compared using Cox proportional hazards model with baseline stratification factors as covariates. The primary safety endpoint was proportion of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events. Study enrollment was terminated early for administrative reasons in light of the evolving pandemic. RESULTS: 562 patients underwent randomization and started their assigned treatment (279, RDV; 283, placebo). Baseline demographics and characteristics were balanced across arms. Overall, 52% were male, 44% were Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and 30% were  60 years old. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (62%), obesity (56%; median BMI, 30.7), and hypertension (48%). Median baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasopharyngeal viral load was 6.2 log(10) copies/mL. Treatment with RDV significantly reduced COVID-19 hospitalization or all-cause death by day 28 (HR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03 C 0.59; p = 0.008; Table 1) compared to placebo. Participants receiving RDV also had significantly lower risk for COVID-19-related medically attended visits or all-cause death by day 28 compared to placebo (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07 C 0.56; p = 0.002; Table 1). No deaths occurred in either arm by day 28. There was no difference between arms in time-weighted average change in nasopharyngeal viral loads from baseline up to day 7. The proportion of patients with AEs was similar between arms (Table 1); the most common AEs in the RDV arm were nausea (11%), headache (6%), and diarrhea (4%).

Although these trials can offer significant advantages over traditional clinical trials, the process of designing and implementing direct-to-family studies is poorly defined, especially in children with rheumatic disease. This paper provides lessons learnt from the design and implementation of a self-controlled, direct-to-family pilot trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a medication management device on adherence to hydroxychloroquine in paediatric SLE. METHODS: Several design features accommodate a direct-to-family approach. Participants meeting eligibility criteria from across the USA were identified a priori through a disease registry, and all outcome data are collected remotely. The primary outcome (medication adherence) is evaluated using electronic medication event-monitoring, plasma drug levels, patient questionnaires and pill counts. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include (1) lupus disease activity measured by a remote SLE Disease Activity Index examination and the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire; and (2) hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Recruitment of the initial target of 20 participants was achieved within 10 days. Due to initial recruitment success, enrolment was increased to 26 participants. Additional participants who were interested were placed on a waiting list in case of dropouts during the study. DISCUSSION AND DISSEMINATION: Direct-to-family trials offer several advantages but present unique challenges. Lessons learnt from the protocol development, design, and implementation of this trial will inform future direct-to-family trials for children and adults with rheumatic diseases.

We analyzed 1999C2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey mortality-linked data, followed up until 2015. In participants aged > 30 with measurements of differential white blood cell counts, NLR was calculated and categorized into quartiles. Associations of increased NLR with overall or cause-specific mortality were assessed with Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. Increased NLR was associated with overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10C1.17, per quartile NLR) and mortality due to heart disease (1.17, 1.06C1.29), chronic lower respiratory disease (1.24, 1.04C1.47), influenza/pneumonia (1.26, 1.03C1.54) and kidney disease (1.26, 1.03C1.54). NLR was associated with cancer mortality only in the first follow-up year (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11C1.98).

Very little is known about the potential mental impact of social media use on pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the association between using social media for health information and risk perception for COVID-19, worry due to COVID-19, and depression among pregnant women in China. METHODS: A total of 4580 pregnant women were recruited from various provinces of China. The participants completed a cross-sectional, web-based survey in March 2020. RESULTS: More than one-third (1794/4580, 39.2%) of the participants reported always using social media for obtaining health information. Results of structural equation modeling showed that the frequency of social media use for health information was positively associated with perceived susceptibility (=.05; P<.001) and perceived severity (=.12; P<.001) of COVID-19, which, in turn, were positively associated with worry due to COVID-19 (=.19 and =.72, respectively; P<.001). Perceived susceptibility (=.09; P<.001), perceived severity (=.08; P<.001), and worry due to COVID-19 (=.15; P<.001) all had a positive association with depression. Bootstrapping analysis showed that the indirect effects of frequency of social media use for health information on both worry due to COVID-19 (=.09, 95% CI 0.07-0.12) and depression (=.05, 95% CI 0.02-0.07) were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence on how social media use for health information might have a negative impact on the mental health of pregnant women.

However, the safety and efficacy profile of MSC infusion therapy in patients with non-severe COVID-19 infection has not been completely established; there is, in particular, a substantial void in the literature on dose-dependent studies of MSC infusion in patients with low clinical risk COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial examines the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of 2 doses (high and low) of DW-MSC in patients with low clinical risk COVID-19. A total of 9 patients were enrolled in this study and randomized into low-dose (TL), high-dose (TH), and placebo (C) groups. Subjects in the TL and TH groups received single intravenous infusions of 5.0  10(7) cells and 1.0  10(8) cells, respectively. The main outcome was the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) during the 28-day study period. Vital signs and various inflammatory markers were also monitored weekly during the observation period. RESULTS: There were no apparent differences in clinical characteristics between study groups (TL, TH, and C) at baseline. All patients did not show the progression of severity during the study period. During the course of the study, 6 episodes of TEAE were observed in 5 subjects; however, none of the TEAEs were severe. During the follow-up period, 8 subjects recovered and were discharged from the hospital without complications. A subject exhibited abnormal liver function biomarkers at the end of the study period. Changes in inflammatory markers throughout the clinical course were not vastly different across study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical trial has provided reliable results regarding the safety of MSCs in low clinical risk COVID-19 subjects treated with MSCs. However, further confirmation of the therapeutic efficacy aspects of MSC will require large-scale randomized controlled trials in subjects with varying severity profiles for COVID-19.

Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 are important pro-inflammatory cytokines of which IL-8 is an important chemotactic factor in the lung. Data suggest that preterm newborns with lung inflammation may be unable to activate the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Therefore, early post-natal anti-inflammatory therapy could help in preventing development of CLD. Prophylactic dexamethasone therapy cannot yet be recommended. There are a number of potential interactions between surfactant and cytokine effects on the preterm lung which have not been evaluated.

We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute stroke care quality and clinical outcomes to detect healthcare system's bottlenecks from a territorial point of view. METHODS: Crossed-data analysis between a prospective nation-based mandatory registry of acute stroke, Emergency Medical System (EMS) records, and daily incidence of COVID-19 in Catalonia (Spain). We included all stroke code activations during the pandemic (March 15CMay 2, 2020) and an immediate prepandemic period (January 26CMarch 14, 2020). Primary outcomes were stroke code activations and reperfusion therapies in both periods. Secondary outcomes included clinical characteristics, workflow metrics, differences across types of stroke centers, correlation analysis between weekly EMS alerts, COVID-19 cases, and workflow metrics, and impact on mortality and clinical outcome at 90 days. RESULTS: Stroke code activations decreased by 22% and reperfusion therapies dropped by 29% during the pandemic period, with no differences in age, stroke severity, or large vessel occlusion. Calls to EMS were handled 42 min later, and time from onset to hospital arrival increased by 53 min, with significant correlations between weekly COVID-19 cases and more EMS calls (rho = 0.81), less stroke code activations (rho = ?0.37), and longer prehospital delays (rho = 0.25). Telestroke centers were afflicted with higher reductions in stroke code activations, reperfusion treatments, referrals to endovascular centers, and increased delays to thrombolytics. The independent odds of death increased (OR 1.6 [1.05C2.4], p 0.03) and good functional outcome decreased (mRS 2 at 90 days: OR 0.6 [0.4C0.9], p 0.015) during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Catalonia's stroke system's weakest points were the delay to EMS alert and a decline of stroke code activations, reperfusion treatments, and interhospital transfers, mostly at local centers. Patients suffering an acute stroke during the pandemic period had higher odds of poor functional outcome and death.

IgG of high avidity is established during affinity maturation. Failure to achieve high avidity IgG may result in a lack of protective immunity towards infection and disease. It is known that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cellular receptor is driven by high affinity. Therefore, it is predictable that protective antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 should show high affinity/avidity. AVIDITY AFTER SARS-COV-2 INFECTION: Recent findings by several groups demonstrate that the serological response towards infection with SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses is characterized by incomplete avidity maturation, followed by a decline of the serological response. This response might facilitate reinfection, prevent herd immunity and potentially allow repeated cycles of infection. CONSEQUENCES FOR VACCINATION TOWARDS SARS-COV-2: Therefore, the sole focus on antibody titers reached after vaccination towards SARS-CoV-2 might not be sufficient to evaluate the degree of achieved protection. Rather, it is suggested to include avidity determination to optimize vaccination protocols and achieve high avidity IgG directed towards SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination.

However, among scaled digital health solutions, ensuring sustainability remains elusive. This study explores the factors underpinning scale-up of digital health solutions for FLHWs in India, and the potential implications of these factors for sustainability. METHODS: We assessed five FLHW digital tools scaled at the national and/or state level in India. We conducted in-depth interviews with implementers, technology and technical partners (n=11); senior government stakeholders (n=5); funders (n=1) and evaluators/academics (n=3). Emergent themes were grouped according to a broader framework that considered the (1) digital solution; (2) actors; (3) processes and (4) context. RESULTS: The scale-up of digital solutions was facilitated by their perceived value, bounded adaptability, support from government champions, cultivation of networks, sustained leadership and formative research to support fit with the context and population. However, once scaled, embedding digital health solutions into the fabric of the health system was hampered by challenges related to transitioning management and ownership to government partners; overcoming government procurement hurdles; and establishing committed funding streams in government budgets. Strong data governance, continued engagement with FLHWs and building a robust evidence base, while identified in the literature as critical for sustainability, did not feature strongly among respondents. Sustainability may be less elusive once there is more consensus around the roles played between national and state government actors, implementing and technical partners and donors. CONCLUSION: The use of digital tools by FLHWs offers much promise for improving service delivery and health outcomes in India. However, the pathway to sustainability is bespoke to each programme and should be planned from the outset by investing in people, relationships and service delivery adjustments to navigate the challenges involved given the dynamic nature of digital tools in complex health systems.","output":"A tale of politics and stars aligning: analysing the sustainability of scaled up digital tools for front-line health workers in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the hydroxyl derivative of chloroquine (CQ), is widely used in the treatment of rheumatological conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) and is being studied for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we investigate through mathematical modelling the safety profile of HCQ, CQ and other QT-prolonging anti-infective agents to determine their risk categories for Torsade de Pointes (TdP) arrhythmia. We performed safety modelling with uncertainty quantification using a risk classifier based on the qNet torsade metric score, a measure of the net charge carried by major currents during the action potential under inhibition of multiple ion channels by a compound. Modelling results for HCQ at a maximum free therapeutic plasma concentration (free C(max)) of approximately 1.2 M (malaria dosing) indicated it is most likely to be in the high-intermediate-risk category for TdP, whereas CQ at a free C(max) of approximately 0.7 M was predicted to most likely lie in the intermediate-risk category. Combining HCQ with the antibacterial moxifloxacin or the anti-malarial halofantrine (HAL) increased the degree of human ventricular action potential duration prolongation at some or all concentrations investigated, and was predicted to increase risk compared to HCQ alone. The combination of HCQ/HAL was predicted to be the riskiest for the free C(max) values investigated, whereas azithromycin administered individually was predicted to pose the lowest risk. Our simulation approach highlights that the torsadogenic potentials of HCQ, CQ and other QT-prolonging anti-infectives used in COVID-19 prevention and treatment increase with concentration and in combination with other QT-prolonging drugs.","output":"Cardiac TdP risk stratification modelling of anti-infective compounds including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND CONTEXT Watertight dural repair is crucial for both incidental durotomy and closure after intradural surgery. PURPOSE The study aimed to describe a perfusion-based cadaveric simulation model with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reconstitution and to compare spine dural repair techniques. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING The study is set in a fresh tissue dissection laboratory. SAMPLE SIZE The sample includes eight fresh human cadavers. OUTCOME MEASURES A watertight closure was achieved when pressurized saline up to 40 mm Hg did not cause further CSF leakage beyond the suture lines. METHODS Fresh human cadaveric specimens underwent cannulation of the intradural cervical spine for intrathecal reconstitution of the CSF system. The cervicothoracic dura was then exposed from C7-T12 via laminectomy. The entire dura was then opened in six cadavers (ALLSPINE) and closed with 6-0 Prolene (n=3) or 4-0 Nurolon (n=3), and pressurized with saline via a perfusion system to 60 mm Hg to check for leakage. In two cadavers (INCISION), six separate 2-cm incisions were made and closed with either 6-0 Prolene or 4-0 Nurolon, and then pressurized. A hydrogel sealant was then added and the closure was pressurized again to check for further leakage. RESULTS Spinal laminectomy with repair of intentional durotomy was successfully performed in eight cadavers. The operative microscope was used in all cases, and the model provided a realistic experience of spinal durotomy repair. For ALLSPINE cadavers (mean: 240 mm dura/cadaver repaired), the mean pressure threshold for CSF leakage was observed at 66.7 (2.9) mm Hg in the 6-0 Prolene group and at 43.3 (14.4) mm Hg in the 4-0 Nurolon group (p>.05). For INCISION cadavers, the mean pressure threshold for CSF leakage without hydrogel sealant was significantly higher in 6-0 Prolene group than in the 4-0 Nurolon group (6-0 Prolene: 80.04.5 mm Hg vs. 4-0 Nurolon: 32.52.7 mm Hg; p<.01). The mean pressure threshold for CSF leakage with the hydrogel sealants was not significantly different (6-0 Prolene: 100.00.0 mm Hg vs. 4-0 Nurolon: 70.033.1 mm Hg). The use of a hydrogel sealant significantly increased the pressure thresholds for possible CSF leakage in both the 6-0 Prolene group (p=.01) and the 4-0 Nurolon group (p<.01) when compared with mean pressures without the hydrogel sealant. CONCLUSIONS We described the feasibility of using a novel cadaveric model for both the study and training of watertight dural closure techniques. 6-0 Prolene was observed to be superior to 4-0 Nurolon for watertight dural closure without a hydrogel sealant. The use of a hydrogel sealant significantly improved watertight dural closures for both 6-0 Prolene and 4-0 Nurolon groups in the cadaveric model.","output":"The use of a novel perfusion-based cadaveric simulation model with cerebrospinal fluid reconstitution comparing dural repair techniques: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Relatively little data are available on how the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected treatment outcomes in patients receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma or multiple myeloma. We aimed to determine the effect of COVID-19 countermeasures on treatment outcomes in this patient population. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on patients treated for lymphoma or multiple myeloma in two tertiary hospitals in Seoul. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included patients who received chemotherapy between September and December 2019 (the control period), and group 2 included patients who received chemotherapy between September and December 2020 (the study period). Countermeasures to COVID-19 were applied to the patients in group 2. The countermeasures implemented included mask wearing and regular handwashing at home and in hospital; COVID-19 risk assessments on all hospital visitors; and pre-emptive COVID-19 screening for all newly hospitalized patients and their resident guardians. RESULTS: No differences in treatment outcomes, including treatment response, incidence and duration of neutropenia or neutropenic fever, delays in chemotherapy, or number of deaths during chemotherapy, were observed between the g roups. None of the patients in group 2 tested positive for COVID-19, and there were no COVID-19-related deaths during the study period.

Methods: The design of this study was guided by an interpretative phenomenological approach. In-depth interviews were conducted with twenty bereaved family caregivers who had lost a loved one during the first waves of the pandemic. Results: Results indicate that bereaved family caregivers lived and understood their experience in terms of metaphoric cut-offs, obstructions and shockwaves. These three metaphors represented the grief process and the bereaveds quest for social connection, narrative coherence and recognition.

Few reports exist on Norwegian womens experiences of GDM follow-up. AIM: To elucidate womens experiences with follow-up of GDM in pregnancy and after delivery, and to explore their attitudes to diabetes risk and motivation for lifestyle changes. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative study in primary care in the region of Stavanger, Norway. METHOD: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted 24C30 months after delivery with 14 women aged 28C44 years, with a history of GDM. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Most women were satisfied with the follow-up during pregnancy; however, only two women were followed-up according to the guideline after delivery. In most encounters with GPs after delivery, GDM was not mentioned. To continue the healthy lifestyle adopted in pregnancy, awareness of future risk was a motivational factor, and the women asked for tailored information on individual risk and improved support. The main themes emerging from the analysis were as follows: stigma and shame; uncertainty; gaining control and finding balance; and a need for support to sustain change.

Mucormycosis is a fatal fungal condition affecting immunocompromised patients caused by a group of mold mucoromycetes. Candida albicans (C. albicans) is an oral commensal present in almost 40C65% of healthy oral cavities in adults. Several cases of mucormycosis and oral candidiasis have been reported lately in COVID-19 patients, and it may elevate the associated risks of morbidity and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were taken from a period of 2020 to April 2021 using search sources such as Cochrane, PubMed, Fungiscope and Mycobank using keywords mucormycosis, Black fungus, oral candidiasis, white fungus, COVID-19, Sars-Cov-2. DISCUSSION: The development of oral mucocutaneous lesions, such as mucormycosis and candidiasis in COVID-19 patients could be due to inhaling spores resulting in pulmonary and/or sinus congestion and prolonged mechanical ventilation in the ICU settings and the long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics respectively. The onset of candidiasis after the emergence of COVID-19 clinical signs and symptoms varied considerably and is reported within 1C30 days in most of the cases reported in the literature. Biofilms present on the denture surfaces are predisposing factors to oral candidiasis. We aim to summarize the limited data available regarding diagnosis, clinical presentation, and therapeutic approaches for the management of Mucormycosis and oral candidiasis in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Careful monitoring of oral lesions should be instituted through interdisciplinary telemedicine and teleconsultation to aid in primary diagnosis, thereby avoiding personal attendance during the pandemic. Dental practitioners should be included among the interdisciplinary teams for exhaustive intraoral examination and reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality.","output":"Mycotic infections C mucormycosis and oral candidiasis associated with Covid-19: a significant and challenging association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic headache is a frequent disorder that can cause a significant deterioration in the quality of life of the affected person.

STUDY DESIGN: Using a 24-month cohort study of 1700 women who delivered in eight Texas hospitals and were uninsured or publicly insured at the time of delivery, we focused on 456 women who used short-acting hormonal contraception within 6 months after delivery. We classified this sample according to characteristics and method preference, and estimated rates of discontinuation and associated predictors using life tables and Cox models. We assessed reasons for discontinuation and subsequent contraceptive use among those who discontinued. RESULTS: Roughly half used the pill and half used the injectable. One hundred seventy-eight (39%) expressed a baseline preference for the method they used, 162 (36%) preferred a long-acting reversible contraception method, and 41 (9%) preferred sterilization. After 1 year, 72% had discontinued [95% confidence interval (CI) 67.1C75.7]. Foreign-born Hispanic women were less likely to discontinue than U.S.-born Hispanics [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.65; 95% CI 0.50C0.84]. Those who wanted a more effective method (aHR, 1.44; 95% CI 1.12C1.85) and those who lost insurance coverage (aHR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.12C1.92) were more likely to discontinue. The most common reasons for discontinuation were side effects and access/cost. Of those who discontinued, 243 (68%) switched to a less effective or no method. Only 47 (13%) switched to their preferred method. CONCLUSIONS: Short-acting hormonal contraceptive discontinuation is high in this population. Many switch to less effective methods after discontinuation despite preferring methods at least as effective as the pill, patch, ring or injectable. IMPLICATIONS: Expanding contraceptive coverage in the 2 years after delivery should be a state and federal policy priority.

Prior pandemics and disasters have demonstrated that the scope of responsibilities for all types of healthcare workers evolves as a disaster unfolds, from meeting surging needs by prioritizing patient care, to re-balancing activities as each surge waxes and wanes, to recovery and mitigation, and finally to preparing for future disasters. This report presents a high-level summary of the current and expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare workforce and makes a series of recommendations about how to minimize the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers and their families in Illinois, now and over time. The report draws on well-established frameworks for response to pandemics and disasters distilled from a body of research and practice. We conclude that focused supportive actions are necessary to facilitate work responsibilities under new pressurespeople, information, process, technology, equipment, spaceand to promote personal wellnessphysical and psychosocial. Many steps taken to ensure public and workforce safety have also introduced economic challenges that must be addressed in order to sustain these efforts to support the workforce throughout the response and recovery phases of the pandemic. Key supports for individual providers, such as hazard pay provided by employers or government1 and free hotel rooms or meals provided by private companies,2 have already begun in many places across the country, but applying these at scale remains a challenge. We include two case studies showing it is possible to respond to real needs of workers even in the midst of a pandemic, if institutions are committed, creative and nimble. CONCLUSION: EXTEND WHAT WORKS Some of the innovations highlighted in the case studies above may be promising statewide if they can be brought to scale, shared across the industry, and made sustainable. For example, hospitals that have significant human capital have developed protocols for insuring worker safety. By contrast, home healthcare workers, who have been deemed essential in Illinois and many states, say they lack sufficient information about ensuring their own safety and the safety of their clients. While trade groups can assist with best practices, adapting detailed protocols developed by hospitals with greater in-house capacity can help workers who work for smaller companies. Just as reimbursement rules have been modified to allow for telemedicine services, policymakers and insurers should explore whether similar flexibility is possible for community health services. Increasing coverage for their services will help vitally important community health workers to assist persons in need.20 Coordination and sharing of information (e.g., best practices, operational manuals) can reduce the costs to healthcare organizations that face tremendous strain now. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) promulgates best practices for public health efforts but is actively managing a pandemic. Ideally in partnership with IDPH, the new Illinois Innovation Network (IIN)21 with its 15 hubs, drawing on the expertise of 12 universities, provides an existing architecture for transferring knowledge learned at UI Health and other Chicago hospitals to hospitals across the state, including Illinois vital critical access hospitals. IIN is also helping with development of the healthcare workforce across the state. Some innovations may improve the way healthcare is delivered going forward. For example, changes in reimbursement for telehealth may provide the necessary conditions to serve as model of care for some patients and some conditions moving forward.

Ninety-one adolescents aged 12C17 years old were assessed online during the COVID pandemic period, employing the Youth Self-Report to assess withdrawal and the Friends and Family Interview to assess attachment-general IWM and attachment-specific representations. Results show no influence of parents together/separated or of the general IWM on withdrawal, but higher parent secure base/safe haven and peer attachment cumulatively predicted 10C21% less withdrawal. Moreover, more positive peer attachment mediated 61% of the effect of the parental secure attachment on withdrawal, revealing an indirect effect of parental attachment on withdrawal through peer attachment. In conclusion, both parents and peers are influential on adolescent mental health, and fostering positive peer relationships can buffer the effect of dysfunctional family relationships on teenagers' withdrawal.","output":"Peer Power!

The Purdue University undergraduate chapter of the American Society for Biochemistry (PU-ASBMB) has designed a service-learning outreach project that will further the ASBMB's and Purdue's goals of promoting equity and access to learning in the community, and engaging undergraduates in the social responsibilities of science communication. In the past, outreach efforts have achieved most positive feedback and engagement from schools that were already considered advantaged, or privileged. We hypothesize that because the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the preexisting racial and socioeconomic disparities present in underrepresented communities, there is an increased awareness of the knowledge- and opportunity-gaps faced by many marginalized members of our communities, both by student-members and by community stakeholders. Furthermore, we propose that this will create a need for more effective partnerships between Purdue University and the Greater Lafayette Community. Creating these partnerships is critical to addressing the disparities in access to science-related educational opportunities. The objective of this service-learning research project is to partner PU-ASBMB with the Greater Lafayette community to foster greater engagement with marginalized populations of K-8 students and their families. PRELIMINARY RESULTS: Based on our 2021 project proposal, the PU-ASBMB has succeeded in partnering with the Hanna Community Center's after-school program which involves 26 K-6th grade students from 7 schools in low-income districts (www.hannacntr.org). The mission of the Center is \\"to provide quality services, programs and community interactions for the surrounding neighborhood and beyond\\" and to \\"celebrate traditions throughout the Greater Lafayette area while preserving the culture, heritage and history of African Americans and minority groups.\\" By integrating hands-on experiences aligned with statewide learning outcomes, conducting interviews, classroom observations, and reflections of students and staff, our program will be evaluated to further address the needs of those underrepresented in the Lafayette community, such as those raised in low-income families, as well as the Latinx, African American, and other marginalized populations. CONCLUSIONS: Drastically reframing the priorities of the PU-ASBMB has allowed us to effectively engage with populations within our community with whom we can have a significant impact. Immediate feedback from stakeholders, both at Purdue and at the Hanna Center indicate significant support for this program. These findings support the execution of sustainable service initiatives to provide targeted support for diverse students in the local community. Future work will include pursuing these outreach opportunities, while also educating the Purdue community on the importance of recognizing their responsibilities in giving back to, and supporting the Greater Lafayette Community, without which Purdue would not be a world-class higher institution for higher education.","output":"Doing Better: Addressing Community Educational Disparities through Student-Led Outreach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Because of the increasing emergence of skin manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, we investigated the published reports of these lesions. Methods We conducted a literature search for original and review articles published from November 11, 2019, to September 30, 2020. Results We determined five skin lesions common in patients with COVID-19: pseudo-chilblains, maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, and vaso-occlusive lesions. These lesions manifest at various times in relation to COVID-19 symptoms, which may indicate whether the lesions are virus-induced or are delayed immunological responses to the infection. Skin lesions are more prevalent among Europeans and US residents than among Asians, as is pseudo-chilblain, and the morphology of the skin lesions varies between continents. Pseudo-chilblains are the most common COVID-19 skin manifestation in Europe and the United States, but there is only one reported case from Asian populations. Additionally, patients with vaso-occlusive lesions are more likely than those with pseudo-chilblains to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to die. Conclusion Different cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 could reflect a wide spectrum of viral interactions with the skin, though reporting bias may play a role as well.","output":"Skin manifestations of COVID-19: A worldwide review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The precise transplantation, long-term tracking, and maintenance of stem cells with maximizing therapeutic effect are significant challenges in stem cell-based therapy for stroke treatment. In this study, a unique core-shell labeling nanoagent was prepared by encapsulating a cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle (CPMSN) into a 125I-conjugated/spermine-modified dextran polymer (125I-SD) by microfluidics for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) tracking and activity maintenance. The CPMSN core not only exhibits excellent photoacoustic (PA) imaging performance induced by the intermolecular aggregation of CoPP within the mesopores but also protects the MSCs against oxidative stress by sustained release of CoPP. Meanwhile, the addition of a 125I-SD shell can increase the uptake efficiency in MSCs without inducing cell variability and enable the single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) nuclear imaging. In vivo results indicated that CPMSN@125I-SD labeling could allow for an optimal combination of instant imaging of MSCs, with PA to guide intracerebral injection, followed by multiple time point SPECT imaging to consecutively track the cell homing. Importantly, the sustained release of CoPP from CPMSN@125I-SD significantly increased the survival of MSCs after injection into an ischemic mouse brain and promoted neurobehavioral recovery in ischemic mice. Thus, CPMSN@125I-SD represents a robust theranostic probe for both MSC tracking and maintaining their therapeutic effect in the treatment of brain ischemia.","output":"Engineering of SPECT/Photoacoustic Imaging/Antioxidative Stress Triple-Function Nanoprobe for Advanced Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy of Cerebral Ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Children and youth residential care institutions were forced to introduce adaptations to their regular functioning in order to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic challenges.

Soldiers completed surveys assessing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, sleep problems, burnout, morale, and attitudes and rated their leaders on health-promoting behaviors. Using mixed-effects logistic regression, health-promoting leadership focused on psychological health was associated with decreased odds of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and burnout, and increased odds of high morale and avoiding unnecessary risk. Health-promoting leadership focused on preventive medicine was associated with decreased odds of depression and anxiety, and increased odds of high morale, positive attitudes, and avoiding unnecessary risk.

The proposed model assumes that a single supplier faces full disruptions with a probability, and therefore, fails to procure all the items ordered. Accordingly, the buyer experiences unmet demand, which is assumed to be partially backordered. To make proper replenishment decisions, two base stock (S,T) periodic review optimization models are developed. The objective functions minimize the expected long-run total costs (i.e., ordering, holding, and shortage). After proving their convexity and obtaining the optimal decisions, computational experiments were carried out to investigate the impacts of the change in parameters. The results highlight the importance of selecting a suitable ratio for backorders during supply disruptions, as it leads to lower costs and reduces the inventory obsolescence and overstocking risks. Moreover, the managerial insights derived from this study aid retailers to make better replenishment decisions (in terms of level and frequency) and to be more resilient in times of disruptions.

It has baffled many scientists, as no firm rule has yet been reached to predict the effect that the virus can inflict on people if they are infected with it. Recently, many researches have been introduced for diagnosing Covid-19; however, none of them pay attention to predict the effect of the virus on the person's body if the infection occurs but before the infection really takes place. Predicting the extent to which people will be affected if they are infected with the virus allows for some drastic precautions to be taken for those who will suffer from serious complications, while allowing some freedom for those who expect not to be affected badly. This paper introduces Covid-19 Prudential Expectation Strategy (CPES) as a new strategy for predicting the behavior of the person's body if he has been infected with Covid-19. The CPES composes of three phases called Outlier Rejection Phase (ORP), Feature Selection Phase (FSP), and Classification Phase (CP). For enhancing the classification accuracy in CP, CPES employs two proposed techniques for outlier rejection in ORP and feature selection in FSP, which are called Hybrid Outlier Rejection (HOR) method and Improved Binary Genetic Algorithm (IBGA) method respectively. In ORP, HOR rejects outliers in the training data using a hybrid method that combines standard division and Binary Gray Wolf Optimization (BGWO) method. On the other hand, in FSP, IBGA as a hybrid method selects the most useful features for the prediction process. IBGA includes Fisher Score (F(Score)) as a filter method to quickly select the features and BGA as a wrapper method to accurately select the features based on the average accuracy value from several classification models as a fitness function to guarantee the efficiency of the selected subset of features with any classifier. In CP, CPES has the ability to classify people based on their bodies reaction to Covid-19 infection, which is built upon a proposed Statistical Na?ve Bayes (SNB) classifier after performing the previous two phases. CPES has been compared against recent related strategies in terms of accuracy, error, recall, precision, and run-time using Covid-19 dataset [1]. This dataset contains routine blood tests collected from people before and after their infection with covid-19 through a Web-based form created by us.

Therefore, the study aimed to assess social distancing practice and associated factors in response to COVID-19 pandemic in West Guji Zone, Southern Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Community based cross-sectional study design was conducted among randomly selected 410 household members of Bule Hora Town, West Guji Zone. Data were collected by pre-tested interviewer administered structured questionnaire adapted from previous peer reviewed articles. The data were coded and entered in to Epi data version 3.5 and analyzed by SPSS version 23. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions analysis was done to identify factors associated with social distancing practice. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and p value <0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.

Telesimulation training with both remote participants and facilitators using telehealth software has not been described. Objective: We investigated the feasibility of a large group telesimulation provider training of telehealth software for remote team leadership skills with common neonatal cases and procedures. Methods: We conducted a 90-min telesimulation session with a combination of InTouch&#8482; provider access software and Zoom&#8482; teleconferencing software. Zoom facilitators activated InTouch software and devices and shared their screen with remote participants. Participants rotated through skill stations and case scenarios through Zoom and directed bedside facilitators to perform simulated tasks using the shared screen and audio connection. Participants engaged in a debrief and a pre- and postsurvey assessing participants' comfort and readiness to use telemedicine. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and paired t tests. Results: Twenty (n = 20) participants, five Zoom and eight bedside facilitators participated. Twenty-one (21) pre- and 16 postsurveys were completed. Most participants were attending neonatologists who rarely used telemedicine software. Postsession, participants reported increased comfort with some advanced InTouch features, including taking and sharing pictures with the patient (p < 0.01) and drawing on the shared image (p < 0.05), but less comfort with troubleshooting technical issues, including audio and stethoscope (p < 0.01). Frequently stated concerns were troubleshooting technical issues during a call (75%, n = 16) and personal discomfort with telemedicine applications and technology (56%, n = 16).

METHODS: To illustrate the impacts of co-administration of the gamma-irradiated H1N1 vaccine with poly (I:C) and recombinant murine CCL21, either alone or in combination with each other, as adjuvants on the vaccine potency, mice were inoculated intranasally 3 times at one-week interval with -Flu alone or with any of the three adjuvant combinations and then challenged with a high lethal dose (10 LD50) of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus. Virus-specific humoral, mucosal, and cell-mediated immunity, as well as cytokine profiles in the spleen (IFN-, IL-12, and IL-4), and in the lung homogenates (IL-6 and IL-10) were measured by ELISA. The proliferative response of restimulated splenocytes was also determined by MTT assay. RESULTS: The findings showed that the co-delivery of the -Flu vaccine and CCL21 or Poly (I:C) significantly increased the vaccine immunogenicity compared to the non-adjuvanted vaccine, associated with more potent protection following challenge infection. However, the mice given a combination of CCL21 with poly (I:C) had strong antibody- and cell-mediated immunity, which were considerably higher than responses of mice receiving the -Flu vaccine with each adjuvant separately. This combination also reduced inflammatory mediator levels (notably IL-10) in lung homogenate samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that adjuvantation with the CCL21 and poly (I:C) can successfully induce vigorous vaccine-mediated protection, suggesting a robust propensity for CCL21 plus poly (I:C) as a potent mucosal adjuvant.","output":"A formulated poly (I:C)/CCL21 as an effective mucosal adjuvant for gamma-irradiated influenza vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to analyze and report the results of the surgical activity in a spinal unit of a trauma hub in central Italy during COVID-19 pandemic.

This overview provides an example of a standard operating procedure (SOP) for infection prevention measures in HEMS missions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we describe different methods used by several organizations in Europe and the experience of the Swiss air rescue organization Rega in transporting these patients. Possible benefits of the use of small patient isolation units (PIU) are discussed, including the fact that accompanying medical personnel do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during the transport but can still maintain full access to the patient. Rega has developed and patented its own PIU. This device allows spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients to be transported in pressurized jet cabins, small helicopters and ambulance vehicles, without the need to change between transport units. This PIU is unique, as it remains air-tight even when there is a sudden loss of cabin pressure. CONCLUSION: A wide variety of means are being used for the aeromedical transport of infectious patients. These involve isolating either the patient or the medical crew. One benefit of PIUs is that the means of transport can be easily changed without contaminating the surroundings and while still allowing access to the patient.","output":"Transport of COVID-19 and other highly contagious patients by helicopter and fixed-wing air ambulance: a narrative review and experience of the Swiss air rescue Rega"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of using convalescent plasma to treat moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in adults in India. DESIGN: Open label, parallel arm, phase II, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 39 public and private hospitals across India. PARTICIPANTS: 464 adults (18 years) admitted to hospital (screened 22 April to 14 July 2020) with confirmed moderate covid-19 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio between 200 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg or a respiratory rate of more than 24/min with oxygen saturation 93% or less on room air): 235 were assigned to convalescent plasma with best standard of care (intervention arm) and 229 to best standard of care only (control arm). INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the intervention arm received two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma, transfused 24 hours apart. The presence and levels of neutralising antibodies were not measured a priori; stored samples were assayed at the end of the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO(2)/FiO(2) <100 mm Hg) or all cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment. RESULTS: Progression to severe disease or all cause mortality at 28 days after enrolment occurred in 44 (19%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (18%) in the control arm (risk difference 0.008 (95% confidence interval ?0.062 to 0.078); risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.54). CONCLUSION: Convalescent plasma was not associated with a reduction in progression to severe covid-19 or all cause mortality.

In addition to being linked to the illegal market to be consumed as recreational drugs. The relevance of this review lies in the fact that worldwide consumption has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the depression and anxiety that originated in the population. As a consequence of this increase in consumption, concentrations of SSRIs in the environment have increased, and these have become a relevant issue for toxicologists due to the effects that they could generate in different organisms, both aquatic and terrestrial. For this reason, the objective of this article was to do a critical evaluation of the existing data on the characteristics and physicochemical properties of SSRIs, consumption data during the COVID-19 pandemic, its occurrence in the environment and the reports of toxic effects that have been generated in different organisms; we also conclude with an updated review of different methods that have been used for their removal. With this analysis, it can be concluded that, despite SSRIs are pharmaceutical products widely studied since their launching to the market, still currently under investigation to clarify their mechanisms of action to understand the different effects on the organisms, adverse reactions, as well as possible toxicological effects on non-target organisms. On the other hand, it has been proven that although it is already possible to eliminate a significant percentage of SSRIs in the laboratory, due to their physicochemical characteristics and their behavior in complex mixtures in the environment, they have not yet been eradicated, showing a persistence in the soil, subsoil and surface waters of the entire planet that may represent a future risk.","output":"Consumption and ocurrence of antidepressants (SSRIs) in pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, their environmental impact and innovative removal methods: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predictive studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are limited.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Nineteen patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or stent placement (in 20 lower extremities) were evaluated. A region of interest (ROI) at the proximal superficial femoral artery (SFA) was selected for a reference TTP for quantitative assessments. The ROI measurements of the TTP interval between medial and lateral plantar/dorsalis pedis relative to the reference was regarded as the TTP and used to assess distal hemodynamic improvement achieved by the revascularization. The ABI was obtained with a handheld Doppler ultrasound machine with a manually operated blood-pressure cuff. Correlation between the two methods was analyzed. RESULTS The ABI improved significantly from 0.44  0.18 to 0.79  0.20 (t = 10.11; P < .0001) after the intervention. TTP, which reflected the blood flow time from the proximal SFA to the foot, became much faster, from 11.86 seconds  4.26 to 6.75 seconds  2.03 (t = 6.57; P < .001).

Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization, aided by TMPRSS2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVDI-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced ACE2 down regulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heightened angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyper stimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation, and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as the elderly and those with CV risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multi-organ failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, particularly in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as IL-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis remain important. Specific evidence based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated. To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history.","output":"The Science Underlying COVID-19: Implications for the Cardiovascular System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: In cancer centers, various factors influence the type of organism causing bloodstream infection (BSI). Our premise includes the indirect benefits of hand hygiene of healthcare personnel, masking, and distancing practices during lockdown/post-lockdown period on the type of BSI among cancer patients and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns. Methods: The retrospective cohort study was conducted from November 2020 to July 2021, among cancer patients admitted to Healthcare Global cancer center. Blood culture reports of patients presenting with symptoms of BSI were retrieved and analyzed in the Department of Preventive Oncology, Healthcare Global. Our data were stratified from pre-lockdown (November 2019 to March 24, 2020) and lockdown/post-lockdown (March 25, 2020, to Jul 2020) periods. Results: The proportion of culture positives during the pre-lockdown (Nov 2019 to March 24, 2020) and post-lockdown period (March 25, 2020, to July 2020) are 21.7% and 21.1%, respectively. However, this small difference did not show a significant association with the difference in hand hygiene during the two periods (<80% and 80%). In our study, Escherichia coli (23.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.9 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.8%) were the most common BSI during the pre-lockdown period. A similar analysis during the post-lockdown period shows a higher prevalence of E. coli (20.7%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (12.1%), and K. pneumoniae (15.5%). In our study, the isolates showed a greater proportion of resistance (>50%) to Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin, Tigecycline, and Cephalosporin group of drugs. Conclusion: During COVID times, some of the preventive interventions which were implemented for reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to the reduction of BSI in the hospital setting.

There is a question if SP procedures offer disadvantages or advantages to multiport (MP) colorectal surgery. We hypothesize that SP is equivalent to MP and is a safe alternative in the full spectrum of colorectal disease and procedures. METHODS A case-matched analysis of a prospectively maintained database to compare perioperative outcomes in SP versus MP was performed. Criteria included age, gender, BMI, previous abdominal surgery, previous XRT, disease process, and procedure. 95 exact matches for all 7 criteria were found between 159 SP and 1,617 MP cases. Perioperative outcomes, surgical technique, morbidity, mortality, local recurrence, and 5-year survival were analyzed. RESULTS There was lower mean EBL in SP but no difference in transfusion requirement. OR time for SP left colectomy was shorter, with a trend to shorter OR times found in all procedures. 99 % SP and 98 % MP had no intra-operative complications. Conversion to open was equivalent (0/1). Mean largest incision was smaller for SP. There were no differences in return of bowel function or length of hospital stay. There were no mortalities. There were no differences in perioperative morbidity, local recurrence, distant metastasis, or overall 5-year survival. CONCLUSIONS SP is a safe alternative to MP colorectal surgery across the full array of procedures in equivalent patients. This study demonstrates SP has less blood loss, smaller incisions, is quicker in left colectomy, and tends to be quicker across all procedures. Conversion and morbidity rates are equivalent to MP, without compromise in quality of surgical technique. While proper training is essential, concerns regarding the inability to use SP laparoscopic colorectal surgery safely are unfounded in nearly exactly matched patients.

In terms of items, \\"worrying about infecting family members and friends\\" and \\"worrying about being separated from family after being infected\\" earned the two highest scores (2.35  0.79 and 2.17  0.92, respectively). Scores for psychological distress averaged 5.49  3.83, with stress anxiety (1.32  0.84) earning the highest mean subscale score followed by distress and irritability (1.17  0.92) and depression (1.12  0.94). Nearly two-thirds (61.8%) of the participants earned psychological and emotional distress scores within the 'normal' range, and 3.4% earned scores indicating severe distress. \\"Receiving education and training\\" was the most common method used by the participants to relieve stress (2.27  0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The following six strategies are proposed based on the above findings: (1) Caring: provide psychological assessment and care; (2) Supporting: create a friendly team atmosphere and provide support; (3) Inquiring: recruit volunteers with relevant experience; (4) Informing: provide timely, open, and transparent epidemic-prevention information; (5) Equipping: provide complete and appropriate epidemic-prevention education and training; (6) Assisting: establish a strategy for family support and caring to reduce the stress and worries of nurses.","output":"[Exploring the Stress, Psychological Distress, and Stress-relief Strategies of Taiwan Nursing Staffs Facing the Global Outbreak of COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries are recording health information on the global spread of COVID-19 using different methods, sometimes changing the rules after a few days.

Interestingly, the citizens of the countries where most of the cases are reported are overtly religious and manifest their religiosity by attending religious activities in religious buildings. This, therefore, heightens the impact of a disaster, such as where there is a religious building collapse or a stampede. The attendant social, legal and economic effects of such disasters on religious organisations, religious faithful and society thus necessitate the study. This article critically examines the roles of religious organisations and state governments in reducing the risks of avoidable disasters in religious buildings. It evaluates the reports of two instances of church building collapses in Nigeria as case studies. This article observes that many religious organisations do not have effective risk and safety policies to reduce their exposure to religious disasters. It also observes that the state is ineffective in enforcing building standards. It argues that religious organisations and the state owe a legal duty to protect the lives and guarantee the safety of the faithful against the tragedy that may occur in worship places, and where this duty is breached, and a victim suffers harm, a right to damages will accrue. It concludes that although a religious organisation may not be able to stop all such disasters, having an effective disaster risk policy can assist in reducing the occurrence of avoidable mishaps in religious buildings.","output":"Death in worship places: Evaluating the roles of religious organisations and state governments in reducing the risks of religious disaster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Sexually Transmitted Infections, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, are common in school-aged youths. These infections can cause significant health problems if not identified and treated early. Current estimates of how widespread these infections are among students receiving healthcare in schools, the role school-based clinics may have in gonorrhea and chlamydia testing and treatment, and information on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected testing and treatment, are lacking. This study was conducted in an urban metropolitan area in the United States, and included 2439 patients aged 13C17 years over a 2-year period. The patients were seen at four school-based and five family planning clinics. We found that 35% of those tested in school-based clinics were positive for chlamydia, and 10% were positive for gonorrhea. The rates of these infections were higher than previous reports from school settings (both pre-COVID-19 and the during COVID-19 pandemic). School-based clinics were able to treat patients with gonorrhea and chlamydia much faster (average ~6 days) than the family planning clinics (average ~18 days). This study shows us the critical role that school-based clinics play in the testing and treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia infections, and the value of strengthening the services these clinics provide. ABSTRACT: The prevalence and treatment of chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (GC) at school-based clinics (SBCs) requires revisiting. To assess whether clinic type influences CT/GC testing and treatment for minors (individuals 13C17 years of age), our study compared four SBCs with five family planning clinics (FPCs) in the Houston, Harris County metropolitan area of Texas, USA for: (1) the prevalence of CT/GC infection (pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19); (2) treatment rates at the last positive diagnosis; and (3) the time, in days, from testing-to-diagnosis and testing-to-treatment. Between January 2019 and December 2020, 2439 unique patients (1579 at SBCs, 860 at FPCs) were seen. Of the 1924 tests obtained, 39.2% and 15.9% were positive for CT and GC, respectively. The prevalence of CT and GC at SBCs was similar prior to COVID-19 vs. during the COVID-19 pandemic. SBCs were able to provide treatment significantly faster after diagnosis (mean, 6.07 days; 95% CI, 3.22C8.90; 94.7% were within 30 days) than FPCs (mean, 17.60 days; 95% CI, 10.15C25.12; 84.7% were within 30 days) (p = 0.0257). This comparison within our large clinic system, with consistent clinical management protocols, suggests that SBC care may be critical to ensuring optimal sexually transmitted infection management in minors.","output":"Adolescents Accessing School-Based versus Family Planning Clinics: Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Testing and Treatment Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has altered how the current generation of thoracic surgery residents are being trained. The aim of this survey was to determine how thoracic surgery program directors (PDs) are adapting to educating residents during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

The 15\\\\question electronic survey queried program status, changes to the baseline surgical practice, changes to didactic education, deployment/scheduling of residents, and effect of the pandemic on case logs and preparedness for resident graduation. RESULTS: All 23 institutions responding had ceased elective procedures, and most had switched to telemedicine clinic visits. Online virtual didactic sessions were implemented by 91% of programs, with most (69.6%) observing same or increased attendance. PDs reported that 82.7% of residents were on a non\\\\standard schedule, with most being deployed in a 1 to 2 week on, 1 to 2 week off block schedule.

Protein levels in tumour tissues and LC cells were measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In vitro, cell proliferation, colony formation assays, cell death and autophagy were detected. A nude mouse xenograft model was established through the injection of Tu212 cells. We found that GLUT1 was highly expressed and negatively associated with autophagy-related proteins in LC and that curcumin suppressed radiation-mediated GLUT1 overexpression in Tu212 cells. Treatment with curcumin, GLUT1 siRNA, or the combination of the two promoted autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy using 6-amino-3-methypourine (3-MA) promoted apoptosis after irradiation or treatment of cells with curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA. 3-MA inhibited curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA-mediated non-apoptotic programmed cell death. The combination of curcumin, GLUT1 siRNA and 3-MA provided the strongest sensitization in vivo. We also found that autophagy induction after curcumin or GLUT1 siRNA treatment implicated in the AMP-activated protein kinase-mTOR-serine/threonine-protein kinase-Beclin1 signalling pathway. Irradiation primarily caused apoptosis, and when combined with curcumin and GLUT1 siRNA treatment, the increased radiosensitivity of LC occurred through the concurrent induction of apoptosis and autophagy.","output":"Radiosensitizing effects of curcumin alone or combined with GLUT1 siRNA on laryngeal carcinoma cells through AMPK pathway-induced autophagy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are members of the genus Metapneumovirus in the subfamily Pneumovirinae. Metapneumovirus fusion (F) protein mediates the fusion of host cells with the virus membrane for infection. Trypsin- and/or low pH-induced membrane fusion is a strain-dependent phenomenon for hMPV. Here, we demonstrated that three subtypes of aMPV (aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C) F proteins promoted cell-cell fusion in the absence of trypsin. Indeed, in the presence of trypsin, only aMPV/C F protein fusogenicity was enhanced. Mutagenesis of the amino acids at position 100 and/or 101, located at a putative cleavage region in aMPV F proteins, revealed that the trypsin-mediated fusogenicity of aMPV F proteins is regulated by the residues at positions 100 and 101. Moreover, we demonstrated that aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins mediated cell-cell fusion independent of low pH, whereas the aMPV/C F protein did not. Mutagenesis of the residue at position 294 in the aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C F proteins showed that 294G played a critical role in F protein-mediated fusion under low pH conditions.

We used latent class analysis to identify distinct patterns of preferences related to testing and conducted a simulation to predict testing uptake if additional testing scenarios were offered. Five distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 testing emerged. Comprehensive testers (18.9%) ranked specimen type as most important and favored less invasive specimen types, with saliva most preferred, and also ranked venue and result turnaround time as highly important, with preferences for home testing and fast result turnaround time. Fast track testers (26.0%) ranked result turnaround time as most important and favored immediate and same day turnaround time. Dual testers (18.5%) ranked test type as most important and preferred both antibody and viral tests. Non-invasive dual testers (33.0%) ranked specimen type and test type as similarly most important, preferring cheek swab specimen type and both antibody and viral tests. Home testers (3.6%) ranked venue as most important and favored home-based testing. By offering less invasive (saliva specimen type), dual testing (both viral and antibody tests), and at home testing scenarios in addition to standard testing scenarios, simulation models predicted that testing uptake would increase from 81.7% to 98.1%.

METHODS: Adopting the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) framework, this study explored the clinical learning and training experiences of final-year health professions students during the pandemic. A survey was conducted via online platforms. Data from 155 respondents were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Personal attributes such as reflection, self-determination, motivation, resilience, and positive learning behaviors and skills were identified as SDL enablers. Collaborative learning networks and online learning platforms facilitate learning needs and goals. Fear and anxiety, untrusted learning sites, uncertainty about graduation, financial issues and challenges in the learning environments were the major themes related to barriers to SDL. CONCLUSION: The importance of SDL as a skill for uncertain times warrants further investigation in the training of future healthcare professionals. Inclusive planning and engagement with final-year health professions students to address identified stressors, as well as the creation of shared platforms where students are part of the decision-making processes for clinical learning and training are recommended.

We were familiarizing ourselves with digital pathology solutions at the time when the COVID-19 outbreak forced us to embark on an abrupt transition to digital pathology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantitatively describe how the abrupt transition to digital pathology might affect the quality of diagnoses, model possible causes by probabilistic modeling, and qualitatively gauge the perception of this abrupt transition. METHODS: A total of 17 pathologists and residents participated in this study; these participants reviewed 25 additional test cases from the archives and completed a final psychologic survey. For each case, participants performed several different diagnostic tasks, and their results were recorded and compared with the original diagnoses performed using the gold standard method (ie, conventional microscopy). We performed Bayesian data analysis with probabilistic modeling. RESULTS: The overall analysis, comprising 1345 different items, resulted in a 9% (117/1345) error rate in using digital slides. The task of differentiating a neoplastic process from a nonneoplastic one accounted for an error rate of 10.7% (42/392), whereas the distinction of a malignant process from a benign one accounted for an error rate of 4.2% (11/258). Apart from residents, senior pathologists generated most discrepancies (7.9%, 13/164). Our model showed that these differences among career levels persisted even after adjusting for other factors.

Federated learning, one type of machine learning techniques, has been started to use for the improvement of the privacy and security of medical data. In the federated learning, the training data is distributed across multiple machines, and the learning process is performed in a collaborative manner. There are several privacy attacks on deep learning (DL) models to get the sensitive information by attackers. Therefore, the DL model itself should be protected from the adversarial attack, especially for applications using medical data. One of the solutions for this problem is homomorphic encryption-based model protection from the adversary collaborator. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning algorithm for medical data using homomorphic encryption. The proposed algorithm uses a secure multi-party computation protocol to protect the deep learning model from the adversaries. In this study, the proposed algorithm using a real-world medical dataset is evaluated in terms of the model performance.","output":"Homomorphic Encryption and Federated Learning based Privacy-Preserving CNN Training: COVID-19 Detection Use-Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fresh cold chain network is complex, and the interruption risk can significantly impact it.

The main criterion for the efficiency of such indicators is their sensitivity to a cyclical pattern and changes in the dynamics of statistical referents. Statistically significant lead in time series or earlier publication allows them to be combined into a group of early response indicators. The composite Business Activity Indicator (BAI) in the basic sectors of the Russian economy reflects the common profile in the dynamics of short-term fluctuations of the key parameters of the economic environment. It consists of the balances of opinions of respondents on questions, which are unified for all sectoral surveys, and connected with reference quantitative statistics with significant cross-correlation coefficients and a lead at least one quarter. This is its main difference from the well-known indices of economic sentiment and entrepreneurial confidence. The components of the BAI are the new composite indices of real demand, current output, real employment, total profits and general economic situation. The Economic Vulnerability Indicator demonstrates a counterdirectional profile and various symmetry of its dynamics relative to the short-term movement of the BAI. Proactive monitoring of emerging vulnerabilities in the business environment is necessary to warn their large-scale accumulation, prevent the risks of economic downturns and ensure the highest possible macroeconomic stability.

Throughout the time these viruses have been found to affect human life by causing major pandemics like SARS, MERS and COVID-19 due to their high rate of mutation and zoonotic transmission. Repurposing of a drug could be a solution for this challenge, as many previously available drugs hold great potential to act as a drug molecule. Interfering this interaction could be a potent mechanism to stop the viral infection and propagation. Methods: In the current study we have predicted the evolutionary relationship of nCoV using three viral proteins Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, membrane glycoprotein and Envelop protein with accession number YP_009724397, YP_009724393 and YP_009724392 respectively. Phylogenetic tree was constructed and evaluated using the bootstrap method. Homology modeling and docking studies has been done to identify the interaction and binding affinity of SARS drugs. Results: Phylogenetic tree shows that Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein is originated from Hypsugo Bat Coronavirus, Membrane glycoprotein is originated from MERS Corona Virus and Envelop proteins have originated from Ferret coronavirus. From the docking result we concluded that Precose (glide score-8.372) shows that it has stable and strong interaction with Spike glycoprotein. Conclusion: Precose which is commonly known as Acarbose can act as a potential inhibitor for the spike glycoprotein.

During the COVID pandemic, such engagement had to be curtailed and alternatives needed to be formulated. In addition, Community Engaged Research (CEnR) teams refocused their efforts to address this public health crisis. METHODS: To obtain a general understanding of how CTSAs have conducted CE and CEnR during the COVID pandemic, we invited seven CTSA CE leaders to provide brief field reports of their activities during the pandemic. This included how their approaches to CE and CEnR were modified during the COVID-19 pandemic and key lessons learned. RESULTS: We found that despite numerous challenges, all seven CTSAs CE cores were able to successfully carry out CE and CEnR. We also found that the fundamental principles of meaningful and authentic stakeholder engagement were of paramount importance during the pandemic. Through virtual approaches, all sites had considerable success in maintaining CE in during the COVID pandemic. They also leveraged existing bi-directional community partnerships to carry out meaningful and impactful research. This included both new COVID CEnR and also innovative approaches to sustain prior non-COVID research. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that academic-community partnerships must be fostered and sustained over the many years so that when such crises emerge, all partners can build on existing trust and mutual respect.

After oral immunization with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus, antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells was revealed by an in vitro boost with viral antigen. For the latter the leukocytes were co-cultured with UV-inactivated virus using a variety of different methods of antigenic stimulation. Enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and titration of secreted anti-virus antibodies were performed with ELISASPOT (using 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole as the peroxidase chromogen) and ELISA tests respectively, according to the Ig isotype. The results showed a close relationship between ASC numbers and secreted antibody titres. The best in vitro antibody synthesis was observed when the sensitized cells were maintained in contact with virus during the whole culture period. Antibody responses were defined by a kinetic profile characterized by a narrow peak, with a maximum occuring after 4 and 6 days of culture and with the IgA response appearing earlier than the IgG. This methodology, which analyses specific antibody responses at the cellular level, may permit studies on the mechanisms of Ig isotype regulation. Extended to leukocytes from other organs of the immune system, it may also constitute an in vitro model to study antibody responses expressed in different lymphoid tissues of the pig.","output":"Kinetics of the in vitro antibody response to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus from pig mesenteric lymph node cells, using the ELISASPOT and ELISA tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Replication of positive-sense RNA viruses is associated with the rearrangement of cellular membranes. Previous work on the infection of tissue culture cell lines with the betacoronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) showed that they generate double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes as part of a reticular membrane network. Here we describe a detailed study of the membrane rearrangements induced by the avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in a mammalian cell line but also in primary avian cells and in epithelial cells of ex vivo tracheal organ cultures. In all cell types, structures novel to IBV infection were identified that we have termed zippered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and spherules. Zippered ER lacked luminal space, suggesting zippering of ER cisternae, while spherules appeared as uniform invaginations of zippered ER. Electron tomography showed that IBV-induced spherules are tethered to the zippered ER and that there is a channel connecting the interior of the spherule with the cytoplasm, a feature thought to be necessary for sites of RNA synthesis but not seen previously for membrane rearrangements induced by coronaviruses. We also identified DMVs in IBV-infected cells that were observed as single individual DMVs or were connected to the ER via their outer membrane but not to the zippered ER. Interestingly, IBV-induced spherules strongly resemble confirmed sites of RNA synthesis for alphaviruses, nodaviruses, and bromoviruses, which may indicate similar strategies of IBV and these diverse viruses for the assembly of RNA replication complexes. IMPORTANCE All positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses induce rearranged cellular membranes, providing a platform for viral replication complex assembly and protecting viral RNA from cellular defenses. We have studied the membrane rearrangements induced by an important poultry pathogen, the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Previous work studying closely related betacoronaviruses identified double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs) derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in infected cells. However, the role of DMVs and CMs in viral RNA synthesis remains unclear because these sealed vesicles lack a means of delivering viral RNA to the cytoplasm. Here, we characterized structures novel to IBV infection: zippered ER and small vesicles tethered to the zippered ER termed spherules. Significantly, spherules contain a channel connecting their interior to the cytoplasm and strongly resemble confirmed sites of RNA synthesis for other positive-sense RNA viruses, making them ideal candidates for the site of IBV RNA synthesis.","output":"Infectious Bronchitis Virus Generates Spherules from Zippered Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peptide drugs, especially food-derived peptides, have a variety of functional activities including antiviral and may also have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19.

To understand current clinical characteristics and practice, we conducted a cross-sectional study to analyze quality of care on childhood pneumonia in eight eastern cities in China. METHODS: Consecutive hospital records between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010 were collected from 13 traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medicine (WM) hospitals in February, May, August, and November (25 cases per season, 100 cases over the year), respectively. A predesigned case report form was used to extract data from the hospital medical records. RESULTS: A total of 1298 cases were collected and analyzed. Symptoms and signs upon admission at TCM and WM hospitals were cough (99.3% vs. 98.6%), rales (84.8% vs. 75.0%), phlegm (83.3% vs. 49.1%), and fever (74.9% vs. 84.0%) in frequency. Patients admitted to WM hospitals had symptoms and signs for a longer period prior to admission than patients admitted to TCM hospitals. Testing to identify etiologic agents was performed in 1140 cases (88.4%). Intravenous antibiotics were administered in 99.3% (595/598) of cases in TCM hospitals and in 98.6% (699/700) of cases in WM hospitals. Besides, Chinese herbal extract injection was used more frequently in TCM hospitals (491 cases, 82.1%) than in WM hospitals (212 cases, 30.3%) (p < 0.01). At discharge, 818 cases (63.0%) were clinically cured, with a significant difference between the cure rates in TCM (87.6%) and WM hospitals (42.0%) (OR = 9.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.3 ~ 12.9, p < 0.01). Pathogen and previous medical history were more likely associated with the disappearance of rales (OR = 7.2, 95% CI: 4.8 ~ 10.9). Adverse effects were not reported from the medical records. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous use of antibiotics is highly prevalent in children with community-acquired pneumonia regardless of aetiology. There was difference between TCM and WM hospitals with regard to symptom profile and the use of antibiotics. Intravenous use of herbal injection was higher in TCM hospitals than in WM hospitals. Most of the cases were diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms without sufficient confirmation of aetiology.

In this paper, we identify a number of characteristic features of influenza incidence time series in temperate regions, including ranges of annual attack rates and outbreak durations. By constraining the output of simple models to match these characteristic features, we investigate the role played by population heterogeneity, multiple strains, cross-immunity and the rate of strain evolution in the generation of incidence time series. Results indicate that an age-structured model with non-random mixing and co-circulating strains are both required to match observed time-series data. Our work gives estimates of the seasonal peak basic reproduction number, R(0), in the range 1.6C3. Estimates of R(0) are strongly correlated with the timescale for waning of immunity to current circulating seasonal influenza strain, which we estimate is between 3 and 8 years. Seasonal variation in transmissibility is largely confined to 15C30% of its mean value. While population heterogeneity and cross-immunity are required mechanisms, the degree of heterogeneity and cross-immunity is not tightly constrained.

Phylogenetic analysis and fingerprinting of the nucleotide substitutions underwent to differentiate and classify the viral lineages. Results More than 90% of the strains belonged to Clade 20B and two lineages (B.1.1.284 and B.1.1.214) have been detected predominantly in the Kanto region.

How high preoperative pain scores impact the clinical course and outcomes of patients after lumbar microdiscectomy is not always clear. Here, the authors aimed to determine whether patients reporting higher preoperative pain scores have worse outcomes after lumbar microdiscectomy than those reporting lower preoperative scores. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniations that had failed to improve with nonsurgical methods and who had undergone tubular lumbar microdiscectomy. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores had been collected in the preoperative and postoperative period. The anatomical severity of disease was graded based on lumbar disc health (Pfirrmann classification), facet degeneration, thecal sac cross-sectional area, and disc herniation grade. Data on each patient's narcotic consumption and length of stay were collected. A Student t-test and chi-square test were used to compare patients with high preoperative pain scores (HP cohort) and those with lower preoperative scores (non-HP cohort). RESULTS One hundred thirty-eight patients were included in this analysis. The 47 patients in the HP cohort had taken more preoperative opioids (12.0  21.2 vs 3.6  11.1 morphine equivalent doses, p = 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in Pfirrmann classification (p > 0.15), facet grade (p > 0.11), thecal sac cross-sectional area (p = 0.45), or disc herniation grade (p = 0.39) between the HP and non-HP cohorts. The latter cohort had statistically significant higher preoperative PROMIS scores (36.5  7.0 vs 29.9  6.4, p < 0.001), SF-12 mental component summary scores (48.7  11.5 vs 38.9  16.1, p < 0.001), and SF-12 physical component summary scores (PCS; 32.4  8.6 vs 27.5  10.0, p = 0.005), but a lower Oswestry Disability Index (56.4  22.1 vs 35.4  15.5, p < 0.001). There were only two time points after microdiscectomy when the HP cohort had worse HRQOL scores: at the 2-week follow-up for SF-12 PCS scores (32.4  8.6 vs 29.3  7.1, p = 0.03) and the 12-week follow-up for PROMIS scores (45.2  9.5 vs 39.5  7.1, p = 0.01). All other postoperative HRQOL measurements were similar between the two cohorts (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A patient's perceived severity of disease often does not correlate with the actual clinical pathology on imaging. Although patients who report high pain and have a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation may describe their pain as more extreme, they should be counseled that the outcomes of microdiscectomy are positive.","output":"How do high preoperative pain scores impact the clinical course and outcomes for patients undergoing lumbar microdiscectomy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous reports of COVID-19 among US children have been based on health jurisdiction reporting.

An unintended consequence of the boycotts is that they force the attending athletes to cope with the stress and distress associated with the 2022 Winter Olympics in an unfamiliar environment on their own. It is important to underscore that many of the challenges the athletes could face amid the Games are either deep-rooted or unprecedented, ranging from stressors fuelled by the nonstop media reports, the competitions, to the Omicron scares.

We investigated the impact of COVID-19 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, their families, caregivers, and medical experts. Methods We conducted a nationwide ALS webinar about COVID-19 in May 2020 and sent a questionnaire to those enrolled. Results A total of 135 participants (31 ALS patients; 23 families and caregivers of ALS patients; 81 medical experts) responded to this cross-sectional self-report questionnaire. The results showed that tracheostomy and invasive ventilation (TIV) was used in 22.6% of ALS patients, whereas 77.4% of ALS patients were not under TIV. Among non-TIV patients (n=24), 79.2% did not want TIV in the future. However, 47.4% of non-TIV patients not wanting a tracheostomy in advanced stages replied that they would want an emergency tracheostomy if they developed COVID-19-related pneumonia. These results suggest that ALS patients may be receptive to emergency treatments for reasons other than ALS. In addition, approximately half of the ALS patients agreed with the policy of not ventilating the elderly or ALS patients in case of a ventilator shortage. Furthermore, compared with medical experts, few ALS patients reported that the chance for ALS patients to obtain work was higher due to the increasing availability of remote work. Conclusions This survey indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic might be associated with increased distress about access to care and work, inducing contradictory responses and potential hopelessness among ALS patients.","output":"Contradictory Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients and Their Families and Caregivers in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic represents an enormous challenge for global health systems.

The problem is to find an optimal sequence of nodes that have to be given information so that the network is covered in least number of steps. Graph burning problem is NP-Hard for which two approximation algorithms and a few heuristics have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we propose three heuristics, namely, Backbone Based Greedy Heuristic (BBGH), Improved Cutting Corners Heuristic (ICCH), and Component Based Recursive Heuristic (CBRH). These are mainly based on Eigenvector centrality measure. BBGH finds a backbone of the network and picks vertex to be burned greedily from the vertices of the backbone. ICCH is a shortest path based heuristic and picks vertex to burn greedily from best central nodes. The burning number problem on disconnected graphs is harder than on the connected graphs. For example, burning number problem is easy on a path where as it is NP-Hard on disjoint paths. In practice, large networks are generally disconnected and moreover even if the input graph is connected, during the burning process the graph among the unburned vertices may be disconnected. For disconnected graphs, ordering the components is crucial. Our CBRH works well on disconnected graphs as it prioritizes the components. All the heuristics have been implemented and tested on several bench-mark networks including large networks of size more than 50K nodes. The experimentation also includes comparison to the approximation algorithms. The advantages of our algorithms are that they are much simpler to implement and also several orders faster than the heuristics proposed in the literature.","output":"Faster heuristics for graph burning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ebolavirus (EBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV) that compose the filovirus family of negative strand RNA viruses infect a broad range of mammalian cells. Recent studies indicate that cellular entry of this family of viruses requires a series of cellular protein interactions and molecular mechanisms, some of which are unique to filoviruses and others are commonly used by all viral glycoproteins. Details of this entry pathway are highlighted here. Virus entry into cells is initiated by the interaction of the viral glycoprotein(1) subunit (GP(1)) with both adherence factors and one or more receptors on the surface of host cells. On epithelial cells, we recently demonstrated that TIM-1 serves as a receptor for this family of viruses, but the cell surface receptors in other cell types remain unidentified. Upon receptor binding, the virus is internalized into endosomes primarily via macropinocytosis, but perhaps by other mechanisms as well. Within the acidified endosome, the heavily glycosylated GP(1) is cleaved to a smaller form by the low pH-dependent cellular proteases Cathepsin L and B, exposing residues in the receptor binding site (RBS). Details of the molecular events following cathepsin-dependent trimming of GP(1) are currently incomplete; however, the processed GP(1) specifically interacts with endosomal/lysosomal membranes that contain the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) protein and expression of NPC1 is required for productive infection, suggesting that GP/NPC1 interactions may be an important late step in the entry process. Additional events such as further GP(1) processing and/or reducing events may also be required to generate a fusion-ready form of the glycoprotein. Once this has been achieved, sequences in the filovirus GP(2) subunit mediate viral/cellular membrane fusion via mechanisms similar to those previously described for other enveloped viruses. This multi-step entry pathway highlights the complex and highly orchestrated path of internalization and fusion that appears unique for filoviruses.","output":"Filovirus Entry: A Novelty in the Viral Fusion World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 emerged as a serious pandemic in 2019 and billions of people were infected. Various precautionary methods were taken to contain the spread of virus such as social distancing, public lockdown, sanitation, and closure of schools and colleges.

These evening online sessions resulted in late night sleep, long term mobile/computer exposure, and disturbed sleep pattern. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 online classes on morningness- eveningness personality and to compare it with different age groups, gender, and body mass index. METHODS: The cluster sampling method was used to collect the subjects from the total of 1153 adult college students, 897 subjects were selected based on the selection criteria and instructed to submit an online survey consists of the Morningness-eveningness Questionnaire and demographic and anthropometric data through mail, social media, or through a researcher by direct interview. RESULTS: The mean score for the 897 participants is 56.7, indicating intermediate morningness-eveningness personality type.

SA is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that uses automation to extract affective indicators (emotive language) from text data. Assessing these indicators can help identify whether legal texts are framed, or intentionally biased in their wording. Identifying framing is important for understanding potentially biased interpretations of these laws. METHODS: We identified a sample of 2019 abortion bills using the legislative tracking tool Legiscan and included those that met specified criteria (N = 19 bills). We categorized each bill as restrictive (n = 12) or protective (n = 7). We ran aggregate (i.e., all bills) and separate (protective  restrictive) SA, generating scores that we interpreted qualitatively (higher scores indicated predominance of positive wording). RESULTS: In the aggregate analysis, 56% of text comprised negative terms (44% positive). Restrictive bills contained more negative language than protective bills (67% vs 58%). Although SA scores varied from ?222 to +13, two laws scored 0, indicating neutrality. For comparison, the US Constitutions score equaled 1. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm SA is useful to examine legal documents for language biases. The abortion bills we assessed seem framed along political ideologies, although the sample provided evidence that neutral wording is possible. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: With the recent additions of conservative-leaning Justices to the US Supreme Court, Roe v. Wade is again at the center of partisan conflict. Thus, how abortion laws are framed draws further implications for how they may be interpreted when challenged in the court system.","output":"Neutral or Framed?

The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 were studied based on its clinical classification, and the prevention and treatment effects of antibacterial drugs on the COVID-19 were explored. Firstly, a FUDAN-CCDC mathematical model was established to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Secondly, 500 COVID-19 patients with clear epidemiological history and confirmed by nucleic acid testing who were admitted to our Hospital from February 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020 were taken as research objects in this study. They were divided into 4 categories: mild cases, moderate cases, severe cases, and critical cases based on the standards given by the World Health Organization (WHO). The general data characteristics, epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations characteristics, laboratory indicator characteristics, and prevention and treatment effects of patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. The FUDAN-CCDC model predicted that the peak time of cumulative confirmed cases in Wuhan was from February 1 to February 5, the peak of cumulative confirmed cases was around 60,000, and the peak time of newly confirmed cases was from February 8 to February 11. Most of the patients with COVID-19 in critical cases were older, with an average age of 65.31  8.26 years old; it was mainly imported case (94 cases, 18.8%) at the beginning, and was mainly local cases (406 cases, 81.2%) later. The initial symptoms were fever (447 cases, 89.4%) and cough (304 cases, 60.8%), and the patients in severe and critical cases were often accompanied by respiratory failure and other late symptoms. There were differences in laboratory tests, patients in critical cases had increased procalcitonin (PCT) and less lymphocytes (LYM). The treatment of COVID-19 was mainly moxifloxacin tablets or injections and cefoperazone sodium sulbactam sodium for injection, with significant efficacy, but the cure rate of patients in severe and critical cases was low, which was 83.1% and 68.4% respectively. FUDAN-CCDC could be applied for prediction of the COVID-19 trend.

Healthcare staff move between the cubicles and administer vaccines. This allows for faster vaccine delivery and less recipient contact. In this paper we present a simulation tool which has been created to model the operation of a hockey hub clinic. This tool was developed using AnyLogic and simulates the process of individuals moving through a hockey hub vaccination clinic. To demonstrate this model, we simulate six scenarios comprising three different arrival rates with and without physical distancing.

This study aims to explore the impacts of long COVID on various aspects of social life among female long haulers. MethodsWe conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with female long haulers in the United States purposely recruited from Facebook groups, Slack group, and organization websites. The interviews were audio recorded after appropriate consent and transcribed verbatim. Inductive approach was applied in thematic analysis, which consists of six stages: becoming familiar with data, developing initial codes, extracting themes, refining themes, labeling themes, and reporting. The MAXQDA software was used in data analysis. ResultsParticipants reported persistent symptoms that negatively affected their social lives in many ways. The main impacts included physical limitation, financial hardship, social relationship, conflict of social roles, and social stigma. Negative effects of long COVID hindered female long haulers recovery process. Social isolation, COVID-19 associated stigma, and conflicts of social roles cause tremendous stress. Employers support and social media usage may play positive role in their coping with impacts of long COVID on their social life.

Methods We studied 144 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a single Center, in intensive or subintensive care Units. Those with previous thyroid dysfunctions or taking interfering drugs were excluded. Differently from previous reports, TSH, FT3, FT4, thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg autoantibodies (TgAb) were measured at baseline and every 3-7 days. C-reacting protein (CRP), cortisol and IL-6 were also assayed. Results The majority of patients had a normal TSH at admission, usually with normal FT4 and FT3. Low TSH levels were found either at admission or during hospitalization in 39% of patients, associated with low FT3 in half of the cases. FT4 and Tg levels were normal, and TgAb negative. TSH and FT3 were invariably restored at discharge in survivors, whereas were permanently low in most deceased cases, but only FT3 levels were predictors of mortality. Cortisol, CRP and IL-6 levels were higher in patients with low TSH and FT3 levels. Conclusions: Almost half of our COVID-19 patients without interfering drugs had normal TFTs both at admission and during follow up. In this series, the transient finding of low TSH with normal FT4 and low FT3 levels, inversely correlated with CRP, cortisol and IL-6 and associated with normal Tg levels, is likely due to the cytokine storm induced by SARS-Cov-2 with a direct or mediated impact on TSH secretion and deiodinase activity, and not to a destructive thyroiditis.","output":"THE SPECTRUM OF THYROID FUNCTION TESTS DURING HOSPITALIZATION FOR SARS COV-2 INFECTION."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in Indonesia especially in Medan City made people lose their jobs and had to survive to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.

Of the 205 eligible workers, 152 responded to an online questionnaire designed to measure procedural justice, occupational stress (effort/reward imbalance), sleep quality, anxiety, depression, burnout, job satisfaction, happiness, and turnover intention. Workers reported a further increase in workload and compassion fatigue, which had already risen during the first wave, and a marked reduction in the time devoted to meditation and mental activities. A low level of confidence in the adequacy of safety procedures and the need to work in isolation, together with an increased workload and lack of time for meditation, were the most significant predictors of occupational stress in a stepwise linear regression model. Occupational stress was, in turn, a significant predictor of insomnia, anxiety, low job satisfaction, burnout, and intention to leave the hospital.

Survey questions asked about prior experience with videoconferencing, comfort levels with online and traditional classes, and reasons for not turning on their video (showing their face). Results: Overall, 48.2% had little or no experience with videoconferencing prior to March 2020. Students were more comfortable with in-classroom parameters (listening, asking questions, answering questions, and interacting in small groups (breakouts)) than with online synchronous learning, although differences were not significant (ps > 0.10). Regression analyses showed there were significant positive associations between videoconferencing experience and comfort with both answering questions and interacting in breakouts (B = 0.55, p = 0.04 and B = 0.54, p = 0.03, respectively). Students reported being more comfortable during in-classroom breakouts than in breakouts using videoconferencing (p = 0.003). Main reasons for students not turning on their cameras were that they did not want to dress up (48.1%), other students were not using their video features (46.3%), and they felt they did not look good (35.5%).

A total of 3639 drugs from SuperDRUG2 database and additionally 14 potential drugs reported against COVID-19 proteins were selected. Molecular docking analyses revealed that nine drugs can bind the active site of M-protein with desirable molecular interactions. We therefore applied molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculation using MM-PBSA to analyze the stability of the compounds. The complexes of M-protein with the selected drugs were simulated for 50 ns and ranked according to their binding free energies. The binding mode of the drugs with M-protein was analyzed and it was observed that Colchicine, Remdesivir, Bafilomycin A1 from COVID-19 suggested drugs and Temozolomide from SuperDRUG2 database displayed desirable molecular interactions and higher binding affinity towards M-protein. Interestingly, Colchicine was found as the top most binder among tested drugs against M-protein. We therefore additionally identified four Colchicine derivatives which can bind efficiently with M-protein and have better pharmacokinetic properties.

The serious game Vil Du?! was developed to help children open up about sexual experiences. Vil Du?! is a non-verbal communication game, which resembles a dress-up game, in which children can show the therapist what happened to them. The current study examined how and for which therapy components Vil Du?! was used by therapists. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods triangulation design. Therapists filled out online surveys about the use of Vil Du?! with 23 clients (M(age) = 11.38 years, SD = 3.96; 61 % female). We also conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 therapists. The data were analyzed in SPSS (quantitative) and Nvivo (qualitative) following the stepwise guidelines of Zhang and Wildemuth. RESULTS: Merged qualitative and quantitative data revealed that therapists acknowledged the usefulness of Vil Du?! mostly for the therapy components trauma narration and processing, and psycho-education about sexuality. In addition, Vil Du?! might be most useful for clients who have difficulty with disclosing sexual abuse experiences, due to limited verbal abilities or feelings of guilt, shame, avoidance, and tension. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations from this study were incorporated in a user manual as a first step toward more systematic and broad implementation of Vil Du?! in the treatment of young sexual abuse victims. A next step is to test whether implementing Vil Du?! in therapy is effective in reducing the negative mental health consequences of sexual abuse for children and adolescents.","output":"Vil Du?! incorporation of a serious game in therapy for sexually abused children and adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus from the coronavirus family that emerged in the end of December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

DESIGN: Cross\\\\sectional study. SETTING: Two cities in China, Wuhan (epicentre) and Chongqing (a less affected city). POPULATION: 1947 pregnant women. METHODS: We collected demographic, pregnancy, and epidemic information from our pregnant subjects, along with their attitudes towards COVID\\\\19 (using a self\\\\constructed five\\\\point scale). The Self\\\\Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety status. Obstetric decision\\\\making was also evaluated. The differences between cities in all of the above factors were compared, and the factors that influenced anxiety levels were identified by multivariable analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anxiety status and its influencing factors. Obstetric decision\\\\making. RESULTS: Differences were observed between cities in some background characteristics and women's attitudes towards COVID\\\\19 in Wuhan were more extreme. More women in Wuhan felt anxious (24.5% vs 10.4%). Factors that influenced anxiety also included household income, subjective symptoms, and attitudes. Overall, obstetric decisions also revealed city\\\\based differences; these decisions mainly concerned hospital preference, time of prenatal care or delivery, mode of delivery and infant feeding. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak aggravated prenatal anxiety, and the associated factors could be targets for psychological care. In parallel, key obstetric decision\\\\making changed, emphasising the need for pertinent professional advice.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether EMS use varied by race/ethnicity and sex among a current, diverse national sample of hospitalized acute stroke patients. METHODS AND RESULTS We analyzed data from 398,798 stroke patients admitted to 1613 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke participating hospitals between October 2011 and March 2014. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between combinations of racial/ethnic and sex groups with EMS use, adjusting for potential confounders including demographics, medical history, and stroke symptoms. Patients were 50% female, 69% white, 19% black, 8% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 1% other, and 86% had ischemic stroke. Overall, 59% of stroke patients were transported to the hospital by EMS. White women were most likely to use EMS (62%); Hispanic men were least likely to use EMS (52%). After adjustment for patient characteristics, Hispanic and Asian men and women had 20% to 29% lower adjusted odds of using EMS versus their white counterparts; black women were less likely than white women to use EMS (odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.77). Patients with weakness or paresis, altered level of consciousness, and/or aphasia were significantly more likely to use EMS than patients without each symptom; the observed racial/ethnic and sex differences in EMS use remained significant after adjustment for stroke symptoms. CONCLUSIONS EMS use differed by race/ethnicity and sex. These contemporary data document suboptimal use of EMS transport among US stroke patients, especially by racial/ethnic minorities and those with less recognized stroke symptoms.","output":"Racial/Ethnic and Sex Differences in Emergency Medical Services Transport Among Hospitalized US Stroke Patients: Analysis of the National Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic renewed attention has been directed towards viral neutralization assays and neutralizing antibodies quantification, for vaccine pre-clinical trials and determining vaccine efficacy over time. The gold standard to assess antibody titer is the plaque reduction neutralization test, an end-point assay which evaluates the highest serum antibody dilution that neutralizes viral replication, by inspecting the cytopathic effect induced on cell cultures. Here, we use planar, PEDOT:PSS-based organic electrochemical transistors for real-time, remote-controlled, reliable and fast electrical monitoring of the cytopathic effect induced by SARS29 CoV-2 on Vero E6 cell lines, allowing the quantification of serum neutralizing titer. Our low-cost and scalable device has the potential to speed-up large-scale viral neutralization screening without the need for cancerous staining or highly specialized operators. Finally, the technology could be easily transferred to assess neutralizing antibody response towards different viruses in their permissive cell substrates.The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of tests for assessing antibody titer, such as for determining vaccine efficacy.

Using 2018 American Hospital Association data, we identified barriers to surveillance data reporting and combined this with data on the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital capacity at the hospital referral region level. Our results find the most common barrier was public health agencies lacked the capacity to electronically receive data, with 41.2% of all hospitals reporting it. We also identified 31 hospital referral regions in the top quartile of projected bed capacity needed for COVID-19 patients in which over half of hospitals in the area reported that the relevant public health agency was unable to receive electronic data. Public health agencies' inability to receive electronic data is the most prominent hospital-reported barrier to effective syndromic surveillance. This reflects the policy commitment of investing in information technology for hospitals without a concomitant investment in IT infrastructure for state and local public health agencies.","output":"Barriers to hospital electronic public health reporting and implications for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to reveal lifestyle changes and their impact on glycemic control and weight control in patients with diabetes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,402 outpatients with diabetes at a clinic in Osaka, Japan, who responded to an interview sheet regarding lifestyle changes during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic between 28 March and 30 May 2020. The association of lifestyle changes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight changes from February to May 2020 was investigated using the linear regression model. We also investigated the association with clinically important change of HbA1c (by 0.3%) and bodyweight (by 3%), using the cumulative link model. RESULTS: Leisure time and other outside physical activities were decreased in one\\\\quarter of patients during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, whereas the amount of meals and snacks was decreased and increased in approximately 10%, respectively. The change in leisure time physical activities was inversely associated with HbA1c and weight changes, whereas the quantitative change of meals with the decline in eating out and that of snacks were positively associated with HbA1c and weight changes (all P < 0.05). The quantitative change of meals without the decline in eating out was also positively associated with weight change (P = 0.012). The cumulative link model for clinically important HbA1c and weight change showed broadly similar associations, except for that between snacks and bodyweight (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of outpatients with diabetes experienced lifestyle changes during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.
