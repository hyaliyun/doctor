This assumption is an underlying principle of using raters for creativity tasks, as in the Consensual Assessment Technique. While several prior studies have examined expert-novice differences in ratings, none have examined whether experts ability to identify the quality of a creative product is being driven more by their ability to identify high quality work, low quality work, or both. To address this question, a sample of 142 participants completed individual difference measures and rated the quality of several sets of creative captions. Unbeknownst to the participants, the captions had been identified a prior by expert raters as being of particularly high or low quality. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that after controlling for participants background and personality, those who scored significantly higher on any of three external measures of creativity also rated low-quality captions significantly lower than their peers; however, they did not rate the high-quality captions significantly higher.

We have also shown that exosomes secreted from mesenchymal stem-cells pre-irradiated with 2 Gy are quantitatively, functionally and qualitatively different from the exosomes secreted from non-irradiated mesenchymal cells and also that proteins, exosomes and microvesicles secreted by mesenchymal cells suffer a dramatic change when cells are activated or non-activated, with the amount of protein present in the exosomes of the pre-irradiated cells being 1.5-fold times greater compared to those from non-irradiated cells. This finding correlates with a dramatic increase in the anti-tumour activity of the exosomes secreted by pre-irradiated mesenchymal-cells. After the proteomic analysis of the load of the exosomes released from both irradiated and non-irradiated cells, we conclude that annexin A1 is the most important and significant difference between the exosomes released by the cells in either status. Knowing the role of annexin A1 in the control of hypoxia and inflammation which is characteristic of acute-distress-respiratory syndrome, we have designed a hypothetical therapeutic strategy, based on the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells stimulated with radiation, to alleviate the symptoms of patients who, due to pneumonia caused by COVID-19, require the care of an intensive care unit for patients with life-threatening conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From May 2016 to July 2017, patients with liver cancers adjacent to GB (10 mm) who intended to undergo ultrasound-guided RFA without GB isolation in our hospital were prospectively enrolled. During the RFA procedures, CEUS was employed to evaluate the therapeutic response and the perfusion of the intact GB wall. The outcomes of GB and liver cancers were followed up and recorded. RESULTS 23 patients (18 male, 5 female) with 23 liver cancers (mean 18 mm, range 8-34 mm) adjacent to GB were enrolled. There were 12 tumors that abutted the GB while 11 tumors located within 10 mm of the GB. After the RFA procedures, intra-procedural CEUS evaluation demonstrated the perfusion of the GB wall was intact in all 23 patients and technical success rate of RFA was 100% (23/23). According to the contrast-enhanced CT/MR one month after RFA, the technical efficacy rate was 100% (23/23). During the follow-up period (range: 12-23 months, median: 17 months), no local tumor progression occurred and no major complications arised. Overall survival at 1-year was 100%. Thickening of GB wall was detected in 11 patients. The thickness of GB wall returned to the pre-ablation level in five patients. CONCLUSION CEUS-monitored RFA of liver cancers adjacent to GB without GB isolation was feasible, safe and effective.","output":"Radiofrequency ablation of liver cancers adjacent to the gallbladder without gallbladder isolation under contrast-enhanced ultrasound monitoring: a preliminary study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings.

Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV.

A multivariable analysis was subsequently performed to create a new risk prediction model for serious postoperative complications in our institution. RESULTS: Our 30-day morbidity and mortality were 45.3% and 0.8%, respectively. The ACS-NSQIP failed to predict complications and had an acceptable discrimination ability for predicting death.

Therefore, between June 2017 and May 2018 semi-structured interviews were conducted involving 13 healthcare professionals. Interview transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. The presence and occasional manifestation of prejudices against the Romas were noted by the interviewees, most commonly in the form of longer waiting time, comments or other meta-communicative tools. Study participants appeared to exclude a direct relationship between health providers' implicit bias and the lower quality of health services or the worse health status of Roma patients. However, as reported, indirect negative effects may occur in cases where a patient refrains from seeking care due to previous perceived or experienced discrimination. As barriers to effective patient-provider communication and cooperation, differences in culture, health-seeking behaviour and gaps between health literacy levels were emphasized. In terms of prevention, enhancing anti-discriminatory attitudes from early childhood within the families, the role of media in conveying unbiased information, increasing health awareness of the Roma people as well as educating healthcare providers on culture-related issues may be beneficial.

To address the issue, a novel datamining method is introduced and applied to repositioning of drugs for hypertension (HT) which is a serious medical condition and needs some improved treatment plans to help treat it. RESULTS: A novel two-step data mining method, which is based on the If-Then association rules as well as a novel discrete optimization algorithm, was introduced and applied to the synthetic repurposing of drugs for HT. The required data were also extracted from DrugBank, KEGG, and DrugR+ databases. The findings indicated that based on the different statistical criteria, the proposed method outperformed the other state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast to the previously proposed methods which had failed to discover a list on some datasets, our method could find a combination list for all of them. CONCLUSION: Since the proposed synthetic method uses medications in small dosages, it might revive some failed drug development projects and put forward a suitable plan for treating different diseases such as COVID-19 and HT.

Large-scale deployment of DAC requires serious government, private, and corporate support and investment particularly to offset the capital cost as well as operational costs. Further optimizations to the costs can be found in choice of energy source as well as advances in CO(2) capture technology such as high capacity and selectivity materials, faster reaction kinetics, and ease of reusability. ABSTRACT: Direct air capture (DAC) technologies are receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, commercial enterprises, policymakers and governments. While deep decarbonization of all sectors is required to meet the Paris Agreement target, DAC can help deal with difficult to avoid emissions (aviation, ocean-shipping, iron-steel, cement, mining, plastics, fertilizers, pulp and paper). While large-scale deployment of DAC discussions continues, a closer look to the capital and operational costs, different capture technologies, the choice of energy source, land and water requirements, and other environmental impacts of DAC are reviewed and examined. Cost per ton of CO(2) captured discussions of leading industrial DAC developers with their carbon capture technologies are presented, and their detailed cost comparisons are evaluated based on the choice of energy operation together with process energy requirements. Validation of two active plants net negative emission contributions after reducing their own carbon footprint is presented. Future directions and recommendations to lower the current capital and operational costs of DAC are given. In view of large-scale deployment of DAC, and the considerations of high capital costs, private investments, government initiatives, net zero commitments of corporations, and support from the oil companies combined will help increase carbon capture capacity by building more DAC plants worldwide.

We present evidence that DC-SIGN neck variants are expressed on dendritic and myeloid cells at the RNA and protein levels. Structural analysis revealed that multimerization of DC-SIGN within a cellular context depends on the lectin domain and the number and arrangement of the repeats within the neck region, whose glycosylation negatively affects oligomer formation. Naturally occurring DC-SIGN neck variants differ in multimerization competence in the cell membrane, exhibit altered sugar binding ability, and retain pathogen-interacting capacity, implying that pathogen-induced cluster formation predominates over the basal multimerization capability. Analysis of DC-SIGN neck polymorphisms indicated that the number of allelic variants is higher than previously thought and that multimerization of the prototypic molecule is modulated in the presence of allelic variants with a different neck structure. Our results demonstrate that the presence of allelic variants or a high level of expression of neck domain splicing isoforms might influence the presence and stability of DC-SIGN multimers on the cell surface, thus providing a molecular explanation for the correlation between DC-SIGN polymorphisms and altered susceptibility to HIV-1 and other pathogens.","output":"Structural requirements for multimerization of the pathogen receptor dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (CD209) on the cell surface."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsProlonged waiting times for admission to psychiatric hospital settings are a common and widespread issue.

These transfers are frequently affected by delays in admission, possibly resulting in increased risk to patients, staff and the public.The aim of this project was to audit all referrals to Broadmoor High Secure Hospital in England within a one year period with special focus taken on calculating the time taken from referral to admission. We aimed to assess if there were any rate limiting steps which could be targeted to reduce time from referral to admission.MethodWe collected data and conducted a retrospective cohort review for all admissions from September 2019-September 2020. Where available, information was obtained for each step of the referrals process. Individual patient records were reviewed where required.Exclusion criteria: data withdrawn, transfers from other high secure services (HSS), incomplete data, MOJ instruction or urgent admission bypassing the process.Result18 cases were excluded as per exclusion criteria. 46 patients were included in the study. 16 referrals originated from medium secure psychiatric hospitals, and 30 from prison.The average time from referral to admission was 44.3 days. Admission of patients from MSUs was quicker, taking an average of 40.3 days when compared to prison referrals, which took 45.9 days.The breakdown of timings for each step in the referrals process was calculated to determine if a rate limiting step could be identified.On average it took 2.1 working days to allocate a case to a clinician, 7.6 days for an assessment, 9.2 days to complete a report and 3.5 days to submit this to the admissions panel.

Postprocedure digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated flow stagnation inside the aneurysm dome. The patient was discharged 9 days post procedure without new neurologic deficits. A 6-month follow-up DSA demonstrated delayed posttreatment residual flow into the aneurysm sac. Although she was scheduled for additional FD placement because of concern for aneurysmal rupture, the operation was not conducted due to an interim motor vehicle accident. Oral treatment with aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) was continued during her recovery. DSA performed 12 months post procedure showed that the aneurysm had completely thrombosed. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that delayed post-treatment residual flow into an aneurysm may form part of the normal clinical course post FD placement and may not preclude eventual thrombosis of the aneurysm.

The results of cognitive tests were closely comparable between the laboratory-based and home-based experiments indicating that students followed the guidelines and the required procedures for a reliable data collection. Our assessments of students' performance and feedback indicate that the majority of our educational goals were achieved, while all safety guidelines and distancing requirements were also met.","output":"Short-term research projects in cognitive neuroscience for undergraduate students: a contingency plan to maintain quality teaching during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atomically thin superconductivity in Pb monolayers grown on Si(111) is affected by adding a tiny amount of Au atoms. In situ macroscopic electron transport measurements reveal that superconductivity develops at higher temperatures and manifests a sharper superconducting transition to zero resistance as compared to pristine Pb/Si(111). Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy show that Au atoms decorate atomic step edges of Pb/Si(111) and link the electronic reservoirs of neighboring atomic terraces. The propagation of superconducting correlations across the edges is enhanced, facilitating the coherence between terraces and promoting macroscopic superconductivity at higher temperatures.

Editorials have hypothesized that resident physicians worked fewer hours, therefore losing valuable experience, but we are not aware of studies that have objectively assessed changes in hours worked. Objective This study aims to identify differences secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic in resident work hours across all specialties at 3 geographically dispersed, integrated academic hospitals in a large sponsoring institution. Methods We obtained de-identified work hour data from all residency programs at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Florida, and Minnesota. Resident work hours were compared between 2020 and 2019 from March to May. Results Work hours for 1149 and 1118 residents during the pandemic and control periods respectively were compared. Decreases in resident work hours were seen, with the largest decrease demonstrated in April 2020 when 19 of 43 programs demonstrated significantly decreased work hours. Residents worked more hours from home in April 2020 compared to the previous year (Arizona: mean 1 hour in 2019 vs 5.2 hours in 2020, P<.001; Florida: mean 0.7 hour in 2019 vs 6.5 hours in 2020, P<.001; Minnesota: mean 0.8 hour in 2019 vs 10.2 hours in 2020, P<.001). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decrease in work hours in some, but not all, specialties. The decrease in on-site work was only partially offset by an increased number of hours worked from home.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Resident Physician Clinical and Educational Work Hours at a Large Sponsoring Institution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Limited data are available on the course of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). More real-world data are needed to help the MS community to manage MS treatment properly. In particular, it is important to understand the impact of immunosuppressive therapies used to treat MS on the outcome of COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in MS patients treated with ocrelizumab, followed in two MS Centers based in University Hospitals in Northern Italy from February 2020 to June 2021. Results: We identified 15 MS patients treated with ocrelizumab with confirmed COVID-19 (mean age, 50.47  9.1 years; median EDSS, 3.0; range 1.0C7.0). Of these, 14 were confirmed by nasal swab and 1 was confirmed by a serological test. COVID-19 severity was mild to moderate in the majority of patients (n = 11, 73.3%; mean age, 49.73; median EDSS 3.0). Four patients (26.7%; mean age, 52.5 years; median EDSS, 6) had severe disease and were hospitalized; one of them died (age 50, EDSS 6.0, no other comorbidities).

To perform these functions, it has been suggested that protein E can form a membrane destabilizing transmembrane (TM) hairpin, or homooligomerize to form a TM pore. Indeed, in a recent study we reported that the -helical putative transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms several SDS-resistant TM interactions: a dimer, a trimer, and two pentameric forms. Further, these interactions were found to be evolutionarily conserved. Herein, we have studied multiple isotopically labeled ETM peptides reconstituted in model lipid bilayers, using the orientational parameters derived from infrared dichroic data. We show that the topology of ETM is consistent with a regular TM -helix. Further, the orientational parameters obtained unequivocally correspond to a homopentameric model, by comparison with previous predictions. We have independently confirmed that the full polypeptide of E protein can also aggregate as pentamers after expression in Escherichia coli. This interaction must be stabilized, at least partially, at the TM domain. The model we report for this pentameric -helical bundle may explain some of the permabilizing properties of protein E, and should be the basis of mutagenesis efforts in future functional studies.","output":"Model of a Putative Pore: The Pentameric -Helical Bundle of SARS Coronavirus E Protein in Lipid Bilayers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Zoonotic diseases have varying public health burden and socio-economic impact across time and geographical settings making their prioritization for prevention and control important at the national level. We conducted systematic prioritization of zoonotic diseases and developed a ranked list of these diseases that would guide allocation of resources to enhance their surveillance, prevention, and control. METHODS: A group of 36 medical, veterinary, and wildlife experts in zoonoses from government, research institutions and universities in Kenya prioritized 36 diseases using a semi-quantitative One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization tool developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with slight adaptations. The tool comprises five steps: listing of zoonotic diseases to be prioritized, development of ranking criteria, weighting criteria by pairwise comparison through analytical hierarchical process, scoring each zoonotic disease based on the criteria, and aggregation of scores. RESULTS: In order of importance, the participants identified severity of illness in humans, epidemic/pandemic potential in humans, socio-economic burden, prevalence/incidence and availability of interventions (weighted scores assigned to each criteria were 0.23, 0.22, 0.21, 0.17 and 0.17 respectively), as the criteria to define the relative importance of the diseases. The top five priority diseases in descending order of ranking were anthrax, trypanosomiasis, rabies, brucellosis and Rift Valley fever. CONCLUSION: Although less prominently mentioned, neglected zoonotic diseases ranked highly compared to those with epidemic potential suggesting these endemic diseases cause substantial public health burden.

In this study, we conduct a scenario analysis for COVID-19 in Malaysia using a simple universality class of the SIR system and extensions thereof (i.e., the inclusion of temporary immunity through the reinfection problems and limited medical resources scenarios leads to the SIRS-type model). This system has been employed in order to provide further insights on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of the epidemiological parameters of this system are estimated based on the fitting of the model to real COVID-19 data released by the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH). We observe that this model is able to mimic the trend of infection trajectories of COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and it is possible for transmission dynamics to be influenced by the reinfection force and limited medical resources problems. A rebound effect in transmission could occur after several years and this situation depends on the intensity of reinfection force. Our analysis also depicts the existence of a critical value in reinfection threshold beyond which the infection dynamics persist and the COVID-19 outbreaks are rather hard to eradicate. Therefore, understanding the interplay between distinct epidemiological factors using mathematical modelling approaches could help to support authorities in making informed decisions so as to control the spread of this pandemic effectively.","output":"Scenario analysis of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Malaysia with the possibility of reinfection and limited medical resources scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To compare the results of Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (LTEPR) and the open prolene hernia system repair (OPHSR), in terms of complications, postoperative pain and quality of life. Background: Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequent surgeries made by general surgeons. Although, with the technological development and scientific advances even today it is not possible to define which is the gold standard procedure to hernia repair. Material and Methods: For this observational study, all 577 consecutive patients who underwent hernia repair were included in the study, 293 LTEPR, and 284 OPHSR. The average age for OPHSR was 62.49 years and for LTEPR 55.35 years. The average follow-up of 38.10 months, the mean operative time for OPHSR was 55.58 minutes and for LTEPR was 45.46 minutes, with a hospital stay of 1.1 and 1.08 respectively. Results: Each type of hernia was classified according to Gilbert/Rutcow-Robbins criteria, resulting in the OPHSR, 80.28 % were assigned to class 1 to 3 and only 19.72% in class 4 to 7. In the LTEPR, 52.22% of the patients are classified in degree 1 to 3 and 47.78% were class 4 to 7. In the LTEPR group there was more complications with 9 cases of bleeding controlled at the same time, one tear of the bladder, no other visceral complications; in the OPHSR group, there were fewer complications with significant differences (p= .014). The postoperative complications, principally hematoma, and seroma were the most common complication without statistic differences. The postoperative pain was in the OPHSR group, 77.46% of patients reported suffering from mild or pain-free pain, 21.47% reported moderate pain, and 1.05% reported severe pain, in the LTEPR group 74.4% of patients reported mild pain, 25.25% reported moderate pain and only one patient reported severe pain, without significant differences. In both groups, the patients reported a high index of satisfaction, and in the LTEPR group scare results were better than OPHSR (p .001). CONCLUSION The outcomes of LTEPR are similar to OPHSR.

Although the majority of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild-to-no symptoms, many patients develop severe disease and need immediate hospitalization, with most severe infections associated with a dysregulated immune response attributed to a cytokine storm. Epidemiological studies suggest that overall COVID-19 severity and morbidity correlate with underlying comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and immunosuppressive conditions. Patients with such comorbidities exhibit elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress caused by an increased accumulation of angiotensin II and by activation of the NADPH oxidase pathway. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress coupled with the cytokine storm contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis by causing endotheliitis and endothelial cell dysfunction and by activating the blood clotting cascade that results in blood coagulation and microvascular thrombosis. In this review, we survey the mechanisms of how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces oxidative stress and the consequences of this stress on patient health. We further shed light on aspects of the host immunity that are crucial to prevent the disease during the early phase of infection. A better understanding of the disease pathophysiology as well as preventive measures aimed at lowering ROS levels may pave the way to mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced complications and decrease mortality.

In patients critically ill with COVID-19, the clinicopathologic characteristics of AKI have not been described in detail. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 81 patients critically ill with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit. The incidence, etiologies, and outcomes of AKI were analyzed. Pathologic studies were performed in kidney tissues from ten deceased patients with AKI. RESULTS: A total of 41 (50.6%) patients experienced AKI in this study. The median time from illness to AKI was 21.0 (IQR, 9.5-26.0) days. The proportion of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI were 26.8%, 31.7%, and 41.5%, respectively. The leading causes of AKI included septic shock (25 of 41, 61.0%), volume insufficiency (eight of 41, 19.5%), and adverse drug effects (five of 41, 12.2%). The risk factors for AKI included age (per 10 years) (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.69; P=0.002) and serum IL-6 level (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.73; P=0.003). KDIGO stage 3 AKI predicted death. Other potential risk factors for death included male sex, elevated D-dimer, serum IL-6 level, and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. The predominant pathologic finding was acute tubular injury. Nucleic acid tests and immunohistochemistry failed to detect the virus in kidney tissues. CONCLUSIONS: AKI was a common and multifactorial complication in patients critically ill with COVID-19 at the late stage of the disease course. The predominant pathologic finding was acute tubular injury. Older age and higher serum IL-6 level were risk factors of AKI, and KDIGO stage 3 AKI independently predicted death.","output":"Clinicopathological Features and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill COVID-19 with Prolonged Disease Course: A Retrospective Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on global comparisons, Latin America is the most violent region in the world, with the highest homicide rate and a significant incidence of urban violence, kidnappings, lynchings and other forms of vigilante practices, and violent environmental conflicts.

Methods: We collected and evaluated data from the Study to Investigate the Differential Effects of Inhaled Symbicort and Advair on Lung Microbiota (DISARM), a randomized controlled trial. Bronchoscopy was performed on COPD patients before and after treatment with salmeterol/fluticasone, formoterol/budesonide or formoterol-only. Bronchial brush samples were processed for microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and host mRNA sequencing. Longitudinal changes in the microbiome at a community, phylum and genus level were correlated with changes in host gene expression using a Spearmans rank correlation test. Findings: In COPD patients treated with salmeterol/fluticasone, the expression levels of 676 host genes were significantly correlated to changes in the alpha diversity of the small airways. At a genus level, the expression levels of 122 host genes were significantly related to changes in the relative abundance of Haemophilus. Gene enrichment analyses revealed the enrichment of pathways and biological processes related to innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. None of these changes were evident in patients treated with formoterol/budesonide or formoterol alone. Interpretation: Changes in the microbiome following salmeterol/fluticasone treatment are related to alterations in the host transcriptome in the small airways of patients with COPD.

The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the existing knowledge on this topic. METHODS MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched for studies investigating nuclear medicine imaging methods for the prediction of postoperative liver function in patients undergoing localized, liver-directed treatments. The postoperative endpoints were clinical outcome (morbidity and mortality) as well as measures of postoperative liver function, e.g., liver function assessed by biochemical tests or nuclear imaging. RESULTS A total of 1352 references were identified, of which 82 fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Most studies (n = 63) were retrospective studies. The vast majority of studies assessed [99mTc]Tc-galactosyl serum albumin (GSA) (n = 57) and [99mTc]Tc-mebrofenin (n = 19). Liver resection was entirely or partly major (involved at least three segments) in 78 reports. There were notable variations in the research methodology, e.g., image acquisition, imaging variables, and endpoints. Thirty-seven studies reported on postoperative mortality, of which most reported descriptive data at the patient level. Of the four reports that performed multivariate analyses, two showed significant predictive results of isotope-based preoperative tests. Fifty-two papers presented data on postoperative liver failure. Multivariate predictive analyses were performed in eighteen trials, of which fifteen showed the significant value of nuclear medicine tests. CONCLUSION There is sparse evidence supporting the significant value of nuclear medicine imaging methods in predicting postoperative mortality. In contrast, a notable number of trials showed a significant prediction of liver failure in multivariate analyses. The research methodology was heterogeneous and exploratory in most trials.

Combination of Conscientiousness scores differentiated between adaptive and maladaptive resilience. However, high Emotionality in conjunction with Introversion and high Conscientiousness produced both vulnerability and maladaptation.

PURPOSE: To estimate the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who never develop symptoms. DATA SOURCES: Searches of Google News, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and PubMed using the keywords antibodies, asymptomatic, coronavirus, COVID-19, PCR, seroprevalence, and SARS-CoV-2. STUDY SELECTION: Observational, descriptive studies and reports of mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 that were either cross-sectional or longitudinal in design; were published through 17 November 2020; and involved SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antibody testing of a target population, regardless of current symptomatic status, over a defined period. DATA EXTRACTION: The authors collaboratively extracted data on the study design, type of testing performed, number of participants, criteria for determining symptomatic status, testing results, and setting. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty-one eligible studies and reports were identified, of which 43 used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18 used antibody testing to detect current or prior infection. In the 14 studies with longitudinal data that reported information on the evolution of symptomatic status, nearly three quarters of persons who tested positive but had no symptoms at the time of testing remained asymptomatic. The highest-quality evidence comes from nationwide, representative serosurveys of England (n = 365 104) and Spain (n = 61 075), which suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. LIMITATION: For PCR-based studies, data are limited to distinguish presymptomatic from asymptomatic infection. Heterogeneity precluded formal quantitative syntheses. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. Longitudinal studies suggest that nearly three quarters of persons who receive a positive PCR test result but have no symptoms at the time of testing will remain asymptomatic.

Moreover, clinical attack rate of ward-based HCWs was significantly higher than non-ward-based HCWs (8.1%, 7/68 vs 1.8%, 2/109, p=0.045). The episodes (mean  S.D) of patient-care duty assignment in the cubicles was significantly higher among infected ward-based HCWs than non-infected ward-based HCWs (6.02.4 vs 3.02.9, p=0.012) during the outbreak period. The outbreak strains belong to SARS-CoV-2 lineage, B.1.36.27 (GISAID Clade GH) with the unique S-T470N mutation on WGS. CONCLUSION: This nosocomial point source superspreading due to possible airborne transmission demonstrated the need for stringent SARS-CoV-2 screening at admission to healthcare facilities and better architectural design of the ventilation system to prevent such outbreaks. Portable high-efficiency particulate filters were installed in each cubicle to improve ventilation before resumption of clinical service.","output":"Nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 by possible airborne transmission leading to a superspreading event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the arrival of vaccines against the novel coronavirus in late 2020, the issue of how vaccines should be distributed and which groups should be prioritized has become salient.

We find that the public supports prioritizing vulnerable groups such as health care workers or the elderly. We also find a notable degree of cross\\\\generational solidarity: younger age cohorts prioritize the elderly, while older groups prioritize (typically younger) health care workers. We then examine whether this finding is not in fact driven by vaccine hesitancy. This is not the case for older age groups, whose solidarity thus seems to be genuine.

Methods: We reported and compared the surgical procedures performed for acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis between two periods (March and April 2019 and March and April 2020) at Emergency Surgery Department of Parma University Hospital, a tertiary COVID-Hospital. Results: A total of 72 patients underwent surgery between March and April 2019 and 36 between March and April 2020 for acute appendicitis and cholecystitis. The average length of stay was comparable in the two considered years for LA (4.231.69 days in 2019 versus 4.52.33 days in 2020). The average length of stay in patients with acute cholecystitis was 5.93.8 days in 2019 and 8.235.5 days in 2020(P=0.038). The average hospitalization was comparable with 2019 data (5.623.77 days)n March 2020;whereas, April 2020 was statistically significantly longer 10.56 days (P= 0.023).

Chrononutrition is an integral part of metabolism, pancreatic function, and hormone secretion. Eating most calories and carbohydrates at lunch time and early afternoon, avoiding late evening dinner, and keeping consistent number of daily meals and relative times of eating occasions seem to play a pivotal role for postprandial glycemia and insulin sensitivity. Sequence of meals and nutrients also play a significant role, as foods of low density such as vegetables, salads, or soups consumed first, followed by protein and then by starchy foods lead to ameliorated glycemic and insulin responses. There are several dietary schemes available, such as intermittent fasting regimes, which may improve glycemic and insulin responses. Weight loss is important for the treatment of insulin resistance, and it can be achieved by many approaches, such as low-fat, low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean-style diets, etc. Lifestyle interventions with small weight loss (7C10%), 150 min of weekly moderate intensity exercise and behavioral therapy approach can be highly effective in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes. Similarly, decreasing carbohydrates in meals also improves significantly glycemic and insulin responses, but the extent of this reduction should be individualized, patient-centered, and monitored. Alternative foods or ingredients, such as vinegar, yogurt, whey protein, peanuts and tree nuts should also be considered in ameliorating postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.

Multilateral institutions, bilateral arrangements, and philanthropies have historically privileged economic development over health concerns. That focus has resulted in weak health systems and inadequate preparedness when there are outbreaks of diseases. This review aims to understand the politics of disease control in Africa and global health diplomacys (GHDs) critical role. Methods: A literature review was done in Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google scholar search engines. Keywords included MeSH and common terms related to the topics: \\"Politics,\\" \\"disease control,\\" \\"epidemics/ endemics,\\" and \\"global health diplomacy\\" in the \\"African\\" context. The resources also included reports of World Health Organization, United Nations and resolutions of the World Health Assembly (WHA). Results: African countries continue to struggle in their attempts to build health systems for disease control that are robust enough to tackle the frequent epidemics that plague the continent. The politics of disease control requires the crafting of cooperative partnerships to accommodate the divergent interests of multiple actors. Recent outbreaks of COVID-19 and Ebola had a significant impact on African economies. It is extremely important to prioritize health in the African development agendas. The African Union (AU) should leverage the momentum of the rise of GHD to (i) navigate the politics of global health governance in an interconnected world(ii) develop robust preparedness and disease response strategies to tackle emerging and reemerging disease epidemics in the region (iii) address the linkages between health and broader human security issues driven by climate change-induced food, water, and other insecurities (iv) mobilize resources and capacities to train health officials in the craft of diplomacy. Conclusion: The AU, Regional Economic Communities (RECs), and African Centres for Disease Control should harmonize their plans and strategies and align them towards a common goal that integrates health in African development agendas.

Echinacoside, a naturally occurring phenol extracted from Cistanche tubulosa, Echinacea angustifolia, and Cistanche spp, has a wide range of physiological effects, such as antioxidation, neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulation, which are closely related to depression. In addition, echinacoside can activate protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular signalCregulated kinase (ERK), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. A key downstream event of the Akt, ERK, and BDNF signaling pathways, namely mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, plays a crucial role in generating an rapid antidepressant effect. Thus, echinacoside is a promising therapeutic agent for depression. However, research regarding the role of echinacoside in antidepressant effect and brain mTOR activation remains lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The forced swimming test and Western blot analysis in C57BL/6 mice was used to investigate the antidepressant-like activities of echinacoside and the underlying mechanism involved in-amino3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)CAkt/ERKCmTOR pathway. RESULTS: We confirmed the suggestions by previous reports that echinacoside activates Akt/ERK signaling and further demonstrated that echinacoside could provide antidepressant-like effects in mice via the activation of AMPARCAkt/ERKCmTOR pathway in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to reveal that echinacoside is a potential treatment for depressive disorders.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke is not a single disease but can be caused by a wide range of risk factors, disease processes and mechanisms. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, although its contribution differs for different subtypes. Most (85%) strokes are ischaemic, predominantly caused by small vessel arteriolosclerosis, cardioembolism and large artery athero-thromboembolism. Ischaemic strokes in younger patients can result from a different spectrum of causes such as extracranial dissection. Approximately 15% of strokes worldwide are the result of intracerebral haemorrhage, which can be deep (basal ganglia, brainstem), cerebellar or lobar. Deep haemorrhages usually result from deep perforator (hypertensive) arteriopathy (arteriolosclerosis), while lobar haemorrhages are mainly caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy or arteriolosclerosis. A minority (about 20%) of intracerebral haemorrhages are caused by macrovascular lesions (vascular malformations, aneurysms, cavernomas), venous sinus thrombosis or rarer causes; these are particularly important in young patients (<50 years).

Vaccine-promoting policymaking for public engagement is a prerequisite for social mobilization. However, making an informed and judicious choice is a dilemma for the Chinese government in the vaccine promotion context. OBJECTIVE: In this study, public opinions in China were analyzed via dialogues on Chinese social media, based on which Chinese netizens views on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination were investigated. We also aimed to develop strategies for promoting vaccination programs in China based on an in-depth understanding of the challenges in risk communication and social mobilization. METHODS: We proposed a novel behavioral dynamics model, SRS/I (susceptible-reading-susceptible/immune), to analyze opinion transmission paradigms on Chinese social media. Coupled with a meta-analysis and natural language processing techniques, the emotion polarity of individual opinions was examined in their given context. RESULTS: We collected more than 1.75 million Weibo messages about COVID-19 vaccines from January to October 2020. According to the public opinion reproduction ratio (R(0)), the dynamic propagation of those messages can be classified into three periods: the ferment period (R(01)=1.1360), the revolution period (R(02)=2.8278), and the transmission period (R(03)=3.0729). Topics on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China include price and side effects. From September to October, Weibo users claimed that the vaccine was overpriced, making up 18.3% (n=899) of messages; 38.1% (n=81,909) of relevant topics on Weibo received likes. On the contrary, the number of messages that considered the vaccine to be reasonably priced was twice as high but received fewer likes, accounting for 25.0% (n=53,693). In addition, we obtained 441 (47.7%) positive and 295 (31.9%) negative Weibo messages about side effects. Interestingly, inactivated vaccines instigated more heated discussions than any other vaccine type. The discussions, forwards, comments, and likes associated with topics related to inactivated vaccines accounted for 53% (n=588), 42% (n=3072), 56% (n=3671), and 49% (n=17,940), respectively, of the total activity associated with the five types of vaccines in China. CONCLUSIONS: Most Chinese netizens believe that the vaccine is less expensive than previously thought, while some claim they cannot afford it for their entire family. The findings demonstrate that Chinese individuals are inclined to be positive about side effects over time and are proud of Chinas involvement with vaccine development. Nevertheless, they have a collective misunderstanding about inactivated vaccines, insisting that inactivated vaccines are safer than other vaccines.

It has made a major contribution to medical image analysis as it overcomes the data scarcity problem as well as it saves time and hardware resources. However, transfer learning has been arbitrarily configured in the majority of studies. This review paper attempts to provide guidance for selecting a model and TL approaches for the medical image classification task. METHODS: 425 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from two databases, PubMed and Web of Science, published in English, up until December 31, 2020. Articles were assessed by two independent reviewers, with the aid of a third reviewer in the case of discrepancies. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for the paper selection and 121 studies were regarded as eligible for the scope of this review. We investigated articles focused on selecting backbone models and TL approaches including feature extractor, feature extractor hybrid, fine-tuning and fine-tuning from scratch. RESULTS: The majority of studies (n = 57) empirically evaluated multiple models followed by deep models (n = 33) and shallow (n = 24) models. Inception, one of the deep models, was the most employed in literature (n = 26). With respect to the TL, the majority of studies (n = 46) empirically benchmarked multiple approaches to identify the optimal configuration. The rest of the studies applied only a single approach for which feature extractor (n = 38) and fine-tuning from scratch (n = 27) were the two most favored approaches. Only a few studies applied feature extractor hybrid (n = 7) and fine-tuning (n = 3) with pretrained models. CONCLUSION: The investigated studies demonstrated the efficacy of transfer learning despite the data scarcity.

We investigated the relationship between their NLR and HOMA-IR values by bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. As insulin use could results in inaccurate HOMA-IR estimation, we excluded them and ran the analyses in subgroup analyses. Results: There was a relationship shown when insulin users were included, having a beta coefficient value of 0.010 (95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.003-0.017). However, when insulin users were excluded, the beta value decreased to 0.004 (95% CI of -0.006-0.015). The statistical significance was not reached when age, sex, and body mass index were adjusted for in the multivariate analyses. Conclusion: There is no visible relationship between IR and NLR in the general population. IR might not explain the variation of NLR value in healthy people, and further studies are needed to reveal the associated factor of high NLR.","output":"The Relationship Between Insulin Resistance Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People living with chronic pain experience multiple challenges in their daily activities. Chronic pain is complex and often provokes life circumstances that create increased social isolation. Living with chronic pain during the pandemic may add additional layers of complexity to their daily lives. The researchers endeavored to explore the experiences of people living with chronic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers conducted semi-structured, open-ended interviews about how the pandemic influenced participants lives. The interviews were recorded and analyzed using an applied philosophical hermeneutics approach. The findings were feeling socially isolated, losing their sense of livinghood, and experiencing augmented stress levels which, in most cases, aggravated their chronic pain. In addition to gaining an in-depth understanding of the needs of people living with chronic pain, these findings may guide policy decisions with the intention of improving health care access and the overall experiences of people living with chronic conditions during a pandemic.","output":"The Experiences of People Living With Chronic Pain During a Pandemic: Crumbling Dreams With Uncertain Futures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 has been a game changer in many aspects of medical care, including laparoscopic surgery service.

First, the following hypotheses are proposed. I: in addition to the confirmed cases and deaths, people suspected of being infected are also involved in the spread of the epidemic. II: patients who have been cured may also develop secondary infections, so it is considered that there is still a link between cured cases and the spread of the epidemic. III: only the relevant data of the previous day is used to predict the epidemic prevention and control of the next day. Then, the epidemic data from February 1st to February 15th in X province were selected as the control. The combined neural network model is used for prevention and control prediction, and the prediction results of the traditional neural network model are compared. The results show that the predictions of the daily new cases by the five neural network models have little difference with the actual value, and the trend is basically consistent. However, there are still differences in some time nodes. The errors of neural network 1 on the 6th and network 3 on the 13th are large. The accuracy of the combined neural network prediction model is high, and there is little difference between the result and the actual value at each time node. The prediction of the cumulative number of diagnoses per day of the five neural network models is also analyzed, and the results are relatively ideal. In addition, the accuracy of the combined neural network prediction model is high, and the difference between the result and the actual value at each time node is relatively small. It is found that the standard deviations of neural networks 2 and 3 are relatively high through the comparison of the deviations. The deviation means of the five models were all relatively low, and the mean deviation and standard deviation of the combined neural network model are the lowest. It is found that the accuracy of prediction on the epidemic spread in this province is good by comparing the performance of each neural network model. Regarding various indicators, the prediction accuracy of the combined neural network model is higher than that of the other four models, and its performance is also the best. Finally, the MSE of the improved neural network model is lower compared with the traditional neural network model. Moreover, with the change of learning times, the change trend of MSE is constant (P <0.05 for all). In short, the improved neural network blade model has better performance compared with that of the traditional neural network blade model. The prediction results of the epidemic situation are accurate, and the application effect is remarkable, so the proposed model is worthy of further promotion and application in the medical field.","output":"Adoption of Improved Neural Network Blade Pattern Recognition in Prevention and Control of Corona Virus Disease-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we present a fully stochastic model of performance analysis of single- and multi-carrier modulations (SCM and MCM) in communication systems affected by impulsive noise. The key performance parameter of the model is the symbol error rate (SER), which is fully determined as a function of the system parameters, including the frame length, symbol power, white noise power, impulsive noise power, and the probability of the impulse events. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the systems and compare them with simulation results, showing very good agreement for all the impulsive noise scenarios. Specifically, we show under which conditions a MCM system performs better than a SCM system, and vice versa, which can be used to apply an optimal control policy that minimizes SER. The developed model for SCM and MCM systems is conceptually applied to the Covid-19 phenomenology, and consequently the results obtained for SCM and MCM scenarios, are interpreted as decision and management of social distancing (lock/roam) policies. Specifically, we also show under which conditions the \\"roam\\" strategy performs better than the \\"lock\\" strategy, and vice versa, which can be used to develop an optimal control policy that minimizes the mortality rate (MR).

Notable features that make SARS-CoV-2 distinct from most other previously identified betacoronaviruses include a receptor binding domain and a unique insertion of 12 nucleotides or 4 amino acids (PRRA) at the S1/S2 boundary. In this study, we identified two deletion variants of SARS-CoV-2 that either directly affect the polybasic cleavage site itself (NSPRRAR) or a flanking sequence (QTQTN). These deletions were verified by multiple sequencing methods. In vitro results showed that the deletion of NSPRRAR likely does not affect virus replication in Vero and Vero-E6 cells; however, the deletion of QTQTN may restrict late-phase viral replication. The deletion of QTQTN was detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and 12 of 24 in vitro-isolated viruses, while the deletion of NSPRRAR was identified in 3 in vitro-isolated viruses. Our data indicate that (i) there may be distinct selection pressures on SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro and in vivo; (ii) an efficient mechanism for deleting this region from the viral genome may exist, given that the deletion variant is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage; and (iii) the PRRA insertion, which is unique to SARS-CoV-2, is not fixed during virus replication in vitro. These findings provide information to aid further investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and a better understanding of the NSPRRAR deletion variant observed here. IMPORTANCE The spike protein determines the infectivity and host range of coronaviruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has two unique features in its spike protein, the receptor binding domain and an insertion of 12 nucleotides at the S1/S2 boundary resulting in a furin-like cleavage site. Here, we identified two deletion variants of SARS-CoV-2 that either directly affect the furin-like cleavage site itself (NSPRRAR) or a flanking sequence (QTQTN), and we investigated these deletions in cell isolates and clinical samples. The absence of the polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 did not affect virus replication in Vero or Vero-E6 cells. Our data indicate the PRRAR sequence and the flanking QTQTN sequence are not fixed in vitro; thus, there appears to be distinct selection pressures on SARS-CoV-2 sequences in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation of the mechanism of generating these deletion variants and their infectivity in different animal models would improve our understanding of the origin and evolution of this virus.","output":"Identification of Common Deletions in the Spike Protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with worse outcome in patients with infection However, the epidemiological feature of AKamong patients wit","output":"The Incidence, Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: A Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter presents a survey of some recent methods used in economics and finance to account for cyclical dependence and account for their multifaced dynamics: nonlinearities, extreme events, asymmetries, non-stationarity, time-varying moments.

However, mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated thrombo-coagulopathy, and its impact on patient morbidity and mortality, are still poorly understood. Methods: We performed a comprehensive analysis of coagulation and thromboinflammatory factors in plasma from COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. Furthermore, we assessed the functional impact of these factors on clot formation and clot lysis. Results: Across all COVID-19 disease severities (mild, moderate and severe) we observed a significant increase (6-fold) in the concentration of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (UL-VWF) multimers compared to healthy controls. This is likely the result of an interleukin (IL)-6 driven imbalance of VWF and the regulatory protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13). Upregulation of this key pro-coagulant pathway may also be influenced by the observed increase (~6-fold) in plasma -defensins, a consequence of increased numbers of neutrophils and neutrophil activation. Markers of endothelial, platelet and leukocyte activation were accompanied by increased plasma concentrations of Factor XIII (FXIII) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1. In patients with high FXIII we observed alteration of the fibrin network structure in in vitro assays of clot formation, which coupled with increased PAI-1, prolonged the time to clot lysis by the t-PA/plasmin fibrinolytic pathway by 52% across all COVID-19 patients (n=23). Conclusions: We show that an imbalance in the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis causing increased VWF reactivity may contribute to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients. Through immune and inflammatory responses, COVID-19 also alters the balance of factors involved in fibrin generation and fibrinolysis which accounts for the persistent fibrin deposition previously observed in post-mortem lung tissue.","output":"Severity-stratified and longitudinal analysis of VWF/ADAMTS13 imbalance, altered fibrin crosslinking and inhibition of fibrinolysis as contributors to COVID-19 coagulopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Regional or distant metastases from melanoma may be surgically resected, but remain at high-risk of recurrence.

Those antibodies exert a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, whose evolution overtime after COVID-19 as well as efficiency against novel variants are however poorly characterized. METHODS: In this prospective study, sera of 107 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected at 3- and 6-months post-infection. We performed quantitative neutralization experiments on top of high-throughput serological assays evaluating anti-Spike (S) and anti-Nucleocapsid (NP) IgG. FINDINGS: Levels of sero-neutralization and IgG rates against the ancestral strain decreased significantly over time. After 6 months, 2.8% of the patients had a negative serological status for both anti-S and anti-NP IgG. However, all sera had a persistent and effective neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2. IgG levels correlated with sero-neutralization and this correlation was stronger for anti-S than for anti-NP antibodies. The level of sero-neutralization quantified at 6 months correlated with markers of initial severity, notably admission in intensive care units and the need for mechanical invasive ventilation. In addition, sera collected at 6 months were tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and showed efficient neutralizing effects against D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants but a significantly weaker activity against B.1.351 variant. INTERPRETATION: Decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19.

Despite the harmful effects of pain, ED care often falls short of providing timely and effective pain relief. Knowledge translation research targeting systems of care holds potential to transform paediatric pain care. This article reports on the first stages of an implementation project aimed at embedding effective and sustainable practice change in an Australian childrens hospital ED. METHODS: The integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework underpinned a cooperative process of engagement to establish a practitioner-led, interprofessional research collaborative. The Kids Pain Collaborative (KPC) aimed to co-design innovation in paediatric ED pain care, facilitating an extensive reconnaissance of research evidence, clinician and family experiences, and local evaluation data. This critical appraisal of the context and culture of pain management generated foci for innovation and facilitation of implementation action cycles. RESULTS: Engaging in a complex process of facilitated critical reflection, the KPC unpacked deeply embedded assumptions and organisational practices for pain care that worked against what they wanted to achieve as a team. A culture of rules-based pain management and command and control leadership produced self-defeating practices and ultimately breakdowns in pain care. By raising a critical awareness of context, and building consensus on the evidence for change, the KPC has established a whole of ED shared vision for prioritising pain care. CONCLUSIONS: In-depth key stakeholder collaboration and appraisal of context is the first step in innovation of practice change. The KPC provided a space for collaborative enquiry where ED clinicians and researchers could develop context-specific innovation and implementation strategy.

Primary care can play a key role in early detection and contention of the disease. There is lack of information on the clinical profile of suspected Covid-19 primary care patients and controversy on the effectiveness of rapid serologic tests in the diagnosis and surveillance of the disease. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of rapid serologic testing in detection and surveillance of Covid-19 cases in primary care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal study based on non-random sample of 522 participants including 304 symptomatic patients and 218 high-risk asymptomatic individuals receiving care at four primary health clinics in an underserved area in Santiago. METHOD: Participants were systematically assessed and tested for Covid-19 with RT-PCR and serology at baseline and followed clinically and serologically for a three weeks period. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 cases was 3.5 times higher in symptomatic patients (27.5% (22.1-32.8; 95% CI) compared to asymptomatic participants (7.9% (4.3-11.6; 95% CI).

Epitopes within these sites have been identified on the basis of cross-reactivity of MAb-resistant mutants against the panel of MAbs, determined by plaque assays and Western blotting. Site A contains three non-overlapping epitopes (A1, A2 and A3). A1 is the only linear epitope; all remaining epitopes are conformational. MAbs which react with epitopes A2 and A3 inhibit neuraminidase activity (NA) when assayed with neuraminlactose. Site B contains three partially overlapping epitopes (B1, B2 and B3) and site C is represented by a single epitope (C1). HN gene sequence analysis of MAb-resistant mutants showed that they each had only single amino acid substitutions which range from amino acid residues 347C460 for site A, 284C325 for site B, and at 481 for the Cl epitope.

In those who reported decreased masturbation activity, the main causes were poor privacy (46.4%) and lack of desire (34.7%). We found that men presented lower SD during the quarantine, than women (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Potentially, the more time available might lead couples to reconnect at an intimate level and to improve their sexuality. However, the majority of quarantined participants experienced reduced number of SI per week, with poor household privacy and lack of psychological stimuli as cited causes, even as a majority did not report reduced autoeroticism.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on sexual life in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Information regarding multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with COVID-19 is scarce. The study objective is to describe the incidence and characteristics of MS patients with COVID-19, to identify susceptibility and severity risk factors, and to assess the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 serologies according to disease modifying treatments (DMTs). METHODS Retrospective study of an MS cohort analysing data collected between February and May 2020. Cases were identified through an email survey and clinical visits. We examined the relationship of demographic and MS characteristics with COVID-19 and of the DMTs with SARS-CoV-2 serostatus. RESULTS We collected data from 48 suspected cases out of 758 valid respondents and from 45 COVID-19 cases identified through clinical visits. Incidence was 6.3%. Nineteen(20.3%) patients were hospitalized and 2(2.2%) died. Multivariable models determined that age (odds ratio per 10 years:0.53[95% CI,0.34-0.85]), contact with a confirmed case (OR:197.02[56.36-688.79]), residence in Barcelona (OR:2.23[1.03-4.80]), MS duration (OR per 5y:1.41[1.09-1.83]), and time on anti-CD20-treatment (OR per 2y: 3.48[1.44-8.45]) were independent factors for presenting COVID-19 and age (OR per 10y:2.71[1.13-6.53]) for a severe COVID-19. Out of the 79 (84.9%) with serological test, 45.6% generated antibodies, but only 17.6% of those on anti-CD20 therapies. Lymphopenia or immunoglobulins levels did not relate with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS MS patients present similar incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for COVID-19 than the general population.

Those with a high psychological burden have been shown to have the worst prognosis, and are consequently most likely to be referred to tertiary care. The Covid-19 pandemic caused significant disruption to tertiary services and affected the mental health of the nation, however there is minimal data on the effects on patients with IBS in tertiary care. We therefore compared the symptom profiles of tertiary referrals with refractory IBS, 12-months before, and 12-months after the onset of Covid-19 restrictions in the UK.MethodsAs part of their routine care, all patients with refractory IBS referred to the tertiary service before and after the Covid-19 pandemic prospectively completed a series of questionnaires during their baseline consultation including;IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS), non-colonic symptom score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD), and Quality of Life (QoL). Demographic data and symptom profiles were compared between patients seen in the 12 months before the pandemic (22/03/2019 - 22/03/2020) with those seen in the 12-months after (23/03/2020 - 23/03/2021), using non-parametric tests.ResultsOverall, 190 patients (median age 43 years, n=157 (82.6%) female, 41.0% IBS-C, 24.7% IBS-D, IBS-M 33.7% and 0.5% IBS-U) with refractory IBS were included. Compared to those seen in the 12-months before the pandemic (n=107), the cohort seen during the Covid-19 pandemic (n=83) had a significantly higher median IBS-SSS (318 vs. 352, p=0.03), and more extra-intestinal symptoms (non-colonic score: 225 vs. 269, p=0.03). During the pandemic, median abdominal pain (50 vs. 63, p=0.05) and abdominal distension scores (60 vs. 75, p=0.008) were significantly higher, and patients that were unmarried had a higher median IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS: 320 vs. 359, p=0.03). Interestingly, those seen during the pandemic had more difficulty with sleep (53 vs. 68, p=0.03), and more feelings of helplessness and loss of control (50 vs. 70, p=0.02), compared to those seen before the pandemic. There was no difference in the levels of anxiety and depression between the pre and post lockdown groups (HAD-Anxiety: 11 vs. 11.5, p=0.96;HAD-Depression: 8 vs. 8, p=0.84).ConclusionsThis study has shown for the first time that patients seen in tertiary care with refractory IBS during the covid-19 pandemic had a significantly higher symptom burden emphasising the importance of gut-brain axis in IBS.

The effects of processing conditions such as: (1) binder saturation rates (55%, 100% and 150%), and (2) isothermal sintering temperatures (1000 C to 1200 C) on the porosity of 316L stainless steel parts were studied. By varying the processing conditions, porosity of 40% to 45% were achieved. To further increase the porosity values of 316L stainless steel parts, 30 vol. % (or 6 wt. %) of PMMA space holder particles were added to the 3D printing feedstock and porosity values of 57% to 61% were achieved. Mercury porosimetry results indicated pore sizes less than 40 m for all the binder jetting processed 316L stainless steel parts.

Retroviruses are unique among viruses in that they show an alternation of generations between a diploid free living phase and a haploid integrated phase. Retroviruses engage in extensive recombination during the synthesis of the haploid DNA provirus. Whereas reverse transcription generates large amounts of sequence variation, DNA transcription is a high-fidelity process. Retroviruses come under strong selection pressures from immune systems to generate escape mutants, and reverse transcription into the haploid DNA phase serves to generate diversity followed by a phase of transcriptional clonal expansion during the restoration of diploidy from a stable, long lived, DNA encoded provirus.","output":"The greater than twofold cost of integration for retroviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior teleneuropsychological research has assessed the reliability between in-person and remote administration of cognitive assessments.

For particles in the submicron range the efficiency depends on the material properties of the masks, though generally the filtration efficiency in this regime varies between 30 to 60 % and multi-layered cotton masks are expected to be comparable to surgical masks. Respiratory droplets are conventionally divided into coarse droplets (> 5-10 micron) responsible for droplet transmission and aerosols (< 5-10 micron) responsible for airborne transmission. Masks are thus expected to be highly effective at preventing droplet transmission, with their effectiveness limited only by the mask fit, compliance and appropriate usage. By contrast, knowledge of the size distribution of bioaerosols and the likelihood that they contain virus is essential to understanding their effectiveness in preventing airborne transmission. We argue from literature data on SARS-CoV-2 viral loads that the finest aerosols (< 1 micron) are unlikely to contain even a single virion in the majority of cases; we thus expect masks to be effective at reducing the risk of airborne transmission in most settings.","output":"How effective are face coverings in reducing transmission of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic that is taking a heavy toll on several countries.

OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to formulate expectations with regard to the sustainability of online mental health care after COVID-19. METHODS: In an interview study, 11 mental health care professionals were asked about their experiences and expectations for the future. Participants were recruited from a mental health care organization in the Netherlands. The interviews took place between April 7-30, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND Diabetes affects both large and small vessels in the brain, but the dynamic process and mechanism are unclear. METHODS We investigated the structural and functional changes of brain vasculature in living hyperglycemic rats and their impact on stroke outcomes via a novel technique: synchrotron radiation angiography. We also examined the effect of prolonged fasudil treatment on arterial reactivity and hemorrhagic transformation. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were treated by streptozotocin to induce type 1 diabetes. These hyperglycemic rats received fasudil pretreatment and then underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS We found that diabetes caused arteries narrowing in the circus Willis as early as 2 weeks after streptozotocin injection (P < 0.05). These vessels were further constricted after middle cerebral artery occlusion. L-NAME could induce regional constrictions and impaired relaxation in hyperglycemic animals. Furthermore, hemorrhagic transformation was also increased in the hyperglycemic rats compared to the control (P < 0.05). In fasudil-treated rats, the internal carotid artery narrowing was ameliorated and L-NAME-induced regional constriction was abolished. Importantly, stroke prognosis was improved in fasudil-treated rats compared to the control (P < 0.05).

We hypothesized that CXCR7 expression affects proliferation and migration of MSCs. In present study, we constructed long-term and stable mMSCs lines overexpressing and suppressing CXCR7 modifications with lentiviral vectors. The transduction efficiencies, mRNA and protein expression of CXCR7 were significantly regulated. CXCR7 gene overexpression promoted mMSCs proliferation and migration, whereas suppressing CXCR7 had the opposite effect. Additional CXCL12 improved the vertical migration of mMSCs. The overexpression of CXCR7 increased the MSC-secreted CXCL12, VCAM-1, CD44 and MMP2 levels, which contributed to the improvement of mMSC proliferation and migration. Therefore, overexpressing CXCR7 improved the proliferation and migration of mMSCs, which may be attributable to the CXCL12 secreted by MSCs, leading to a positive feedback loop for CXCL12/CXCR7 axis. Our results may provide a potential method for improving the treatment effectiveness of mMSCs by overexpressing CXCR7.","output":"Chemokine receptor 7 overexpression promotes mesenchymal stem cell migration and proliferation via secreting Chemokine ligand 12"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We conducted two World Health Organization-commissioned reviews to inform use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) We synthesized the evidence regarding efficacy and safety (review 1), as well as risks of droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, and associated transmission (review 2) of viral products SOURCE: Literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese databases, and medRxiv Review 1: we synthesized results from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFNC to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure Review 2: we narratively summarized findings from studies evaluating droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, or infection transmission associated with HFNC For both reviews, paired reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment We evaluated certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: No eligible studies included COVID-19 patients Review 1: 12 RCTs (n = 1,989 patients) provided low-certainty evidence that HFNC may reduce invasive ventilation (relative risk [RR], 0 85;95% confidence interval [CI], 0 74 to 0 99) and escalation of oxygen therapy (RR, 0 71;95% CI, 0 51 to 0 98) in patients with respiratory failure Results provided no support for differences in mortality (moderate certainty), or in-hospital or intensive care length of stay (moderate and low certainty, respectively) Review 2: four studies evaluating droplet dispersion and three evaluating aerosol generation and dispersion provided very low certainty evidence Two simulation studies and a crossover study showed mixed findings regarding the effect of HFNC on droplet dispersion Although two simulation studies reported no associated increase in aerosol dispersion, one reported that higher flow rates were associated with increased regions of aerosol density CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal cannula may reduce the need for invasive ventilation and escalation of therapy compared with COT in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure This benefit must be balanced against the unknown risk of airborne transmission","output":"Les canules nasales  haut dbit pour le traitement de l'insuffisance respiratoire hypoxmique aigu? chez les patients atteints de la COVID-19: comptes rendus systmatiques de l'efficacit et des risques d'arosolisation, de dispersion et de transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines briefly why the Indian economy was slowing pre-pandemic.

In addition, these vulnerable groups frequently have greater difficulty accessing health services and in treatment adherence. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of the COVID-19Crelated lockdown on service utilisation and follow-up adherence in an Italian mental health outpatient service for migrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties. STUDY DESIGN: The design of this study is a retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: All patients who visited the mental health outpatient service in the months of February and March in the years 2017C2020 were included in the study. To compare service utilisation before and after the lockdown, the number of patients who visited the mental health outpatient service for psychiatric interview were recorded. Follow-up adherence was calculated as the percentage of patients who visited in February and subsequently attended a follow-up visit in March of the same year. RESULTS: The number of patients who visited the outpatient service between February 2017 and February 2020 was continuously increasing. In March 2020, fewer patients visited the service for psychiatric interview, in line with the introduction of lockdown measures. In addition, the number of the patients who visited in February 2020 and returned for their follow-up visits in March 2020 declined from approximately 30% over the same months in 2017C2019 to 17.53% in March 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown-related reduction in numbers of patients accessing the mental health service makes it difficult to help vulnerable populations during a period of time in which their mental health needs are expected to increase. Moreover, the reduction seen in follow-up compliance increases the risk of treatment discontinuation and possible relapse. Proactive alternative strategies need to be developed to reach these vulnerable populations.","output":"Negative impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health service access and follow-up adherence for immigrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A survey was conducted through a web link on the students and staff of the Universit degli Studi di Milano, Italy in the period 14-30 April 2020. It was anonymous at the source and included history of COVID-19-related questions (fever, headache, cold, cough, anosmia, gastrointestinal complaints and separately fever over 38.5C) in the previous three weeks, and similar information on cohabitants. A total of 14 374 subjects were included. Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5C; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5C was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85). There was a strong association between symptoms in the respondent and in cohabitants: 64% of subjects with symptoms reported at least one cohabitant with symptoms, compared to 14% of asymptomatic subjects (OR = 11.4, 95% CI, 10.4-12.6). The lower risk of serious symptoms in women, and the strong intra-nucleus of cohabitation contagiousness are an indication that at least part of the symptoms was caused by a new pathogen - SARS-CoV-2. These data, therefore, suggest that the number of persons affected by COVID-19 was much greater in northern Italy than the number of recorded cases.

Molecular methods were used to investigate the genetic relatedness and carbapenem resistance mechanisms of a collection of 203 non-repetitive XDR-PA isolates available for study. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 52 genotypes were observed; one predominant genotype (pulsotype 1) was found in 57.6% of the isolates. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses demonstrated that one horizontally acquired mechanism [metallo--lactamase (MBL) genes] and two mutational mechanisms (efflux and porins) accounted for the carbapenem resistance. The most predominant horizontally acquired mechanism was carriage of bla(VIM-3), which was found in 61.1% of isolates. Decreased expression of oprD was the most prevalent mutational mechanism and was found in 70.0% of the XDR-PA isolates, whereas overexpression of mexA was found in 27.6% of the isolates. The highlight of this study was the discovery of statistically significant relationships between certain horizontally acquired and mutational resistance mechanisms and their contribution to carbapenem susceptibility. MBL-producers expressed significantly lower MexAB and higher OprD than non-MBL-producers. Amongst isolates without an acquired -lactamase gene, oprD expression was significantly reduced, whilst expression of efflux pumps was increased. Reduced OprD expression alone or the production of VIM-type MBLs showed similar contributions to a low to intermediate MIC(50) (minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms) for carbapenems. Isolates with reduced OprD expression that simultaneously harboured bla(VIM) exhibited high levels of resistance to carbapenems, which implied that these two mechanisms had a synergistic effect on the MICs.","output":"Interplay between mutational and horizontally acquired resistance mechanisms and its association with carbapenem resistance amongst extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: More than a quarter of the UK population are affected by depression during their lifetime. For major trauma patients, postinjury depression can result in poorer long-term outcomes, but there is limited evidence regarding outcomes for patients with pre-existing depression. This study investigated the relationship between a diagnosis of depression prior to hospital admission and clinical outcomes after major trauma. METHODS: Trauma patients at a UK major trauma center were identified during a 6.5-year period using the Trauma Audit and Research Network database. Patients with Injury Severity Score >15 who did not die in the emergency department (ED) were included. Logistic regression models were used to compare in-hospital mortality (excluding ED), requirement for surgery, and length of stay (LOS) between those with depression and those without. RESULTS: There were 4602 patients included in the study and 6.45% had a diagnosis of depression. Depression was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91; p=0.026). However, patients with depression were more likely to have longer LOS (OR 124, 95% CI 8.5 to 1831; p<0.001) and intensive care unit LOS (OR 9.69, 95% CI 3.14 to 29.9; p<0.001). Patients with depression were also more likely to undergo surgery (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.75; p=0.016). DISCUSSION: A pre-existing diagnosis of depression has complex association with clinical outcomes after major trauma, with reduced mortality but longer LOS and higher likelihood of surgical intervention. Further prospective investigations are warranted to inform optimal management strategies for major trauma patients with pre-existing depression.

Making this experience more humanized requires the chatbot to understand natural language and express itself using natural language. One crucial step to achieve this is to label the data with intentions and entities. After labeling, one can use the labeled data to train a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component. The NLU component interprets the text extracting the intentions and entities present in that text. Manually label the data is an onerous and impracticable process due to the high volume of data. Thus, an unsupervised machine learning technique, such as data clustering, is usually used to find patterns in the data and thereby label them. For this task, it is essential to have an effective vector embedding representation of texts that depicts the semantic information and helps the machine understand the context, intent, and other nuances of the entire text. In this paper, we perform an extensive evaluation of different text embedding models for clustering, labeling, and training an NLU model using the text of attendances from the Coronavirus Platform Service of Ceara, Brazil.

Previously, we have identified a transcription initiation site (for mRNA 2-1), which is more efficiently transcribed by viruses containing two copies of UCUAA sequence in the leader RNA than by those with three copies. In this study, we have identified several sites which are regulated in the opposite way, namely, they are efficiently transcribed by the leader RNA with three UCUAA copies but not by those with two copies. These sites were characterized by primer extension and amplification by polymerase chain reaction. One of these sites is in the gene 3 region of a recombinant virus between A59 and JHM strains of MHV. Another is in the gene 2 region of MHV-1 strain. Both of these sites have a sequence similar to but different from the consensus transcription initiation signal (UCUAAUCUAUC and UUUAAUCUU, as opposed to UCUAAAC). These two novel intergenic sequences are not present in the genome of the JHM strain, consistent with the absence of these mRNAs in the JHM-infected cells. The discovery of this type of transcription initiation site provides additional evidence for the importance of the leader RNA in the transcription initiation of MHV mRNAs.","output":"Coronavirus mRNA synthesis: Identification of novel transcription initiation signals which are differentially regulated by different leader sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To prospectively evaluate interferences between viruses of the upper respiratory tract in asymptomatic preschool children.

Most humans exhibit reduced appetites under high temperature and high humidity (HTHH) conditions, and HTHH environments favor fungal growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that the colonic mycobiota may affect the hosts appetite under HTHH conditions. Changes in humidity are also associated with autoimmune diseases. In the current study mice were fed in an HTHH environment (32C  2C, relative humidity 95%) maintained via an artificial climate box for 8 hours per day for 21 days. Food intake, the colonic fungal microbiome, the feces metabolome, and appetite regulators were monitored. Components of the interleukin 17 pathway were also examined. In the experimental groups food intake and body weight were reduced, and the colonic mycobiota and fecal metabolome were substantially altered compared to control groups maintained at 25C  2C and relative humidity 65%. The appetite-related proteins LEPT and POMC were upregulated in the hypothalamus (p < 0.05), and NYP gene expression was downregulated (p < 0.05).

P. infestans was well quantified in eleven types of soil samples, including nine types of upland soils in Japan, that were artificially inoculated with a zoosporangia suspension. The amounts of P. infestans DNA estimated by the real-time PCR were proportional to the inoculum densities. In the non-controlled experimental potato field, P. infestans population densities in soil corresponded to the development of symptoms and were correlated with the number of lesions on the potato foliage. These results imply that the proposed real-time PCR assay is suitable for the estimation or monitoring of P. infestans population densities in upland soils in Japan. The population densities at the ridge bottoms were larger than those at any other location in commercial potato fields. These results were similar to those of a previous report using a bioassay. Moreover, a correlation between DNA quantity and inoculum potential was observed.

In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been shown that virus entry requires the endosomal protease cathepsin L; however, it was also found that infection of SARS-CoV could be strongly induced by trypsin treatment. Overall, in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion, proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein remains unclear. Here, we identify a proteolytic cleavage site within the SARS-CoV S2 domain (S2', R797). Mutation of R797 specifically inhibited trypsin-dependent fusion in both cell-cell fusion and pseudovirion entry assays. We also introduced a furin cleavage site at both the S2' cleavage site within S2 793-KPTKR-797 (S2'), as well as at the junction of S1 and S2. Introduction of a furin cleavage site at the S2' position allowed trypsin-independent cell-cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second furin cleavage site at the S1-S2 position. Taken together, these data suggest a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S2'), acting in concert with the S1-S2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity.","output":"Activation of the SARS coronavirus spike protein via sequential proteolytic cleavage at two distinct sites."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article offers a theoretical reflection on how the First Portuguese Football League is preparing to return to competition, after the suspension and mandatory confinement, as well as the security measures adopted in response to the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus.

Reliable measurement of these parameters would seem to be required for comparisons between devices, device selection at the time of clinical usage, as well as for research purposes. Because there is no standard method of measurement, our aim was to assess the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of PD measurements and of three different ways of measuring porosity. METHODS Six microphotographs of two fully deployed FDs were taken overlying two different millimetric reference grids: one flat and the other corrected to match the cylindrical stent. Standardized protocols for independently measuring PD and porosity according to three different methods were used by three trained observers and by the same observer twice. Bland-Altman plots and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to study the reliability of the measurements. RESULTS For porosity, satisfactory agreement occurred only when the same method of measurement was performed by the same observer. Intra-observer and inter-observer agreement were poor for measures of porosity when different methods were used (with differences in the range of 5-10%, ICC <0.6 for all methods). Measurement of PD was more reliable within (ICC 0.991 (0.946 to 0.999)) and between (ICC 0.945 (0.781 to 0.991)) observers.

This study aimed to characterize the relationship between neonatal brain development, cerebral oxygen delivery and neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with congenital heart disease. A cohort of infants with serious or critical congenital heart disease (N = 66; N = 62 born 37 weeks) underwent brain MRI before surgery on a 3T scanner situated on the neonatal unit. T2-weighted images were segmented into brain regions using a neonatal-specific algorithm. We generated normative curves of typical volumetric brain development using a data-driven technique applied to 219 healthy infants from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Atypicality indices, representing the degree of positive or negative deviation of a regional volume from the normative mean for a given gestational age, sex and postnatal age, were calculated for each infant with congenital heart disease. Phase contrast angiography was acquired in 53 infants with congenital heart disease and cerebral oxygen delivery was calculated. Cognitive and motor abilities were assessed at 22 months (N = 46) using the Bayley scales of Infant and Toddler DevelopmentCThird Edition. We assessed the relationship between atypicality indices, cerebral oxygen delivery and cognitive and motor outcome. Additionally, we examined whether cerebral oxygen delivery was associated with neurodevelopmental outcome through the mediating effect of brain volume. Negative atypicality indices in deep grey matter were associated with both reduced neonatal cerebral oxygen delivery and poorer cognitive abilities at 22 months across the whole sample. In infants with congenital heart disease born 37 weeks, negative cortical grey matter and total tissue volume atypicality indices, in addition to deep grey matter structures, were associated with poorer cognition. There was a significant indirect relationship between cerebral oxygen delivery and cognition through the mediating effect of negative deep grey matter atypicality indices across the whole sample. In infants born 37 weeks, cortical grey matter and total tissue volume atypicality indices were also mediators of this relationship. In summary, lower cognitive abilities in toddlers with congenital heart disease were associated with smaller grey matter volumes before cardiac surgery. The aetiology of poor cognition may encompass poor cerebral oxygen delivery leading to impaired grey matter growth. Interventions to improve cerebral oxygen delivery may promote early brain growth and improve cognitive outcomes in infants with congenital heart disease.","output":"Individualized brain development and cognitive outcome in infants with congenital heart disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As one of the most important economic zones in China, the energy demand of East China accounts for approximately 20% of the whole country.

They are often used interchangeably, but we pose the provocative question as to whether they should be. We review the literature to evaluate for any differences in efficacy between the two classes in order to determine if the greater side effects associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are offset by any advantageous effects on outcomes to warrant their use over angiotensin receptor blockers. RECENT FINDINGS: In many clinical scenarios, the data supports similar efficacy between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, while in a minority of others, there are murky signals from previous trials that suggest ACE inhibitors may be better. However, when reviewing the literature in its entirety, and taking into account recently published pooled analysis and head to head trials, it is reasonable to conclude that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have similar efficacy. This is in contrast to data on adverse effects, which consistently favors the use of ARBs. SUMMARY: From the available data, it is reasonable to conclude that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have equal efficacy yet unequal adverse effects. It is in this context that we take the provocative stance that ACE inhibitors should not be used to treat hypertension.","output":"Should Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ever Be Used for the Management of Hypertension?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and nurses are often the first to evaluate patients with pain and many patients depend on these clinicians for pain relief. The growing evidence supporting use of opioids for appropriately selected patients means that primary care practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding ever-evolving pain-management strategies. SCOPE This review summarizes core considerations in opioid prescribing in the primary care setting, the risks of undertreatment of pain, the challenges and barriers associated with prescribing opioids, identifying risk factors that may predict problematic use, and emerging formulation technologies expected to assist clinicians in better achieving effective pain control while minimizing risks for misuse or diversion. RESULTS Primary care physicians face considerable challenges in optimizing pain management while minimizing potential for misuse, abuse and diversion. Opioid treatment decisions are based not only on the type of pain but also the patient's psychosocial history, including a screening for predicting aberrant behaviors and, in some patients, substance abuse. New opioid formulations are available to assist clinicians in achieving adequate patient relief while reducing risk of tampering and abuse. Primary care practitioners need to be aware of these new options and integrate them into clinical treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS The strategic use of new opioid formulations and better patient assessment may lead to more successful use of opioids in the management of pain, while limiting or lowering the risk of the development of an addiction problem, abuse or diversion.","output":"Continuing evolution of opioid use in primary care practice: implications of emerging technologies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to study the dominant seepage channel of the third member of Weizhou formation (Ew(3)) in Weizhou 12-X oilfield, Weixinan Sag, Beibu Gulf Basin, and tap the potential of remaining oil.

As the results show, vertically,there are three anomalously high permeability zones in the A(1)(1), A(1)(2) and A(2)(1) micro-stage of the middle diagenetic stage, with the depth range of 2300 m ~ 2400 m, 2400 m ~ 2600 m, 2600 m ~ 2900 m respectively. Grain size, sorting, dissolution and early emplacement of hydrocarbons are the main causes of anomalously high permeability zones. Although both grain size and sorting affect porosity and permeability, the effect of grain size on permeability is stronger than sorting, and sorting has a stronger effect on porosity than grain size. Magmatic hydrothermal and organic acid promote dissolution and concomitant porosity and permeability increase by dissolving unstable minerals. The early emplacement of hydrocarbons retard the cementation and accompanying porosity and permeability reduction by reducing the water-rock ratio.

The identification of prognostic factors can help to improve the risk stratification of patients by promptly defining for each the most effective therapy to resolve the disease. The etiological agent causing COVID-19 is a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that enters cells via the ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a reduction in ACE2 levels, leading to an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and consequently, in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. ERAP1 and ERAP2 are two RAS regulators and key components of MHC class I antigen processing. Their polymorphisms have been associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, hypertension, and cancer. Based on their involvement in the RAS, we believe that the dysfunctional status of ERAP1 and ERAP2 enzymes may exacerbate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, aggravating the symptomatology and clinical outcome of the disease.

Furthermore, it is well known that proper nutrition can help support optimal immune function, reducing the impact of infections. Several vitamins and trace elements play an important role in supporting the cells of the immune system, thus increasing the resistance to infections. Other nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, help sustain optimal function of the immune system. The main aim of this manuscript is to discuss of the potential role of micronutrients supplementation in supporting immunity, particularly against respiratory virus infections. Literature analysis showed that in vitro and observational studies, and clinical trials, highlight the important role of vitamins A, C, and D, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in modulating the immune response. Supplementation with vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and zinc appears to be a safe and low-cost way to support optimal function of the immune system, with the potential to reduce the risk and consequences of infection, including viral respiratory infections. Supplementation should be in addition to a healthy diet and fall within recommended upper safety limits set by scientific expert bodies.

The aim of this study was to address the reliability of the often-used generic HRQOL screening questionnaire EuroQOL 5-dimension, 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) by comparing its normalized index value (calculated via the time trade-off method) and visual analog scale (VAS) to the gold standard of the extensive Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31). QOLIE-10 scores were compared with the extensive QOLIE-31 and EQ-5D-3L TTO. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a monocentric study of 184 patients with epilepsy. Bivariate Spearman correlation analysis and Fisher's r-to-z transformation were used to compare the strengths of correlations of EQ-5D-3L, QOLIE-10 and QOLIE-31 with different epilepsy-specific domains (disease severity, drug interactions, emotional well-being, stigmatization, seizure-related anxiety, cognitive impairment). RESULTS: The different metrics of EQ-5D-3L, QOLIE-10 and QOLIE-31 showed moderate to very strong intra- and inter-metric correlations for overall HRQOL. Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 VAS and EQ-5D-3L VAS did not show any significantly different strengths of correlations with respect to the domains studied. In contrast, the correlation strength of the normalized EQ-5D-3L index value differed significantly from the QOLIE-31 T-score for several domains, for example, for drug-related adverse events, neuropsychological deficits, symptoms of depression and seizure worry. In seizure-free patients, EQ-5D-3L VAS and EQ-5D-3L index values correlated significantly less with the domain of \\"cognitive impairment\\" than the QOLIE-31 T-score. In patients without relevant neuropsychological deficits, the strengths of correlations with the assessed domains did not differ significantly between EQ-5D-3L metrics and the QOLIE-31 T-score. The HRQOL mapping probability of QOLIE-10 was inferior to QOLIE-31 and comparable to EQ-5D-3L regarding the analyzed domains. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the EQ-5D-3L VAS, EQ-5D-3L index values do not adequately map health-related quality of life in severely affected patients with epilepsy and therefore should not be used as screening tools.

The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form, Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale were used to assess problematic gaming, social media use, and smartphone use. The Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 was used to assess distress, and an item rated on a 0-10 scale was included to assess fear of being infected by COVID-19. Fear of being infected by COVID-19 was assessed because this could be a confounding variable in the association between psychological distress and screen time use. Increased time spent on gaming, social media, and smartphones was associated with greater problematic gaming, problematic social media use, problematic smartphone use, and psychological distress, but was not associated with fear of COVID-19 infection. Mediation analyses showed that problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic smartphone use were significant mediators in the association between psychological distress and increased time spent on Internet-related activities during the COVID-19 outbreak period. Children who had psychological distress during COVID-19 outbreak might have spent longer time on Internet-related activities due to the school hiatus and problematic use of Internet-related activities.

This study investigated students' experience with a simulation-based communications training for having difficult conversations using VMC. METHODS Thirty-eight fourth-year medical students preparing for their surgical residency participated in a simulated scenario where students discussed a new COVID-19 diagnosis with a standardised family member (SFM) of a sick patient via VMC. Learners were introduced to an established communications model (SPIKES) by an educational video. After the simulation, SFM and course facilitators guided a debrief and provided feedback. Learners completed surveys evaluating reactions to the training, preparedness to deliver bad news, and attitudes about telehealth. RESULTS Twenty-three students completed evaluation surveys (response rate=61%). Few students had prior formal training (17%) or experience communicating bad news using telehealth (13%). Most respondents rated the session beneficial (96%) and felt they could express empathy using the VMC format (83%). However, only 57% felt ready to deliver bad news independently after the training and 52% reported it was more difficult to communicate without physical presence.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Access to contraception and level of pregnancy intentions, using the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) in women whose last menstrual period was before or after 1 April 2020. While the official date of the first UK lockdown was 23 March, we used 1 April to ensure that those in the post-lockdown group would have faced restrictions in the month that they conceived. RESULTS: A total of 9784 women enrolled in the cohort: 4114 (42.0%) conceived pre-lockdown and 5670 (58.0%) conceived post-lockdown. The proportion of women reporting difficulties accessing contraception was higher in those who conceived after lockdown (n=366, 6.5% vs n=25, 0.6%, p<0.001) and continued to rise from March to September 2020. After adjusting for confounders, women were nine times more likely to report difficulty accessing contraception after lockdown (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 8.96, 95% CI 5.89 to 13.63, p<0.001).

SELPHI is a randomised-controlled-trial (RCT) of 10,135 cis men, trans men, and trans women reporting lifetime anal intercourse with male partners (cis or trans), evaluating whether the offer of free HIV self-testing (HIVST) increases diagnosis. This subgroup analysis from the SELPHI RCT aims to describe key HIVST outcomes and HIVST acceptability for trans people. METHODS: SELPHI recruited using social networking and trans focused social media. Participants were randomised 60/40 to baseline HIVST (Biosure?)

Outcomes were self-reported through online surveys. We conducted a qualitative study of semi-structured peer-led participant interviews (n = 20) exploring HIVST motivations and experiences. These were analysed using a framework approach. FINDINGS: SELPHI recruited and randomised 118 trans men and trans women (94 trans men, 24 trans women), of whom 20 (16 trans men, 4 trans women) underwent the second randomisation. Median age at baseline was 29 (IQR: 22, 37), 79% were white, 79% were UK born, 37% had degree level education, and 31% had never tested for HIV. 62% (n = 59) of trans men completed the 3-month survey, but survey completion by trans women in nBT was too low (1/11) for randomised comparison. In trans men HIV testing uptake by 3 months was significantly higher in BT (95% 36/38) vs nBT (29%, 6/21) (RR=3.32 (1.68, 6.55) p<0.001).

The Canadian COVID-19 Experiences Survey (CCES) involves 1,958 adults with equal representation of vaccinated and vaccine hesitant adults between the ages of 18 and 54 years. Setting: Population-based survey of community dwelling adults, representative of the broader Canadian population. Participants: Men and women between 18 and 54 years of age from English and French speaking provinces. The sample comprised 1,958 adults with a mean age of 37 years (SD=10.4); 60.8% were female. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection with COVID-19 symptoms of any severity, ranging from negligeable to life-threatening infection requiring hospitalization. Primary Outcome: Symptoms of cognitive dysfunction assessed via an abbreviated form of the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS). Results: Those who reported a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of COVID-19 symptom severity (Madj=1.89, SE=0.08, CI: 1.74, 2.04; n=175) reported a significantly higher number of symptoms of executive dysfunction than their non-infected counterparts (Madj=1.63, SE=0.08, CI: 1.47,1.80; n=1,599; {beta}=0.26, p=.001).

The aim of this study was to identify patients who were likely to test positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 during hospitalization by comparing COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were []18 years old and underwent COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction test because they presented with symptoms thought to be due to COVID-19. A Poisson regression analysis was conducted after clinical presentation, demographic, medical co-morbidities, laboratory and chest image data was retrieved from the medical records. Results: Charts of 277 and 18 COVID-19 negative and positive patients respectively were analyzed. Dyspnea (61%) was the most common symptom among COVID-19 negative patients, while 72% and 61% COVID-19 positive patients had cough and fever respectively. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to present initially with cough [1.082 (1.022 - 1.145)], fever [1.066 (1.014 - 1.121)] and be 50 to 69 years old [1.094 (1.021 - 1.172)]. Dyspnea, weakness, lymphopenia and bilateral chest image abnormality were not associated with COVID-19 positivity. COVID-19 positive patients were less likely to have non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [1.068 (1.019 - 1.119)], human immunodeficiency virus [0.849 (0.765 - 0.943)] and heart failure history [0.093 (0.891 - 0.978)]. Other chronic medical problems (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease) were not associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: Cough, fever and being 50 to 69 years old are better predictors of symptomatic COVID-19 positivity during hospitalization. Despite published studies reporting a high prevalence of lymphopenia among COVID-19 positive patients, lymphopenia is not associated with the risk of testing positive for COVID-19.

The advent of the Internet has made a huge volume of data easily available that can be used to measure social influence over large populations. Here, we aim at qualitatively and quantitatively infer social influence from data using a systems and control viewpoint. First, we introduce some definitions and models of opinions dynamics and review some structural constraints of online social networks, based on the notion of sparsity.

Researchers have used various models to predict the maximum extent of the number of cases and the time of peak. This yielded varying numbers. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (R) for COVID-19 over time using incident number of cases that are reported by the government. METHODS: Exponential Growth method to estimate reproduction rate R(0), and Time dependent method to calculate the effective reproduction number (dynamic) were used. R0 package in R software was used to estimate these statistics. RESULTS: The basic reproduction number (R(0)) for India was estimated at 1.379 (95% CI: 1.375, 1.384). This was 1.450 (1.441, 1.460) for Maharashtra, 1.444 (1.430, 1.460) for Gujarat, 1.297 (1.284, 1.310) for Delhi and 1.405 (1.389, 1.421) for Tamil Nadu. In India, the R at the first week from March 2C8, 2020 was 3.2. It remained around 2 units for three weeks, from March 9C29, 2020. After March 2020, it started declining and reached around 1.3 in the following week suggesting a stabilisation of the transmissibility rate. CONCLUSION: The study estimated a baseline R(0) of 1.379 for India. It also showed that the R was getting stabilised from first week of April (R = 1.1), despite the increase in March. This suggested that in due course there will be a reversal of epidemic.

To counteract these antiviral systems, many viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), encode non-structural proteins (NSPs) that mediate immune evasion. Using an overexpression system in A549 ?cells, we demonstrated a significant increase (p ? ?0.0001) in Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-EGFP reporter virus replication in cell lines overexpressing either the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 or NSP15 when compared to control A549 ?cells. The increase in VSV-EGFP virus output was associated with a decrease in TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 protein expression and a lack of antiviral protein production. Truncation of both NSP1 and NSP15 led to an increase in cellular TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 as well as a decrease in TLR2 expression respectively. This observation can be attributed to the presence of a functional domain in NSP1 and NSP15 between amino acid (aa) 120C180 and aa 230C346, respectively. Both TLR3 and TLR9 ligands but not TLR2 ligand were highly effective at overcoming NSP1 and NSP15 functional interference based on significant decrease (p ? ?0.0001) in VSV-EGFP virus replication. NSP1 or NSP15 intracellular interactions are likely low affinity interactions that can be easily disrupted by stimulating cells with specific TLR3 and TLR9 ligands. This report provides insights into the role of SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and NSP15 in limiting specific TLR pathway activation, as an evasive mechanism against host innate responses.","output":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 non-structural proteins 1 and 15 proteins mediate antiviral immune evasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An economic downturn coincided with the start of the epidemic but the recession was short and moderate, compared with that of 1920/21.

The simulated wind and static stability are very similar to the observed ones (e.g., Horinouchi et al., 2018; Ando et al., 2020). The simulated thermal tides accelerate an equatorial superrotational flow with a speed of ~90 m s(?1) around the cloud-heating maximum (~65 km). The zonal-flow acceleration rates of 0.2C0.5 m s(?1) Earth day(?1) are produced by both horizontal and vertical momentum fluxes at low latitudes. In the GCM simulation, strong solar heating above the cloud top (>69 km) and infrared heating around the cloud bottom (~50 km) modify the vertical structures of thermal tides and their vertical momentum fluxes, which accelerate zonal flow at 10(3) Pa (~75 km) and 10(4) Pa (~65 km) at the equator and around 10(3) Pa at high latitudes. Below and in the cloud layer, surface topography weakens the zonal-mean zonal flow over the Aphrodite Terra and Maxwell Montes, whereas it enhances the zonal flow in the southern polar region. The high-resolution topography produces stationary fine-scale bow structures at the cloud top and locally modifies the variances in the geographical coordinates (i.e., the activity of unsteady wave components). Over the high mountains, vertical spikes of the vertical wind variance are found, indicating penetrative plumes and gravity waves. Negative momentum flux is also locally enhanced at the cloud top over the equatorial high mountains. In the solar-fixed coordinate system, the variances (i.e., the activity of waves other than thermal tides) of flow are relatively higher on the nightside than on the dayside at the cloud top. Strong dependences of the eddy heat and momentum fluxes on local time are predominant. The local-time variation of the vertical eddy momentum flux is produced by both thermal tides and solar-related, small-scale gravity waves on the nightside.","output":"Atmospheric response to high-resolution topographical and radiative forcings in a general circulation model of Venus: Time-mean structures of waves and variances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced an infodemic -- a deluge of both accurate and inaccurate health information -- that accompanied the global pandemic of COVID-19 as a major challenge to effective health communication.

METHODS: A systematic literature review across PubMed, Cochrane database, Embase, Google Scholar, and Ovid was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant articles that discussed risk factors for cardiovascular manifestations, cardiac manifestations in COVID-19 patients, and cardiac-specific biomarkers with their clinical implications on COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty-one relevant articles were identified which described risk factors for cardiovascular manifestations, cardiac manifestations (including heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmia, and myocarditis among others) and cardiac-specific biomarkers (including CK-MB, CK, myoglobin, troponin, and NT-proBNP). Cardiovascular risk factors can play a crucial role in identifying patients vulnerable to developing cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 and thus help to save lives.

Few studies have sought to explore the impact of gene therapy on both individuals and families. The aim of this study was to capture real-life experiences of gene therapy in People with haemophilia and their families. RESULTS Sixteen participants with severe haemophilia (11 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B), mean age 41.4 years (range 23-75 years), took part in a single qualitative interview; ten were accompanied by a family member. Mean time since transfection was 3.56 years (range 1-10 years). Participants saw their involvement in gene therapy as a positive experience, freeing them from the personal burden of haemophilia and furthering treatment options for the wider haemophilia community. However, participants reported being unprepared for the side effects of immunosuppression. Some also reported feeling unsupported and having little control over what was happening as their factor levels became the focus of the process. CONCLUSION The results suggest that strategies need to be put into place to enable PwH fully to understand the process of gene therapy, and thereby make an informed choice as to whether it is a treatment they might wish for themselves. These include early and ongoing education, increased provision of psychosocial support and ongoing qualitative research.","output":"The experiences of people with haemophilia and their families of gene therapy in a clinical trial setting: regaining control, the Exigency study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is part of Forum COVID-19: Perspectives in the Humanities and Social Sciences.

Bacterial infections are very frequent in children with cystic fibrosis, but because rapid METHODS: for screening for the wide variety of potentially involved viruses were unavailable until recently, the frequency of viral presence is unknown. Multiplex PCR enables screening for many viruses involved in respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of viruses and bacteria in respiratory specimens from children with cystic fibrosis and to clarify the incidence and characteristics (seasonality and age of patients) of different viruses detected in children with cystic fibrosis. STUDY DESIGN: In this 2-year prospective study, we obtained paired nasopharyngeal-swab and sputum specimens from children with cystic fibrosis during clinical respiratory examinations separated by at least 14 days. We analyzed viruses in nasopharyngeal-swab specimens with multiplex PCR and bacteria in sputum with standard methods. RESULTS: We analyzed 368 paired specimens from 33 children. We detected viruses in 154 (41.8%) and bacteria in 132 (35.9%). Bacteria were commoner in spring and summer; viruses were commoner in autumn and winter. In every season, Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest bacteria and rhinovirus was the commonest virus. Nearly all infections with Haemophilus influenzae occurred in autumn and winter. Viruses were more prevalent in children <5 years old, and bacteria were more prevalent in children 12 years old.

METHODS: Keratinocyte viability and in vitro wound closure were assessed in keratinocyte cultures. Effects of topical TASE (0.5 g/mL of allicin in 97% ethanol) on acute cutaneous WH were determined in a murine model of acute cutaneous wound. Twelve mice were alternately assigned to the vehicle- and TASE-treated groups (n=6 per group). Expression levels of mRNA for keratinocyte differentiation marker-related proteins (filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin) and lipid synthetic enzymes (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4), fatty acid synthase (FA2H), 3-hydroxy- 3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA), and serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)) were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction on day 3 and 8 after wounding, while transepidermal water loss (TEWL) rates were measured in wounded areas. RESULTS: TASE accelerated WH both in vivo (40% vs. 22% reduction in wound area, P<0.01) and in vitro (90% vs. 65% reduction in wound area, P<0.01). Moreover, topical applications of TASE upregulated the expression levels of epidermal mRNA for ELOVL4, HMGCoA, SPT, filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin (P<0.05 vs. vehicle-treated controls) on day 3 after wounding. Likewise, TASE significantly lowered TEWL rates in comparison with vehicle alone on day 8 (33.062.09 g/(m2h) vs. 24.602.04 g/(m2h), P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Topical applications of TASE stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and formation of epidermal permeability barrier function, leading to acceleration of acute cutaneous WH.

Safety was assessed in assays for tight junction integrity, cytotoxicity and cilia beating frequency. Efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in pre-viral load and post-viral load application on airway epithelium. No toxic effects of AM-301 on the nasal epithelium were found. Prophylactic treatment with AM-301 significantly reduced viral titer vs. controls over 4 days, reaching a maximum reduction of 99% in case of infection from the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variant and more than 83% in case of the Delta variant.

BACKGROUND CAC and systemic inflammation are known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. METHODS A total of 17,711 consecutive patients who underwent PCI in our hospital between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015 were categorized according to the degree of CAC (moderate/severe vs. none/mild) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level (2 vs. <2 mg/L). MACE was defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target vessel revascularization (TVR) occurring over 1 year. RESULTS Within the four groups, patients with both moderate/severe CAC and elevated hsCRP (n = 1,814 [10.2%]) were older with more comorbid risk factors compared to those with moderate/severe CAC alone (n = 1,687 [9.5%]), elevated hsCRP alone (n = 7,597 [42.9%]) or neither abnormality (n = 6,613 [37.3%]). The analogous 1-year MACE rates were 21.2, 14.9, 11.5, and 7.8%, respectively (p-trend < .001). Results were unchanged after multivariable adjustment, suggesting synergistic adverse effects in patients with both CAC and elevated hsCRP.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A nationwide retrospective matched case-control study, including all adults admitted to an ICU in Sweden with influenza or COVID-19 between 2014 and September 2020 and a matched control population (ratio 1:5, patients:controls). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Admission to an ICU. The study included 1,873 influenza and 2,567 COVID-19 ICU patients, and 9,365 and 12,835 controls, respectively, matched on sex, age, and geographical region. Influenza patients were older and less likely male, and carried a larger burden of comorbidity and a higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score III score, whereas short-term mortalities were similar when compared to COVID-19 patients. The risk-factor profiles at ICU admission were largely comparable including socioeconomic, psychiatric, and several somatic variables. Hypertension was a strong risk factor in critical COVID-19 patients compared with influenza. Nonglucocorticoid immunosuppressive therapy was associated with critical influenza but not COVID-19. Premorbid medication with statins and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors reduced the risk for both conditions, the opposite was a seen for glucocorticoid medication.

Case description: This is a case report of a 39-year-old critically ill patient with COVID-19 with no premorbid conditions, who presented with intensive care unit-acquired weakness and persistent sinus tachycardia after their stay in an intensive care unit. The sinus tachycardia and exertional symptoms contributed to a severely limited exercise capacity (assessed through the 6-Minute Walk Test and 2-Minute Step Test), which impaired the progress of inpatient rehabilitation. This was addressed through the use of bisoprolol for heart rate control and a rehabilitation programme based on cardiac rehabilitation principles.

The mineral resources are also devastated, which served as a primary raw input into the production system. The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment and mineral resources are studied in a large panel of countries and found that mineral resource rents and population growth improve environmental sustainability rating (ESR). In contrast, an increase in coronavirus cases decreases the rating scale across countries. Further, mineral resources first decrease along with increased COVID-19 cases due to strict government policies, including the mandatory shutdown of economic institutions. Further, mineral resource rents increase later because of resuming economic activities in many parts of the world. The high rate of population growth is another important factor that negatively affects mineral resources across countries. Through impulse response and variance decomposition estimates, an exacerbated coronavirus cases and population growth would likely negatively affect ESR and mineral resources.

Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients 19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). Conclusions: The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.","output":"Preliminary epidemiological analysis on children and adolescents with novel coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei Province, China: an observational study utilizing crowdsourced data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Universities worldwide have been conducting e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic to continue education irrespective of faculties are familiar with e-education or not.

Effects of surgical masks on droplet and aerosol dispersion under oxygen delivery modalities are not yet clarified. Objectives To visualize and quantify dispersion particles under various oxygen delivery modalities and examine the protective effect of surgical masks on particle dispersion. Methods Three and five healthy men were enrolled for video recording and quantification of particles, respectively. Various oxygen delivery modalities including high flow nasal cannula were used in this study. Particle dispersions during rest breathing, speaking, and coughing were recorded and automatically counted in each condition and were evaluated with or without surgical masks. Measurements and Main Results Coughing led to the maximum amount and distance of particle dispersion, regardless of modalities. Droplet dispersion was not visually increased by oxygen delivery modalities compared to breathing at room air. With surgical masks over the nasal cannula or high-flow nasal cannula, droplet dispersion was barely visible. Oxygen modalities did not increase the particle dispersion counts regardless of breathing pattens. Wearing surgical masks significantly decreased particle dispersion in all modalities while speaking and coughing, regardless of particle sizes, and reduction rates were approximately 95 and 80-90 % for larger (> 5 m) and smaller (> 0.5 m) particles, respectively.

SUMMARY Current strategies include direct transportation of patients to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) (\\"mothership model\\") or transportation to the nearest primary stroke center (PSC) and secondary transfer to the CSC (\\"drip-and-ship model\\"). Both have disadvantages. We propose the model \\"flying intervention team.\\" Patients will be transported to the nearest PSC; if telemedically identified as eligible for thrombectomy, an intervention team will be acutely transported via helicopter to the PSC and endovascular treatment will be performed on site. Patients stay at the PSC for further stroke unit care. This model was implemented at a telestroke network in Germany. Fifteen remote hospitals participated in the project, covering 14,000 km2 and a population of 2 million. All have well established telemedically supported stroke units, an angiography suite, and a helicopter pad. Processes were defined individually for each hospital and training sessions were implemented for all stroke teams. An exclusive project helicopter was installed to be available from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. during 26 weeks per year. Key Messages: The model of the flying intervention team is likely to reduce time delays since processes will be performed in parallel, rather than consecutively, and since it is quicker to move a medical team rather than a patient.

To date, there is no effective treatment. Clinical management is largely symptomatic, with organ support in intensive care for critically ill patients. The first phase I trial to test the efficacy of a vaccine has recently begun, but in the meantime there is an urgent need to decrease the morbidity and mortality of severe cases. It is known that patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection than individuals without cancer because of their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments. Therefore, these patients might be at increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 could in some case induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with potentially fatal severe lung injury and patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome and viral ARDS result from uncontrolled severe acute inflammation. Acute lung injury results from inflammatory monocyte and macrophage activation in the pulmonary luminal epithelium which lead to a release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-. These cytokines play a crucial role in immune-related pneumonitis, and could represent a promising target when the infiltration is T cell predominant or there are indirect signs of high IL-6-related inflammation, such as elevated C-reactive protein. A monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab has been administered in a number of cases in China and Italy. Positive clinical and radiological outcomes have been reported. These early findings have led to an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial in China and Italy.

However, there is uncertainty about the benefit to harm balance of mesh approved for pelvic organ prolapse. We, therefore, assessed the evidence at the time of approval for transvaginal mesh products and the impact of safety studies the FDA mandated in 2012 because of emerging harms. METHODS We used FDA databases to determine the evidence for approval of transvaginal mesh. To create a 'family tree' of device equivalence, we used the 510(k) regulatory approval of the 1985 Mersilene Mesh (Ethicon) and the 1996 ProteGen Sling (Boston Scientific), searched for all subsequently related device approvals, and for the first published randomised trial evidence. We assessed compliance with all FDA 522 orders issued in 2012 requiring postmarketing surveillance studies. RESULTS We found 61 devices whose approval ultimately relied on claimed equivalence to the Mersilene Mesh and the ProteGen Sling. We found no clinical trials evidence for these 61 devices at the time of approval. Publication of randomised clinical trials occurred at a median of 5 years after device approval (range 1-14 years). Analysis of 119 FDA 522 orders revealed that in 79 (66%) the manufacturer ceased market distribution of the device, and in 26 (22%) the manufacturer had changed the indication. Only seven studies (six cohorts and new randomised controlled trial) covering 11 orders were recruiting participants (none had reported outcomes).

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Nationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, a large integrated national healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: All 4297 patients admitted to hospital from 1 March to 31 July 2020 with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and without a history of anticoagulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was 30 day mortality. Secondary outcomes were inpatient mortality, initiating therapeutic anticoagulation (a proxy for clinical deterioration, including thromboembolic events), and bleeding that required transfusion. RESULTS: Of 4297 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, 3627 (84.4%) received prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission. More than 99% (n=3600) of treated patients received subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin. 622 deaths occurred within 30 days of hospital admission, 513 among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation. Most deaths (510/622, 82%) occurred during hospital stay. Using inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, the cumulative incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3% (95% confidence interval 13.1% to 15.5%) among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7% (15.1% to 22.9%) among those who did not. Compared with patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a 27% decreased risk for 30 day mortality (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.81). Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality and initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. Receipt of prophylactic anticoagulation was not associated with increased risk of bleeding that required transfusion (hazard ratio 0.87, 0.71 to 1.05). Quantitative bias analysis showed that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95% confidence interval 1.77 for 30 day mortality). Results persisted in several sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation compared with no anticoagulation among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 was associated with a decreased risk of 30 day mortality and no increased risk of serious bleeding events.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, palliative care has received unprecedented levels of societal attention. Unfortunately, this has not been enough to prevent patients dying alone, relatives not being able to say goodbye and palliative care being used instead of intensive care due to resource limitations. Yet global guidance was available. In 2018, the WHO released a guide on 'Integrating palliative care and symptom relief into the response to humanitarian emergencies and crises'-the first guidance on the topic by an international body. AIMS: This paper argues that while a landmark document, the WHO guide took a narrowly clinical bioethics perspective and missed crucial moral dilemmas. We argue for adding a population-level bioethics lens, which draws forth complex moral dilemmas arising from the fact that groups having differential innate and acquired resources in the context of social and historical determinants of health. We discuss dilemmas concerning: limitations of material and human resources; patient prioritisation; euthanasia; and legacy inequalities, discrimination and power imbalances. IMPLICATIONS: In parts of the world where opportunity for preparation still exists, and as countries emerge from COVID-19, planners must consider care for the dying. Immediate steps to support better resolutions to ethical dilemmas of the provision of palliative care in humanitarian and emergency contexts will require honest debate; concerted research effort; and international, national and local ethical guidance.","output":"Dying individuals and suffering populations: applying a population-level bioethics lens to palliative care in humanitarian contexts: before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The upheaval of providers and their patients has led to many changes in the way people live and work.

Recent changes in the vaccine development field, such as the introduction of vaccines developed overseas in Japan and vaccine development on a global scale have increased the need for revision of these guidelines. In this study, we identified the current challenges in the development of vaccines through comparison of Japanese and international guidelines. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey of pharmaceutical industries in Japan, and found issues related to non-clinical studies, such as the necessity of safety pharmacology studies and repeated-dose toxicity studies for each route of administration. We examined international guidelines on these issues as well as review reports by regulatory authorities, and determined that the results of repeated-dose toxicity studies can be used to decide whether safety pharmacology studies are required, and that studies to evaluate toxicity due to systemic effects may not be necessary for both intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.

The objective of our study was to examine the perceptions and attitudes of RNs in the United States regarding their duty to care and willingness to work after a patient infected with the Ebola virus was admitted to their hospital. We performed a quantitative, descriptive study using social media to recruit critical care RNs to complete an online survey. A total of 72 RNs completed the survey. While only 20 respondents reported providing direct care, more than half (n = 38) reported that family members asked them not to work with patients infected with the Ebola virus. A majority of respondents (n = 63) agreed that healthcare workers have a duty to help sick people despite high risks to themselves or their families; however, 59 agreed that family responsibilities would take priority. Respondents were less likely to work if their partners (n = 11) or children (n = 7) were ill but more likely to work if colleagues were infected (n = 48) or dying (n = 40). Shunning was experienced by 32 respondents, and 25 knew of others who were shunned. We observed several factors that affect RNs' willingness to provide care when patients are admitted, including moral conflict between their duty to treat sick people and their duty to protect their family. As part of infectious disease emergency planning, health policy managers should consider these complex factors, which may modulate effective patient care.

The key issue is that PAH is a form of PH. On the opposite, PH does not automatically imply PAH. Pulmonary arterial hypertension must be differentiated from other causes of PH that are frequently seen in ICU. It was recently emphasized that pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) must be differentiated from PH and PAH. The prognosis of PAH was consistently improved in the ten past years by introduction of selective pulmonary vasodilators and management by highly specialized medical teams. In ICU patients, PAH remains a severe disease with a high mortality rate. When PAH is suspected, a systematic diagnosis approach is of particular importance in order to rapidly eliminate left cardiac, thromboembolic and pulmonary causes of PH. Left cardiac disease is the most common cause of PH. Early recognition of PAH allows a rapid introduction of selective pulmonary vasodilators that can improve outcome. Idiopathic PAH is the most frequent cause but it can also be associated with scleroderma, HIV infection, anorexigen toxicity, thyroid disease, cirrhosis. Pulmonary vasodilators should be only a part of a general management including treatment of triggering factors, optimization of fluid balance, decrease of RV afterload by using pulmonary vasodilators while maintaining cardiac output and mean arterial pressure.

Abstract Introduction Multiple studies carried out around the globe have concluded that there is a seasonal effect on the births of patients that will go on to develop schizophrenia later on. A relationship between being exposed to certain infectious agents during the prenatal period and possible direct effects on the developing brain that will later be expressed by the classical clinical picture has been suggested. Objective To analyze the behavior of births in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia from Santa Marta, Colombia. Methods Descriptive study based on the review of clinical histories of the patients seen in a psychiatric institute. Discussion A larger number of births took place during the rainiest months of the year suggesting a possible seasonal effect. However, the lack of data on births in Santa Marta during the years of the study did not allow a comparison between the results of the study and the birth rates of the general population. Even so, these findings have implications for future research regarding seasonality of schizophrenia in Colombia. They do not reflect an individual risk of developing the illness but they do document the characteristics of the temporal behavior of the births in the sample studied.

In this experimental work, the resilience of anastomotic techniques to pressure and tensile stress was studied. Study Design Ex vivo pig model. Setting Experimental. Subjects and Methods The trachea with the 2 main bronchi in freshly slaughtered pigs was isolated and intubated (CH 8.0). Both main bronchi were closed distally by a stapler. After resection of the trachea, an anastomosis (n = 15 per group) was created: group 1, single interrupted sutures; group 2, continuous running suture; group 3, mixed technique. A continuous tensile stress of 0, 500, 1000, or 1500 g was applied to the preparations. Mechanical ventilation with a maximum pressure of 70 mbar was initiated. The airtightness of the anastomosis was verified by submerging the entire preparation under water. Results At tensile loads of 0.5 and 1.0 kg, all anastomoses created in the single-stitch technique were airtight; at 1.5 kg, 93.3% were without leaks. In the continuous suture technique, the airtightness of anastomoses decreased with increasing tensile load: from 93.3% at 500 g to 73.3% at 1 kg and 66.6% at 1.5 kg ( P = .02 at 1.5 kg). Anastomoses in the mixed technique were airtight in 80% at 500 g, 66.6% at 1 kg, and 46.6% at 1.5 kg ( P = .01 in comparison with single stitches).

Here we revisit T-B cooperation as a prerequisite for effective and durable neutralizing antibody responses centered on a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope. T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.","output":"In silico analysis suggests less effective MHC-II presentation of SARS-CoV-2 RBM peptides: Implication for neutralizing antibody responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the factors that affect anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody production remain unclear.

METHODS: This study comprised patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and June 30, 2020 and gave consent for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during their acute and/or convalescent phases. Factors related to elevated antibody titers and the relationship between the days from disease onset and the development of antibody titers were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 84 participants enrolled in the study. Nineteen participants had antibody titers measured during the convalescent phase only, and 65 participants had antibody titers measured during the acute and convalescent phases. The antibody titers peaked in weeks 5 and 6. The stepwise multivariate log-normal analysis revealed that male sex (P = 0.04), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03), and high C-reactive protein levels during the disease course (P < 0.001) were associated with elevated IgG antibodies. Glucocorticoid use was not associated with antibody titers.

RESULTS In total, 58 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC were analyzed. Various clinical factors such as smoking history and EGFR mutation type were not associated with progression-free survival (PFS) of ICIs, while the PFS of prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was inversely associated with that of ICIs. Patients who responded to prior EGFR TKIs for > 10 months exhibited a significantly shorter response to ICIs compared to those who had responded for  10 months (PFS of ICI: 1.6 vs. 1.9 months; hazard ratio: 2.54; 95% confidence interval 1.26-5.12; p = 0.009). However, patients who responded to ICIs for > 6 months responded to prior EGFR TKIs for significantly shorter periods compared to those who responded to ICIs for  6 months (PFS of prior EGFR TKI: 5.3 vs. 12.1 months; log-rank test: p = 0.0025). CONCLUSION The duration of response to prior EGFR TKIs could be a predictive marker of ICI therapy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.","output":"Characteristics of patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer who benefited from immune checkpoint inhibitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disease due to both a peripheral destruction of platelets and an inappropriate bone marrow production. Although the primary triggering factors of ITP remain unknown, a loss of immune tolerancemostly represented by a regulatory T-cell defectallows T follicular helper cells to stimulate autoreactive splenic B cells that differentiate into antiplatelet antibody-producing plasma cells. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa is the main target of antiplatelet antibodies leading to platelet phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, through interactions with Fc gamma receptors (FcRs) and complement receptors. This allows macrophages to activate autoreactive T cells by their antigen-presenting functions. Moreover, the activation of the classical complement pathway participates to platelet opsonization and also to their destruction by complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Platelet destruction is also mediated by a FcR-independent pathway, involving platelet desialylation that favors their binding to the Ashwell-Morell receptor and their clearance in the liver. Cytotoxic T cells also contribute to ITP pathogenesis by mediating cytotoxicity against megakaryocytes and peripheral platelets. The deficient megakaryopoiesis resulting from both the humoral and the cytotoxic immune responses is sustained by inappropriate levels of thrombopoietin, the major growth factor of megakaryocytes. The better understanding of ITP pathogenesis has provided important therapeutic advances. B cell-targeting therapies and thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) have been used for years. New emerging therapeutic strategies that inhibit FcR signaling, the neonatal Fc receptor or the classical complement pathway, will deeply modify the management of ITP in the near future.","output":"Immune Thrombocytopenia: Recent Advances in Pathogenesis and Treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has refocused attention to the betacoronaviruses, only eight years after the emergence of another zoonotic betacoronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). METHODS: The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research C with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics. RESULTS: A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. CONCLUSION: There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind. The proposed robust and structured strategy aims to address the current and anticipated future challenges while maintaining scientific rigor and managing risk.","output":"Guidelines for TMS/tES Clinical Services and Research through the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTi) cause a high burden of disease and lead to negative impact on quality of life, frequent school/work absenteeism, and doctor visits, which remain a great challenge to pediatricians because RRTi can increase the risk of various complications including antibiotic overuse and resistance, which is one of the biggest threats to global health, and there is no confirmed effective treatment. In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of oropharyngeal probiotic ENT-K12 as a dietary intervention or a complementary treatment along with standard medical treatment during acute respiratory infections among children with RRTi during cold season. The results of this study show that when comparing to practicing of standard medical treatment only, the complementary intake of oropharyngeal probiotic ENT-K12 can effectively reduce episodes of both acute and RRTi in school children, shorten the course of respiratory symptoms onset, reduce the use of antibiotics and antiviral drugs, and reduce the absence days from both children's school and parents' work. Using oropharyngeal probiotics as a complementary dietary intervention to stabilize oropharyngeal microflora, specifically inhibiting respiratory pathogens and enhancing host immunity, could possibly be a promising approach to reduce RRTi burden and combating antibiotic resistance in long term, more clinical studies will be needed to further confirm the clinical practicing guide to ensure its clinical benefit. METHODS: A total of 100 susceptible children with RRTi aged 3C10 years, living in Wuhan, China, were selected. They were randomized to the probiotic group and control group at the beginning of the trial during the cold season. Fifty children in the probiotic group took oropharyngeal probiotic ENT-K12 for 30 days, along with standard medical treatment when there was an onset of respiratory symptoms and medical treatment was needed, and fifty children in the control group did not take oropharyngeal probiotics but only had standard medical treatment when there was an onset of respiratory symptoms and medical treatment was needed. Patients were followed up for 30 days during the cold season. The primary objective of this study is to assess the complementary dietary interventional efficacy of oropharyngeal probiotic ENT-K12 on episodes of respiratory tract infections during the cold season, and the secondary objective is to assess the interventional efficacy of oropharyngeal probiotic on days of respiratory symptoms onset, using antiviral drugs, antibiotics, and antipyretics, days of children absent from school, and days of parents absent from work, as well as to confirm tolerability and safety judged by adverse event reporting. RESULTS: There were 47 children, 22 male and 25 female children, with an average age of 5.71 years (SD = 1.99) in the probiotic group finishing the study, and 50 children, 32 male and 18 female children, in the control group with an average age of 6.12 years (SD = 1.98) finishing the study. During the 30-day period of oropharyngeal probiotic intake, children in the probiotic group totally had 7 episodes of upper respiratory tract infections, while children in the control group totally had 17 episodes of upper respiratory tract infections, indicating that the incidence of upper respiratory tract infection in the probiotic group (14.89%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (34.00%) during the intervention period. The days of using antibiotics and antiviral drugs in the probiotic group were significantly lower than that in the control group, and the course of respiratory symptoms onset was shorter and more moderate in the probiotic group than that in the control group; in addition, compared with the control group, both the days of children absent from school and parents' absence from work in the probiotic group were significantly lower. Children treated with oropharyngeal probiotic ENT-K12 had excellent tolerability with no side effects reported, hence confirmed safety of applying oropharyngeal probiotic ENT-K12 as a prophylactic use or an effective dietary intervention along with standard medication during respiratory infections onset. CONCLUSION: Intake of oropharyngeal probiotic ENT-K12 as a dietary intervention can effectively reduce episodes of upper respiratory tract infections in school children with RRTi during high peak season, reduce the days of using antibiotics and antiviral drugs, and reduce children's sick leave days, parents' absence days from work, and shorten the course of respiratory infections; the safety of oropharyngeal probiotic ENT-K12 has been confirmed with no side effects reported, excellent tolerability, and easy acceptance. Notably, this study opens up a new research idea in the field of microbe promoting human health by supplying direct proof to support its efficiency and safety.","output":"Oropharyngeal Probiotic ENT-K12 as an Effective Dietary Intervention for Children With Recurrent Respiratory Tract Infections During Cold Season"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reference genes are generally employed in real\\\\time quantitative PCR (RT\\\\qPCR) experiments to normalize variability between different samples.

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery has recently emerged as a less invasive potential alternative to conventional three- or four-port laparoscopy. However, the feasibility of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) remains unclear, and there are no rigorous criteria in the literature. Identifying patients at risk of failure of this new technique is essential. The aim of our study was to determine risk factors that may predict failure of the procedure. METHODS From May 2010 to March 2012, 110 consecutive patients underwent SILC and were reviewed retrospectively. The main feasibility criterion was the procedure failure rate, defined as addition of supplementary port(s) and prolonged (>60 min) operative time. The factors evaluated were age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, previous abdominal surgery, indication for surgery and gallbladder suspension. RESULTS There was conversion in 16 patients (14.5%), and the operative time exceeded 60 min for 20 patients (30.9%). Univariate analysis showed a significant independent association between additional port requirement and each of weight as a continuous value, weight 80 kg, BMI >26.5 kg/m(2) and height >172 cm. Univariate analysis also showed a significant independent association between prolonged operative duration (>60 min) and each of height and weight as continuous values, height >172 cm and previous abdominal surgery. In the multivariate analysis, only weight remained independently associated with additional port requirement, and height remained independently associated with prolonged operative duration.

Although additional disease peaks may occur, and a consequent increase in the number of affected individuals, a combination of policy, good governance, a healthy society, and good citizen behaviors' should be sufficient to provide enough time for the health care system to cope with them.

Jianpi Qingchang Bushen decoction (JQBD) is a prescription used in clinical practice. However, further studies are needed to determine whether JQBD regulates the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) (RANK)/receptor activator of NF-B ligand (RANKL)/ osteoprotegerin (OPG) pathways and could play a role in treating IBD-induced bone loss. AIM: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of JQBD in IBD-induced bone loss and explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: An IBD-induced bone loss model was constructed by feeding 12 6-to-8-wk-old interleukin-10 (IL-10)-knockout mice with piroxicam for 10 d. The mice were randomly divided into model and JQBD groups. We used wild-type mice as a control. The JQBD group was administered the JQBD suspension for 2 wk by gavage, while the control and model groups were given normal saline at the corresponding time points. All mice were killed after the intervention. The effect of JQBD on body weight, disease activity index (DAI), and colon length was analyzed. Histopathological examination, colon ultrastructure observation, and micro-computed tomographic scanning of the lumbar vertebrae were performed. The gene expression of NF-B, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in the colon was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colon samples were assessed by Western blot for the expression of RANKL, OPG, RANK, and NF-B proteins. RESULTS: The model group lost body weight, had a shorter colon, and showed a dramatic increase in DAI score, whereas JQBD had protective and therapeutic effects. Treatment with JQBD significantly improved inflammatory cell infiltration and reduced crypt abscess and ulcer formation. Three-dimensional imaging of the vertebral centrum in the model group revealed a lower bone mass, loose trabeculae, and rod-shaped changes in the structure compared to the control group and JQBD groups. The bone volume/total volume ratio and bone mineral density were significantly lower in the model group than in the control group. JQBD intervention downregulated the NF-B, TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA expression levels. The RANKL and OPG protein levels were also improved. CONCLUSION: JQBD reduces inflammation of the colonic mucosa and inhibits activation of the RANK/ RANKL/OPG signaling pathway, thereby reducing osteoclast activation and bone resorption and improving bone metabolism.","output":"Jianpi Qingchang Bushen decoction improves inflammatory response and metabolic bone disorder in inflammatory bowel disease-induced bone loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to accelerated efforts to develop therapeutics and vaccines A key target of these efforts is the spike (S) protein, which is metastable and difficult to produce recombinantly We characterized 100 structure-guided spike designs and identified 26 individual substitutions that increased protein yields and stability Testing combinations of beneficial substitutions resulted in the identification of HexaPro, a variant with six beneficial proline substitutions exhibiting higher expression than its parental construct (by a factor of 10) as well as the ability to withstand heat stress, storage at room temperature, and three freeze-thaw cycles A cryo-electron microscopy structure of HexaPro at a resolution of 3 2 angstroms confirmed that it retains the prefusion spike conformation High-yield production of a stabilized prefusion spike protein will accelerate the development of vaccines and serological diagnostics for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","output":"Structure-based design of prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth-assisted finger rehabilitation therapy demonstrated good functional results following repair of a zone 2 flexor tendon laceration.","output":"Using Telehealth Rehabilitation Therapy to Treat a Finger Flexor Tendon Repair During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use a linear mixed model in order to estimate the effect of the number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 on the overall death toll on a monthly basis.

Gaining insight into factors regarding willingness or refusal for vaccination might guide our goals in raising the awareness and target efforts to increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and maximize the uptake. Therefore, this study aims to assess the intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among Lebanese adults and the factors associated with vaccine refusal. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study during NovemberCDecember 2020 among Lebanese adults from all Lebanese regions using a survey tool with closed-ended questions that included sociodemographic data and questions about vaccine hesitancy, knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of COVID-19. We used the snowball technique to collect the data because of the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. RESULTS: Of the 579 participants, 21.4% were willing to receive the vaccine, 40.9% refused, and the remainder were unsure of their response. More vaccine hesitancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.03C1.09) was significantly associated with more odds of disagreeing/ strongly disagreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. More vaccine hesitancy (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91C0.99), female gender compared to males (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32C0.87), and being married compared to single (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.29C0.98) were significantly associated with lower odds of agreeing/strongly agreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral.

It is known that people choose different walking strategies when subjected to fear or stressful situations. To demonstrate that our model for crowd dynamics could be used to reproduce realistic scenarios, we simulate passengers in one terminal of Hobby Airport in Houston. In order to model disease spreading in a walking crowd, we introduce a variable that denotes the level of exposure to people spreading the disease. In addition, we introduce a parameter that describes the contagion interaction strength and a kernel function that is a decreasing function of the distance between a person and a spreading individual.

Multiple new guidelines were proposed and existing models of social, domestic and hospital care altered. Most healthcare systems were largely unprepared for this, and the pandemic has tested their adaptability. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the demographics, presentation, clinical management and outcomes of patients with proximal femoral (hip) fractures comparing them to a similar cohort of patients admitted a year earlier. METHODS: This retrospective multi-centre cohort study compared all patients admitted with hip fractures between 1st March and 30th May 2019 (group PC: pre-COVID-19) with hip fracture patients admitted over the same time period during the pandemic in 2020 (group C: COVID-19). The data was obtained from the hospitals local and National Hip Fracture Databases. Mortality data was checked with the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Primary outcomes were time to theatre, in-patient length of stay and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 580 patients were included (304 group PC, 276 group C). Patient demographics including Charlson Comorbidity Index and Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores were broadly similar across the two cohorts. There was a significant reduction in the percentage of total hip replacements (11 to 5%, p = 0.006) in group C. There was an increase in conservative management (1 to 5%, p = 0.002) in group C. Time to theatre was significantly delayed in group C (43.7 h) vs group PC (34.6 h) (p  0.001). The overall length of hospital stay was significantly longer in group PC (16.6 days) vs group C (15 days) (p = 0.025). The 30-day mortality rate in group C was 9.8% compared to 8.2% in group PC (p = 0.746), but for COVID-19 (+) patients, it was significantly higher at 38.2% vs 5.8% in COVID-19 (?) patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest multi-centre comparative cohort study in the literature to date examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of hip fracture patients. Whilst mortality rates were similar in both groups, COVID-19-positive patients were almost seven times more likely to die, reflecting the seriousness of the COVID-19 infection and its sequelae in such elderly, vulnerable patients.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the management and outcomes of patients with proximal femoral fractures: a multi-centre study of 580 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 has been a challenge all over the world. It is challenging to manufacture many testing kits and even then, their accuracy rate is very low.

In this study, we have developed a COVID-19 detection model that by observing the chest x-ray images of the patient, detects that either the patient is affected by COVID-19 or not. The model is developed using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that differentiates between COVID-19 and healthy x-ray images so that the patient can be diagnosed and quarantined on time to prevent the spread of the pandemic. We used two different datasets which are publicly available for the training and validation of this model. Upon completion, the proposed model yields an accuracy of almost 98%. Upon further training, our model will be able to be used as a COVID-19 detection tool in hospitals worldwide and will play a vital role in early detection and timely containment of the pandemic. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Covid-19 Detection by using Deep learning-based Custom Convolution Neural Network (CNN)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How did the financial and trade ties between China and the Eurozone develop in the aftermath of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis?

However, due to limited resources, re-assessment of treatment paradigms in the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is urgently required. In this rapid review, we described contemporary oncological outcomes for OSCC using non-surgical modalities. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for articles published between January 1, 2010 and April 1, 2020 on MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Studies were included if they contained patients with OSCC treated with either neoadjuvant, induction, or definitive radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or combination thereof, and an outcome of overall survival. RESULTS: In total, 36 articles were identified. Definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of 18 articles and neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of the other 18 articles. In early stage OSCC, definitive radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, was associated with a significantly increased hazard of death compared to definitive surgery (HR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.56 - 3.67, I(2): 63%). The hazard of death was non-significantly increased with definitive chemoradiotherapy in studies excluding early disease (HR: 1.98, 95% CI: 0.85 - 4.64, I(2): 84%). Two recent randomized control trials have been conducted, demonstrating no survival advantage to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that primary radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are inferior to surgical management for OSCC. Strategies for surgical delay warranting consideration are sparse, but may include several neoadjuvant regimens, recognizing these regimens may not offer a survival benefit over definitive surgery alone.","output":"Nonsurgical Management of Resectable Oral Cavity Cancer in the Wake of COVID-19: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The cost of Saudi healthcare continues to rise at an alarming rate, putting the sustainability of the public healthcare system into question.

BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has been rapidly integrated into ambulatory neurology in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Ambulatory neurology patients at a single center were contacted via telephone to complete: (1) a survey quantifying likelihood of scheduling a future telemedicine visit, and (2) a semi-structured qualitative interview following their visit in March 2021. Data were processed using the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of 2493 visits, 39% assented to post-visit feedback; 74% were in-person visits and 13% video and telephone. Patients with in-person visits were less likely than those with video and telephone visits to definitely consider a future telemedicine visit (36 vs. 59 and 62%, respectively; p < 0.001). Patients considered five key factors when scheduling future visits: Pros of Visit Type, Barriers to Telemedicine, Situational Context, Inherent Beliefs, and Extrinsic Variables. Patients with telemedicine visits considered convenience as a pro, while those with in-person visits cited improved quality of care. Accessibility and user familiarity were considered barriers to telemedicine by patients with in-person and telephone visits, whereas system limitations were prevalent among patients with video visits. Patients agreed that stable conditions can be monitored via telemedicine, whereas physical examination warrants an in-person visit. Telemedicine was inherently considered equivalent to in-person care by patients with telephone visits. Awareness of telemedicine must be improved for patients with in-person visits. CONCLUSION: Across visit types, patients agree that telemedicine is convenient and effective in many circumstances. Future care delivery models should incorporate the patient perspective to implement hybrid models where telemedicine is an adjunct to in-person visits in ambulatory neurology.

T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL)-dependent and TL shortens with age. Older persons are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19, and we hypothesized that those with short TL have less capacity to mount an adequate T-cell proliferative response to SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis predicts that among older patients with COVID-19, shorter telomeres of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be associated with a lower lymphocyte count. Methods: Our sample comprised 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87(8) (mean(SD)) and 87 (9) years, respectively. We measured TL by the Telomere Shortest Length Assay, a novel method that measures and tallies the short telomeres directly relevant to telomere-mediated biological processes. The primary analysis quantified TL as the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases. For comparison, we also quantified TL by Southern blotting, which measures the mean length of telomeres. Results: Lymphocyte count (109/L) was 0.91 (0.42) in COVID-19 patients and 1.50(0.50) in non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases (P = 0.005) and positively correlated with the mean of telomeres measured by TeSLA (P = 0.03). Lymphocyte counts showed no statistically significant correlations with Southern blotting results in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that a compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response contributes to lymphopenia and the resulting disproportionate severity of COVID-19 among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.","output":"A Mechanism for Severity of Disease in Older Patients with COVID-19: The Nexus between Telomere Length and Lymphopenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current research surrounding online computer science education emphasizes the need for high-quality professional development opportunities.

We retrospectively extracted the relevant patient data for the period of March to May 2020 (COVID group) and compared to the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID group). Results: Compared with pre-COVID, there was a 17.5% fall in total stroke admissions (from 315 to 260) during COVID;but there were no significant differences in the demographics, stroke severity, proportions with known time of onset, or median onset-to-arrival time. The thrombolysis rates amongst ischemic strokes were not significantly different between the two groups (59/260=23% pre- COVID vs. 41/228=18% COVID, p=.19). For thrombolysis patients, their stroke severity and demographics were similar between the two both groups. Median onset-to-needle time was significantly longer by 22 minutes during COVID [127 (IQR 94-160) vs. 149 (IQR 110-124) minutes, p=.045];this delay to treatment was almost entirely due to a longer median onset-to-arrival time by 16 minutes during COVID (p=.029). Favorable early neurological outcomes post-thrombolysis (defined as an improvement in NIHSS by 4 points at 24 hours) were similar (45% vs. 46%, p=.86). Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on prehospital delays which in turn significantly increased onset-to-needle time, but without affecting the chance of a favorable early neurological outcome. Our data highlight the need to maintain public awareness of taking immediate action when stroke symptoms occur during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke thrombolysis rate and delay to thrombolysis treatment in a regional stroke centre in london, uk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The study proposes an automated deep learning-based classification model, based on a Convolutional Neural Network, that demonstrates a rapid detection rate for COVID-19. The training dataset consists of 3616 COVID-19 chest X-ray images and 10,192 healthy chest X-ray images which were then augmented. Initially using the dataset, the symptoms of COVID-19 were detected by employing eleven existing CNN models. MobileNetV2 showed enough promise to make it a candidate for further modification. The resulting model produced the highest accuracy of 98% in classifying COVID-19 and healthy chest X-rays among all the implemented CNN models. The results suggest that the proposed method can efficiently identify the symptoms of infection from chest X-ray images better than existing methods. ABSTRACT: COVID-19, regarded as the deadliest virus of the 21st century, has claimed the lives of millions of people around the globe in less than two years. Since the virus initially affects the lungs of patients, X-ray imaging of the chest is helpful for effective diagnosis. Any method for automatic, reliable, and accurate screening of COVID-19 infection would be beneficial for rapid detection and reducing medical or healthcare professional exposure to the virus. In the past, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) proved to be quite successful in the classification of medical images. In this study, an automatic deep learning classification method for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images is suggested using a CNN. A dataset consisting of 3616 COVID-19 chest X-ray images and 10,192 healthy chest X-ray images was used. The original data were then augmented to increase the data sample to 26,000 COVID-19 and 26,000 healthy X-ray images. The dataset was enhanced using histogram equalization, spectrum, grays, cyan and normalized with NCLAHE before being applied to CNN models. Initially using the dataset, the symptoms of COVID-19 were detected by employing eleven existing CNN models; VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, NFNet, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet, EfficientNetB7, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet. From the models, MobileNetV2 was selected for further modification to obtain a higher accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Performance evaluation of the models was demonstrated using a confusion matrix. It was observed that the modified MobileNetV2 model proposed in the study gave the highest accuracy of 98% in classifying COVID-19 and healthy chest X-rays among all the implemented CNN models. The second-best performance was achieved from the pre-trained MobileNetV2 with an accuracy of 97%, followed by VGG19 and ResNet101 with 95% accuracy for both the models. The study compares the compilation time of the models. The proposed model required the least compilation time with 2 h, 50 min and 21 s. Finally, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to test the statistical significance. The results suggest that the proposed method can efficiently identify the symptoms of infection from chest X-ray images better than existing methods.","output":"COVID-19 Detection Using Deep Learning Algorithm on Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent for COVID-19 pneumonia.

Two groups of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, including 12 severe patients in ICUs who needed mechanical ventilation and 11 mild patients in isolation wards. Serial clinical samples were collected for laboratory detection. Results showed that most of the severe patients had viral shedding in a variety of tissues for 20~40 days post onset of disease (8/12, 66.7%); while the majority of mild patients had viral shedding restricted to the respiratory tract and had no detectable virus RNA after 10 days post-onset (9/11, 81.8%). Mild patients showed significantly lower IgM response compared with that of the severe group. IgG responses were detected in most patients in both severe and mild groups at 9 days post onset and remained high level throughout the study. Antibodies cross-reactive to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were detected in COVID-19 patients but not in MERS patients. High-levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced after about 10 days post onset in both severe and mild patients which were higher in the severe group. SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization test and focus reduction neutralization test with authentic virus showed consistent results.

METHODS: We aimed to study the clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Dubai, a multi-national Society. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, age, gender, and country of origin were associated with more severe cases of COVID-19, higher risk for hospitalization and death.

Lethality in European territories and in territories of some nations with a non-temperate climate was also compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lethality was calculated as the rate of deaths in a determinate moment from the outbreak of the pandemic out of the total of identified positives for COVID-19 in a given area/nation, based on the COVID-John Hopkins University website. Lethality of countries located within the 5th parallels North/South on 6 April and 6 May 2020, was compared with that of all the other countries. Lethality in the European areas of The Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom was also compared to the territories of the same nations in areas with a non-temperate climate. RESULTS: A lower lethality rate of COVID-19 was found in Equatorial countries both on April 6 (OR=0.72 CI 95% 0.66-0.80) and on May 6 (OR=0.48, CI 95% 0.47-0.51), with a strengthening over time of the protective effect.

It generally manifests as a visible painful cord located along the dorsal surface of the penis with signs of skin inflammation. The condition is usually self-limiting, but in severe cases a surgical procedure may be necessary in addition to pharmacological treatment. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a frequent incidence of thrombophilia; therefore, such a prothrombotic state during infection may be a significant risk factor for penile Mondor disease. CASE PRESENTATION: The 34-year-old patient reported moderate pain felt on the surface of the penis. During the medical interview, the patient did not admit significant risk factors for Mondor Disease, apart from the previous, a month earlier COVID-19 disease. Examination revealed swelling erythema and a thick indurated cord on the surface of the penis. Color Doppler ultrasound was performed to confirm assumptions and exclude thrombosis of other penile vessels. Based on visible clots in the course of the superficial penile vein and after exclusion of vasculitis due to autoimmune disease the diagnosis of penile Mondor disease was made. Pharmacological therapy was implemented to further break down the clot and prevent rethrombosis in the penile vessels. The patient did not report any treatment complications and returned for a control visit, which revealed complete clot dissolution on ultrasound; therefore, complete recovery was stated. CONCLUSIONS: This case report presents the correlation between SARS-Cov-2 infection and penile Mondor disease, based on the confirmed influence of COVID-19 on the pathophysiology of thrombosis. It can be concluded that COVID- 19 is a risk factor for Mondor disease, as in the presented case the virus was the only prothrombotic risk factor for the patient.

As on date, the traditional polymerized chain reactions (PCR), lateral flow devices (LFID) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are being adapted for the detection of this deadly virus. However, a more exciting avenue is the detection of certain biomarkers associated with this viral infection which can be done by simply re-purposing our existing infrastructure. SARS-CoV-2 viral infection triggers various inflammatory, biochemical and hematological biomarkers. Because of the infection route that the virus follows, it causes significant inflammatory response. As a result, various inflammatory markers have been reported to be closely associated with this infection such as C-reactive proteins, interleukin-6, procalcitonin and ferritin. Sensing of these biomarkers can simultaneously help in understanding the illness level of the affected patient. Also, by monitoring these biomarkers, we can predict the viral infections in those patients who have low SARS-CoV-2 RNA and hence are missed by traditional tests. This can give more targets to the researchers and scientists, working in the area of drug development and provide better prognosis.

Several EU initiatives related to debt redistribution are analysed, along with the impact of these initiatives on Eastern European countries, particularly those of the Baltic Sea region. The research explores the decisions from the standpoint of legal and political science. In particular, it is stressed that, when reaching a compromise on making the budget conditional on respect for the rule of law, the EU and its member states had to use a mechanism for postponing the execution of an act of the Union, which contradicts the basic principles of EU law.

As it is unknown whether this happens more often with certain patient groups, we explored whether general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists perceived such expectations when they provided antibiotics to immigrant patients. METHODS: Ten GPs and five pharmacists from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were interviewed on the basis of a semi-structured topic guide. Atlas.ti software was then used to conduct a thematic analysis. RESULTS: GPs felt that immigrant patients, especially those who had arrived recently, were more likely to expect to receive antibiotics than native Dutch patients. However, these expectations had decreased over the last years and did not always lead immigrants to exert pressure on them. Except for language barriers, the factors reported by GPs to influence their antibiotic prescribing behaviour were unrelated to patients immigrant background. If there was a language barrier, GPs experienced greater diagnostic uncertainty and needed additional time to obtain and communicate correct information. To overcome language barriers, they often used point-of-care testing to convince patients that antibiotics were unnecessary. Although pharmacists rarely experienced problems dispensing antibiotics to immigrants, they and GPs both struggled to find effective ways of overcoming language barriers, and stressed the need for multi-language support materials. CONCLUSION: While pharmacists rarely experience any problems providing antibiotics to immigrants, GPs regularly face language barriers with immigrant patients, which complicate the diagnostic process and communicating information in the limited available time.

The frequency of stroke in COVID-19 has varied greatly in previous reports, probably reflecting the intensity with which neurologic abnormalities have been sought. The great majority of stroke have been thought to be ischemic. METHODS: Review of data, case reports, and case series RESULTS: See table 1 for a summary of reported data on neurologic manifestations of COVID-19. When MRI has been done, the great majority of strokes have been shown to be ischemic. COVID-19 causes a generalized hypercoagulable state, and arterial thromboses have been recognized in other organs, as well, involving pulmonary, mesenteric and coronary arteries. Coronavirus infection causes an intense release of cytokines with widespread activation of the coagulation cascade. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 attaches to ACE 2 receptors on endothelial surfaces via the S (spike) protein and invades causing a localized inflammatory response, with a resulting increase in local thrombotic activity. Antiphospholipid antibodies are sometimes present. New data suggest possible role of alpha-defensin level in creation and prevention of disintegration of blood clots. To date, reports of neurologic disease are based on case series, so there is no way, at present, to calculate the frequency of neurologic complications of COVID-19. A systematic, prospective study focusing on neurologic examination supplemented by MRI in hospitalized patients would answer the question of the incidence of this complication, but logistical problems including patients need for ICU care and concern for contagion resulting from sending patents out of the ICU for procedures mitigate against the likelihood of such a study being done. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that: (1) stroke occurs in COVID-19 more frequently than is recognized; (2) a hypercoagulable state with inflammation at the site of local invasion of vascular endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2, perhaps with a role for antiphospolipid antibodies all contribute to the pathogenesis of stroke; and (3) more liberal use of anticoagulation in COVID-19 cases should be considered.

METHODS: We surveyed relevant articles published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese up to July, 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, and BVS databases. Moreover, we surveyed potentially important articles in journals such as the NEJM, JAMA, BMJ, Gut, and AJG. RESULTS: This systematic review included 43 studies, including 18,246 patients. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom, affecting 11.5% of the patients, followed by nausea and vomiting (6.3%) and abdominal pain (2.3%).

Due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, MSCs have been extensively researched and tested for treatment of different diseases/indications. One mechanism that MSCs exert functions is through the transfer of mitochondria, a key player involved in many biological processes in health and disease. Mitochondria transfer is bidirectional and has an impact on both donor and recipient cells. In this review, we discussed how MSC-mediated mitochondrial transfer may affect cellular metabolism, survival, proliferation, and differentiation; how this process influences inflammatory processes; and what is the molecular machinery that mediates mitochondrial transfer. In the end, we summarized recent advances in preclinical research and clinical trials for the treatment of stroke and spinal cord injury, through application of MSCs and/or MSC-derived mitochondria.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cell-Mediated Mitochondrial Transfer and the Therapeutic Potential in Treatment of Neurological Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is a boundary separating parameters that can permit epidemics from those that cannot. This threshold corresponds to points where the stability of the systems equilibrium reaches zero. Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold for some individual variables of the model. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, we find that they still provide useful insight into the behaviour of estimates from simulations with a range of population sizes, environmental noise, and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold. The estimation approach is general and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV as well as vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.","output":"Estimating the distance to an epidemic threshold"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"News articles generated by online media are a major source of information. In this work, we present News Monitor, a framework that automatically collects news articles from a wide variety of online news portals and performs various analysis tasks. The framework initially identifies fresh news (first stories) and clusters articles about the same incidents. For every story, at first, it extracts all of the corresponding triples and, then, it creates a knowledge base (KB) using open information extraction techniques. This knowledge base is then used to create a summary for the user. News Monitor allows for the users to use it as a search engine, ask their questions in their natural language and receive answers that have been created by the state-of-the-art framework BERT. In addition, News Monitor crawls the Twitter stream using a dynamic set of trending keywords in order to retrieve all messages relevant to the news. The framework is distributed, online and performs analysis in real-time. According to the evaluation results, the fake news detection techniques utilized by News Monitor allow for a F-measure of 82% in the rumor identification task and an accuracy of 92% in the stance detection tasks.

Ferroptosis was induced at low drug doses and was associated with increased cellular iron and decreased glutathione levels, concomitant with reduced levels of GPX4 and key glutathione biosynthesis genes. Further functional studies, analysis of clinical datasets and breast cancer specimens revealed a unique vulnerability of TNBC to ferroptosis inducers, enrichment of ferroptosis gene signature, and differential expression of key proteins that increase labile iron and decrease glutathione levels.

We exposed 40 young healthy men to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST, n = 20) or its non-stressful placebo version (PTSST, n = 20). Moral decision-making was assessed early (+10 until +30 min) and late (+75 until +95 min) after (P)TSST exposure by the Everyday Moral Conflict Situations (EMCS) Scale (Singer et al., 2019). The EMCS Scale requests altruistic versus egoistic responses to everyday moral conflict situations with varying closeness of target persons. Results revealed significantly higher total percentages of altruistic decisions in the stress than in the control condition and for scenarios involving socially close (e.g., mother) versus socially distant (e.g., stranger) protagonists, while the main effect of timing was nonsignificant. Only secondary analyses showed increased altruistic decision-making after acute stress exposure towards socially close but not towards distant protagonists at the early but not at the late point of measurement. Moreover, psychological stress responses and personality traits were significantly associated with EMCS scores. Positive correlations between cortisol levels and altruistic decision-making were descriptively observable, but did not reach statistical significance. In sum, our findings suggest increased altruistic decision-making towards socially close compared to socially distant protagonists and provide further evidence that acute stress influences decision-making in everyday moral conflict scenarios in a prosocial manner.","output":"Everyday moral decision-making after acute stress exposure: do social closeness and timing matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Self-administered subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) is poised to increase access to contraception; however, governments are concerned about the waste management of used units. Self-injectors in Malawi and Uganda are currently instructed to store used units in containers and return them to health workers for disposal. However, this may not be feasible in low-resource settings, especially for younger or covert self-injectors. We describe adolescent (15C19 years) and adult (20C49 years) self-injectors disposal experiences in Uganda and Malawi. When possible, we compare covert and overt users experiences. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional qualitative studies in 2019 with 50 self-injectors in Uganda and 60 in Malawi. We purposively selected approximately half adolescents and included those trained by clinic-based providers and community health workers. We conducted semi-structured interviews and thematic data analysis and compared the findings across settings. RESULTS: Just under half of both samples were adolescents, substantially more of whom were covert users in Uganda (68%) than Malawi (~ 10%). Most participants reported being told to store used units in a container and return them to health workers. About two-thirds of Uganda participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, most commonly returning them to health workers. Over one-third of Malawi participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, slightly more disposed into latrines compared to returning to health workers. Participants in both settings reported compliance with health workers disposal instructions as a primary reason for their disposal method. One-fifth of Uganda participants, mostly adolescent covert users, and one-quarter in Malawi said they were told they could dispose into latrines, and often did so. The majority in both settings said they would prefer to dispose units in latrines because they worried about needlestick injuries to others and because it was convenient. Some Uganda adolescent covert users felt returning units to health workers was challenging due to privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: While most self-injectors disposed of used units as instructed, findings from both studies suggest that returning units to health workers is not preferred and may not be feasible for some adolescent covert users. More convenient disposal solutions should be identified.","output":"Adolescent and covert family planning users experiences self-injecting contraception in Uganda and Malawi: implications for waste disposal of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring and summer of 2020, paediatric heart centres were forced to rapidly alter the way patient care was provided to minimise interruption to patient care as well as exposure to the virus.

Local autogenous bone is largely unavailable, distant bone grafts are fraught with significant morbidity and limited yield, and alloplastic materials are incompatible with the growing calvarium and facial skeleton. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, a member of a class of proteins first noticed in the 1960s to promote bone deposition in soft tissues, offers a potential solution to the bone shortage historically faced by the pediatric craniofacial surgeon. A review of English language literature was conducted from the 1960s to the present.Attention was focused on BMP-2's osteoinductive mechanism, basic science and translational laboratory findings, and multidisciplinary clinical experiences. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 has been embraced by spine surgeons, is gaining in popularity for long-bone repair, and is making its way into the plastic surgery literature.

Methods: A total of 239 patients with ACS were enrolled into the study. Patients were divided into two groups. First group was prepandemic group consisted of patients admitted at January and February 2020, before the pandemic. Second group was consisted of ACS patients admitted through April and May 2020 during pandemic. Both groups were compared according to demographic properties, blood chemistry findings, angiographic features, revascularisation strategies and clinical outcomes. Results: During pandemic period we observed an increase in total number of patient with ST elevation miyocardial infarction (STEMI) patients compared to prepandemic period ( 59(45%) vs 32 (29.6%) respectively).

However, participants are clear that it is essential to follow the guidelines of the scientists and doctors, which are represented as credible sources. However, when the state of alarm and the lockdown of all citizens was declared, most of the participants represented the risk as being associated with the elderly and the pandemic became something that might also affect their families. Due to these circumstances, negative emotions appear such as fear, nervousness, uncertainty, restlessness, and insecurity.

Professional medical societies endorse LARC use in AYAs and, more recently, have emphasized the importance of using a reproductive justice framework when providing LARC. This article reviews reproductive justice, discusses contraceptive coercion, examines bias, and highlights interventions that promote equitable reproductive healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS: Research indicates that both bias and patient characteristics influence provider LARC practices. AYA access to comprehensive LARC services is limited, as counseling, provision, management, and removal are not offered at all sites providing reproductive healthcare to AYAs. Interventions aimed at addressing provider bias and knowledge, clinic policies, confidentiality concerns, insurance reimbursement, and systems of oppression can improve AYA access to equitable, comprehensive contraceptive care. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequities in reproductive healthcare, as well as provided unique innovations to decrease barriers, including telemedicine LARC services. SUMMARY: Clinicians who care for AYAs should honor reproductive autonomy by approaching contraceptive services with a reproductive justice lens.

METHODS: A rigorous COS development process was used including a systematic review, qualitative interviews, modified Delphi consensus process, and in-person consensus using nominal group technique (registration http://www.comet- initiative.org/studies/details/796). Participants in qualitative interviews were delirium survivors or family members. Participants in consensus methods comprised international representatives from three stakeholder groups: researchers, clinicians, and delirium survivors and family members. RESULTS: Item generation identified 8 delirium-specific outcomes and 71 other outcomes from 183 studies, and 30 outcomes from 18 qualitative interviews, including 2 that were not extracted from the systematic review. De-duplication of outcomes and formal consensus processes involving 110 experts including researchers (N = 32), clinicians (N = 63), and delirium survivors and family members (N = 15) resulted in a COS comprising 6 outcomes: delirium occurrence and reoccurrence, delirium severity, delirium duration, cognition, emotional distress, and health-related quality of life.

This project aimed to explore the outcome of patients assessed by Mental Health Liaison Services (MHLS) in a large district general hospital ED in the UK, with a focus on patients with self-harm or suicidality.MethodData were extracted from electronic patient records on 100 consecutive attendees to MHLS in July 2020. Data were collected on demographics, index of multiple deprivation (IMD) by postcode, time and reason for attendance, known ICD-10 diagnoses, self-harm history, alcohol/substance misuse at time of presentation, recent psychosocial stressors and outcome of MHLS assessment. Assessments by MHLS in the preceding 12 months and reattendance to the service within 3 months following this assessment were also recorded.ResultThe sample included 44 male and 56 female patients, with a mean age of 35.3 years. 80.0% of patients were Caucasian. 67.0% lived in areas classed within the top 30% most deprived in the country, whilst 2.0% had no fixed abode. The majority (79.0%) of patients self-presented;outside of normal working hours (70.0%). The most common reasons for attendance were thoughts/intent of self-harm/suicide (50.0%), overdose (29.0%) and self-harm by laceration (7.0%).The majority (73.0%) of patients had a known psychiatric diagnosis, with the most frequent being depressive disorder (36.0%) and emotionally unstable personality disorder (15.0%). Almost half (48.0%) had a history of self-harm, and 40.0% were under the influence of alcohol/illicit substances upon presentation to ED. The most common psychosocial triggers were conflict with partner (26.0%) and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic (19.0%).Following assessment, 24.0% of patients were discharged to their General Practitioner, 18.0% to the community mental health team;and 17.0% to the Crisis & Home Treatment Team. A minority (13.0%) were admitted to a psychiatric hospital (10.0% informally, 3.0% under the Mental Health Act 1983).Approximately one in five (21.0%) patients re-attended to MHLS within 3 months. Out of 37 patients that had previously been assessed by MHLS in the preceding 12 months;37.8% were reassessed within 3 months (p &lt; 0.01).ConclusionIn the studied sample, most (90%) of psychiatric patients attended ED for self-harm or suicide, and a significant proportion had repeat attendance. Socioeconomic deprivation, substance misuse, relationship difficulties and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues, alongside diagnosed depression and personality disorder.

Cows in group I were inoculated IM and intramammarily (IMm) with Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) tissue culture-propagated modified-live Nebraska calf diarrhea bovine rotavirus with added adjuvant (OARDC vaccine-immunized cows). Group II cows were given IM injections of a commercial modified-live rotavirus-coronavirus vaccine (commercial vaccine-immunized cows), and the remaining 5 cows were noninoculated controls (group III). Rotavirus antibody in colostrum and milk was mainly associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)G1, and less so with IgG2, IgA, and IgM, as analyzed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using monospecific anti-bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, and IgA sera. In serum, the rotavirus antibody was distributed almost equally between IgG1 and IgG2. The same relationships appeared in both immunized and nonvaccinated cows. All OARDC vaccine-injected cows had virus-neutralization (VN) and ELISA IgG1 rotavirus antibody titers in serum and mammary secretions at significantly increased levels (at least 100-fold; P less than 0.05) compared with the titers in groups II (commercial vaccine-immunized cows) and III (controls). Serum, colostrum, and milk antibody titers from these latter 2 groups did not differ statistically. The ELISA IgG2, IgA, and IgM rotavirus antibody titers also were significantly greater in mammary secretions from OARDC vaccine-immunized cows than in groups II and III cows. There was a high correlation between ELISA IgG1 and VN rotavirus antibody titers for all samples tested (r = 0.97, P less than 0.001), but ELISA IgG1 antibody titers were consistently higher than VN titers. The ELISA IgG1 and VN antibody titers of milk samples collected from cows 30 days after parturition were higher from the OARDC vaccine-immunized cows (ELISA IgG1, geometric mean titer (GMT) = 3,511; VN GMT = 1,689) than were titers from the group II cows (ELISA IgG1 GMT = 39; VN GMT = 33) or group III cows (ELISA IgG1 GMT = 21; VN GMT = 19).

This study examined perceptions and behaviors of employees and students who used tobacco products on tobacco-free campuses, to better understand policy non-compliance. METHODS: Students (n=56) and employees (n=20) from two tobacco-free 4-year public universities in Southern California who self-reported using tobacco products on campus participated in focus groups, stratified by university and student or employee (faculty and staff) status, to discuss attitudes toward campus tobacco policies and on-campus smoking. Focus group discussions were transcribed and analyzed after structured coding and subcoding. RESULTS: Participants were generally aware that smoking and vaping were not allowed on campus, though few could correctly identify their campus as tobacco-free. Attitudes toward the policy varied by subgroup and by campus, with students and employees at different universities expressing varying levels of support. Non-compliance was a unique interaction of individual, institutional, and interpersonal factors including a desire to smoke or vape to reduce stress, lack of formal enforcement or penalty for violating the policy, and efforts to smoke or vape in ways that reduce harm to others as a way of rationalizing non-compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes toward university tobacco-free policies are campus- and constituency-specific, with similarities in individual, institutional, and interpersonal factors underlying non-compliance. Interventions to increase compliance should address individual, institutional, and interpersonal influences on non-compliance through efforts tailored to specific campus constituencies based on their particular knowledge and attitudes towards tobacco-free policies.","output":"Non-compliance with university tobacco-free policies: A qualitative exploration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemics increased research in the interaction of coronaviruses with human immune response Moreover, a detailed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 immune response might be helpful in vaccine development and delivering some other therapeutic approaches Several papers described SARS and MERS antiviral response Unfortunately, not all data derived from SARS and MERS studies could be directly applied to the SARS-CoV-2 immune response, its clinical course and severe COVID-19 pathology In this paper we are trying to summarize basic aspects of COVID-19 immunopathology focusing on immune response, pathogenesis of severe disease and the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessors Moreover, we are trying to outline possible therapeutic approaches including but not limited to vaccines All reviewed data have to be treated with caution Next months and years will generate more results helping us to deal with SARS-CoV-2, which will confirm or disprove current information and the understanding of COVID-19","output":"The immune response to sars-cov-2.

Among those, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are extremely versatile and, therefore, widely prescribed. Moreover, they are commonly considered as having a better safety profile compared to other antidepressants. For these reasons, when it comes to off-label prescribing, SSRIs rank among the top positions. In this review, we present the state of the art of off-label applications of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, ranging from migraine prophylaxis to SARS-CoV-2 antiviral properties. Research on SSRIs provided significant evidence in the treatment of premature ejaculation, both with the on-label dapoxetine 30 mg and the off-label paroxetine 20 mg. However, other than serotoninergic syndrome, serious conditions like increased bleeding rates, hyponatremia, hepatoxicity, and post-SSRIs sexual dysfunctions, are consistently more prominent when using such compounds. These insidious side effects might be frequently underestimated during common clinical practice, especially by non-psychiatrists. For this reason, some points must be addressed when using SSRIs. Among these, a psychiatric evaluation before every administration that falls outside the regulatory agencies-approved guidelines has to be considered mandatory. For these reasons, we aim with the present article to identify the risks of inappropriate uses and to advocate the need to actively boost research encouraging future clinical trials on this topic.","output":"Off-label uses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unique functionality of Akkermansia muciniphila in gut microbiota indicates it to be an indispensable microbe for human welfare.

These vesicles play an important role in intercellular communication and influence the extracellular environment and the immune system. Emerging evidence demonstrates that cancer-derived exosomes are enriched in immunosuppressive proteins, such as the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). PD-L1 and its receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are the key immune checkpoint molecules that promote tumor progression via negative regulation of immune responses. PDL-1 is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and binds to PD-1 on the surface of activated T cells, leading to suppression of T cells, which consequently enables cancer cells to escape antitumor immunity. Currently, there are several Food and Drug Administration-approved monoclonal antibodies blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, which are clinically used for cancer treatment. However, despite impressive treatment outcomes, some patients show poor response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Of note, tumor-derived exosomes containing PD-L1 can recapitulate the effect of cell-surface PD-L1. There is evidence that reveals a significant association between levels of circulating exosomal PD-L1 and rate of response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy. The present article reviews the role of exosomal PDL-1 in the therapeutic resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Importantly, it is suggested that the removal of exosomal PDL-1 could serve as a therapeutic adjuvant for enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with cancer.","output":"Mechanisms underlying low-clinical responses to PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies in immunotherapy of cancer: a key role of exosomal PD-L1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Species of Old World fruit-bats (family Pteropodidae) have been identified as the natural hosts of a number of novel and highly pathogenic viruses threatening livestock and human health.

Data loggers were deployed on eight of 54 A. jubatus (two males and six females) captured near Subic Bay on the Philippine island of Luzon between 22 November and 2 December 2010.

The majority of foraging locations were in closed forest and most were remote from evident human activity. Forty-six discrete foraging locations and five previously unrecorded roost locations were identified. Our findings indicate that foraging is not a random event, with the majority of bats exhibiting repetitious foraging movements night-to-night, that apparently intact forest provides the primary foraging resource, and that known roost locations substantially underestimate the true number (and location) of roosts.

Hence, nanotechnology-based IOT biosensors play a significant role in the medical field. Problem. However, the consistency continues to decrease where missing data occurs in such medical data from nanotechnology-based IOT biosensors. Furthermore, each region has its own special features, which further lowers the accuracy of prediction. The proposed model initially reconstructs lost or partial data in order to address the challenge of handling the medical data structures with incomplete data. Methods. An adaptive architecture is proposed to enhance the computing capabilities to predict the disease automatically. The medical databases are managed by unpredictable environments. This optimized paradigm for diagnosis produces the fuzzy, genetically categorized decision tree algorithm. This work uses a normalized classifier namely fuzzy-based decision tree (FDT) algorithm for classifying the data collected via nanotechnology-based IOT biosensors, and this helps in the identification of nondeterministic instances from unstructured datasets relating to the medical diagnosis. The FDT algorithm is further enhanced by using genetic algorithms for effective classification of instances. Finally, the proposed system uses two larger datasets to verify the predictive precision. In order to describe a fuzzy decision tree algorithm based upon the fitness function value, a modified decision classification rule is used. The structure and unstructured databases are configured for processing. Results and Conclusions. This evaluation of test patterns helps to track the efficiency of FDT with optimized rules during the training and testing stages. The proposed method is validated against nanotechnology-based IOT biosensors data in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F -measure. The results of the simulation show that the proposed method achieves a higher rate of accuracy than the other methods. Other metrics relating to the model with and without feature selection show an improved sensitivity, specificity, and F -measure rate than the existing methods.

For any kind of assay development, screening for the optimal antigen is essential. Here we describe the verification of a new protein microarray with different commercially available preparations significant antigens of SARS-CoV-2 that can be used for the evaluation of the performance of these antigens in serological assays and for antibody screening in serum samples. Antigens of other pathogens that are addressed by widely used vaccinations were also included. To evaluate the accuracy of 21 different antigens or antigen preparations on the microarray, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis using ELISA results as reference were performed. Except for a single concentration, a diagnostic sensitivity of 1 was determined for all antigen preparations. A diagnostic specificity, as well as an area under the curve (AUC) of 1 was obtained for 16 of 21 antigen preparations. For the remaining five, the diagnostic specificity ranged from 0.942 to 0.981 and AUC from 0.974 to 0.999. The optimized assay was subsequently also applied to determine the immune status of previously tested individuals and/or to detect the immunization status after COVID-19 vaccination. Microarray evaluation of the antibody profiles of COVID-19 convalescent and post vaccination sera showed that the IgG response differed between these groups, and that the choice of the test antigen is crucial for the assay performance. Furthermore, the results showed that the immune response is highly individualized, depended on several factors (e.g., age or sex), and was not directly related to the severity of disease.

The utility of cycle threshold, at admission, as a predictor of disease severity has not been thoroughly investigated. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study of SARS-CoV-2 positive, hospitalized patients from 3/26/2020 to 8/5/2020 who had SARS-CoV-2 Ct data within 48 hours of admission (n = 1044). Only patients with complete survival data, discharged (n = 774) or died in hospital (n = 270), were included in our analysis. Laboratory, demographic, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to examine the relationship of patient mortality with Ct values while adjusting for established risk factors. Ct was analyzed as continuous variable and subdivided into quartiles to better illustrate its relationship with outcome. Cumulative incidence curves were created to assess whether there was a survival difference in the setting of the competing risks of death versus patient discharge. Mean Ct at admission was higher for survivors (28.6, SD = 5.8) compared to non-survivors (24.8, SD = 6.0, P<0.001). In-hospital mortality significantly differed (p<0.05) by Ct quartile. After adjusting for age, gender, BMI, hypertension and diabetes, increased cycle threshold was associated with decreased odds of in-hospital mortality (0.91, CI 0.89-0.94, p<0.001). Compared to the 4th Quartile, patients with Ct values in the 1st Quartile (Ct <22.9) and 2nd Quartile (Ct 23.0-27.3) had an adjusted odds ratio of in-hospital mortality of 3.8 and 2.6 respectively (p<0.001). The discriminative ability of Ct to predict inpatient mortality was found to be limited, possessing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 (CI 0.63-0.71). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 Ct was found to be an independent predictor of patient mortality. However, further study is needed on how to best clinically utilize such information given the result variation due to specimen quality, phase of disease, and the limited discriminative ability of the test.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold at hospital admission associated with patient mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To determine whether mean arterial blood pressure excursions below the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation during cardiopulmonary bypass are associated with acute kidney injury after surgery. SETTING Tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS Four hundred ten patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. DESIGN Prospective observational study. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Autoregulation was monitored during cardiopulmonary bypass by calculating a continuous, moving Pearson's correlation coefficient between mean arterial blood pressure and processed near-infrared spectroscopy signals to generate the variable cerebral oximetry index. When mean arterial blood pressure is below the lower limit of autoregulation, cerebral oximetry index approaches 1, because cerebral blood flow is pressure passive. An identifiable lower limit of autoregulation was ascertained in 348 patients. Based on the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, End-stage renal disease), acute kidney injury developed within 7 days of surgery in 121 (34.8%) of these patients. Although the average mean arterial blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass did not differ, the mean arterial blood pressure at the limit of autoregulation and the duration and degree to which mean arterial blood pressure was below the autoregulation threshold (mm Hg  min/hr of cardiopulmonary bypass) were both higher in patients with acute kidney injury than in those without acute kidney injury. Excursions of mean arterial blood pressure below the lower limit of autoregulation (relative risk 1.02; 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.03; p < 0.0001) and diabetes (relative risk 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.50; p = 0.001) were independently associated with for acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS Excursions of mean arterial blood pressure below the limit of autoregulation and not absolute mean arterial blood pressure are independently associated with for acute kidney injury. Monitoring cerebral oximetry index may provide a novel method for precisely guiding mean arterial blood pressure targets during cardiopulmonary bypass.","output":"Blood pressure excursions below the cerebral autoregulation threshold during cardiac surgery are associated with acute kidney injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is associated with severe COVID-19. Our aim was to describe clinical and laboratory features (including electrocardiographic and echocardiographic ones) and outcomes of patients with cardiac disease hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study of consecutive adult patients admitted, between March and September of 2020, with confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection. Data were collected as per the ISARIC case report form and complemented with variables related to heart disease. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one patients were included. Mean age was 60 SD 15.2 years and 80/121(66.1%) were male. Two-thirds of the patients (80/121, 66.1%) had COVID-19 at the time of hospital admission and COVID-19 was the reason for hospitalization in 42 (34.7%). Other reasons for hospital admission were acute coronary syndrome (26%) and decompensated heart failure (14.8%). Chronic cardiac diseases were found in 106/121 (87.6%), mostly coronary artery disease (62%) or valve disease (33.9%). A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed in 93/121(76.8%) and enlarged cardiac chambers were found in 71% (66/93); admission ECG was done in 93 cases (93/121, 76.8%), and 89.2% (83/93) were abnormal. Hospital-acquisition of COVID-19 occurred in 20 (16.5%) of patients and their mortality was 50%. On bivariate analysis for mortality, BNP levels and troponin levels were NOT associated with mortality. On multivariate analysis, only C reactive protein levels and creatinine levels were significant. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 impacted the profile of hospital admissions in cardiac patients.

Yet, the practical model production and further research of deep face recognition are in great need of corresponding public support. For example, the production of face representation network desires a modular training scheme to consider the proper choice from various candidates of state-of-the-art backbone and training supervision subject to the real-world face recognition demand;for performance analysis and comparison, the standard and automatic evaluation with a bunch of models on multiple benchmarks will be a desired tool as well;besides, a public groundwork is welcomed for deploying the face recognition in the shape of holistic pipeline. Furthermore, there are some newly-emerged challenges, such as the masked face recognition caused by the recent world-wide COVID-19 pandemic, which draws increasing attention in practical applications. A feasible and elegant solution is to build an easy-to-use unified framework to meet the above demands.

Although some of the treatments are promising, it is thought to be early to state that there is definitive treatment. Experiences and treatment protocol studies from treatment centers are still important. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors affecting the treatment process of the first cases followed in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this retrospective and cross-sectional study. Data were recorded from the electronic and written files of patients. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients were evaluated. The median age was 50  15 years. Forty-eight (57.8%) patients had one or more comorbidities. The most common comorbidity was hypertension. The most common symptom was cough in 58 patients (70%). The overall mortality was 15%, and 85% of the patients were discharged. The time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization was statistically significantly longer in deceased patients (P = 0.039). Age, D-Dimer, troponin, CK, CK-MB, ferritin, procalcitonin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were statistically significantly higher in deceased patients than survivor patients. In subgroup analysis, in the patients receiving azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine and other antibiotics plus hydroxychloroquine, the duration of hospitalization was shorter in the azithromycin group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Early treatment and early admission to the hospital can be crucial for the better treatment process.

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of more than one month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment scores. RESULTS: Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: LT can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction that could contraindicate LT, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs.

However, its expression and function in breast cancer cells has yet to be studied. Therefore, RNA in situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of HEPIS in breast cancer and cancer-adjacent normal breast tissue. HEPIS was expressed at lower levels in breast cancer compared with that in adjacent normal tissue. Subcellular localization of HEPIS was mainly found in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine cell proliferation assays were used to investigate the role of HEPIS in cancer cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of HEPIS in MCF-7 cells was found to significantly inhibit cell proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of HEPIS by RNA interference exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed and HEPIS overexpression specifically inhibited the activity of the NF-B reporter gene. Results of the gene chip assay revealed that 2,231 genes were differentially expressed in HEPIS-overexpressing cells. Results of the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses indicated that these genes were enriched in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway and focal adhesion. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to confirm the expression levels of the differentially expressed genes interleukin 2 receptor subunit  (IL2RA), interferon  and  receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2) and IF8 (IFNA8).

Therefore, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains to detect the emergence of novel co-existing mutations and trace their geographical distribution within India. Comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of 837 Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed the occurrence of 33 different mutations, 18 of which were unique to India. Novel mutations were observed in the S glycoprotein (6/33), NSP3 (5/33), RdRp/NSP12 (4/33), NSP2 (2/33), and N (1/33). Non-synonymous mutations were found to be 3.07 times more prevalent than synonymous mutations. We classified the Indian isolates into 22 groups based on their co-existing mutations. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the representative strains of each group were divided into various sub-clades within their respective clades, based on the presence of unique co-existing mutations. The A2a clade was found to be dominant in India (71.34%), followed by A3 (23.29%) and B (5.36%), but a heterogeneous distribution was observed among various geographical regions. The A2a clade was highly predominant in East India, Western India, and Central India, whereas the A2a and A3 clades were nearly equal in prevalence in South and North India.

RESULTS: Out of 288 scheduled appointments, 60 were prenatal consultations and 228 were postnatal visits. We performed most of prenatal consultations as face-to-face visits, as women would have been present in the hospital to perform other procedures in addition to our consult. As for postnatal care, we suspended all outpatient first visits and opted for telemedicine for selected follow-up consultations: interestingly, 75% of our patients' parents revealed that they would have cancelled the appointment themselves for the fear to contract an infection.

Here, we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human-modified environments, or synanthropic species, are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). We do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature. The evidence for this relationship is examined with special emphasis on the Australasian, South East Asian and East Asian regions. We find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases, and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species. A significant positive association with EIDs is also evident for those wildlife species of low conservation risk. Since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human-induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss, our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion, global decline in biodiversity and a rise in EIDs of wildlife origin.","output":"Synanthropy of Wild Mammals as a Determinant of Emerging Infectious Diseases in the AsianCAustralasian Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dietary intervention studies thus far have failed to be replicable or causal.

Contrary to great variability in infectivity, which we show has no bearing on the mathematical modeling, variability in susceptibility actually manifests itself as pre-immunity on a macroscopic scale, thus making pre-immunity a necessity for accurate mathematical modeling.","output":"Pre-immunity: the Schrodinger's cat of immunology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Our study aims to explore the differential impact of this pandemic on clinical presentations and outcomes in African Americans (AAs) compared to white patients. BACKGROUND: AAs have worse outcomes compared to whites while facing heart diseases, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. However, there is no current study to show the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the AA communities. METHODS: This is a retrospective study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 tertiary centers in New Orleans, LA. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were identified. Of these, 134 (77%) were AAs, whereas 23.4% of patients were Whites. Interestingly, AA were younger, with a mean age of 63  13.4 compared to 75.7  23 years in Whites (P < 0.001). Thirty-seven patients presented with no insurance, and 34 of them were AA. SOFA Score was significantly higher in AA (2.57  2.1) compared to White patients (1.69  1.7), P = 0.041. Elevated SOFA score was associated with higher odds for intubation (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.32-1.93, P < 0.001). AA had more prolonged length of hospital stays (11.1  13.4 days vs 7.7  23 days) than in Whites, P = 0.01. CONCLUSION: AAs present with more advanced disease and eventually have worse outcomes from COVID-19 infection.

The aim of this study was to explore PHC provider interpretation and management of potential breast and cervical cancer signs and symptoms. METHODS: In-depth interviews with PHC providers incorporating vignettes were conducted between April and May 2019 in two sites in SA. Four vignettes (two breast and two cervical) were developed by the research team to capture aspects of provider symptom interpretation, reasoning, actions and challenges. The content of the vignettes was informed by a preceding community-based survey and qualitative interviews with symptomatic women. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Twenty-four PHC providers were interviewed (12 urban, 12 rural; median age: 43 years). Four main themes relating to clinical assessment and reasoning; referral and feedback challenges; awareness of breast and cervical cancer policy guidelines and training and education needs emerged. Vignette-prompted questions relating to presenting symptoms, and possible accompanying symptoms and signs, demonstrated comprehensive proposed history taking and clinical assessment by PHC providers. Cancer was considered as a potential diagnosis by the majority of PHC providers. PHC providers also considered the possibility of infectious causes for both breast and cervical vignettes indicating they would ask questions around human immunodeficiency virus status, use of anti-retroviral therapy, and, for those with cervical symptoms, would need to rule out a sexually transmitted infection. Sexual assault was considered in assessing the cervical symptom scenarios. Providers raised issues around cumbersome booking systems and lack of feedback from referral centres. The need for provider and patient education and training to improve timely diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer was raised. Most providers were not aware of current breast or cervical cancer policy guidelines. CONCLUSION: Clinical assessment at PHC level is complex and influenced by local health issues. Providing context-relevant training and support for PHC providers, and improving referral and feedback systems, could assist timely diagnosis of women with symptomatic breast and cervical cancer.","output":"Exploring primary care level provider interpretation and management of potential breast and cervical cancer signs and symptoms in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this paper is to synthesize the digital interventions initiatives to fight against COVID-19 in Bangladesh and compare with other countries.

It is commonly believed, but scarcely investigated, that product shelf life depends on the oxidative status of the lipid ingredients. In this study, the influence of oxidation degree of the ingredient sunflower oil on cracker oxidative stability and hence shelf life was investigated. To this aim, oil with increasing peroxide values (PVs) (5, 11, and 25 mEqO(2)/kg(oil)) was used to prepare crackers. Just after production, crackers presented similar peroxide and rancid odor intensity, probably due to the interactive pathways of oxidative and Maillard reactions. Crackers were packed and analyzed for PV and rancid odor during storage at 20, 40, and 60 C. Rancid odor well discriminated cracker oxidative status. Relevant oxidation rates were used to develop a shelf life predictive model based on the peroxide value of the ingredient oil. It was estimated that an oil PV from 5 to 15 mEqO(2)/kg(oil) shortens cracker Shelf Life (SL) by 50%, independently of storage temperature.

However, there is still insufficient evidence regarding how medical care that is based on the early diagnosis of confirmed cases can affect the outcome of COVID-19 treatment. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effect of the duration from the onset of clinical symptoms to confirmation of COVID-19 on the duration from the onset of symptoms to the resolution of COVID-19 (release from quarantine). METHODS: For preliminary data collection, we performed data crawling to extract data from social networks, blogs, and official websites operated by local governments. We collected data from the 4002 confirmed cases in 33 cities reported up to May 31, 2020, for whom sex and age information could be verified. Subsequently, 2494 patients with unclear symptom onset dates and 1349 patients who had not been released or had no data about their release dates were excluded. Thus, 159 patients were finally included in this study. To investigate whether rapid confirmation reduces the prevalence period, we divided the duration from symptom onset to confirmation into quartiles of 1, 3, 6, and 7 days, respectively. We investigated the duration from symptom onset to release and that from confirmation to release according to these quartiles. Furthermore, we performed multiple regression analysis to investigate the effects of rapid confirmation after symptom onset on the treatment period, duration of prevalence, and duration until release from isolation. RESULTS: We performed multiple regression analysis to investigate the association between rapid confirmation after symptom onset and the total prevalence period (faster release from isolation). The time from symptom onset to confirmation showed a negative association with the time from confirmation to release (t(1)=?3.58; P<.001) and a positive association with the time from symptom onset to release (t(1)=5.86; P<.001); these associations were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The duration from COVID-19 symptom onset to confirmation date is an important variable for predicting disease prevalence, and these results support the hypothesis that a short duration of symptom onset to confirmation can reduce the time from symptom onset to release.","output":"Effect of the Period From COVID-19 Symptom Onset to Confirmation on Disease Duration: Quantitative Analysis of Publicly Available Patient Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling mental health issues has become challenging too.

The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.70, p < 0.001).

They can be colonized with the Staphylococcus aureus complex, which includes Staphylococcus schweitzeri and Staphylococcus argenteus. Fecal carriage of S. aureus complex in the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) has been described. However, data on their transmission and adaptation in animals and humans are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the population structure of the S. aureus complex in E. helvum and to assess the geographical spread of S. aureus complex among other animals and humans. Fecal samples were collected from E. helvum in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Isolates were screened for the presence of lukS/lukF-PV and the immune evasion cluster (scn, sak, chp) which is frequently found in isolates adapted to the human host. A Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed using the concatenated sequences of the seven MLST genes. A total of 250 fecal samples were collected and 53 isolates were included in the final analysis. They were identified as S. aureus (n = 28), S. schweitzeri (n = 11) and S. argenteus (n = 14). Only one S. aureus was resistant to penicillin and another isolate was intermediately susceptible to tetracycline. The scn, sak, and chp gene were not detected. Species-specific MLST clonal complexes (CC) were detected for S. aureus (CC1725), S. argenteus (CC3960, CC3961), and S. schweitzeri (CC2463). STs of S. schweitzeri from this study were similar to STs from bats in Nigeria (ST2464) and Gabon (ST1700) or from monkey in C?te d'Ivoire (ST2058, ST2072). This suggests host adaptation of certain clones to wildlife mammals with a wide geographical spread in Africa. In conclusion, there is evidence of fecal carriage of members of S. aureus complex in E. helvum. S. schweitzeri from bats in Nigeria are closely related to those from bats and monkeys in West and Central Africa suggesting a cross-species transmission and wide geographical distribution. The low antimicrobial resistance rates and the absence of the immune evasion cluster suggests a limited exposure of these isolates to humans.","output":"Staphylococcus aureus Complex in the Straw-Colored Fruit Bat (Eidolon helvum) in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The recent outbreak of CoVID-19 is declared as a global public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).

A 69 years old woman was referred to the surgical ward for elective low anterior resection (LAR). The complete preoperative workup was performed with acceptable results.

Following the surgery, the patient's clinical status was stable for about 8 hours;however, the patient became anuric and hypotensive, receiving a variety of treatments for a list of differential diagnoses, including fresh lung CT scan and RT-PCR test;both of the latter were positive for COVID-19. Despite COVID-19 management and respiratory support, the patient died on day 15 of hospitalization.

We aimed to assess IPAC measures implemented in Quebecs hemodialysis units during the spring of 2020, describe the characteristics of these units and document the cumulative infection rates during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this cross-sectional survey, we invited leaders from 54 hemodialysis units in Quebec to report information on the physical characteristics of the unit and their perceptions of crowdedness, which IPAC measures were implemented from Mar. 1 to June 30, 2020, and adherence to and feasibility of appropriate IPAC measures. Participating units were contacted again in March 2021 to collect information on the number of COVID-19 cases in order to derive the cumulative infection rate of each unit. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 38 of the 54 units contacted (70% response rate), which provided care to 4485 patients at the time of survey completion. Fourteen units (37%) had implemented appropriate IPAC measures by 3 weeks after Mar. 1, and all 38 units had implemented them by 6 weeks after. One-third of units were perceived as crowded. General measures, masks and screening questionnaires were used in more than 80% of units, and various distancing measures in 55%C71%; reduction in dialysis frequency was rare. Data on cumulative infection rates were obtained from 27 units providing care to 4227 patients. The cumulative infection rate varied from 0% to 50% (median 11.3%, interquartile range 5.2%C20.2%) and was higher than the reported cumulative infection rate in the corresponding region in 23 (85%) of the 27 units. INTERPRETATION: Rates of COVID-19 infection among hemodialysis recipients in Quebec were elevated compared to the general population during the first year of the pandemic, and although hemodialysis units throughout the province implemented appropriate IPAC measures rapidly in the spring of 2020, many units were crowded and could not maintain physical distancing.

This typically requires an abdominal incision for specimen removal that is associated with the majority of postoperative pain. We describe the first laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal approach for sigmoidectomy and rectocolpopexy for the treatment of rectal prolapse. METHODS Mobilization of the sigmoid colon was performed laparoscopically using a 12-mm vaginal port and 3 additional 5-mm abdominal ports. A laparoscopic stapler was used through the vaginal port to transect the distal sigmoid colon. The specimen was subsequently externalized through the colpotomy to complete the resection and prepare the remaining bowel for intracorporeal, end-to-end, stapled anastomosis. The colpotomy was then repaired, and the colorectal anastomosis and rectocolpopexy were completed laparoscopically. RESULTS Sigmoidectomy and rectocolpopexy were successfully performed laparoscopically by using a transvaginal approach without the need for an abdominal incision for specimen removal. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course, complained of minimal pain, and was discharged home on postoperative day 3.

Most happen in resource-constrained settings and are potentially preventable. Hypoxaemia is one of the strongest predictors of these deaths. We present an updated estimate of hypoxaemia prevalence among children with pneumonia in low-income and middle-income countries. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the following key concepts children under five years of age AND pneumonia AND hypoxaemia AND low- and middle-income countries by searching in 11 bibliographic databases and citation indices. We included all articles published between Nov 1, 2008, and Oct 8, 2021, based on observational studies and control arms of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. We excluded protocol papers, articles reporting hypoxaemia prevalence based on less than 100 pneumonia cases, and articles published before 2008 from the review. Quality appraisal was done with the Joanna Briggs Institute tools. We reported pooled prevalence of hypoxaemia (SpO(2) <90%) by classification of clinical severity and by clinical settings by use of the random-effects meta-analysis models. We combined our estimate of the pooled prevalence of pneumonia with a previously published estimate of the number of children admitted to hospital due to pneumonia annually to calculate the total annual number of children admitted to hospital with hypoxaemic pneumonia. FINDINGS: We identified 2825 unique records from the databases, of which 57 studies met the eligibility criteria: 26 from Africa, 23 from Asia, five from South America, and four from multiple continents. The prevalence of hypoxaemia was 31% (95% CI 26C36; 101 775 children) among all children with WHO-classified pneumonia, 41% (33C49; 30 483 children) among those with very severe or severe pneumonia, and 8% (3C16; 2395 children) among those with non-severe pneumonia. The prevalence was much higher in studies conducted in emergency and inpatient settings than in studies conducted in outpatient settings. In 2019, we estimated that over 7 million children (95% CI 5C8 million) were admitted to hospital with hypoxaemic pneumonia. The studies included in this systematic review had high (2) (ie, 017), indicating a high level of heterogeneity between studies, and a high I(2) value (ie, 996%), indicating that the heterogeneity was not due to chance. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019126207. INTERPRETATION: The high prevalence of hypoxaemia among children with severe pneumonia, particularly among children who have been admitted to hospital, emphasises the importance of overall oxygen security within the health systems of low-income and middle-income countries, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even among children with non-severe pneumonia that is managed in outpatient and community settings, the high prevalence emphasises the importance of rapid identification of hypoxaemia at the first point of contact and referral for appropriate oxygen therapy.

A 1:2 propensity matching was performed based on respiratory ECMO survival prediction (RESP) score, age, gender, bilirubin, and creatinine levels. Patients characteristics, laboratory parameters, adverse events, and 90-day survival were analyzed. Patients characteristics in COVID and NCOVID groups were similar. Before ECMO initiation, fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in the COVID group (median: 493 vs. 364 mg/dL, p &lt;0.001). Median ECMO support duration was similar (16 vs. 13 days, p = 0.714, respectively). During ECMO therapy, patients in the COVID group developed significantly more thromboembolic events (TEE) than did those in the NCOVID group (42% vs. 12%, p = 0.031), which were mainly pulmonary artery embolism (PAE) (26% vs. 0%, p = 0.008).

Methods: Chinese guidelines relevant to COVID-19 were systematically searched via the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, YiMaiTong database, and World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database on March 20th, 2020. Guideline information was extracted, including date of publication, source, objectives and the target population. Guidelines specific to the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 were further investigated to identify the types of antivirus drugs recommended and to report on how treatment recommendations for COVID-19 have evolved overtime. Results: A total of 114 guidelines were identified, of which 87 were national guidelines and 27 were regional guidelines. The scope of included guidelines consisted of: the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, the management of hospital departments and specific diseases during the outbreak of COVID-19. Sixty-four of the included guidelines targeted all COVID-19 patients, while the remaining guidelines concentrated on special patient populations (i.e., geriatric population, pediatric population, and pregnant population) or patients with coexisting diseases. Twenty-three guidelines focused on the pharmacological treatments for all COVID-19 patients. Interferon, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Ribavirin, Chloroquine, and Umifenovir represented the most recommended antivirus drugs. With the emergence of encouraging results from preclinical and preliminary clinical studies, Chloroquine Phosphate was recommended in the national Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th version) on February 19th, 2020. Thereafter, more detailed guidelines regarding the adjustment of dosage regimens and the monitoring of adverse events of Chloroquine Phosphate were published. To date, 8 Chinese guidelines have recommended Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxychloroquine as mainstream antivirus drug for the treatment of COVID-19.

Most ARDS patients improve their systemic oxygenation, as assessed by the ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen fraction, with conventional intensive care and the application of moderate-to-high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. However, in some patients hypoxemia persisted because the lungs are markedly injured, remaining unresponsive to increasing the inspiratory fraction of oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure. For decades, mechanical ventilation was the only standard support technique to provide acceptable oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. Mechanical ventilation provides time for the specific therapy to reverse the disease-causing lung injury and for the recovery of the respiratory function. The adverse effects of mechanical ventilation are direct consequences of the changes in pulmonary airway pressures and intrathoracic volume changes induced by the repetitive mechanical cycles in a diseased lung. In this article, we review 14 major successful and unsuccessful randomized controlled trials conducted in patients with ARDS on a series of techniques to improve oxygenation and ventilation published since 2010. Those trials tested the effects of adjunctive therapies (neuromuscular blocking agents, prone positioning), methods for selecting the optimum positive end-expiratory pressure (after recruitment maneuvers, or guided by esophageal pressure), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, extracorporeal oxygenation, and pharmacologic immune modulators of the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses in patients affected by ARDS.

To ensure the continuity of hospital care for patients with cardiovascular diseases, the clinic has formulated the strategy for prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital environment. The purpose of this paper is to present the strategy for the prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare facility, using Antigen Rapid Diagnostic Tests (Ag-RDTs). Methods: A description of the work from the hospital committee for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is presented. The hospital has adopted the zero-case strategy. Each positive Ag-RDTs test was sent for confirmation by real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Results: During the observed period, 6569 tests were performed at the Magdalena Clinic. Of these, a total of 6100 Ag-RDTs were performed, while 469 were recorded by RT-PCR test. Of these tests, a total of 181 tests showed a positive result, which is a share of 2.75% of all tests performed, of which 144 (2.19%) positive findings were detected among staff. In Ag-RDTs alone, a total of 86 positive people were detected, which is 1.41% of those tested on this type of test. Conclusion: The use of antigen rapid diagnostic tests is an effective and reliable method for the early detection of asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting. This strategy can significantly contribute to the insurance of uninterrupted healthcare, providing regular workflow processes, and the care of patients in the safest possible way. ? 2022.

AREAS COVERED: Various complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified, the most lethal being the acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused most likely by the presence of severe immune cell response and the concomitant alveolus inflammation. The new treatment strategies are updated, and the analysis of the physiopathology is included in this review. EXPERT OPINION: ARDS is one of the most frequent complications in patients with COVID-19. Information regarding the etiology and physiopathology are still unfolding and for the prevention and amelioration, good clinical management, adequate ventilatory support and the use of systemic corticoids seem to be the most efficient way to reduce mortality and to reduce hospital lengths.","output":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a practical comprehensive literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevention of disease transmission is an effective cost-strategy in controlling COVID-19. The scenario of the control of COVID-19 in Samarinda City consists of 3 phases namely initial advanced and recovery. The outcome of the advanced phase is flattening the transmission curve of the COVID-19 pandemic with an increased proportion of patients in recovery and an increased culture of preventing disease transmission in society. This study aimed at knowing the influence of the understanding of COVID-19 infographics on the efforts to prevent COVID-19 transmission at the advanced phase. A survey was conducted via social media from April 21st to April 30th, 2020. The preventive actions for the disease transmission as the dependent variable in this study were social distancing wearing a mask washing hands and efforts to enhance the bodys immunity while the independent variable was the understanding of COVID-19 infographics updated daily. The results of the study showed that the proportion of the population who understood the infographics well was 79.5% the community participation in practicing social distancing (81.6%) wearing a mask (50.9%) washing hands as frequently as possible (74.3%) and the efforts to strengthen the bodys immune system (73.6%) with a consistency level of 55.12%. The lowest rate for the activity of social distancing was visiting elders or the people suffering from comorbidities with 54.71%. A good understanding of infographics could increase adherence to the recommendations of social distancing. The implementation of social distancing wearing a mask washing hands as frequently as possible and the efforts to improve the bodys immune system need to be done consistently to prevent the COVID-19 transmission and as a result the potential transmission could be minimized to optimize the recovery phase and anticipate the possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Relationship between understanding of COVID-19s infographics and the efforts to prevent COVID-19 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate knowledge levels concerning COVID-19 in elderly patients with T2DM.

In 2009, a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified, and pregnant women also were found to be at greater risk for influenza-related complications from this new virus. As a result, during the 2009--10 influenza season, two separate influenza vaccines were recommended to pregnant women: inactivated trivalent 2009--10 seasonal vaccine and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. To estimate influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women during the 2009--10 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from 10 states from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that vaccination coverage for pregnant women among the 10 states combined was 50.7% for seasonal influenza and 46.6% for 2009 H1N1. In addition, women to whom vaccination was offered or recommended by their health-care provider were significantly more likely to report being vaccinated against seasonal influenza (relative risk [RR] = 3.3) and 2009 H1N1 (RR = 10.1). These results indicate substantially higher influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women than has been reported for previous influenza seasons and support previous findings that receipt of influenza vaccination can be influenced greatly by health-care providers offering or recommending influenza vaccination.","output":"Seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women--10 states, 2009-10 influenza season."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a low cost, high impact intervention that ameliorates the disability associated with chronic respiratory diseases (CRD). PR is becoming increasingly recognized in low resource settings where the burden of CRD is rapidly increasing. To aid the implementation of PR in Uganda, we conducted a study to assess the attitudes and opinions towards PR among patients with CRD in Uganda and explore barriers faced by health care workers (HCWs) in referring to PR. METHODS: A cross-sectional study comprising two survey populations: people living with CRD and HCWs regarded as potential PR referrers and PR deliverers. This exploratory study sought initial opinions and thoughts regarding PR, as well as baseline knowledge and potential barriers faced in the referral process. RESULTS: Overall, 30 HCWs (53% female, 43% doctors) and 51 adults with CRD (63% female) participated in the survey. Among those with CRD, the majority reported breathlessness as a major problem (86%) and breathlessness affected their ability to do paid and unpaid work (70%). Interest in PR was high amongst adults with CRD (92%) with preference for a hospital-based programme (67%) as opposed to community-based (16%) or home-based (17%). All HCWs considered PR important in lung disease management, but 77% do not refer patients due to a lack of information about PR. HCWs free-text responses identified the need for training in PR, patient education and streamlining the referral process as key elements to develop successful PR referral services. CONCLUSION: To successfully set up a PR service for people with CRD in Uganda, there is a great need for appropriately tailored training and education of prospective referrers about CRD and PR programs. Educating patients about the benefits of PR as well as streamlining the referral process is critical in expanding PR services across Uganda to fulfill this unmet need.","output":"Identifying Appropriate Delivery of and Referral to Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Uganda: A Survey Study of People Living with Chronic Respiratory Disease and Health Care Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommends, if HCC surveillance is offered, 6 monthly ultrasound- scan with serum AFP.1 We aim to evaluate our screening practice in liver cirrhosis patients and compare it with the BSG guidelines. Methodology Retrospectively, all patients with liver disease who admitted to gastroenterology ward between January 2020 and Jun 2020 at Royal Lancaster Infirmary were assessed. Stages of liver cirrhosis were taken into consideration with the presence of decompensated liver disease signs and the underlying cause of liver cirrhosis.2 Data collected from Electronic- Patients Record included any blood test, ultrasound, and endoscopy report. We analysed the data by using One-Way ANOVA on SPSS. Results Total number of hepatology admissions during the study period was 183 patients with 65% (n=119) known to have liver cirrhosis. 74% were male (n=137) of total admissions and only forty-six female patients. Among individuals with liver cirrhosis, twenty-seven patients had Child-Pugh (A) liver cirrhosis with Fifty and forty-two had Child-Pugh (B) and (C) respectively. Admission with decompensated Alcoholic liver Cirrhosis was higher in male patients 69% (n=47) compare to female patients of only 30% (n=21) (p= 0.001). None of the patients had autoimmune or metabolic liver disease as main cause of cirrhosis (p= 0.0001). Oesophageal varices were diagnosed in thirty-one patients (26%) predominantly males (n=22). HCC surveillance with Ultrasound occurred in 85% (n=102) whereas only 73 patients (61.3%) had AFP checked. The ANOVA results suggest the HCC surveillance differs significantly between different stages of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A, B and C) (F3,359 = 6.11, p= 0.003). Male patients had more robust HCC surveillance (M=37.61, SD=23.46, n=13) in comparison to Female patients with liver cirrhosis (M=13.38, SD = 8.60, n = 13). This was statistically significant, t (24) = 2.06, (p= 0.0009). Conclusion More than two third of Hepatology admissions have liver cirrhosis, however, the study period was during the first COVID-19 wave, yet the adherence to the BSG in HCC surveillance guidelines was achieved in 85% and 61.3% with USS and AFP respectively.

Many of these measures caused a sudden rupture in peoples daily routines, thereby eliciting considerable uncertainty and potentially also hampering the satisfaction of individuals psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Drawing upon Maslows Hierarchical Need Theory and Self-Determination Theory, this study examined the unique role of felt insecurity and the psychological needs, as well as their dynamic interplay, in the prediction of mental health. A large and heterogeneous sample of adults (N = 5118; Mage = 43.45 years) was collected during the first ten days of the lockdown period in Flanders, Belgium. A subsample (N = 835, Mage = 41.39) participated during a second wave one week later. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that felt insecurity, need satisfaction and need frustration all independently predicted various positive (life satisfaction, sleep quality) and negative indicators depressive symptoms, anxiety) of mental health, with little systematic evidence for interactions between the predictors. The pattern of findings obtained concurrently largely held in the longitudinal analyses. Finally, results showed that associations between felt insecurity and lower concurrent and prospective mental health were partially mediated by need satisfaction and frustration, with especially psychological need frustration predicting changes in mental health over time. Overall, the findings suggest that satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness is not just a luxury good. Satisfaction of these needs is important also in times of insecurity, while need frustration represents a risk factor for maladjustment during such times.","output":"Do Psychological Needs Play a Role in Times of Uncertainty?

As such, vaccination is considered an essential intervention that could greatly reduce the incidence and spread of this deadly infectious disease. However, the willingness of college students to receive the COVID-19 vaccine varies significantly. Therefore, a study on the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in college students that explores the attitudes, knowledge, willingness, and key factors influencing vaccination acceptance is of great significance to improve vaccine coverage and control the pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on students from three universities in China. Descriptive statistics, independent sample t tests/one-way ANOVA (normal distribution), Mann-Whitney U tests/Kruskal-Wallis H tests (skewness distribution) and multivariate linear regression were performed. As a result, a total of 3,256 students participated in the survey. Students' willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was high (86%), and they had good knowledge of the vaccine (77.9%). However, they had a low-risk perception of COVID-19 and less positive attitudes toward vaccination (69.8%). The main influencing factors were sex, age, specialty, grades, living environment, spending level, traveling to risk areas, and family members' vaccination experiences. We believed that to increase vaccination coverage among college students, more attention should be paid for students majoring in Science and Engineering, male students, those in the lower age group, students with low or very high economic levels, living in remote or rural areas, and family members having not received the COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines among college students: a study of the attitudes, knowledge, and willingness of students to vaccinate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, leads to a respiratory syndrome and other manifestations. Most affected people show no or mild symptoms, but the risk of severe disease and death increases in older people. Here, we report a narrative review on selected studies targeting aging-related chronic neuroinflammation in the COVID-19 pandemic. A hyperactivation of the innate immune system with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs during severe COVID-19, pointing to an important role of the innate immune dysregulation in the disease outcome. Aging is characterized by a general condition of low-grade inflammation, also connected to chronic inflammation of the brain (neuroinflammation), which is involved in frailty syndrome and contributes to several age-associated diseases, including neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Since neuroinflammation can be induced or worsened by the virus infection itself, as well as by stressful conditions like those linked to the recent pandemic, the role of neuroinflammatory mechanisms could be central in a vicious circle leading to an increase in the mortality risk in aged COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, triggered neuroinflammatory pathways and consequent neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions might be potential long-term complications of COVID-19. In order to provide insights to help clinicians in identifying patients who progress to a more severe case of the disease, this review underlines the potential implications of aging-related neuroinflammation in COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Implication of Aging Related Chronic Neuroinflammation on COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced lockdowns and declarations of states of emergency, resulting in marked changes to daily life such as dietary habits in many countries. Though serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids levels have been shown to be useful markers for recurrent vascular events or worse prognosis in cardiovascular diseases and ischemic stroke, the relationship between serum omega-3 PUFA levels and the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage has essentially been unknown. We explored the association of serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with intracerebral hemorrhage during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants comprised patients admitted to Juntendo University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) with intracerebral hemorrhage between January 1, 2016 and April 30, 2020. Clinical characteristics including serum omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were compared between patients developing intracerebral hemorrhage during the period from January 1, 2016 to February 29, 2020, and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic period (March 1 to April 30, 2020). Clinical characteristics independently related to intracerebral hemorrhage during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed by comparing these two cohorts of intracerebral hemorrhage patients in different periods. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (age, 67.0  13.9 years; 67 males) with intracerebral hemorrhage were enrolled. Intracerebral hemorrhage developed in 91 patients before and 12 patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Monthly averages of intracerebral hemorrhage patients admitted to our hospital during and before the COVID-19 pandemic were 6 and 1.82, respectively. Serum eicosapentaenoic acid levels were significantly lower in intracerebral hemorrhage patients during the COVID-19 pandemic than before (31.87  12.93 g/ml vs. 63.74  43.29 g/ml, p = 0.007). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that, compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, dyslipidemia (odds ratio 0.163, 95% confidence interval 0.031C0.852; p = 0.032) and eicosapentaenoic acid levels (odds ratio 0.947, 95% confidence interval 0.901C0.994; p = 0.029) were associated with intracerebral hemorrhage during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To evade activation of the host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, coronaviruses employ Nsp15, which is uridine-specific endoribonuclease. Nsp15 is proposed to associate with the coronavirus replication-transcription complex within double-membrane vesicles to cleave these dsRNA intermediates. How Nsp15 recognizes and processes dsRNA is poorly understood because previous structural studies of Nsp15 have been limited to small single-stranded (ss) RNA substrates. Here we present cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 bound to a 52nt dsRNA. We observed that the Nsp15 hexamer forms a platform for engaging dsRNA across multiple protomers. The structures, along with site-directed mutagenesis and RNA cleavage assays revealed critical insight into dsRNA recognition and processing. To process dsRNA Nsp15 utilizes a base-flipping mechanism to properly orient the uridine within the active site for cleavage.

The most common complaints include dyspnea, fatigue, brain fog, and chest pain. There is currently no single agreed-upon definition for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, but most agree that criterion for this syndrome is the persistence of mental and physical health consequences after initial infection. Given the millions of acute infections in the U.S. over the course of the pandemic, perioperative providers will encounter these patients in clinical practice in growing numbers. Symptoms of the COVID-19 long-haulers should not be minimized as these patients are at higher risk for postoperative respiratory complications and perioperative mortality for up to 7 weeks after initial illness. Instead, a cautious multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation should be performed. Perioperative care should be viewed through the prism of best practices already in use such as avoidance of benzodiazepines in patients with cognitive impairment and use of lung protective ventilation. Recommendations especially relevant to the COVID-19 long-haulers include assessment of critical care myopathies and neuropathies to determine suitable neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal, preoperative workup of insidious cardiac or pulmonary pathologies in previously healthy patients, and thorough medication review, particularly of anticoagulation regimens and chronic steroid use.

Methods: This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6-2143 children infected with SARS-CoV-2, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. Results: The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18-45% were infants <1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5-20 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40-100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections.

A vaccine is greatly needed to prevent this disease. The purpose of this study was to use an immmunosense approach to develop a foundation for development of vaccines to protect humans with the HLA-A03 supertype. Three peptides had been identified with high binding scores for HLA-A03 supertypes using bioinformatic algorhythms, high measured binding affinity for HLA-A03 supertype molecules, and ability to elicit IFN- production by human HLA-A03 supertype peripheral blood CD8(+ )T cells from seropositive but not seronegative persons. RESULTS: Herein, when these peptides were administered with the universal CD4(+)T cell epitope PADRE (AKFVAAWTLKAAA) and formulated as lipopeptides, or administered with GLA-SE either alone, or with Pam(2)Cys added, we found we successfully created preparations that induced IFN- and reduced parasite burden in HLA-A*1101(an HLA-A03 supertype allele) transgenic mice. GLA-SE is a novel emulsified synthetic TLR4 ligand that is known to facilitate development of T Helper 1 cell (TH1) responses. Then, so our peptides would include those expressed in tachyzoites, bradyzoites and sporozoites from both Type I and II parasites, we used our approaches which had identified the initial peptides. We identified additional peptides using bioinformatics, binding affinity assays, and study of responses of HLA-A03 human cells. Lastly, we found that immunization of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice with all the pooled peptides administered with PADRE, GLA-SE, and Pam(2)Cys is an effective way to elicit IFN- producing CD8(+ )splenic T cells and protection. Immunizations included the following peptides together: KSFKDILPK (SAG1(224-232)); AMLTAFFLR (GRA6(164-172)); RSFKDLLKK (GRA7(134-142)); STFWPCLLR (SAG2C(13-21)); SSAYVFSVK((SPA250-258)); and AVVSLLRLLK(SPA(89-98)). This immunization elicited robust protection, measured as reduced parasite burden using a luciferase transfected parasite, luciferin, this novel, HLA transgenic mouse model, and imaging with a Xenogen camera. CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasma gondii peptides elicit HLA-A03 restricted, IFN- producing, CD8(+ )T cells in humans and mice. These peptides administered with adjuvants reduce parasite burden in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice. This work provides a foundation for immunosense based vaccines. It also defines novel adjuvants for newly identified peptides for vaccines to prevent toxoplasmosis in those with HLA-A03 supertype alleles.","output":"Human immunome, bioinformatic analyses using HLA supermotifs and the parasite genome, binding assays, studies of human T cell responses, and immunization of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice including novel adjuvants provide a foundation for HLA-A03 restricted CD8(+)T cell epitope based, adjuvanted vaccine protective against Toxoplasma gondii"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The World Health organization received reports of 478 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H5N1) from 15 countries between November 2003 and February 2010. More than 50% of these cases involved patients <20 years of age. Determining an association between the clinical factors at the time of hospital admission and prognosis may be useful for timely and adequate consultation and treatment. It has been difficult to obtain these clinical factors adjusted with other confounding factors, such as age and sex, as published studies of H5N1 virus infection usually reported only a few cases. So, we performed a pooled analysis of the reported cases. METHODS: Five case reports (36 patients <18 years of age) of H5N1 infection from four countries published between 2004 and 2009 were assessed based on available individual clinical data. Using the pooled data for all patients, we investigated the associations between patients prognosis and available laboratory findings, such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT) counts, and serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by adjusting for age and/or sex. RESULTS: The linear regression analysis revealed that mortality was negatively associated with WBC and PLT counts adjusted with age and sex. Increased log AST tended to be associated with a poor prognosis (p = 0.054), but there was no significant association between survival and log ALT level. CONCLUSIONS: Both decreased WBC and PLT counts can be considered to be common predictors of poor prognosis in H5N1 influenza patients <18 years of age.

Conventional air-purifying respirators (APR) and modern loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirator-hoods (PAPR-hood) may have a different impact during pediatric resuscitation and therefore require evaluation. OBJECTIVE This study investigated the influence of APRs and PAPR-hoods during simulated pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS Study design was a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Sixteen paramedics carried out a standardized EPLS scenario inside an ambulance, either unprotected (control) or wearing a conventional APR or a PAPR-hood. Treatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared. RESULTS All paramedics completed the treatment objectives of the study arms without adverse events. Study subjects reported that communication, dexterity and mobility were significantly better in the APR group, whereas the heat-build-up was significantly less in the PAPR-hood group. Treatment times compared to the control group did not significantly differ for the APR group but did with the PAPR-hood group (26112 seconds for the controls, 2759 seconds for the conventional APR and 28613 seconds for the PAPR-hood group, P < .05.

However, little guidance is available to inform these activities, and many health departments rely on deterministic algorithms that may miss many true matches. In the context of public health action, these missed matches lead to missed opportunities to deliver interventions and may exacerbate existing health inequities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the performance of record linkage algorithms commonly used in public health practice. METHODS: We compared five deterministic (exact, Stenger, Ocampo 1, Ocampo 2, and Bosh) and two probabilistic record linkage algorithms (fastLink and beta record linkage [BRL]) using simulations and a real-world scenario. We simulated pairs of datasets with varying numbers of errors per record and the number of matching records between the two datasets (ie, overlap). We matched the datasets using each algorithm and calculated their recall (ie, sensitivity, the proportion of true matches identified by the algorithm) and precision (ie, positive predictive value, the proportion of matches identified by the algorithm that were true matches). We estimated the average computation time by performing a match with each algorithm 20 times while varying the size of the datasets being matched. In a real-world scenario, HIV and sexually transmitted disease surveillance data from King County, Washington, were matched to identify people living with HIV who had a syphilis diagnosis in 2017. We calculated the recall and precision of each algorithm compared with a composite standard based on the agreement in matching decisions across all the algorithms and manual review. RESULTS: In simulations, BRL and fastLink maintained a high recall at nearly all data quality levels, while being comparable with deterministic algorithms in terms of precision. Deterministic algorithms typically failed to identify matches in scenarios with low data quality. All the deterministic algorithms had a shorter average computation time than the probabilistic algorithms. BRL had the slowest overall computation time (14 min when both datasets contained 2000 records). In the real-world scenario, BRL had the lowest trade-off between recall (309/309, 100.0%) and precision (309/312, 99.0%).

METHODS: Here, we assessed the association between white blood cell profile (lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes and total white blood cells) as markers of chronic inflammation, habitual diet and gut microbiome composition (determined by sequencing of the 16S RNA) in 986 healthy individuals from the PREDICT-1 nutritional intervention study. We then investigated whether the gut microbiome mediates part of the benefits of vegetable intake on lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: Higher levels of white blood cells, lymphocytes and basophils were all significantly correlated with lower habitual intake of vegetables, with vegetable intake explaining between 3.59 and 6.58% of variation in white blood cells after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing using false discovery rate (q < 0.1). No such association was seen with fruit intake. A mediation analysis found that 20.00% of the effect of vegetable intake on lymphocyte counts was mediated by one bacterial genus, Collinsella, known to increase with the intake of processed foods and previously associated with fatty liver disease. We further correlated white blood cells to other inflammatory markers including IL6 and GlycA, fasting and post-prandial glucose levels and found a significant relationship between inflammation and diet. CONCLUSION: A habitual diet high in vegetables, but not fruits, is linked to a lower inflammatory profile for white blood cells, and a fifth of the effect is mediated by the genus Collinsella.

INVESTIGATIONS: During the further examination and unclothing, mild dyspnea was apparent. According to the patient, the dyspnea was also progressive in the last days but would not affect everyday life. Furthermore, the patient reported a significant and unintended weight loss. Outpatient chest X-ray revealed bilateral, peripheral, fine-speckled infiltrates that became increasingly confluent. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 (wild type). TREATMENT AND COURSE: Due to progressive dyspnea, the patient was referred to inpatient treatment within the day, where he rapidly developed severe acute respiratory failure. To provide respiratory support, a combined intermittent non-invasive ventilation and nasal high flow-therapy was started. Moreover, a probatory antiviral therapy with remdesivir was initiated.

Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention. Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described. Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 causing pneumonia-associated respiratory disorder (COVID-19): diagnostic and proposed therapeutic options."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims Comprehensive and timely data collection during a pandemic is crucial in developing guidelines and policy as well as evaluating their effectiveness. In turn, this will improve planning for future incidents. While this is being undertaken at a national level by Public Health England, more specific information as it relates to psychiatric care is important in understanding the neuropsychiatric, psychological and social effects of the pandemic. The management of patients with COVID-19 presents a unique challenge in inpatient psychiatry settings both in terms of diagnosis and treatment. This is perhaps greater still in forensic settings due to the increased risk of violence and aggression. This audit aimed to firstly assess the consistency of local practice to national guidance from Public Health England. Secondly, it aimed to describe the clinical management of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in this high security forensic hospital and how readily broad, national guidance can be implemented in this unique setting. We present an audit with three cycles, one from each wave of COVID-19 in England during 2020. Method This was a retrospective audit in a high secure forensic psychiatry hospital in the United Kingdom, into the investigation and management of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 compared to national guidelines from Public Health England. It includes three cycles, one undertaken in each national wave of COVID-19 in England in 2020. Result Ten patients have been included in cycle 1, 12 in cycle 2 and 21 in cycle 3 as those where COVID-19 was a considered diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in one patient in cycle 1 and 12 patients in cycle 3. All patients recovered, most of whom remained on-site with supportive care in self-isolation on a dedicated ward for positive cases. Three patients required additional treated with oral antibiotics and dexamethasone, one of whom required admission to the local general medical hospital for continuous supplemental oxygen. Conclusion This is the first study to describe the management of the novel COVID-19 pandemic in a high security forensic psychiatry hospital and how readily national guidance can be implemented in this unique setting. Hospital practice at identifying suspected cases and the management of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was shown to be consistent with national guidance. It also allowed for clinicians to exercise their judgement about testing for atypical cases and for repeat testing where appropriate.","output":"An audit into the management of COVID-19 in a high security psychiatric hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neural networks have shown strong potential to aid the practice of healthcare. Mainly due to the need for large datasets, these applications have focused on common medical conditions, where much more data is typically available. Leveraging publicly available data, we trained a neural network classifier on images of rare genetic conditions with skin findings. We used approximately 100 images per condition to classify 6 different genetic conditions. Unlike other work related to these types of images, we analyzed both preprocessed images that were cropped to show only the skin lesions, as well as more complex images showing features such as the entire body segment, patient, and/or the background. The classifier construction process included attribution methods to visualize which pixels were most important for computer-based classification. Our classifier was significantly more accurate than pediatricians or medical geneticists for both types of images. Next, we trained two generative adversarial networks to generate new images. The first involved all of the genetic conditions and was used for style-mixing to demonstrate how the diversity of small datasets can be increased. The second focused on different disease stages for one condition and depicted how morphing can illustrate the disease progression of this condition. Overall, our findings show how computational techniques can be applied in multiple ways to small datasets to enhance the study of rare genetic diseases.","output":"Proof-of-principle neural network models for classification, attribution, creation, style-mixing, and morphing of image data for genetic conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work relates to the implementation of core parallel architecture in a deep learning algorithm.

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with satisfactory results.

The analysis uses a systematic literature review. The potential of medical waste during the COVID-19 epidemic is infectious waste (PPE wastes) , sharps waste (syringes), chemical waste (expired medicines) and pharmaceutical waste (the used alcohol bottles when rapid tests). The hazardous waste management system refers to Government Regulation No. 101 year 2014 about Management of Hazardous and Toxic Waste and and Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry of Republic Indonesia No. P.56/MenlhkSetjen/2015 about Procedures and Technical Requirements for Waste Management Hazardous and Toxic From the Health Service Facilities.

Therefore, patient stratification is critical for this therapy, which could benefit from a whole-body, non-invasive, and quantitative evaluation of TIGIT expression in cancers. In this study, a (68)Ga-labeled D-peptide antagonist, (68)Ga-GP12, was developed and validated for PET imaging of TIGIT expression in vitro, in vivo, and in an exploratory human study. METHODS: The D-enantiomer peptide antagonists were modified and radiolabeled with (68)Ga. In vitro binding assays were performed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to assess their affinity and specificity. The imaging capacity, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and radiation dosimetry were investigated. Flow cytometry, autoradiography, and immunohistochemical staining were used to confirm the expression of TIGIT. The safety and potential of (68)Ga-GP12 for PET/CT imaging of TIGIT expression were evaluated in NSCLC patients. RESULTS: (68)Ga-labeled D-peptides were conveniently produced with high radiochemical yields, radiochemical purities and molar activities. In vitro binding assays demonstrated (68)Ga-GP12 has high affinity and specificity for TIGIT with a K(D) of 37.28 nM. In vivo and ex vivo studies demonstrated the capacity of (68)Ga-GP12 for PET imaging of TIGIT expression with high tumor uptake of 4.22  0.68 %ID/g and the tumor-to-muscle ratio of 12.94  2.64 at 60 min post-injection. In NSCLC patients, primary and metastatic lesions found in (68)Ga-GP12 PET images were comparable to that in (18)F-FDG PET images. Moreover, tracer uptake in primary and metastatic lesions and intra-tumoral distribution in the large tumor were inhomogenous, indicating the heterogeneity of TIGIT expression. CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-GP12 is a promising radiotracer for PET imaging of TIGIT expression in cancers, indicating its potential as a potential companion diagnostic for anti-TIGIT therapies.

Although the diverse etiologies likely share a common mechanism to generate ocular, trunk, and limb movements, the underlying cause may be a paraneoplastic syndrome, as the first sign of cancer, or may be a postinfectious complication, and thus, the outcome depends on identifying the trigger mechanism. A recent hypothesis suggests increased GABAA receptor sensitivity in the olivary-oculomotor vermis-fastigial nucleus-premotor saccade burst neuron circuit in the brainstem. Therefore, OMAS management will focus on immunosuppression and modulation of GABAA hypersensitivity with benzodiazepines. METHODS We serially video recorded the eye movements at the bedside of 1 patient with SARS-CoV-2-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) serum antibodies, but twice-negative nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We tested cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, and nasopharyngeal samples. After brain MRI and chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans, we treated our patient with clonazepam and high-dose Solu-MEDROL, followed by a rituximab infusion after her formal eye movement analysis 10 days later. RESULTS The recordings throughout her acute illness demonstrated different eye movement abnormalities. While on high-dose steroids and clonazepam, she initially had macrosaccadic oscillations, followed by brief ocular flutter during convergence the next day; after 10 days, she had bursts of opsoclonus during scotopic conditions with fixation block but otherwise normal eye movements. Concern for a suboptimal response to high-dose Solu-MEDROL motivated an infusion of rituximab, which induced remission. An investigation for a paraneoplastic etiology was negative. CSF testing showed elevated neuron-specific enolase. Serum IgG to Serum SARS-CoV2 IgG was elevated with negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal testing. CONCLUSION A recent simulation model of macrosaccadic oscillations and OMAS proposes a combined pathology of brainstem and cerebellar because of increased GABAA receptor sensitivity. In this case report, we report 1 patient with elevated CSF neuronal specific enolase, macrosaccadic oscillations, ocular flutter, and OMAS as a SARS-CoV-2 postinfectious complication. Opsoclonus emerged predominantly with fixation block and suppressed with fixation, providing support to modern theories on the mechanism responsible for these ocular oscillations involving cerebellar-brainstem pathogenesis.","output":"Postinfectious SARS-CoV-2 Opsoclonus-Myoclonus-Ataxia Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose and discuss a model for flagellar mechanics in Euglena gracilis.

METHODS This was an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial in which patients with stage IIIA NSCLC, who were deemed to be surgically resectable, were treated with neoadjuvant paclitaxel (200 mg/m2 once a day) and carboplatin (area under curve 6) plus nivolumab (360 mg) once on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, for three cycles, followed by adjuvant nivolumab monotherapy for 1 year (240 mg once every 2 weeks for 4 months, followed by 480 mg once every 4 weeks for 8 months). The 3-year OS and ctDNA analysis were secondary objectives of the trial.

However, undetectable ctDNA levels after neoadjuvant treatment were significantly associated with progression-free survival and OS (HR: 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.93, and HR: 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.55, respectively). The C-index to predict OS for ctDNA levels after neoadjuvant treatment (0.82) was superior to that of RECIST criteria (0.72).

Neutralizing antibody confers protection against further infection. The present study was done with the objective to measure the antibody level against SARS-CoV2 among laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases and to evaluate whether the presence of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies indicate virus neutralizing capacity. MethodsOne hundred COVID-19 confirmed cases were recruited. Sociodemographic details and history of COVID-19 vaccination, contact with positive COVID-19 cases, and symptoms were ascertained using a self-developed semi-structured interview schedule. Serum samples of the participants were collected within three months from date of the positive report of COVID-19. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies), receptor binding domain antibodies (anti-RBD), and neutralizing antibodies were measured. FindingsAlmost all participants had Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (IgA, IgG and IgM) (99%) and Anti-RBD IgG antibodies (97%). However, only 69% had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV2. Anti-RBD antibody levels were significantly higher among participants having neutralizing antibodies compared to those who didnt.

MATERIAL AND METHODS At the turn of May and June 2020, an online survey was conducted on a representative sample of 3000 Poles (age: Me = 45 years). Working persons accounted for 52% of the respondents, while 38.1% were hired workers. Two standardized (0-100 pts) indices were defined. The level of mental health symptoms index (LMHSI) concerned the incidence of 4 problems within the past 2 months, whereas the change in mental health symptoms index (CMHSI) concerned the degree of mental health deterioration. RESULTS The mean value of LMHSI was 40.91 (SD = 26.97), and that of CMHSI 60.51 (SD = 23.97). In both cases, a worse assessment was obtained among women than among men. In the group of working respondents, the least advantageous results were found among those who worked casually or under a commission contract. Among the non-employed respondents, jobless persons and students were the group at risk. Remote work resulted in the deterioration of mental health in the light of CMHSI; however, a threat of changes in the professional situation affected LMHSI variability to the greatest extent The results of linear regression (R2 = 0.339) suggest that the increase in the CMHSI score (adjusted for LMHSI) is independently influenced by female sex, university education, remote work and a threat of the worsening of employment terms. The analysis of the interaction effect showed a stronger impact of the last factor in the group of women (p = 0.001).

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) entry process into susceptible host tissue cells is complex requiring (1) attachment of the virus via the conserved spike (S) protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) to the host cell angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, (2) S protein proteolytic processing, and (3) membrane fusion. Spike protein processing occurs at two cleavage sites, i.e., S(1)/S(2) and S(2). Cleavage at the S(1)/S(2) and S(2) sites ultimately gives rise to generation of competent fusion elements important in the merging of the host cell and viral membranes. Following cleavage, shedding of the S(1) crown results in significant conformational changes and fusion peptide repositioning for target membrane insertion and fusion. Identification of specific protease involvement has been difficult due to the many cell types used and studied. However, it appears that S protein proteolytic cleavage is dependent on (1) furin and (2) serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 proteases acting in tandem. Although at present not clear, increased SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding motif binding affinity and replication efficiency may in part account for observed differences in infectivity. Cleavage of the ACE2 receptor appears to be yet another layer of complexity in addition to forfeiture and/or alteration of ACE2 function which plays an important role in cardiovascular and immune function.","output":"SARS-CoV-2, Early Entry Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Selection of resilient suppliers has attracted the attention of researchers in the past one decade. The devastating effect of COVID-19 in emerging economies has provided great impetus to the selection of resilient suppliers. Under volatile and uncertain business scenarios, supplier selection is often done under imprecise and incomplete information, making the traditional decision-making methods ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the application of a fuzzy decision-making method for resilient supplier selection. Design/methodology/approach A group of three decision makers was considered for evaluating various alternatives (suppliers) based on their performance under different primary, sustainability and resilience criteria. Experts' opinion about each criterion and alternative was captured in linguistic terms and was modelled using fuzzy numbers. Then, an algorithm for solving resilient supplier selection problem based on the trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TrIFTOPSIS) was introduced and demonstrated through a case study. Findings A closeness coefficient was used to rank the suppliers based on their distances from intuitionistic fuzzy positive-ideal solution and intuitionistic fuzzy negative-ideal solution. Finally, the proposed fuzzy decision making model was applied to a real problem of supplier selection in the clothing industry. Originality/value The presented TrIFTOPSIS model provides an effective route to prioritise and select resilient suppliers under imprecise and incomplete information.

We sought to determine the effectiveness of thermal screening as a key step in diagnosing COVID-19 in a resource-limited setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study based on a review of body temperature and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 test results records for truck drivers entering Uganda through Mutukula between 15th May and 30th July 2020. All records missing information for body temperature, age, gender, and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 status were excluded from the data set. A data set of 7,181 entries was used to compare thermal screening and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay test results using the diagnostic statistical test in STATAv15 software. The prevalence of COVID-19 amongst the truck drivers based on Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay results was determined. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive and negative Likelihood ratios were obtained using Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay as the gold standard. RESULTS: Based on our gold standard test, the proportion of persons that tested positive for COVID-19 was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.1-7.3). Of the 7,181 persons that were thermally screened, 6,844 (95.3%) were male. The sample median age was 38 years (interquartile range, IQR: 31-45 years). The median body temperature was 36.5C (IQR: 36.3-36.7) and only n (1.2%) had a body temperature above 37.5C. The sensitivity and specificity of thermal screening were 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4-13.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 99.3-99.6) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 57.8 (95% CI: 46.5-68.6) and 93.9 (95% CI: 93.3-94.4) respectively. The positive and negative Likelihood Ratios (LRs) were 19 (95% CI: 12.4-29.1) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93) respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study population, the use of Thermal screening alone is ineffective in the detection of potential COVID-19 cases at point of entry.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the potential factors associated with them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A self-designed online questionnaire survey, which consisted of the demographic and selected features, the occupational protection knowledge, attitudes, and practices of COVID-19, and the Chinese version of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, were used to assess the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. The logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the potential factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. RESULTS: A total of 617 pediatric nurses were included in the survey. A considerable proportion of pediatric nurses reported symptoms of depression (95 [15.4%]), anxiety (201 [32.6%]), and stress (111 [18.0%]). Results of multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the good occupational protection practices (for depression: OR = 0.455, 95%CI: 0.281 to 0.739; for anxiety: OR = 0.597, 95%CI: 0.419 to 0.851; for stress: OR = 0.269, 95%CI: 0.166 to 0.438) and the personal protective equipment (PPE) meeting work requirements (for depression: OR = 0.438, 95%CI: 0.246 to 0.778; for anxiety: OR = 0.581, 95%CI: 0.352 to 0.959; for stress: OR = 0.504, 95%CI: 0.283 to 0.898) were independent protective factors against depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Yet, working in an isolation ward or fever clinic was an independent risk factor associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively (for depression: OR = 1.809, 95%CI: 1.103 to 2.966; for anxiety: OR = 1.864, 95%CI: 1.221 to 2.846; for stress: OR = 2.974, 95%CI: 1.866 to 4.741). Having suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the departments (OR = 1.554, 95%CI: 1.053 to 2.294) and coming in contact with the patient's bodily fluids or blood (OR = 1.469, 95%CI: 1.031 to 2.095) were independent risk factors for anxiety, while >3 times of training for COVID-19 related information was an independent protective factor for depression (OR = 0.592, 95%CI: 0.360 to 0.974). Moreover, >10 years of working was an independent risk factor for stress (OR = 1.678, 95%CI: 1.075 to 2.618).

METHOD Two representative Danish populations (2016, n=1656) and (2017, n=3366) were compared to a representative Danish population (n=1538) sampled during the first lockdown in May 2020. Two-tailed tests of proportions were used to investigate possible differences between samples in proportions reporting poorer mental well-being measured by WHO-5, general health, and internal locus of control. RESULTS Younger men (aged 18 24) and younger women (aged 18 - 44) as well as elderly women (aged 65-74) reported lower mental well-being during the early phase of the pandemic compared to the population from 2016.

Methods: We conducted a prospective single-center study (NCT04689490) of previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without dyspnea during mid-term follow-up. An outpatient group was also evaluated. They underwent serial testing with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary lung test, six-minute walking test, serum biomarker analysis, and quality of life questionaries. Results: Patients with dyspnea (n = 41, 58.6%), compared with asymptomatic patients (n = 29, 41.4%), had a higher proportion of females (73.2 vs. 51.7%;p = 0.065) with comparable age and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. There were no significant differences in the transthoracic echocardiogram and pulmonary function test.

In this paper, we propose a new scheme based on a constant wavelet transform (CWT) and a deep network for classifying complex mixture. The scheme first transforms the noisy Raman spectrum to a two-dimensional scale map using CWT. A multi-label deep neural network model (MDNN) is then applied for classifying material. The proposed model accelerates the feature extraction and expands the feature graph using the global averaging pooling layer. The Sigmoid function is implemented in the last layer of the model. The MDNN model was trained, validated and tested with data collected from the samples prepared from substances in palm oil. During training and validating process, data augmentation is applied to overcome the imbalance of data and enrich the diversity of Raman spectra. From the test results, it is found that the MDNN model outperforms previously proposed deep neural network models in terms of Hamming loss, one error, coverage, ranking loss, average precision, F1 macro averaging and F1 micro averaging, respectively. The average detection time obtained from our model is 5.31 s, which is much faster than the detection time of the previously proposed models.","output":"Identification of complex mixtures for Raman spectroscopy using a novel scheme based on a new multi-label deep neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior of N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI)-functionalized graphene composite (ABEI-GC) modified on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode was studied. ABEI-GC exhibited excellent ECL activity. On this basis, a label-free ECL immunosensor was developed for the sensitive detection of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) by using ABEI-GC as the ECL nano-interface via a layer-by-layer assembly technique. ABEI-GC was first assembled onto an ITO electrode. Positively charged chitosan was then electrostatically adsorbed to the modified electrode. Finally, negatively charged antibody-coated gold nanoparticles were attached to the surface to form the ECL immunosensor. In the presence of hIgG, hIgG was captured by its antibody. In addition, an ECL signal was detected in the presence of H(2)O(2) when a double potential was applied. The ECL immunosensor for the determination of hIgG showed a linear range of 1.010(?13)C1.010(?8) g/mL with a detection limit of 5.010(?14) g/mL. This immunosensor has high sensitivity, wide linearity and good reproducibility. The superior sensitivity of the proposed ECL immunoassay mainly derives from the incorporation of ABEI-GC, which not only improves the ECL intensity, response speed, and stability, but also provides a large specific surface for high levels of protein loading. This work reveals that ABEI-GC is good nano-interface for the construction of ECL biosensors.

The number of active cases also continues to increase in most provinces in Indonesia, especially in the Special Region of Yogyakarta. This condition requires health workers to collaborate well in suppressing and handling COVID-19 patients. AIM: The aims of this study were to find out how collaboration occurs between health workers in handling COVID-19. This study identifies opportunities and challenges for Interprofessional Collaboration (IPC) health workers at the Primary Health Center of Bantul Regency. METHODS: The design of this study was a cross-sectional study. We used the purposive sampling method to recruit participants. This study was followed by 200 participants who were health workers at the Primary Health Center in Bantul Regency. We used a questionnaire as the instrument. The questionnaire consists of four dimensions of IPC such as knowledge, collaboration, service, and the role of a pharmacist. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using Chi-square and Spearman. RESULTS: The result showed that IPC health worker at Health Primary Center of Bantul was categorized as good (45%). However, IPC at the Health Primary Center is still not optimal. There were top three obstacles in collaborating, namely, lack of time, perception of complicated bureaucracy, and lack of trust from health workers about their knowledge and skill.Based on spearman test p-value for age, gender, education level, years of service, occupation were 0.764;0,732;0.808;0.189;0.582;0.746. This result showed that the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants did not significantly affect the IPC (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The main key in practicing IPC was building a good work team, good communication and relationship, responsibility for each others, keep learning from each other and being critical, and maintaining the ethics of each profession.

Unfortunately, this model is of limited use if the duration of the epidemic prolongs. This paper uses a slightly modified compartment model, the SEIR(D) model, to analyze the time-varying transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea in multiple stages of its development. This multi-stage estimation of the model parameters offers a better model fit and shows how the COVID-19s transmission dynamics change over time, primarily depending on, the effectiveness of the public health authoritys non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).Method: This paper uses the SEIR(D) compartment model to simulate and estimate the parameters for three distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, using a compiled COVID-19 dataset from Feb. 18, 2020 to Feb. 08, 2021. The paper identifies three distinct stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, conduct multi-stage estimations of model parameters, and carefully infer context-dependent meaning of the estimation results to better understand the unique characteristics of the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 in each stage.Findings: The original SIR compartment model may produce a poor and even misleading result if it is used to cover the entire period of the epidemic, because underlying assumptions behind this model - i.e., homogeneity of the susceptible population and invariant parameters - are easily defied by the real-world complexity. However, if we use a carefully calibrated model in distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, we can find useful insights that we can use to evaluate the effectiveness of the governments non-pharmaceutical interventions over time.","output":"The SEIR(D) Model of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introd uction Understanding how influenza vaccine uptake changed during the 2020/2021 influenza season compared to previous pre-pandemic seasons is a key priority, as is identifying the relationship between prior influenza vaccination and COVID-19 vaccine willingness. METHODS: We analyzed data from a large, nationally representative cohort of Canadian residents aged 50 and older to assess influenza vaccination status three times between 2014 and 2020. We investigated: 1) changes in self-reported influenza vaccine uptake, 2) predictors of influenza vaccine uptake in 2020/2021, and 3) the association between influenza vaccination history and self-reported COVID-19 vaccine willingness using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 23,385 participants analyzed for aims 1-2, influenza vaccination increased over time: 14,114 (60.4%) in 2015-2018, 15,692 (67.1%) in 2019/2020, and 19,186 (82.0%; combining those already vaccinated and those planning to get a vaccine) in 2020/2021. After controlling for socio-demographics, history of influenza vaccination was most strongly associated with influenza vaccination in 2020/2021 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 147.9 [95%CI: 120.9-180.9]); this association remained after accounting for multiple health and pandemic-related factors (aOR 140.3 [95%CI: 114.5-171.8]). To a lesser degree, those more concerned about COVID-19 were also more likely to report influenza vaccination in fall 2020, whereas those reporting a very negative impact of the pandemic were less likely to get vaccinated.

These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities.

MAIN TEXT: We suggested that systematic utilization of traditional medicine, outstanding synergy of research units at all levels and timely information-sharing mechanism should be achieved to establish a comprehensive and efficient R&D system, especially under low-resource settings. In the case of artemisinin discovery, Chinese scientists integrated documented traditional medicine experiences and modern approaches to develop drug candidates timely. Due to limited R&D resources, China adopted a collaborative way, motivating nearly all domestic research units at different levels, to develop antimalarial products. Moreover, the excellent synergy among all units through efficient information-sharing mechanisms greatly avoided work repetition and accelerated the R&D process. CONCLUSION: Traditional medicines inspires drug discoveries in LMICs, while a comprehensive and efficient R&D system could accelerate its R&D process and save investment.

METHODS: An online cross-sectional questionnaire survey comprising of 9 questions was conducted among dental practitioners of Telangana. Age, gender, qualification, type of practice, years of practice, and place of residence were the demographic variables recorded. The response to each question was recorded in a YES or NO format, and mean fear score was calculated to categorize answers into low and high levels of fear. Comparison of mean fear score was done using t-test for 2 variables and analysis of variance for 3 or more than 3 variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the levels of fear with demographic variables was done. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean fear and anxiety score of this study population reported was high 6.57  2.07, with 58.31% of the population presenting with a low level of fear and anxiety.

A comparison of healthy controls and patient samples showed activation of neutrophil degranulation pathways and formation of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) complexes that were activated in a subset of the mild infections and more prevalent in severe infections (containing multiple NET proteins in individual patient samples). As a potential mechanism to suppress NET formation, multiple redox enzymes were elevated in the mild and severe symptom population. Analysis of metabolites from the same cohort showed a 24- and 60-fold elevation in plasma L-cystine, the oxidized form of cysteine, which is a substrate of the powerful antioxidant glutathione, in mild and severe patients, respectively. Unique to patients with mild infections, the carnosine dipeptidase modifying enzyme (CNDP1) was up-regulated. The strong protein and metabolite oxidation signatures suggest multiple compensatory pathways working to suppress oxidation and NET formation in SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Multi-omics Characterization of Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation in Severe and Mild COVID-19 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) cDNA have identified a region of about 184 bases in the 3' non-coding terminus of both the U.S. prototype strain (Beaudette) and a Japanese strain (KB8523), that was not present in an antigenically closely related U.S. strain, Massachusetts (Mass) 41 (Boursnell et al., 1985; Sutou et al., 1988).

Its allocation involves ethical considerations that may be different to usual times. There is limited pre-pandemic literature on the ethical factors that ECMO physicians consider during ECMO allocation. During the pandemic, there has been relatively little professional guidance specifically relating to ethics and ECMO allocation; although there has been active ethical debate about allocation of other critical care resources. We report the results of a small international exploratory survey of ECMO clinicians' views on different patient factors in ECMO decision-making prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then outline current ethical decision procedures and recommendations for rationing life-sustaining treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine the extent to which current guidelines for ECMO allocation (and reported practice) adhere to these ethical guidelines and recommendations. METHODS: An online survey was performed with responses recorded between mid May and mid August 2020. Participants (n = 48) were sourced from the ECMOCard study group-an international group of experts (n = 120) taking part in a prospective international study of ECMO and intensive care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey compared the extent to which certain ethical factors involved in ECMO resource allocation were considered prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS: When initiating ECMO during the pandemic, compared to usual times, participants reported giving more ethical weight to the benefit of ECMO to other patients not yet admitted as opposed to those already receiving ECMO, (p < 0.001). If a full unit were referred a good candidate for ECMO, participants were more likely during the pandemic to consider discontinuing ECMO from a current patient with low chance of survival (53% during pandemic vs. 33% prior p = 0.002). If the clinical team recommends that ECMO should cease, but family do not agree, the majority of participants indicated that they would continue treatment, both in usual circumstances (67%) and during the pandemic (56%). CONCLUSIONS: We found differences during the COVID-19 pandemic in prioritisation of several ethical factors in the context of ECMO allocation. The ethical principles prioritised by survey participants were largely consistent with ECMO allocation guidelines, current ethical decision procedures and recommendations for allocation of life-sustaining treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Ethical factors determining ECMO allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Simulation can be a useful tool for teaching and assessing clinical skills, but can also be costly and faculty-time intensive. It is defined as a technique to create an activity to portray a real experience for purpose of practicing or evaluating. Simulations can use standardized patients (SPs), which can be paid actors (PASPs), staff and faculty, manikins, volunteers, or students from higher level cohorts, also known as advanced class standardized patients (ACSPs). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a multifaceted analysis comparing ACSPs and PASPs, based on student performance in the assessment, student preference of SP type, and SP performance as an actor. METHODS: ACSPs and PASPs were used in a summative prescription counseling role play. For the evaluation, students counseled a SP about a new prescription medication and answered questions about taking an over-the-counter product with the new medication. The interaction was recorded and evaluated by faculty using a previously developed rubric. SP performance was evaluated by faculty using a separate rubric to determine how well the patient role was performed. A pre- and post-evaluation survey was completed by student pharmacists to gather student preferences about SPs and confidence in their counseling skills. Data were evaluated using a paired t-test. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven student pharmacists completed the summative prescription counseling evaluation. Student pharmacists performed well overall with minimal differences between SP types. Students preferred PASPs to role play the patient but felt that the actor type did not affect their performance. CONCLUSIONS: ACSPs performed the role of the SP well for a summative prescription counseling session without impacting student performance compared to PASPs and with reduced cost.

Chinese medicine has a long history in treating plague, and viral disease is the clinical advantage in Chinese medicine. Under the premise that there is currently no specific drug treatment, Chinese medicine has achieved certain effects in the treatment of COVID-19, which has attracted much attention and has been upgraded to a national strategy. Regarding the treatment of COVID-19 with Chinese medicine, it is believed that in terms of the name of Chinese medicine, the modern connotation of &quot;uniform of typhoid and febrile disease&quot; should be re-recognized, and it is advisable to use drugs based on specific clinical prescriptions and indications. In terms of pathogenesis, the COVID-19 has the pathogenesis rules including from the mild to severe conditions, from the surface to the inside, from the excess syndrome to the deficiency syndrome. We should pay attention to the Taiyang syndrome damaged by wet disease in initial stage, Shaoyang syndrome complicated with Yangming syndrome in the middle stage, phlegm-heat obstructing lung in critical period, lung and spleen deficiency in the recovery stage. In terms of clinical treatment strategies, Dayuan Yin is recommended to induce sweat and disperse the stasis in early stage. Xiaochaihu Decoction and Maxing Shigan Decoction is used to relieve both exterior and interior symptoms in middle stage. In critical stage, Tingli Dazao Xiefei Decoction, Weijing Decoction, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, Xiaoxianxiong Decoction, and Sanzi Yangqin Decoction are considered to reduce phlegm and clear heat.

A total of 1353 athletes from non-contact individual sports athletes (NCISA), contact individual sports athletes (CISA) and team sport athletes (TSA) participated; 45.4% of them were females that completed a series of self-rating questionnaires covering sociodemographic information, former and current exercise patterns, exercise dependency and mood states. NCISA had less exercise frequency than CISA, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and NCISA had less exercise frequency than TSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding exercise intensity, CISA had higher scores than NCISA and TSA before the COVID-19 pandemic, and CISA had more exercise intensity than TSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequency and intensity were reduced from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic in the three groups, except for TSA intensity. In addition, positive and negative mood states were correlated with exercise dependency. CISA were more discouraged and vigorous than NCISA and TSA, respectively.

Many bacterial phytopathogens use type III effector (T3E) proteins to interfere with plant defense responses, including this transcriptional reprogramming. Here, we show that XopS, a T3E of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), interacts with and inhibits proteasomal degradation of WRKY40, a transcriptional regulator of defense gene expression. Virus-induced gene silencing of WRKY40 in pepper (Capsicum annuum) enhanced plant tolerance to Xcv infection, indicating that WRKY40 represses immunity. Stabilization of WRKY40 by XopS reduces the expression of its targets, which include salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes and the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling repressor JAZ8. Xcv bacteria lacking XopS display significantly reduced virulence when surface inoculated onto susceptible pepper leaves. XopS delivery by Xcv, as well as ectopic expression of XopS in Arabidopsis thaliana or Nicotiana benthamiana, prevented stomatal closure in response to bacteria and biotic elicitors. Silencing WRKY40 in pepper or N. benthamiana abolished XopS's ability to prevent stomatal closure. This suggests that XopS interferes with both preinvasion and apoplastic defense by manipulating WRKY40 stability and downstream gene expression, eventually altering phytohormone crosstalk to promote pathogen proliferation.","output":"The Xanthomonas type-III effector XopS stabilizes CaWRKY40a to regulate defense responses and stomatal immunity in pepper (Capsicum annuum)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing reports of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patient's warrant clinicians to adopt and define the standardized diagnostic and managing protocols in order to investigate the linkage of neurological symptoms in COVID-19.

Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises health of individuals. Therefore, this pandemic poses a serious emergency worldwide. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting economic and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several recent findings have unexpectedly found that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV), as its been observed with another virus. In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, were discovered more than 10 years ago and interestingly there is a population characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome with the host and other findings linking SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria, support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the celular, molecular, phenotypical and biochemical evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection.

PARTICIPANTS: All adult inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19 (N=164) who were referred to Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) for voice and/or swallowing assessment for 2 months starting in April 2020. INTERVENTIONS: SLT assessment, advice, and therapy for dysphonia and dysphagia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence of delirium, neurologic presentation, intubation, tracheostomy, and proning history were collected, along with type of SLT provided and discharge outcomes. Therapy outcome measures were recorded for swallowing and tracheostomy pre- and post-SLT intervention and Grade Roughness Breathiness Asthenia Strain Scale for voice. RESULTS: Patients (N=164; 104 men) aged 56.816.7 years were included. Half (52.4%) had a tracheostomy, 78.7% had been intubated (mean, 156.6d), 13.4% had new neurologic impairment, and 69.5% were delirious. Individualized compensatory strategies were trialed in all and direct exercises with 11%. Baseline assessments showed marked impairments in dysphagia and voice, but there was significant improvement in all during the study (P<.0001). On average, patients started some oral intake 2 days after initial SLT assessment (interquartile range [IQR], 0-8) and were eating and drinking normally on discharge, but 29.3% (n=29) of those with dysphagia and 56.1% (n=37) of those with dysphonia remained impaired at hospital discharge.

Finally, we make suggestions for future research, such as proactively documenting credibility-related metadata for Natural Language Processing and Language Technology services and establishing an explicit hierarchical taxonomy of usability predictors for automatic credibility assessment.","output":"User Experience Design for Automatic Credibility Assessment of News Content About COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, which causes the current pandemic of respiratory illness, is evolving continuously and generating new variants. Nevertheless, most of the sequence analyses thus far focused on nucleotide substitutions despite the fact that insertions and deletions (indels) are equally important in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we analyzed 1,099,664 high-quality sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to re-construct the evolutionary and epidemiological histories of indels. Our analysis revealed 289 circulating indel types (237 deletion and 52 insertion types, each represented by more than ten genomic sequences), among which eighteen were recurrent indel types, each represented by more than 500 genome sequences. Although indels were identified across the entire genome, most of them were identified in nsp6, S, ORF8, and N genes, among which ORF8 indel types had the highest frequencies of frameshift. Geographical and temporal analyses of these variants revealed a few alterations of dominant indel types, each accompanied by geographic expansion to different countries and continents, which resulted in the fixation of several types of indels in the field, including the current variants of concern. Evolutionary and structural analyses revealed that indels involving S N-terminal domain regions were linked to the 3/4 variants of concern, resulting in significantly altered S protein that might contribute to the selective advantage of the corresponding variant. In sum, our study highlights the important role of insertions and deletions in the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A comprehensive evolutionary and epidemiological characterization of insertion and deletion mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There are few studies on patients with heart failure (HF) hospitalized for COVID-19. Our aim is to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with HF hospitalized for COVID-19 and identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality upon admission. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study in patients with HF hospitalized for COVID-19 in 150 Spanish hospitals (SEMI-COVID-19 Registry). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify admission factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 1,718 patients were analyzed (56.5% men; median age 81.4 years). The overall case fatality rate was 47.6% (n=819). The independent risk factors at admission for in-hospital mortality were: age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.02-1.05; p<.001); severe dependence (AOR: 1.62; 95%CI: 1.19-2.20; p=.002); tachycardia (AOR: 1.01; 95%CI: 1.00-1.01; p=.004); and high C-reactive protein (AOR: 1.004; 95%CI:1.002-1.004; p<.001), LDH (AOR: 1.001; 95%CI: 1.001-1.002; p<.001), and serum creatinine levels (AOR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.18-1.54; p<.001). Conclusions: Patients with HF hospitalized for COVID-19 have a high in-hospital mortality rate.

Exogenous glucocorticoids are structurally and pharmacologically similar to the endogenous hormones. As such, multiple actions of corticosteroids are exhibited, including those of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Epidural injections, with or without steroids, have been extensively used throughout the world. There are reports of epidural injections starting in 1901, with steroids being added to the local anesthetic since 1952, when steroids were administered into the sacral foramen. PURPOSE Due to the extensive side effects of steroids in various injections, some have proposed limiting their use in epidurals and intraarticular injections. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the multiple side effects of the steroids have elevated the level of concern and recommendations have been made to utilize local anesthetic alone or the lowest dose of steroids. Fashioned from common expressions of the day, the term \\"steroid distancing\\" began to be used and proposed for intraarticular injections of the knee. Consequently, we sought to evaluate the evidence and feasibility of steroid distancing in interventional pain management. METHODS This focused review of local anesthetics and steroids utilized in interventional pain management for epidural injections, peripheral nerve blocks, and intraarticular injections by multiple database searches. This is a focused narrative review and not a systematic review. Consequently, evidence synthesis was not performed traditionally, but was based on an overview of the available evidence. RESULTS No significant difference was identified based on whether steroids are added to local anesthetic or not for epidural as well as facet joint injections. However, there was not enough evidence to compare these two groups for peripheral intraarticular injections. LIMITATIONS The present review is limited by the paucity of literature with bupivacaine alone or bupivacaine with steroids local anesthetic alone or with steroids of intraarticular injections of knee, hip, shoulder and other joints, and intraarticular facet joint injections. CONCLUSION This review shows an overall lack of significant difference between lidocaine alone and lidocaine with steroids in epidural injections. However, available evidence is limited for bupivacaine alone or with steroids. Evidence is also not available comparing local anesthetic alone with steroids for facet joint or peripheral joint intraarticular injections. Thus, it is concluded that local anesthetic with lidocaine may be utilized for epidural injections, with appropriate patient selection and steroids reserved for non-responsive patients with local anesthetic and with significant radiculitis.","output":"Steroid Distancing in Interventional Pain Management During COVID-19 and Beyond: Safe, Effective and Practical Approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the content of nursing diagnoses related to urinary incontinence according to NANDA International and others identified in the literature.

METHODS: A survey was conducted through an online survey platform on June 6, 2020. Demographic characteristics, the PHQ-9, the ISI, a COVID-19 questionnaire and a headache profile survey were included in the online questionnaire. RESULTS: Eventually, a total of 15,000 participants from China completed the online questionnaire. Among them, 2806 participants had pre-existing headache disorders. Our analysis showed reductions in the duration of headaches (3.414  6.859 vs 4.033  7.325 h, P<0.001), number of headache days per month (1.788  2.989 vs 2.092  3.694, P<0.001), and headache intensity (4.110  1.609 vs 4.290  1.680, P<0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Smoking (OR = 1.397, 95% CI 1.090 to 1.790, P = 0.008) and getting support from family members during social isolation (OR = 1.656, 95% CI 1.075 to 2.550, P = 0.022) were independent factors affecting the reduction in the duration of headaches.

Patients with IRDs often experience long delays prior to reaching a definitive diagnosis. Children attending a tertiary care paediatric ophthalmology department with phenotypic (i.e., clinical and/or electrophysiologic) evidence suggestive of IRD were contacted for genetic testing during the SARS-CoV-2-19 pandemic using a telegenetics approach. Genetic testing approach was panel-based next generation sequencing (351 genes) via a commercial laboratory (Blueprint Genetics, Helsinki, Finland). Of 70 patient samples from 57 pedigrees undergoing genetic testing, a causative genetic variant(s) was detected for 60 patients (85.7%) from 47 (82.5%) pedigrees. Of the 60 genetically resolved IRD patients, 5% (n = 3) are eligible for approved therapies (RPE65) and 38.3% (n = 23) are eligible for clinical trial-based gene therapies including CEP290 (n = 2), CNGA3 (n = 3), CNGB3 (n = 6), RPGR (n = 5) and RS1 (n = 7).

Most patients now prefer to obtain their doctor's care and check their health status through their mobile phone call, Skype, Facebook Messenger, or other online resources. There is, however, a major concern about the privacy of patients when using online resources. Patients usually choose to keep their information confidential, which should be only accessible to authorized individuals.The most current remote patient monitoring system is organization-centric and patient's privacy and security rely on healthcare providers' mercy. Blockchain technologies have attracted the attention of researchers for designing eHealth applications to provide patients with secure and privacy-preserving health services. Blockchain researchers have recently proposed some models for remote patient monitoring systems. However, most of those researchers have applied public blockchains where health data is available to all participants with the property of data tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a novel remote patient monitoring model using a decentralized private blockchain to protect patient's privacy and increase the system's efficiency. The private blockchain will be implemented on Hyperledger Fabric where a Patient centric Agents (PCA) manage patient's data and coordinate authorization to form a secure channel to transmit data to the private blockchain. A hybrid consensus by combining Proof of Integrity (PoI) and Proof of Validity (PoV) is used to protect data privacy and integrity when retrieving data from a blockchain-based cloud database.

Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are highly susceptible to environmental stress. In the current study, we aimed to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic psychologically affected patients with chronic progressive diseases such as AS and RA and the effects of these psychological factors on disease activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age and sex-matched patients with AS (n = 80), RA (n = 80), and healthy controls (n = 80) were included in the study. All participants were evaluated with the Perceived COVID-19 Threat Form (PCTF), Suicide-Ideation Scale (SIS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), The Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT), and Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB) scales. BASDAI was used in patients with AS, and DAS28 was used in patients with RA to assess disease severity. RESULTS: Compared to healthy individuals, patients with RA and AS had lower PGWB scores and higher HADS depression and anxiety subscale scores. Almost all psychometric assessment test scores were worse in AS patients with high-disease activity compared to those in low-disease activity. PACT scores were higher in patients with moderate RA compared to patients with mild RA (p = 0.006). While a positive correlation was identified between BASDAI and most of the psychometric assessment test scores (r = 0 .36 for PCTF, r = 0.53 for depressive scores, r = 0.54 for anxiety scores, r = 0.57 for suicidal ideation), DAS28 scores were found to be associated only with PACT total and PACT perceived forward-focused subscale scores (r = C.26 and r = .33, respectively). CONCLUSION: Psychologically, AS and RA patients were found to be worse off compared to healthy controls. The perceived COVID threat and psychological status were associated with disease activity in AS, but not RA patients. Patients with chronic illnesses may be more vulnerable to the psychological effects of the pandemic, which can worsen disease activity.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychology and disease activity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac glycosides (CGs), toxins well-known for numerous human and cattle poisoning, are natural compounds, the biosynthesis of which occurs in various plants and animals as a self-protective mechanism to prevent grazing and predation. Interestingly, some insect species can take advantage of the CGs toxicity and by absorbing them, they are also protected from predation. The mechanism of action of CGs toxicity is inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (the sodium-potassium pump, NKA), which disrupts the ionic homeostasis leading to elevated Ca(2+) concentration resulting in cell death. Thus, NKA serves as a molecular target for CGs (although it is not the only one) and even though CGs are toxic for humans and some animals, they can also be used as remedies for various diseases, such as cardiovascular ones, and possibly cancer. Although the anticancer mechanism of CGs has not been fully elucidated, yet, it is thought to be connected with the second role of NKA being a receptor that can induce several cell signaling cascades and even serve as a growth factor and, thus, inhibit cancer cell proliferation at low nontoxic concentrations. These growth inhibitory effects are often observed only in cancer cells, thereby, offering a possibility for CGs to be repositioned for cancer treatment serving not only as chemotherapeutic agents but also as immunogenic cell death triggers. Therefore, here, we report on CGs chemical structures, production optimization, and biological activity with possible use in cancer therapy, as well as, discuss their antiviral potential which was discovered quite recently.

There is, however, indication that death talk among community-dwelling adults is not occurring, and there is a dearth of research examining why this is the case. This study aims to provide the first examination of barriers and facilitators to talking about death and dying among the general population in a UK region (Northern Ireland), and to provide a novel application of health behaviour change theory towards developing a theoretical understanding of the sources of this behaviour. METHODS: The study involved qualitative analysis of responses (n = 381 participants) to two open-ended questions within a cross-sectional online survey, with recruitment via social media of adults currently living in Northern Ireland. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on open text responses per question, with the barriers and facilitators mapped on to health behaviour change models (the Behaviour Change Wheel COM-B and the Theoretical Domains Framework). RESULTS: The findings evidence a myriad of barriers and facilitators to engaging in death talk, with themes aligning to areas such as lack of acceptance of death in social contexts and fear of upsetting self or others, and a need to improve interpersonal communication skills for facilitating conversations and improve knowledge of the existing services around death and dying. A theoretical understanding of the drivers of death talk is presented with findings mapped across most components of the COM-B Behaviour Change Model and the Theoretical Domains Framework.

In humans, these spatial-regulatory connections are largely set during early development, when the cohesin complex plays an essential role in genome organisation and cell division. A full complement of the cohesin complex and its regulators is important for normal development, since heterozygous mutations in genes encoding these components are often sufficient to produce a disease phenotype. The implication that genes encoding the cohesin complex and cohesin regulators must be tightly controlled and resistant to variability in expression has not yet been formally tested. Here, we identify spatial-regulatory connections with potential to regulate expression of cohesin loci, including linking their expression to that of other genes. Connections that centre on the cohesin ring subunits (Mitotic: SMC1A, SMC3, STAG1, STAG2, RAD21/RAD21-AS; Meiotic: SMC1B, STAG3, REC8, RAD21L1), cohesin-ring support genes (NIPBL, MAU2, WAPL, PDS5A and PDS5B), and CTCF provide evidence of coordinated regulation that has little tolerance for perturbation. We identified transcriptional changes across a set of genes co-regulated with the cohesin loci that include biological pathways such as extracellular matrix production and proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Remarkably, many of the genes that are co-regulated with cohesin loci are themselves intolerant to loss-of-function. The results highlight the importance of robust regulation of cohesin genes, indicating novel pathways that may be important in the human cohesinopathy disorders.","output":"Low tolerance for transcriptional variation at cohesin genes is accompanied by functional links to disease-relevant pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Suicide amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an important issue. In Japan, the number of suicides in April 2020 decreased by nearly 20% from that in 2019. To assess the impact of an infectious disease pandemic, excess mortality is often discussed. Our main purpose was evaluating excess mortality from suicide in Japan during the early pandemic period. METHODS: We used data on suicides collected by the National Police Agency of Japan until June 2020. We estimated excess mortality during the early pandemic period (MarchCJune 2020) using a time-series model of the number of suicides before the pandemic. A quasi-Poisson model was employed for the estimation. We evaluated excess mortalities by the categories of age and sex, and by prefecture. RESULTS: No significant excess mortality was observed throughout the early pandemic; instead, a downward trend in the number of suicides for both sexes was noted. For males, negative values of excess mortalities below the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval were observed in April and May. All numbers of females during the period were included in the interval, and the excess mortalities in June were positive and higher than those in April and May. In Tokyo, the number of suicides was below the lower bound throughout the period. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that various changes, such as communication, and social conditions amid the early COVID-19 pandemic induced a decrease in suicides in Japan.

Grown from the roots of civic community theory, civic agriculture functions as a new branch of civic community theory that is ripe for theorization. In revisiting the foundations of the term, this review paper seeks to consolidate current and future research in the field of civic agriculture with a focus on its link to social welfare. This begins by reviewing the foundations of civic community theory and discussing how they influence research related to civic agriculture. As we report in this paper, there remain considerable gaps in understanding of how civic agriculture can be fomented by-or is related to-indicators such as demographics, concentration of power, community cohesion, and civic engagement. Consequently, the assumed links between local food systems and social welfare must continue to be studied to determine correlation and causality. This understanding is particularly important during this time of global pandemic, when the flaws and inequities of global supply chains are exposed and where, in many cases, civic agriculture met the increasing interest in local food.

We estimated Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for observed COVID-19 and COVID-19-related hospitalization, nationwide and stratified by age, immunocompromised status, calendar time, and states with high incidence of the Delta variant. We corrected VE estimates for under-recording of vaccinations in insurance data. Results Among 390,517 vaccinated and 1,524,153 matched unvaccinated individuals, VE was 79% (95% CI, 77% to 80%) for COVID-19 and 81% (79% to 84%) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations.

In this study, nine types of biochar produced from three raw materials, namely fruit tree branch, peanut shell, and cow dung, at three pyrolysis temperatures (300, 450, and 600 C) were used to amend acidified brown soil; the rape growth, physiology character, soil chemical and microbial, along with soil organic carbon mineralization were also investigated. The results showed that application of biochar increased soil pH by 8.48-79.25% and reduced exchangeable acidity, exchangeable Al, and exchangeable H by 56.94-94.95%, 34.38-95.66%, and 58.72-93.27%, respectively. Biochar alleviated oxidative stress in plants, reduced malondialdehyde and glutathione content in leaves, promoted rape growth, and increased microbial community diversity and the relative abundances of Acidobacteria and Olpidiomycota in the acidic soil. Moreover, biochar reduced the mineralization rate of organic carbon and the proportion of mineral-bonded organic carbon. Overall, biochar application is an effective strategy to ameliorate soil acidification and enhance rape production and carbon sequestration. The mitigation effect of branch biochar and cow dung biochar on soil acidification was superior to that of peanut shell biochar. The effects of biochar depended on the pyrolysis temperature; the positive effects of biochar samples pyrolyzed at 450 and 600 a were stronger than those pyrolyzed at 300 a.

There were reports of improvement with breastfeeding outcomes as assessed on validated assessment tools for 88% (7/8) of CF articles (588 patients) and 2 LF articles (78 patients). ZF improved breastfeeding outcomes on subjective maternal reports (1 article with 18 infants) only. One RCT with a high risk of bias concluded greater speech articulation improvements with ZF compared to CF. Only minor adverse events were reported for all frenotomy techniques. CONCLUSIONS Current literature does not demonstrate a clear advantage for one frenotomy technique when managing children with ankyloglossia. Recommendations for future research are provided to overcome the methodological shortcomings in the literature. We conclude that all frenotomy techniques are safe and effective for treating symptomatic ankyloglossia.","output":"Comparison of Frenotomy Techniques for the Treatment of Ankyloglossia in Children: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The societal lockdown imposed in Canada in March 2020 to stem the spread of COVID-19 severed key points of connection for low-income Canadians who rely upon schools, libraries and even fast-food chains for internet connectivity.

METHODS: A secondary analysis of 4385 cases in the Irish Hip Fracture Database from 1st June 2019 to 31st August 2020 was conducted. RESULTS: Hip fracture admissions decreased by 15% during the study period (p < 0.001). Patient characteristics were largely unchanged as the majority of cases occurred in females over 80 years admitted from home. Adherence to many of the Irish Hip Fracture Standards (IHFS) changed following the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in patients admitted to an orthopaedic ward from Emergency Department (ED) within 4 h from 27 to 36% (p < 0.001). However, the proportion of patients reviewed by a geriatrician reduced from 85% pre-COVID to 80% (p < 0.001). Fewer patients received a bone health assessment [90% from 95% (p < 0.001)] and specialist falls assessment [(82% from 88% (p < 0.001)]. No change was seen in time to surgery or incidence of pressure injuries. There was a significant decrease in length of stay from 18 to 14 days (p < 0.001). There was an increase in patients discharged home during the COVID-19 period and a decrease in patients discharged to rehabilitation, convalescence or nursing home care. There was no statistically significant change in mortality. CONCLUSION: Healthcare services were widely restructured during the pandemic, which had implications for hip fracture patients.

In the present work, we put forward the first wastewater surveillance-based city zonation for effective COVID-19 pandemic preparedness. A three-month data of Surveillance of Wastewater for Early Epidemic Prediction (SWEEP) was generated for the world heritage city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. In this expedition, one hundred sixteen wastewater samples were analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, from September 3rd to November 26th, 2020. A total of 111 samples were detected with at least two out of three SARS-CoV-2 genes (N, ORF 1ab, and S). Monthly variation depicted a significant decline in all three gene copies in October compared to September 2020, followed by a sharp increment in November 2020. Correspondingly, the descending order of average effective gene concentration was: November (~10,729 copies/L) &gt; September (~3047 copies/L) &gt; October (~454 copies/L). Monthly variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples may be ascribed to a decline of 20.48% in the total number of active cases in October 2020 and a rise of 1.82% in November 2020. Also, the monthly recovered new cases were 16.61, 20.03, and 15.58% in September, October, and November 2020, respectively. The percentage change in the gene concentration was observed in the lead of 1C2 weeks with respect to the provisional figures of confirmed cases. SWEEP data-based city zonation was matched with the heat map of the overall COVID-19 infected population in Ahmedabad city, and month-wise effective RNA concentration variations are shown on the map.

The reliability of this tool depends on the validity of key assumptions that include homogeneity of individuals and spatio-temporal homogeneity. Although the SEIR compartmental framework can easily be extended to include demographic (e.g. age) and additional disease (e.g. healthcare workers) classes, dependence of transmission rates on time, and metapopulation structure, fitting such extended models is hampered by both a proliferation of free parameters and insufficient or inappropriate data. This raises the question of how effective a tool the basic SEIR framework may actually be. We go some way here to answering this question in the context of the 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa by comparing fits of an SEIR time-dependent transmission model to both country- and district-level weekly incidence data. Our novel approach in estimating the effective-size-of-the-populations-at-risk ( Neff) and initial number of exposed individuals ( E0) at both district and country levels, as well as the transmission function parameters, including a time-to-halving-the-force-of-infection ( tf/2) parameter, provides new insights into this Ebola outbreak. It reveals that the estimate R0  1.7 from country-level data appears to seriously underestimate R0  3.3 - 4.3 obtained from more spatially homogeneous district-level data. Country-level data also overestimate tf/2  22 weeks, compared with 8-10 weeks from district-level data. Additionally, estimates for the duration of individual infectiousness is around two weeks from spatially inhomogeneous country-level data compared with 2.4-4.5 weeks from spatially more homogeneous district-level data, which estimates are rather high compared with most values reported in the literature.

No relevant evidence was found regarding the use of other social media platforms. Most studies indicated positive findings regarding health professionals' intention to use discussion forums, while the one study that used a collaborative project also indicated positive findings with its perceived ease of use as health professionals felt that it was useful to facilitate chronic disease self-management with patients. Mixed findings were seen in regards to health professionals' perceived ease of use of discussion forums. The most common barrier to using social media platforms was the lack of time in health professionals' schedules.

Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency and severity of STD in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the association with demographic characteristics, hospital admission, symptoms, comorbidities, and blood biomarkers. METHODS: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study on patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (n=846) and controls (n=143) from 15 Spanish hospitals. Data on STD were collected prospectively using an in-person survey. The severity of STD was categorized using a visual analog scale. We analyzed time to onset, recovery rate, time to recovery, hospital admission, pneumonia, comorbidities, smoking, and symptoms. RESULTS: STD was at least 2-fold more common in COVID-19-positive patients than in controls. COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients were older, with a lower frequency of STD, and recovered earlier than outpatients. Analysis stratified by severity of STD showed that more than half of COVID-19 patients presented severe loss of smell (53.7%) or taste (52.2%); both senses were impaired in >90%. In the multivariate analysis, older age (>60 years), being hospitalized, and increased C-reactive protein were associated with a better sense of smell and/or taste. COVID-19-positive patients reported improvement in smell (45.6%) and taste (46.1%) at the time of the survey; in 90.6% this was within 2 weeks of infection.

High capacity serologic assays detecting binding antibodies (bAb) have been developed; nAb assays are not adaptable to high-throughput testing. We sought to determine the effectiveness of using surrogate bAb signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/Co) in predicting nAb titers using a pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay. METHODS: CCP donor serum collected by three US blood collectors was tested with a bAb assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and a nAb RVPN assay. Prediction effectiveness of various CoV2T S/Co criteria was evaluated for RVPN nAb NT50 titers using receiver operating characteristics. RESULTS: Seven hundred and fifty-three CCPs were tested with median CoV2T S/Co and NT50 of 71.2 of 527.5. Proportions of donors with NT50 over target nAb titers were 86% &#8805;1:80, 76% &#8805;1:160, and 62% &#8805;1:320. Increasing CoV2T S/Co criterion reduced the sensitivity to predict NT50 titers, while specificity to identify those below increased. As target NT50 titers increase, the CoV2T assay becomes less accurate as a predictor with a decline in positive predictive value and rise in negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: Selection of a clinically effective nAb titer will impact availability of CCP. Product release with CoV2T assay S/Co criterion must balance the risk of releasing products below target nAb titers with the cost of false negatives. A two-step testing scheme may be optimal, with nAb testing on CoV2T samples with S/Cos below criterion.","output":"Selecting COVID-19 convalescent plasma for neutralizing antibody potency using a high-capacity SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Although a limited percentage of the genome produces proteins, approximately 90% is transcribed, indicating important roles for noncoding RNA (ncRNA). It is now known that these ncRNAs have a multitude of cellular functions ranging from the regulation of gene expression to roles as structural elements in ribonucleoprotein complexes. ncRNA is also represented at nearly every step of viral life cycles. This chapter will focus on ncRNAs of both host and viral origin and their roles in retroviral life cycles. Cellular ncRNA represents a significant portion of material packaged into retroviral virions and includes transfer RNAs, 7SL RNA, U RNA, and vault RNA. Initially thought to be random packaging events, these host RNAs are now proposed to contribute to viral assembly and infectivity. Within the cell, long ncRNA and endogenous retroviruses have been found to regulate aspects of the retroviral life cycle in diverse ways. Additionally, the HIV-1 transactivating response element RNA is thought to impact viral infection beyond the well-characterized role as a transcription activator. RNA interference, thought to be an early version of the innate immune response to viral infection, can still be observed in plants and invertebrates today. The ability of retroviral infection to manipulate the host RNAi pathway is described here.

Several studies have explored the association between age and SARS-CoV-2, showing that there were poorer outcomes in older people. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of age on outcomes such as hospital length of stay, mortality, and re-hospitalisation. METHODS: We performed a single-centre, retrospective observational cohort study, using an electronic microbiology database of recorded index admissions of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients aged 65 years and older during SARS-CoV-2 wave one (March 1(st) to May 31(st) 2020). PCR testing of nasopharyngeal and/or sputum samples was used to confirm positivity. Our clinical outcomes measured included hospital length of stay, mortality and re-admission rate within 6 months. RESULTS: 153 patients 65 years and above were admitted. The male to female ratio was 1.3 with 90% admitted medically. 79 patients were aged between 65C79 years; 84 patients 80 years; and 12 patients 90 years. Mortality was 25%, 31% and 42%, respectively. Median length of stay remained 14 days for ages 65C89 rising to 17.5 days for those 90 years. Re-hospitalisation rates at 6 months were similar for ages 65C79 and 89C89 years at 42% and 40%, respectively. One patient (14%) over 90 years was re-hospitalised. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 has disproportionately impacted on general medical services treating older hospitalised people.

Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is not futile in older patients with 58% of nonagenarians and 69% of octogenarians surviving, however re-hospitalisation rates are high at 40%. A targeted approach to discharge support via integrated care may ameliorate this.","output":"234 THE IMPACT OF OLDER AGE ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES DURING THE FIRST WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 cases and related deaths have been increasing throughout the world, without any let up Health planners, medical professionals, researchers, and scientists have been working relentlessly in containing the disease from the first day, with hardly any success Hence, study has been under taken with an objective to establish the statistical model of trends in COVID-19 active cases for states of India, so that disease containment performance is assessed objectively, taking model as reference level The state-wise data from Kaggle website were used to study the case load, cure rate, and levels and trends in active cases by Modified Second Degree Polynomial Model in Indian state using SPSS-22 and Microsoft Office-10 Spot snap of COVID-19situation as on 21st June, 2020 has also been depicted to fill up the gap infirmity The COVID-19 Active Case Rate varied from 0 to 139 per 100,000 populations COVID-19 Active Case Rate was highest in Delhi followed by Maharashtra, with best state Meghalaya (COVID-19 with Active case rate = 0 3) and Andaman and Nicobar (2 9) In addition, the model fitted well with Coefficient of Determinants (R2) as highest (R2=0 999), with more than 0 80 R2 in 23 states, the states with R2 less than 0 80 had very less number of COVID-19cases, hence, model did not fit well The Modified Quadratic Model had the best fit, to assess the performance of states in controlling the COVID-19 The models are expected to be used by Health Planners and Health Professionals, as the models were fitted well in 23 states Further, the reasons for wide variation in active cases of COVID-19 may be unrest in community due to labour movement Hence, for containment of COVID-19, the need is to restrict labour movement, and pay attention on enhancement of the health services along with provisioning of public necessities","output":"Dynamics of COVID-19 cases in India: a statistical model.

Psychological stress, anxiety and depression are affecting not only COVID-19 patients but also health professionals, and general population. Fear of contracting COVID-19, forced restrictive social measures, and economic hardship are causing mental trauma. Nepal is a developing country from South Asia where the COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving. This online survey has been carried out to understand impact of COVID- 19 on mental health of Nepalese community dwellers. Methods: The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) questionnaire adapted from the Shanghai Mental Health Centre was used for online data collection from 11 April-17 May 2020. Collected data were extracted to Microsoft excel-13 and imported and analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version-22. An initial univariate analysis was conducted for all variables to assess the distribution. Logistic regression analyses were done to estimate the odds ratios of relevant predicting variables. Results: A total of 410 participants completed the self-rated questionnaires. Mean age of study participants was 34.8 11.7 years with male preponderance. 88.5% of the respondents were not in distress (score less than 28) while, 11% had mild to moderate distress and 0.5% had severe distress. The prevalence of distress is higher among age group >45 years, female gender, and post-secondary education group. Health professional were more likely to get distressed. Respondents with post-secondary education had higher odds (OR= 3.32;p=0.020) of developing distress as compared to respondents with secondary education or lower. Conclusion: There is lower rate of psychological distress in city dwellers and people with low education.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, NYC was the first major US city to open schools for in-person learning in the 2020-2021 academic year. Several policies were implemented to reduce the risk of in-school transmission, including infection control measures (facemasks, physical distancing, enhanced indoor ventilation, cohorting of small groups, and hand hygiene), option of all-remote instruction, alternative options for how class schedules would rotate in-person and remote instruction, daily symptom screening, and testing 10-20% of students and staff weekly or monthly depending on local case rates. We sought to determine which of these policies had the greatest impact on reducing the risk of in-school transmission. Methods We evaluated the impact of each policy by referring to global benchmarks for the secondary attack rate (SAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in school settings and by simulating the potential for transmission in NYC's rotating cohort schedules, in which teachers could act as \\"bridges\\" across rotating cohorts. We estimated the impact of (1) infection control measures, (2) providing an option of all-remote instruction, (3) choice of class scheduling for in-person learners, (4) daily symptom screening, (5) testing to curtail transmission, and (6) testing to identify school outbreaks. Each policy was assessed independently of other policies, with the exception of symptom screening and random testing, which were assessed both independently and jointly. Results Among the policies analyzed, the greatest transmission reduction was associated with the infection control measures, followed by small class cohorts with an option for all-remote instruction, symptom screening, and finally randomly testing 10-20% of school attendees. Assuming adult staff are the primary source of within-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission, weekly testing of staff could be at least as effective as symptom screening, and potentially more so if testing days occur in the beginning of the workweek with results available by the following day. A combination of daily symptom screening and testing on the first workday of each week could reduce transmission by 70%. Conclusions Adherence to infection control is the highest priority for safe school re-opening. Further transmission reduction can be achieved through small rotating class cohorts with an option for remote learning, widespread testing at the beginning of the work week, and daily symptom screening and self-isolation. Randomly testing 10-20% of attendees weekly or monthly does not meaningfully curtail transmission and may not detect outbreaks before they have spread beyond a handful of individuals. School systems considering re-opening during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or similarly virulent respiratory disease outbreaks should consider these relative impacts when setting policy priorities.","output":"Which policies most effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a global health challenge particularly for developing countries like Pakistan where overcrowded cities, inadequate sanitation, little health awareness and poor socioeconomic conditions exist. The SARS-CoV-2 has been known to spread primarily through direct contact and respiratory droplets. However, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and sewage have raised the possibility of fecal-oral mode of transmission. Currently, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the only method being used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which requires expensive instrumentation, dedicated laboratory setup, highly skilled staff, and several hours to report results. Considering the high transmissibility and rapid spread, a robust, sensitive, specific and cheaper assay for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection is highly needed. Herein, we report a novel colorimetric RT-LAMP assay for naked-eye detection of SARS-COV-2 in clinical as well as sewage samples. Our SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-based LAMP assay could successfully detect the virus RNA in 26/28 (93%) of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 clinical samples with 100% specificity (n = 7) within 20 min. We also tested the effect of various additives on the performance of LAMP assay and found that addition of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) could increase the sensitivity of assay up to 101 copies of target sequence. Moreover, we also successfully applied this assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in sewage waters collected from those areas of Lahore, a city of Punjab province of Pakistan, declared as virus hotspots by local government. Our optimized LAMP assay could provide a sensitive first tier strategy for SARS-CoV-2 screening and can potentially help diagnostic laboratories in better handling of high sample turnout during pandemic situation. By providing rapid naked-eye SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage samples, this assay may support pandemic readiness and emergency response to any possible virus outbreaks in future.","output":"A novel RdRp-based colorimetric RT-LAMP assay for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical and sewage samples from Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All aspects of family law have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study. The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020. METHOD: We used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: There were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions.

Genetic modifications of SARS-CoV-2 or mice enable the mice susceptible to viral infection. Although neither is the natural situation, they are currently utilized to establish mouse infection models. Here we report a direct contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 in wild-type mice. The SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.351) replicated efficiently and induced significant pathological changes in lungs and tracheas, accompanied by elevated proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and sera. Mechanistically, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.351) spike protein turned to a high binding affinity to mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (mACE2), allowing the mice highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.351) infection. Our work suggests that SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.351) expands the host range and therefore increases its transmission route without adapted mutation. As the wild house mice live with human populations quite closely, this possible transmission route could be potentially risky. In addition, because SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.351) is one of the major epidemic strains and the mACE2 in laboratory-used mice is naturally expressed and regulated, the SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.351)/mice could be a much convenient animal model system to study COVID-19 pathogenesis and evaluate antiviral inhibitors and vaccines.","output":"Infection of wild-type mice by SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant indicates a possible novel cross-species transmission route"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding the incidence and clinical outcome of the SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).

Aim 2: Counseling services included telephone listening activities, online psychological interviews, psychoeducational groups for interventions of anxiety management, and workshops on study methods conducted in small groups. The online counseling intervention, in times of emergency, increased the resilience and identified any psychological problems in order to implement timely management.","output":"Online University Counselling Services and Psychological Problems among Italian Students in Lockdown Due to Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific collaboration within a science team (unit, group, etc.) has been under scrutiny. Recently, science of team science has emerged to use science for deep understanding of the ways researchers jointly perform science to increase their teams performance. This article analyses internal scientific outputs with respect to the size of universitys science team. The objective is to examine the science policy motive that is, if the team size increases, by encouraging academics to gather in larger teams, then their outputs increase. The method of the contrapositive of this conditional statement is adopted. Thus, 120 accredited teams, composed of about 1500 academics in four universities in Morocco, were analyzed using a cross-matrix of members co-publications, an intra-collaboration index, Lorenz curve of both internal co-publications and sole-publications, with respect to teams size. Our findings show that internal co-publications and sole ones are higher for small size teams and that the Lorenz distributions of these two indicators are unequal in favor of small size teams. We discuss the implications of our findings for science policy, beyond size, such as the output- instead of input-based perspective to form a team, time requirement to build a collaborative team, inter- and intra-disciplinarity oriented research, team directorship, etc.","output":"Size of science team at university and internal co-publications: science policy implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To provide clinical practice recommendations and generate a research agenda on mechanical ventilation and respiratory support in patients with acute brain injury (ABI). METHODS: An international consensus panel was convened including 29 clinician-scientists in intensive care medicine with expertise in acute respiratory failure, neurointensive care, or both, and two non-voting methodologists. The panel was divided into seven subgroups, each addressing a predefined clinical practice domain relevant to patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with ABI, defined as acute traumatic brain or cerebrovascular injury. The panel conducted systematic searches and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used to evaluate evidence and formulate questions. A modified Delphi process was implemented with four rounds of voting in which panellists were asked to respond to questions (rounds 1C3) and then recommendation statements (final round). Strong recommendation, weak recommendation, or no recommendation were defined when > 85%, 75C85%, and < 75% of panellists, respectively, agreed with a statement. RESULTS: The GRADE rating was low, very low, or absent across domains. The consensus produced 36 statements (19 strong recommendations, 6 weak recommendations, 11 no recommendation) regarding airway management, non-invasive respiratory support, strategies for mechanical ventilation, rescue interventions for respiratory failure, ventilator liberation, and tracheostomy in brain-injured patients. Several knowledge gaps were identified to inform future research efforts. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus provides guidance for the care of patients admitted to the ICU with ABI. Evidence was generally insufficient or lacking, and research is needed to demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of different management approaches.

With shortage of kits, and deadly underlying disease due to its vastly mutating and contagious properties, the tired physicians need a fast diagnostic method to cater the requirements of the soaring number of infected patients. Laboratory testing has turned out to be an arduous, cost-ineffective and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model for analysis/detection of COVID-19, dubbed as CovCNN, which uses the patients chest X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with an aim to assist the medical practitioners to expedite the diagnostic process amongst high workload conditions. In the proposed CovCNN model, a novel deep-CNN based architecture has been incorporated with multiple folds of CNN. These models utilize depth wise convolution with varying dilation rates for efficiently extracting diversified features from chest X-rays. 657 chest X-rays of which 219 were X-ray images of patients infected from COVID-19 and the remaining were the images of non-COVID-19 (i.e. normal or COVID-19 negative) patients. Further, performance evaluation on the dataset using different pre-trained models has been analyzed based on the loss and accuracy curve.

We analyzed data on 45 workers with type 1 diabetes from whom we collected activity data 5C6 times daily over 14 days. More frequent engagement in high-workload activities was associated with lower well-being on multiple measures including higher stress. Conversely, greater recovery activity frequency was mostly associated with higher well-being indicated by lower stress and higher positive affect.

No deaths, serious adverse events (AE), or other significant AE related to vaccination have been detected. The most common AE in vaccinated participants was pain at the injection site (p<0.05). Immunogenicity assessment was performed in 167 volunteers (122 vaccinated and 45 in Placebo Group) separately for the participants who were anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAB negative (69/122 in Vaccine Group and 28/45 in Placebo Group) or positive (53/122 in Vaccine Group and 17/45 in Placebo Group) at screening. At Day 42 after the first immunization the seroconversion rate in participants who were seronegative at screening was 86.9% with average the geometric mean neutralizing antibody (nAB) titer of 1:20. Statistically significant (p<0.05) increase of IFN-{gamma} production by peptide-stimulated T-cells was observed at Days 14 and 21 after the first immunization. In participants who were seropositive at screening but had nAB titers below 1:256 the rate of 4-fold increase in nAB levels was 85.2%, while in the participants with nAB titers >1:256 the rate of 4-fold increase in nAB levels was below 45%. For the participants who were seropositive at screening the second immunization did not lead to a significant increase in nAB titers. In conclusion, inactivated vaccine CoviVac has shown good tolerability and safety, with 86.9% seroconversion rates in participants, who were seronegative at screening.

According to the current subject knowledge, there are two main axes of the RAAS: (1) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis and (2) ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis. The activation of the first axis leads to deleterious effects, including vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, inflammation, and fibrosis; therefore, blocking the components of this axis is a highly rational and commonly used therapeutic procedure. The ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis has a different role, since it often opposes the effects induced by the classical ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis. Once the positive effects of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis were discovered, the alternative ways of pharmacotherapy activating this axis of RAAS appeared.

Specifically, they suggested intubating COVID-19 positive or those with unknown COVID-19 status prior to emergent endovascular thrombectomy, cohorting by COVID-19 status, early ICU discharge, and postponing elective cases. We sought to determine how the implementation of SNIS guidelines affected outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing ischemic stroke patients who were treated with thrombectomy admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic 4/1/20-6/30/20 COVID-19 peak to patients admitted 4/1/19-6/30/19 2019. Statistical tests used for analysis included Kruskal- Wallis, chi-squared and Fisher's exact test. Results: The proportion of patients treated with thrombectomy was not significantly different, 23% in 2019 vs. 24% during the COVID-19 peak, p=0.67. There were 112 patients treated with thrombectomy: 57 (51%) in 2019, 55 (49%) during the COVID-19 peak. No patients treated with thrombectomy were positive for COVID-19, but 27 (49%) were tested. The median age was 69 for those treated in 2019 and 69 for those during the COVID-19 peak, p=0.44. Patients were similar in sex, race, and comorbidities. The time from onset to arrival was also statistically similar, p=0.19. In 2019, 16% received tPA compared to 9% during the COVID-19 peak, p=0.28. The median time to groin puncture was significantly shorter in 2019, 38 minutes, than during the COVID-19 peak, 44 minutes, p=0.01. The recanalization rate and mRS were similar between groups, p=0.06, and p=0.91, respectively. Conclusions: After implementing the SNIS guidelines, including pre-treatment intubation, we observed a significantly longer time to groin puncture. Anecdotally, the increased observed was remarkably small given the changes to care and did not negatively impact patient outcomes. This suggests that hospitals managing patients efficiently can implement changes in response to COVID- 19 and continue high level of care without impacting outcomes.

Dromedary camels are the source of zoonotic infection. Over 70% of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected dromedaries are found in Africa but no zoonotic disease has been reported in Africa. We aimed to understand whether individuals with exposure to dromedaries in Africa had been infected by MERS-CoV. METHODS: Workers slaughtering dromedaries in an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, were compared with abattoir workers without direct dromedary contact, non-abattoir workers from Kano, and controls from Guangzhou, China. Exposure to dromedaries was ascertained using a questionnaire. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were tested for MERS-CoV specific neutralising antibody and T-cell responses. FINDINGS: None of the participants from Nigeria or Guangdong were MERS-CoV seropositive. 18 (30%) of 61 abattoir workers with exposure to dromedaries, but none of 20 abattoir workers without exposure (p=00042), ten non-abattoir workers or 24 controls from Guangzhou (p=00002) had evidence of MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in PBMC. T-cell responses to other endemic human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, HKU-1, and NL-63) were observed in all groups with no association with dromedary exposure. Drinking both unpasteurised camel milk and camel urine was significantly and negatively associated with T-cell positivity (odds ratio 007, 95% CI 001-054). INTERPRETATION: Zoonotic infection of dromedary-exposed individuals is taking place in Nigeria and suggests that the extent of MERS-CoV infections in Africa is underestimated. MERS-CoV could therefore adapt to human transmission in Africa rather than the Arabian Peninsula, where attention is currently focused.

Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coil?helix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher G values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility.

LOCAL PROBLEM This rapid paradigm shift from face-to-face (F2F) consultations to telemedicine required a collaborative approach for successful implementation while maintaining quality of care. The processes for conducting a telemedicine visit for HF patient are not well defined or outlined. METHOD Using a collaborative practice model and nurse practitioner led program, technology was leveraged to manage the high-risk HF population using virtual care (consultation via phone or video-to-home) with two aims: first to provide ongoing HF care using available telemedicine technologies or F2F care when necessary and, second, to evaluate and direct those needing urgent/emergent level of care to emergency department (ED). INTERVENTION The process was converted into an intuitive algorithm that describes essential elements and team roles necessary for execution of a successful HF consultation. RESULTS Following the algorithm, nurse practitioners conducted 132 visits, yielding 100% success in the conversion of F2F appointments to telemedicine, with 3 patients referred to ED for care. The information obtained through telemedicine consultation accurately informed decision for ED evaluation with resultant admission. CONCLUSION Collaborative team-based approach delineated in the algorithm facilitated successful virtual consultations for HF patients and accurately informed decisions for higher level of care.","output":"Leveraging telemedicine for management of veterans with heart failure during COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors present different expression profiles related to the prognosis of COVID-19. We analyzed clinical parameters and assessed the expression of these biomarkers in patients with different disease severity in a hospitalized Peruvian cohort to determine those associated with worse prognosis. We measured anti-spike IgG antibodies by ELISA and 30 cytokines by quantitative suspension array technology in 123 sera samples. We analyzed differences between patients with moderate, severe and fatal COVID-19 by logistic regression at baseline and in longitudinal samples. Significant differences were found among the clinical parameters: hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine and D-dimer levels. Higher anti-spike IgG antibody concentrations were associated to fatal patient outcomes. At hospitalization, IL-10, IL-6, MIP-1, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-5, IL1RA, TNF and IL-8 levels were already increased in fatal patients group. Meanwhile, multivariable analysis revealed that increased GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, and IL-8 values were associated with fatal outcomes. Moreover, longitudinal analysis identified IL-6 and MCP-1 as the main risk factors related to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this Peruvian cohort we identified and validated biomarkers related to COVID-19 outcomes. Further studies are needed to identify novel criteria for stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital entry. BACKGROUND: In the most severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, large numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells become activated and begin to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, establishing an exacerbated feedback loop of inflammation. METHODS: A total of 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen in Lima, Peru were enrolled during August-October 2020. Of these, 21 had moderate disease, 24 severe diseases and 10 died. We measured 30 cytokines and chemokines by quantitative suspension array technology and anti-spike IgG antibodies using a commercial ELISA. We evaluated these parameters in peripheral blood every 2-5 days until patient discharge or death. Patient information and clinical parameters related were obtained from the respective clinical histories. RESULTS: The frequency of obesity differed among the 3 groups, being most frequent in patients who died. There were also significant differences in clinical parameters: hemoglobin, segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes,C-reactive protein, creatinine and D-dimer levels. Greater anti-spike IgG antibody concentrations were associated to fatal outcomes. In univariate analyses, higher baseline concentrations of IL-6, MIP-1, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-5, IL1RA, TNF, IL-8 and IL-12p70 correlated with severity, while multivariable analysis showed that increased concentrations in 4 biomarkers (GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-8) were associated with fatal outcomes. Longitudinal analysis showed IL-6 (hazard ratio [HR] 6.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-28.7) and MCP-1 (HR 4.61, 95%CI 1.1-19.1) to be related to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine, chemokine and growth factor profiles were identified and validated related to severity and outcomes of COVID-19.

METHODS: 255 CT-guided lung biopsies performed for 249 lesions in 249 patients from August 2014 to August 2019 were retrospectively analysed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Risk prediction models were established using backward stepwise variable selection and likelihood ratio tests and were internally validated using split-sample methods. RESULTS: The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 30.2% (77/255). ICC insertion was required for 8.32% (21/255) of all procedures. The significant independent risk factors for pneumothorax were lesions not in contact with pleura (P < 0.001), a shorter skin-to-pleura distance (P = 0.01), the needle crossing a fissure (P = 0.004) and emphysema (P = 0.01); those for ICC insertion for pneumothorax were a needle through emphysema (P < 0.001) and lesions in the upper lobe (P = 0.017). AUC of the predictive models for pneumothorax and ICC insertion were 0.800 (95% CI: 0.745-0.856) and 0.859 (95% CI: 0.779-0.939) respectively. Upon internal validation, AUC of the testing sets of pneumothorax and ICC insertion were 0.769 and 0.822 on average respectively. CONCLUSION: The complication rates of pneumothorax and ICC insertion after CT-guided lung biopsy at our institution are comparable to results from previously reported studies.

Its success is mainly hampered by tube tip impingement of laryngeal structures. Advancing the tracheal tube along its normal curvature via a tube exchanger catheter has a high risk of tube tip impingement mainly of right laryngeal structures. The authors achieved successful clinical experience by rotating the tracheal tube 90 anticlockwise (ventral tube tip position) before railroading the tube via a tube exchanger catheter or a fiber optic bronchoscope through the larynx. AIM The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the tracheal tube tip position while intubating an airway trainer over a tube exchange catheter. MATERIAL AND METHODS Volunteer anesthetists with varying years of professional experience were asked to intubate an intubation mannequin (Laerdal Airway Management Trainer) using the orotracheal route with an established tube exchange catheter (Cook Airway Exchange Catheter, 11F). Two different brands of tracheal tubes (Rsch and Covidien, ID 7.0 mm) were used in a randomized order, each with the tracheal tube tip at first positioned right (90), then ventrally (0), left (270) and finally dorsally (180), resulting in eight intubation attempts for each participant. To ensure the correct tube tip position the tube was withdrawn before every intubation attempt until the tube tip position was visualized. The oropharnyx, larynx, trachea and tube were sufficiently lubricated with silicon spray (Rsch Silikospray). The tube and airway exchange catheter size selection were made according to the clinical trial of Loudermilk et al. Successful endotracheal intubation without resistance was recorded for each tube tip position and tracheal tube brand. RESULTS In total 20 anesthetists (13 consultants and 7 residents) with a median of 9.5 years (range 3-37 years) of professional experience participated in the study. Overall 160 intubation attempts were performed, 2 participants showed no successful intubation attempts at all and 38 out of 160 intubation attempts (23.8 %) were successful. Intubation success with the tracheal tube tip placed ventrally (0) was 60 % followed by the left (270) and right (90) tracheal tube tip positions with 27.5 % and 7.5 % intubation success, respectively. With the tube tip placed dorsally (180) none of the 40 intubation attempts were successful. Intubation attempts with the Rsch tube were more successful (28.8 %) than those with the Covidien tube (18.8 %). Placing the tracheal tube tip ventrally, the Rsch tube was twice as successful as the Covidien tube with 16 (80 %) versus 8 attempts (40 %, p = 0.011). There was no correlation between professional experience and intubation success (p = 0.362). CONCLUSION Tube insertion via an airway exchange catheter or a fiberoptic bronchoscope is a basic technique in anesthesia. Knowledge about the difficulties and their prevention are essential for every anesthetist. The gap between the airway exchange catheter, the fiber bronchoscope and the tube diameters is one of the major reasons for tube tip impingement. This investigation showed that intubation success via a tube exchange catheter, as investigated in an intubation mannequin, is considerably influenced by the tracheal tube tip position. A 90 anticlockwise rotation, placing the tracheal tube tip ventrally, considerably increased intubation success. This is of particular importance if an anesthesia department has no appropriately sized tube exchange catheters or fiber bronchoscope for every age group of patients.","output":"[Intubation with a tube exchanger on an intubation trainer.

Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users (N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classical COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents with a rash showed that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was the only clinical sign. Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognising rashes is important in identifying new and earlier COVID-19 cases.","output":"Diagnostic value of skin manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is characterized by a high level of infectivity and a high mortality among adults at risk (older than 65 years, obesity, diabetes, systemic hypertension). Following a common viral pneumonia, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome sometimes occurs, including an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) carrying a high mortality. Unlike most common respiratory viruses, children seem less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and generally develop a mild disease with low mortality. However, clusters of severe shock associated with high levels of cardiac biomarkers and unusual vasoplegia requiring inotropes, vasopressors and volume loading have been recently described. Both clinical symptoms (i.e., high and persistent fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin rash, conjunctivitis and dry cracked lips) and biological signs (e.g., elevated CRP/PCT, hyperferritinemia) resembled Kawasaki disease. In most instances, intravenous immunoglobin therapy improved the cardiac function and led to full recovery within a few days. However, adjunctive steroid therapy and sometimes biotherapy (e.g., anti-IL-1Ra, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies) were often necessary. Although almost all children fully recovered within a week, some of them developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysm. Thus, a new 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2' has been recently described in children and helps to better understand Kawasaki disease pathophysiology.","output":"[COVID-19 in children: SARS-CoV-2-related inflammatory multisystem syndrome mimicking Kawasaki disease]./ COVID-19 chez l'enfant : syndrome inflammatoire multi-systmique li  SARS-CoV-2 mimant un syndrome de Kawasaki"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants has been a serious threat to the public health system and vaccination program.

In this situation, authors were particularly concerned with the extent to which job insecurity (both quantitative and qualitative) contributed to the deterioration of workers' well-being. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was carried out on 382 Polish employees in April and May 2020. The following research tools were used: the Job Insecurity in Pandemic Scale by Chirkowska-Smolak and Czumak and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) by Levibond and Levibond. RESULTS The quantitative and qualitative job insecurity were significant predictors of depression and stress, but they did not explain anxiety symptoms. The scope of the explained variance of these negative emotional states by concerns related to work and employment was not large (from 11% to 17.6%). The moderating role of perceived employability was confirmed only in the case of the relationship between qualitative job insecurity and depression, as well as quantitative job insecurity and stress. However, the increase in the explained variance was very small. CONCLUSIONS Uncertainty related to the maintenance of employment and concerns about the deterioration of working conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on emotional disturbances of employees, but they only explained some of the variance of depression and stress and did not affect the perceived level of anxiety. The smaller role of economic stress in the emergence of negative emotional states could be associated with the occurrence of much more serious threats to the health and life of the population in this period. The very low level of unemployment in Poland, which remained at a similar level throughout the pandemic despite the catastrophic forecasts of economists, could also have played an important role.

We performed a systems biology analysis of samples from the Immunization by Mosquito with Radiation Attenuated Sporozoites (IMRAS) trial, which comprised P. falciparum RAS-immunized (PfRAS), malaria-naive participants whose protection from malaria infection was subsequently assessed by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Blood samples collected after initial PfRAS immunization were analyzed to compare immune responses between protected and non-protected volunteers leveraging integrative analysis of whole blood RNA-seq, high parameter flow cytometry, and single cell CITEseq of PBMCs. This analysis revealed differences in early innate immune responses indicating divergent paths associated with protection. In particular, elevated levels of inflammatory responses early after the initial immunization were detrimental for the development of protective adaptive immunity. Specifically, non-classical monocytes and early type I interferon responses induced within 1 day of PfRAS vaccination correlated with impaired immunity. Non-protected individuals also showed an increase in Th2 polarized T cell responses whereas we observed a trend towards increased Th1 and T-bet+ CD8 T cell responses in protected individuals. Temporal differences in genes associated with natural killer cells suggest an important role in immune regulation by these cells. These findings give insight into the immune responses that confer protection against malaria and may guide further malaria vaccine development.

Methods: The study is a cross-sectional study. Participants (N = 5,265; 46.6% males) completed perceived physical literacy instruments, mental health continuum short forms, and the 12-item child and youth resilience measures. Mediation models were applied to explore the association among three concepts. Results: Physical literacy, resilience, and mental health were significantly linked with each other. In the mediation model, the direct effect of physical literacy on mental health was 0.49. The indirect effect of physical literacy on mental health through the mediation of resilience was 0.97. The mediating effect of resilience accounts for 66.30% of the total effect, indicating the partial mediating effect of resilience in the relationship between physical literacy and mental health. In more detailed models, resilience was found to mediate the relationship between physical literacy and social and psychological wellbeing, accounting for 61.02% and 56.92% of the total effect, respectively. In addition, resilience acted as full mediator in the relationship between physical literacy and emotional wellbeing (>100%). These findings suggest that physical literacy increases mental health by improving resilience. Conclusions: This is the first time to connect physical literacy with mind factors. The mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between physical literacy and mental health was found.

Patients who developed severe forms of COVID-19 presented significantly lower CD3+ (median 344/mm3 (inter quartile range 197; 564) vs. 643/mm3 (397; 1251), and CD8+ T cell counts (124/mm3 (76; 229) vs. 240/mm3 (119; 435). However, activated CD4+ T cells were significantly more frequent in severe forms (2.9% (1.37; 5.72) vs. 1.4% (0.68; 2.35), counterbalanced by a significantly higher proportion of Tregs (3.9% (2.35; 5.87) vs 2.7% (1.9; 3.45)).

Cybermanufacturing will unleash the potential of multi-modal manufacturing data, and provide a new perspective called computation service, as a part of service-oriented architecture (SOA), where on-demand computation requests throughout manufacturing operations are seamlessly satisfied by data analytics and machine learning. However, the complexity of information technology infrastructure leads to fundamental challenges in modeling and analysis under cybermanufacturing, ranging from information-poor datasets to a lack of reproducibility of analytical studies. Nevertheless, existing reviews have focused on the overall architecture of cybermanufacturing/SOA or its technical components (e.g., communication protocol), rather than the potential bottleneck of computation service with respect to modeling and analysis. In this paper, we review the fundamental challenges with respect to modeling and analysis in cybermanufacturing. Then, we introduce the existing efforts in computation pipeline recommendation, which aims at identifying an optimal sequence of method options for data analytics/machine learning without time-consuming trial-and-error.

Gardnerella spp. belonging to cpn60 subgroup D, are detected at low levels in vaginal microbiomes and are nutritional generalists relative to other more abundant Gardnerella spp., making them good candidates for negative frequency-dependent selection. The vaginal microbiome is a dynamic environment, and the resulting changes in density of the microbiota may explain why subgroup D never gains dominance. To test this, we co-cultured subgroup D isolates with isolates from the more common and abundant subgroup C. Deep amplicon sequencing of rpoB was used to determine proportional abundance of each isolate at 0 h and 72 h in 152 co-cultures and to calculate change in proportion. D isolates had a positive change in proportional abundance in most co-cultures regardless of initial proportion. Initial density affected the change in proportion of subgroup D isolates either positively or negatively depending on the particular isolates combined, suggesting that growth rate, population density and other intrinsic features of the isolates influenced the outcome.

METHODS: 531 vaccinees, recruited from health care professionals, donated samples before, in between, and after the administration of the two doses of the vaccine. T- and B-cell responses were examined via Interferon--release assay as well as detection of antibodies against different epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (S1 and NCP) via ELISA and binding surrogate neutralization assay. Results were correlated with influence factors such as age, sex, prior infection, vaccine received (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), and immunosuppression. Furthermore, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were measured to screen for autoimmune responses following the vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. RESULTS: No markers of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 were found before the first vaccination. Two weeks after it, specific responses against SARS-CoV-2 were already measurable (medianmedian absolute deviation (MAD): anti-S1 IgG: 195.5172.7 BAU/ml; IgA: 6.74.9 OD; surrogate neutralization: 3923.7 %), which were significantly increased two weeks after the second dose (anti-S1 IgG: 37442571.4 BAU/ml; IgA: 120 OD; surrogate neutralization: 1000 %, IFN-: 1897.2886.7 mIU/ml). Responses were stronger for younger participants (this difference decreasing after the second dose). Further influences were previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 (causing significantly stronger responses after the first dose compared to unexposed individuals (p  0.0001)) and the vaccine received (significantly stronger reactions for recipients of mRNA-1273 after both doses (p < 0.05 C 0.0001)). Some forms of immunosuppression significantly impeded the immune response to the vaccination (with no observable immune response in three immunosuppressed participants). There was no significant induction of ANA by the vaccination (no change in qualitative ANA results (p = 0.2592), nor ANA titers (p = 0.08) from pre to post vaccination.

Various prognostication tools have been validated in many settings in the past few years. Biomarkers of inflammation (albumin and C-reactive protein) are combined to calculate the modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), which has been found to be a simple prognostic tool in this population. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study was to evaluate mGPS as a prognostication tool for cancer patients admitted to an acute hospital in regional Australia. METHODS: Adult cancer patients admitted to an acute Australian regional hospital during 2017 who had albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) tested were included. The mGPS was calculated based on their admission values and discharge values. Based on their score (0-2), groups were compared using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for prognostication. Kaplan-Meier survival plots and median survival time from admission and discharge were constructed. RESULTS: A total of 170 patient records were reviewed of which 95 had admission and discharge mGPS scores available for analysis. Of those, 86 had died at the time of data analysis. The median survival for admission mGPS 0, 1, 2 was 168,156 and 74 days. For discharge mGPS 0, 1, 2 medians were 168,119 and 70 days.

Health promotion is thus being mainstreamed into modern public health. For health promotion, this offers both opportunities and challenges. A stronger focus on the enablers of health enhances the strategic importance of health promotion's whole-of-society approach to health, showcases the achievements of health promotion with regard to core professional competencies, and helps build public health capacity with health promotion accents. On the other hand, mainstreaming health promotion can weaken its organizational capacity and visibility, and bears the risk of it being absorbed into a traditional public health discourse dominated by medical professions.

METHODS Standard laparoscopic technique was utilized to bilaterally implant meshes in 20 female Yorkshire pigs (n = 5 pigs/group). Meshes were fixated to the intact peritoneum with SorbaFix? absorbable fixation devices. Mesh contracture, adhesion coverage, and adhesion tenacity were evaluated after 4 weeks. T-Peel testing and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were utilized to assess tissue ingrowth and host response. RESULTS A significantly greater percent area contracture was demonstrated for PROCEED? (26.9%) compared to Ventrio? ST (8.8%), Ventrio? (14.5%) and Sepramesh? (9.2%). Ventrio? ST demonstrated similar adhesion area, tenacity, and tissue ingrowth compared to all other meshes. Histological scoring revealed a comparable host inflammatory response for all meshes, with a few exceptions. A greater number of giant cells were observed in Ventrio?

Infectious passengers were laboratory-confirmed cases with symptom onset from 7 days before to 2 days after the flight. Possible aircraft-acquired cases were laboratory-confirmed with onset 3-14 days post-flight with no known non-flight exposure. Manifests was merged with the national case management dataset (identifying cases, onset dates, contact tracing status) and the national COVID-19 linelist. Contact tracing notes were reviewed to identify non-flight exposures. We calculated attack rates (ARs) among all co-passengers and within subgroups, including by distance from infectious cases and number of infectious cases on-board. RESULTS: There were 55 infectious passengers and 2313 co-passengers, including 2221 flight-only contacts. Five possible aircraft-acquired cases were identified; ARs of 0.2% (95%CI 0.1-0.5) among all flight-only contacts and 3.8% (95%CI 1.3-10.6) among contact-traced flight-only contacts sat within a two-seat radius.

In public health emergencies, the use of information to achieve disease prevention and treatment is incredibly important. Although both the Model of Information Acceptance (IAM) and Health Belief Model (HBM) have their own merits, they only focus on information or public influence factors to explain the public's online prevention and treatment information adoption intention. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to fill this gap by using IAM and HBM as the framework for exploring the influencing factors and paths in public health events that affect the public's adoption of online health information and health behaviors, focusing on both objective and subjective factors. METHODS: We carried out an online survey to collect the respondents (n=501) in China. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate items and construct reliability and validity via confirmatory factor analysis, and the model goodness of fit and mediation effects were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall fitness indices for the model developed in this study indicated an acceptable fit. Adoption intention is predicted by information characteristic (beta=0.266, P<.001) and perceived usefulness (beta=0.565, P<.001), which jointly explanation nearly 67% of the adoption intention variance. Information characteristic (beta=0.244, P<.001), perceived drawbacks (beta=-0.097, P<.01), perceived benefits (beta=0.512, P<.001), and self-efficiency (beta=0.141, P<.001) jointly determine perceived usefulness and explanation about 81% variance of perceived usefulness. However, social influence is not statistically significant on perceived usefulness, and self-efficiency did not significantly influence adoption intention directly. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating IAM and HBM, this study provided the insight and an understanding that perceived usefulness and adoption intentions of the online health information could be influenced by the information characteristic, people's perception of information drawbacks and benefits, and self-efficiency. Moreover, people also have proactive behavior rather than reactive behavior to adopt information. Thus, we should consider these factors to help the \\"informed public\\" obtain useful information from two aspects, and one is to improve the quality of government and other official information.

Our objective was to examine pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) disparities between the two populations and compare individual, social and structural factors that influence differences between MSM and trans women along the PrEP continuum. METHODS We analysed data from two population-based studies, one with trans women (Trans*National Study, 2016 - 18) and the other with MSM (National HIV Behavioral Surveillance, 2017). Trans women were recruited via respondent-driven sampling and MSM using time location sampling. Key indicators of the PrEP continuum were evaluated, including awareness, health insurance, provider discussions, recent use and adherence. Associations were also examined for PrEP continuum indicators and structural barriers (e.g. employment, homelessness). RESULTS Transwomen were more likely than MSM to be Latino/a (30.4% vs. 25.8%; prevalence ratio (PR)=1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.14) or African American (7.1% vs. 4.5%; PR = 1.12, 1.02 to 1.24), live at or below the poverty limit (70.7% vs. 15.8%; PR = 1.47; 1.41 to 1.53), be unemployed (50.1% vs. 26.3%; PR = 1.18, 1.13 to 1.24), be homeless (8.4% vs. 3.5%; PR = 1.15, 1.06 to 1.25) and to have less than a college degree (PR = 1.41, 1.34 to 1.48). Trans women were more likely than MSM to have health insurance (95.7% vs. 89.7%, PR = 1.17, 1.06 to 1.28), but less likely than MSM to have heard of PrEP (79.1% vs. 96.7%; PR = 0.77, 0.73 to 0.81), talked with a provider about PrEP (35.5% vs. 54.9%; PR = 0.87, 0.83 to 0.91) and less likely than MSM to have used PrEP in the past six months (14.6% vs. 39.8%; PR = 0.80, 0.76 to 0.84). Among PrEP users, trans women were less likely to report being adherent to PrEP than MSM (70.4% vs. 87.4%; PR = 0.80, 0.70 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS We found PrEP disparities for trans women compared to MSM and the need for differentiated implementation strategies to meet the specific PrEP barriers trans women face. Inclusion of trans women's HIV risks is needed in CDC guidance for PrEP. Interventions to increase trans women's awareness of PrEP including at the provider and community level are also needed. Finally, programming that addresses trans women's barriers to housing and income is also needed to reduce PrEP disparities.","output":"Disparities in the PrEP continuum for trans women compared to MSM in San Francisco, California: results from population-based cross-sectional behavioural surveillance studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article has concentrated on the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of viral infections of the hand.

The aim of this study was to prove the feasibility and efficacy of this novel innovative off-pump apico-aortic conduit technique. METHODS The bipartite conduit consists of an 18-mm prosthetic tube graft containing a stentless porcine aortic valve as well as a flexible semi-rigid and curved ventricular connector. Via left anterior lateral thoracotomy, the valved conduit is sutured to the descending aorta. The left ventricular connector is implanted with a gun-like applicator into the apex without cardiopulmonary bypass and with minimal blood loss. RESULTS Between March and December 2011, 7 patients (5 females/2 males) with a mean age of 82 (79-89 years) were operated on. The mean logistic EuroSCORE I was 36.4  23.7 (median 36.7%). The mean ejection fraction was 37 (25-65%) and the mean preoperative transaortic gradient was 38 (22-53 mmHg). Three patients had previous mechanical mitral valve replacement, 1 had a porcelain aorta and 3 had unfavourable distances between the aortic annulus and ostia (ostial encroachment). Implantation was uneventful in all patients, with need for limited cardiopulmonary bypass in only 1 patient. Postoperative mean transaortic gradient was 14 (11-25 mmHg). Approximately 70% of stroke volume was bypassed as measured in postoperative magnetic resonance. One patient died in hospital due to respiratory failure. New York Heart Association class in the other patients diminished from 3.6 to 1.6. No rhythmic disturbances or heart block were encountered.

METHODS: Clinical specimens, including throat swabs, sputum or tracheal aspirates, etc., were obtained from patients exhibiting influenza-like illness (ILIs), especially from those having pneumonia and a history of occupational exposure to poultry and wild birds. RNA was extracted from these samples and a multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assay was developed to specifically detect the influenza A virus (FluA). PCR primers targeted the conserved M and Rnase P (RP) genes, as well as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the H7N9 virus. RESULTS: The multiplex assay specifically detected the avian H7N9 virus, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory pathogens was observed. The detection limit of the assay was approximately 0.05 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID(50)), or 100 copies per reaction. Positive detection of the H7N9 virus in sputum/tracheal aspirates was higher than in throat swabs during the surveillance of patients with ILIs. Additionally, detection of the matrix (M) and Rnase P genes aided in the determination of the novel avian H7N9 virus and ensured the quality of the clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the multiplex assay detected the novel avian H7N9 virus with high specificity and sensitivity, which is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of infected patients.

The first European country to face an emergency caused by the pandemic was Italy. In a rapidly escalating crisis, on 6th March 2020, the Italian Society of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued a series of 15 recommendations, suggesting that a utilitarian approach should be adopted in Italian health care and the extremely scarce resources should be reserved for patients with a greater probability of survival and life expectancy, in order to maximize the benefits for the largest possible number of people. The recommendations generated a heated debate among health care professionals, thereby evidencing that similar discussions must be initiated and pursued in all countries affected by the pandemic.

Our study explored the distinct clinical features of COVID-19 patients with cancer. Experimental Design: 189 COVID-19 patients, including 16 cancer patients and 173 patients without cancer, were recruited. Propensity score 1:4 matching (PSM) was performed between cancer patients and patients without cancer based on age, gender and comorbidities. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the difference was compared by the log-rank test. Results: PSM analysis yielded 16 cancer patients and 64 propensity score-matched patients without cancer. Compared to patients without cancer, cancer patients tended to have leukopenia and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin. For those with critical COVID-19, cancer patients had an inferior survival than those without cancer. Also, cancer patients with severe/critical COVID-19 tended to be male and present with low S(P)O(2) and albumin, and high hs-CRP, lactate dehydrogenase and blood urea nitrogen on admission compared to those with mild COVID-19. In terms of risk factors, recent cancer diagnosis (within 1 year of onset of COVID-19) and anti-tumor treatment within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis were associated with inferior survival. Conclusions: We found COVID-19 patients with cancer have distinct clinical features as compared to patients without cancer. Importantly, cancer patients with critical COVID-19 were found to have poorer outcomes compared to those without cancer. In the cancer cohort, patients with severe/critical COVID-19 presented with a distinct clinical profile from those with mild COVID-19; short cancer history and recent anti-cancer treatment were associated with inferior survival.","output":"Severity of COVID-19 in Cancer patients versus patients without Cancer: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Distress and mental health issues among college students is an emerging topic of study.

During biological nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), high N(2)O fluxes to the atmosphere can occur, typically exhibiting a seasonal emission pattern. Attempts to explain the peak emission phases in winter and spring using physico-chemical process data from WWTP were so far unsuccessful and new approaches are required. The complex and diverse microbial community of activated sludge used in biological treatment systems also exhibit substantial seasonal patterns. However, a potentially causal link between the seasonal patterns of microbial diversity and N(2)O emissions has not yet been investigated. Here we show that in a full-scale WWTP nitrification failure and N(2)O peak emissions, bad settleability of the activated sludge and a turbid effluent strongly correlate with a significant reduction in the microbial community diversity and shifts in community composition. During episodes of impaired performance, we observed a significant reduction in abundance for filamentous and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in all affected reactors. In some reactors that did not exhibit nitrification and settling failures, we observed a stable microbial community and no drastic loss of species. Standard engineering approaches to stabilize nitrification, such as increasing the aerobic sludge age and oxygen availability failed to improve the plant performance on this particular WWTP and replacing the activated sludge was the only measure applied by the operators to recover treatment performance in affected reactors. Our results demonstrate that disturbances of the sludge microbiome affect key structural and functional microbial groups, which lead to seasonal N(2)O emission patterns. To reduce N(2)O emissions from WWTP, it is therefore crucial to understand the drivers that lead to the microbial population dynamics in the activated sludge.","output":"Linking seasonal N(2)O emissions and nitrification failures to microbial dynamics in a SBR wastewater treatment plant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last two years, hundreds of millions of people in the world have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to recurrent waves and closed spaces. Daycare centers are critical infrastructures that cannot be replaced, even during the COVID-19 period. However, the existing settings in daycare centers may pose risks of inevitable close contact between teachers and children, as well as fomite and airborne transmission during care hours. Therefore, reinforced mitigation strategies have been applied in daycare centers to reduce potential indoor virus transfer in many countries. However, numerous outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported in daycare centers. Therefore, in this study, researchers focused on the risk and behavior of long-distance virus transmission based on the detected viruses on air purifier filter sampling in a daycare center outbreak in Korea. Various experiments of possible situations were conducted in nursing rooms based on field interviews. The experiments monitored the long-distance transmission behavior of aerosol-sized particles and visualized particle behavior at the daycare center.

Many countries have legalized or are considering legalizing a trading platform for this asset, and a set of companies worldwide accept it as a medium of exchange. As a result of this expansion, many studies in finance literature have focused on studying the efficiency of this cryptocurrency. In line with this literature, this paper investigates, using the abnormal returns and abnormal trading volumes methodologies, the dynamics of investors reaction to the arrival of unexpected favorable and unfavorable information regarding the Bitcoin market in the context of the three famous hypotheses: the overreaction, the uncertain information, and the efficient market hypotheses. Overall, we find evidence confirming that the Bitcoin market tends to mature over time. More precisely, over the entire analyzed period, investors behave in accordance with the predictions of the uncertain information hypothesis when positive and negative events occur. However, splitting the timespan into sub-periods provides interesting insights. Remarkably in this respect is the fact that starting with the second sub-period, the response of investors in the Bitcoin market supports, in a moderate manner, the postulate of the efficient market hypothesis when favorable events are addressed. Moreover, our findings reveal that during the pandemic period, the efficiency of Bitcoin has increased, thus turning this stressful period into an advantage for this cryptocurrency. This improved market efficiency is also supported by the abnormal trading volume analysis.","output":"An analysis of investors behavior in Bitcoin market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Athletes are advised to receive the COVID-19 vaccination to protect them from SARS CoV-2 infection during major competitions. Despite this, many athletes are reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to concerns that symptoms of vaccinosis may impair athletic performance. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the physiological responses to graded exercise. METHODS: Healthy participants completed a 20-minute bout of graded cycling exercise before and ~21 days after COVID-19 vaccination (2 dose Pfizer mRNA or 1 dose Johnson & Johnson). RESULTS: Oxygen uptake, CO2 production, respiratory exchange ratio, ventilation, heart rate, serum noradrenaline, and rating of perceived exertion were significantly elevated in the post vaccine trial. However, vaccination did not affect serum lactate, adrenaline, cortisol, predicted [V]O2max, and ventilatory threshold. Post-vaccine effects on heart rate and noradrenaline remained significant in non-infected participants that received the Pfizer vaccine. No significant effects in respiratory gas exchange parameters were found after vaccination in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but exercise adrenaline levels were significantly lower and serum lactate levels trending (p= 0.10) lower after vaccination. No changes in any physiological responses to exercise were found in control participants who completed two bouts of exercise separated by ~5 weeks without vaccination. CONCLUSION: Recent COVID-19 vaccination is associated with modest increases in the physiological demands to graded exercise in non-infected healthy people but may actually improve metabolic responses to exercise in those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Whether or not these small effects could impact athletic performance at the elite level warrants investigation.","output":"Recent COVID-19 vaccination is associated with modest increases in the physiological demands to graded exercise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Since September 2012, 170 confirmed infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to the World Health Organization, including 72 deaths. Data on critically ill patients with MERS-CoV infection are limited. OBJECTIVE To describe the critical illness associated with MERS-CoV. DESIGN Case series. SETTING 3 intensive care units (ICUs) at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS 12 patients with confirmed or probable MERS-CoV infection. MEASUREMENTS Presenting symptoms, comorbid conditions, pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations, measures of severity of illness and organ failure, ICU course, and outcome are described, as are the results of surveillance of health care workers (HCWs) and patients with potential exposure. RESULTS Between December 2012 and August 2013, 114 patients were tested for suspected MERS-CoV; of these, 11 ICU patients (10%) met the definition of confirmed or probable cases. Three of these patients were part of a health care-associated cluster that also included 3 HCWs. One HCW became critically ill and was the 12th patient in this case series. Median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 28 (range, 16 to 36). All 12 patients had underlying comorbid conditions and presented with acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Most patients (92%) had extrapulmonary manifestations, including shock, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. Five (42%) were alive at day 90. Of the 520 exposed HCWs, only 4 (1%) were positive. LIMITATION The sample size was small. CONCLUSION MERS-CoV causes severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and considerable extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and is associated with high mortality. Community-acquired and health care-associated MERS-CoV infection occurs in patients with chronic comorbid conditions. The health care-associated cluster suggests that human-to-human transmission does occur with unprotected exposure.

The protective effect of the different preparations of influenza vaccines in patients with cancer has not been widely investigated, especially in adult patients harboring solid tumors. The optimal timing for administration of influenza vaccines in patients receiving chemotherapy is also not clearly defined.

Some associations switch directions when comparing different periods. Even population density, which presumably should always increase viral spread, at some periods seems to decrease spread rates. We also observed systematic inversions between spread rates estimated at 80C100 day intervals. These patterns remain unexplained and suggest difficulties in managing and predicting the pandemic, in particular, negative correlations between population density and spread rates, which were observed in independent samples and at different periods. Putatively, confinements could produce these patterns, by selecting viral strains with longer contagiousness and/or latent periods. ABSTRACT: We present spread parameters for first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic for USA states, and for consecutive nonoverlapping periods of 20 days for the USA and 51 countries across the globe. We studied spread rates in the USA states and 51 countries, and analyzed associations between spread rates at different periods, and with temperature, elevation, population density and age. USA first/second wave spread rates increase/decrease with population density, and are uncorrelated with temperature and median population age. Spread rates are systematically inversely proportional to those estimated 80C100 days later. Ascending/descending phases of the same wave only partially explain this. Directions of correlations with factors such as temperature and median age flip. Changes in environmental trends of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unpredictable; predictions based on classical epidemiological knowledge are highly uncertain. Negative associations between population density and spread rates, observed in independent samples and at different periods, are most surprising. We suggest that systematic negative associations between spread rates 80C100 days apart could result from confinements selecting for greater contagiousness, a potential double-edged sword effect of confinements.","output":"Unpredictable, Counter-Intuitive Geoclimatic and Demographic Correlations of COVID-19 Spread Rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has altered the shape of medicine, making in-person interactions risky for both patients and health care workers.

In this essay, we demonstrate how this has played out in prenatal care, as well as in other aspects of medical care, during the pandemic. The extent to which these changes will persist beyond the most emergent phases of the pandemic is not clear, though insurance reimbursement practices and patient expectations will be determining factors.

These complications can be the result of serious conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), peptic ulcers, and recently COVID-19. Limited liver and kidney function leads to increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) within the body resulting in elevated levels of ammonia in the mouth, nose, and skin. Similarly, peptic ulcers, commonly from H. pylori, result in ammonia production from urea within the stomach. The presence of these biomarkers enables a potential screening protocol to be considered for frequent, non-invasive monitoring of these conditions. Unfortunately, detection of ammonia in these mediums is rather challenging due to relatively small concentrations and an abundance of interferents. Currently, there are no options available for non-invasive screening of these conditions continuously and in real-time. Here we demonstrate the selective detection of ammonia using a vapor phase thermodynamic sensing platform capable of being employed as part of a health screening protocol. The results show that our detection system has the remarkable ability to selectively detect trace levels of ammonia in the vapor phase using a single catalyst. Additionally, detection was demonstrated in the presence of interferents such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetone common in human breath.

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients.

This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens. Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients.

METHODS From October 2013 till February 2014, 54 consecutive uniportal VATS lobectomy were performed in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University. Patients' clinical features and operative details were recorded. Post-operatively, the morbidity and mortality were recorded to analyze the safety and efficacy of uniportal VATS lobectomy for NSCLCs. RESULTS Among the 54 planned uniportal VATS lobectomy, there was one conversion to mini-thoracotomy due to lymph node sticking. Extra ports were required in two patients. The uniportal VATS lobectomy was achieved in 51 out of 54 patients (94.4%). The average operation duration was 122.237.5 min (90-160 min).

While IL6 levels were lower in SARS-CoV-2(+) children as compared to adult patients, the expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN and TNF directly correlated with early age infection and symptoms. Th and B cell subsets were modified during pediatric infection differently with respect to adult patients and controls and within the pediatric group based on age. Low levels of IgD(?) CD27(+) memory B cells correlated with absent/mild symptoms. On the contrary, high levels of FoxP3(+)/CD25(high) T-Regs associated with a moderateCsevere clinical course in the childhood. These T and B cells subsets did not associate with severity in infected adults, with children showing a predominant expansion of immature B lymphocytes and natural regulatory T cells. This study shows differences in immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children compared with adults. Moreover, these data could provide information that can drive vaccination endpoints for children.","output":"Immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Focus on T Regulatory and B Cell Responses in Children Compared with Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Therefore, relevant research metrics would be an added value for understanding the virus for researchers. Methods: Research outputs related to the Coronavirus were retrieved from the Web of Science database from January 1968 to March 2020 and were analyzed using MS-office, Word Cloud generator, VOS viewer, and ArcGIS software. The analysis was based on the number of research publications per year, contributing authors clustering pattern, most preferred journals, leading publication, document type, broad research areas, commonly used keywords, the geographical distribution of publications, commonly used languages, and productive institutes. Results: The search retrieved 6424 Coronavirus research publications. The number of articles found in the year 1968 was 1, but it was 275 in 2019. A total of 33 clusters of authors contributed to studies on COVID-19 across the globe. The Journal of Virology had the most productivityon Coronavirus publications (n=810). An article published by Ksiazek TG et al in the New England Journal of Medicine had the maximum citation (n=2175); 90% of the research outputs were articles, broadly classified under Infectious diseases (n=5341); and the most commonly used keyword was Coronavirus. The higher number of publications was from the USA (n=2345) and the commonly used language was English (n=5948), and the most productive institute was the University of Hong Kong (n=506).

During the past decade, significant progresses have been made to characterize PRRs such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TLR- and RLR-mediated signaling. To avoid excessive and harmful immune effects caused by over-activation of these signaling pathways, host cells adopt a number of strategies to regulate them. In addition, invading viruses also employ a variety of mechanisms to inhibit the production of type I IFNs, thereby evading the supervision and clearance by the host.

Methods: 102 subjects were enrolled in the study. Blood serum samples were collected from each patient upon admission for the semiquantitative determination of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG S levels with lateral flow assays. Factors influencing vaccine responses were documented. Results: 27 subjects had a negative antibody test upon hospital admission. Out of the 102 patients admitted to the hospital, 88 were discharged and 14 died. Both the absence of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19 disease were associated with older age, lower Ct values, and a shorter period between symptom onset and hospital admission. Ct values and time between symptom onset and hospitalization were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG S responses upon admission.

Such a fine-grained vulnerability map identifies early on high-risk areas, helping to reduce the spread of the disease. To mitigate data bias from each self-reporting app, an adaptive worker selection algorithm that leverages neighbouring datasets to obtain a balanced data distribution is proposed.

Thus, we will specifically focus on septic patients in this study to compare the effects of saline and balanced solution. We hypothesize that effects of saline on renal outcomes are related to the underline acute kidney injury (AKI) severity and total volumes of infusion. METHODS/DESIGN: The investigators designed a pragmatic, multi-center parallel controlled trial recruiting 312 patients who are diagnosed with sepsis/septic shock in the intensive care unit (ICU) and will be assigned with either acetate Ringers solution or saline in the corresponding month. Patients with an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or who need renal replacement therapy (RRT) prior to or at the time of enrolment are excluded. Enrolled patients will be regarded as with mild, moderate, or severe sepsis on the basis of the severity of their illness and will be divided into subgroups according to their initial renal function and various intravenous infusion volumes when being analyzed. The primary outcome is major adverse kidney events within 28 days (MAKE28), including the composite of in-hospital death, receipt of new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction. Secondary outcomes include 28-day mortality, internal environment disturbance, incidence and duration of vasoactive drug treatment, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of RRT, and ICU and hospital length of stay. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to focus on septic patients and provide credible and evident data on the comparison of outcome between acetate Ringers solution and saline for intravenous infusion in adult septic patients on the basis of baseline renal function and infusion volumes taken into consideration.

PURPOSE: To analyze Koreas response to COVID-19 in 2020 and develop a logic model to evaluate performance effectiveness in follow-up studies. METHODS: By content analysis of Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) press releases, we defined the problems and identified the causes of the health and social effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. Next, we created a problem tree and developed a logic model that comprised inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Finally, we held expert consultations to obtain expert opinions regarding the logic model and to ensure the models validity.

Some patients develop sudden refractory hypercapnia and hypoxemia not explained by worsening pulmonary parenchymal disease. This case series highlights clinical findings and management of coronavirus disease 2019 patients with refractory hypercapnia despite maximal/optimal ventilatory support. Hypercapnia could not be explained by worsening lung disease or other common factors, and thus, a pulmonary vascular etiology was suggested. The pillars of management were targeted to improve pulmonary vascular patency via aggressive anticoagulation and support right ventricular function. DATA SOURCES: Four consecutive patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 infection with sudden hypercapnia and hypoxemia were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: There was sequential development of: 1) severe hypercapnia attributable to marked elevation of dead space without radiographic changes; 2) concomitant coagulopathy manifest by an increase in d-dimer levels; 3) progressive shunt with consequent hypoxemia; and 4) right ventricular dysfunction. Management included extracorporeal Co(2) removal, direct thrombin inhibition, pulmonary vasodilators, and inotropic support. Marked improvement in Pao(2) allowed reduction in Fio(2) in all patients, extracorporeal Co(2) removal was discontinued in three patients over the ensuing 3 weeks, and one patient was discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that thromboinflammation with pulmonary microvasculature occlusion leads to a sudden increase in dead space and shunt resulting in severe hypercapnia and hypoxemia in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Early identification of these physiologic and clinical biomarkers could trigger the institution of therapies aiming to reverse the hypercoagulable state and support right ventricular function.","output":"Increased Dead Space Ventilation and Refractory Hypercapnia in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Potential Marker of Thrombosis in the Pulmonary Vasculature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays an important role on the overall economic conditions of host countries, particularly the ones that are still in low developmental stages.

SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population- and registry-based study during 2020. The comparator was the number of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The outcome was the change in number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. RESULTS: The average monthly percent change after the initial lockdown measures were introduced was -11.0% (95% confidence interval - 22.0% to 1.5%), resulting in a 24% reduction of the newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during April, May, and June compared with the same period of 2019. However, during 2020, only 1% fewer new cases were detected than in 2019, or 6% fewer than what would be expected based on the linear trend during 2017-2019. CONCLUSION: It seems that national health care system measures for controlling the spread of COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in Croatia during the first lockdown. As it is not plausible to expect an epidemiological change to occur at the same time, this may result in later diagnosis, later initiation of treatment, and less favorable outcomes in the future. However, the effect weakened after the first lockdown and COVID-19 control measures were relaxed, and it has not reoccurred during the second COVID-19 wave. Although the COVID-19 lockdown affected the number of newly diagnosed breast cancers, the oncology health care system has shown resilience and compensated for these effects by the end of 2020.

Several severe outbreaks in developing nations in recent years have highlighted the reduction in HAV endemicity, which increases the risk of infections in the vulnerable population. The current HAV vaccines are based on growing wildtype or attenuated virus in cell culture, which raises the cost of production. For generation of cheaper, subunit vaccines or strategies for antibody-based diagnostics, production of viral structural proteins in recombinant form in easily accessible expression systems is a priority. RESULTS: We attempted several strategies for recombinant production of one of the major capsid proteins VP1, from HAV, in the E. coli expression system. Several efforts resulted in the formation of soluble aggregates or tight association of VP1 with the bacterial chaperone GroEL. Correctly folded VP1 was eventually generated in a discrete oligomeric form upon purification of the protein from inclusion bodies and refolding. The oligomers resemble oligomers of capsid proteins from other picornaviruses and appear to have the correct secondary and antigenic surface structure.

OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2.

PARTICIPANTS: Mothers of 1644 children with neural tube defects (NTDs), 15 110 with non-NTDs, and 10 671 control children without a birth defect diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ORs and 95% CIs. RESULTS: For NTD analysis, 1.7% of mothers of case children and 1.2% of mothers of control children reported using DM alone, 1.1% and 0.6% GG alone, and 0.4% and 0.2% DM +GG. Respective percentages for non-NTD analysis were 2.2% and 1.9% for DM alone, 1.7% and 1.6% for GG alone, and 0.5% and 0.4% for DM +GG. For all NTDs and subtypes, adjusted OR estimates for DM alone were near the null with 95% CIs that included 1.0. Estimates (95% CI) were 1.8 (1.0 to 3.3) for GG alone and 1.8 (0.6 to 4.8) for DM +GG with all NTDs and 2.2 (1.1 to 4.3) for GG alone with spina bifida. Of the 45 adjusted OR estimates for non-NTDs, 39 ranged from 0.5 to 1.6 with 95% CIs that included 1.0. Near twofold or higher estimates (95% CI) were observed for the remainder and included 1.9 (1.0 to 3.7) for hydrocephalus, 2.9 (1.3 to 6.5) for atrioventricular septal defect and 1.8 (1.1 to 3.0) for transverse limb deficiency with DM alone; 2.1 (1.1 to 4.0) for small intestinal atresia/stenosis and 2.1 (0.9 to 4.5) for omphalocele with GG alone; and 3.2 (1.5 to 6.9) for gastroschisis with DM +GG.

This reveals that a high EPU is associated with adverse effects on households, corporations, and governments, which tend to delay many financial decisions under high uncertainty, which leads to lower consumption, fewer issuances of debt, fewer investments, and higher unemployment. The effects of political and regulatory uncertainty also extend to the commodity markets, such as the adverse effects on both oil and gasoline markets, and can potentially create adverse impacts on the crypto\\\\currency market and its potential growth. We demonstrate that governmental uncertainty also affects financial, housing, and equity markets; debt issuances; and the entire economy. This underscores the importance of considering EPU as a risk factor. The association with several components of the global economy reflects not only the EPU index's critical influence, but also the importance of risk management.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the occupational satisfaction during the pandemic of Covid-19 among the nurses in Israel, to shed light on conditions of work and to identify factors associated with low occupational satisfaction. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 130 Israeli nurses. Minnesota Satisfaction and Measure of Job Satisfaction questionnaire with 28 items was used to assess occupational satisfaction. RESULTS: In the multivariable model, nurses working in the community had higher occupational satisfaction than those working in hospitals ( = 0.24, p = .032); nurses who took care of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 had significantly lower occupational satisfaction than others ( = ?0.48, p = .009). Most of the sample reported lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses who experienced lack of PPE reported lower occupational satisfaction than those who did not (3.4 vs. 3.8, p = .039). Occupational satisfaction was mainly based on the component, built by the intrinsic characteristics of the occupation related to the personal accomplishment. Most of nurses had to increase their workload as a result of staff shortages, but the elevation of the workload was not associated with lower occupational satisfaction.

This study used the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model as the conceptual model to investigate the mutual effects of perceived spiritual needs on the quality of life in patients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers after being admitted to hospice. This cross-sectional study used the baseline data of a large clinical trial and identified that patients with cancer and their family caregivers perceived similar spiritual needs associated with the community and outlook needs and had fewer unmet spiritual needs. After controlling for partner effects, perceived outlook needs shown in patients significantly predicted their own functional well-being and social/spiritual well-being. Outlook and community needs perceived by family caregivers also significantly predicted their own mental health.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demographic and clinical profile of new idiopathic scoliosis (IS) patients, with a particular focus on treatment and late referral. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The COVID-19 pandemic has limited health-care services and public access and, as a result, the diagnosis and management of non-COVID-19 health conditions have been compromised. Delayed diagnosis of IS may limit conservative treatment options and subsequently, increase a patients risk of requiring surgical intervention. METHODS: The volume of spine referrals received and new IS clinic visits were compared between March 15COctober 15, 2019 and the same period in 2020. A chart and radiographic review detailed the patient profile at initial presentation. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses examined the referral source, curve magnitude, skeletal maturity, and prescribed treatment. Late referrals were those with a curve magnitude  50, or > 40 and Risser 2 or less. RESULTS: During the 2020 study period, the referral volume decreased 76% and clinic visits 55%. The 2019 cohort was similar in age (13.7  2.1 years vs 13.3  2.3 years, p = 0.08), Risser score distribution (p = 0.32), menarchal status (0.07), and curve magnitude (37.1  3.8 vs 39.0  16.0, p = 0.22). During the pandemic, there was an increased proportion of referrals made by pediatricians (41 to 54%, p = 0.01). The proportion of brace prescriptions increased from 30 to 42% (p = 0.01). The proportion of surgical bookings and late referrals were increased but did not reach significance. CONCLUSION: Despite no significant increase in the magnitude of the curve at initial presentation or the proportion of late referrals, there was a marked decrease in referral volume, over the first 7 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests that the majority of expected new IS patients remain undiagnosed. A future increase in late referrals should be anticipated.

Individuals who are symptomatic/asymptomatic or have recovered are reported to have/will have serious health complications in the future, which is going to be huge economic burden globally. Given the wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test each and every individual for the same and isolate them. Recent reports have shown that sewage can be used as a holistic approach to estimate the epidemiology of the virus. Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India which is populated with nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR method. Based on the average viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (in a window of 35 days) is about 6.6% of the population, which clearly indicates the rate of community transmission and asymptomatic carriers is higher than the number of reported cases. It is important to note here that the samples collected from the inlet of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative indicating the efficient treatment of sewage at STPs.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of grip strength measurement at admission for predicting disease severity in COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic data, smoking status, comorbidities, COVID-19 related symptoms, grip strength, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings at admission were all noted. Using a Smedley hand dynamometer, the maximum grip strength value (kg) after three measurements on the dominant side was recorded. Low grip strength was defined as two standard deviations below the gender-specific peak mean value of the healthy young adults (<32 kg for males, <19 kg for females). Patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical and CT findings. Severe illness group had pneumonia with a respiratory rate >30/min, oxygen saturation &#8804;90%, or extensive lung involvement in CT. Moderate illness group had pneumonia with CT score &#8804;11. Mild illness group had normal CT findings. RESULTS: The study population included 312 patients (140 F, 172 M). The distribution of mild, moderate and severe disease groups were 36.9%, 51.0% and 12.2%, respectively. Cough, fever, dyspnea, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were most frequent, and C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophil levels were highest in the severe group (all p<.05). Absolute grip strength values were lowest and the frequency of having low grip strength were highest in the severe group (both p<.01). Since we found that the significant differences were stemming from the severe group, we combined the mild and moderate group as non-severe, and compared severe vs. non-severe groups with binary logistic regression analyses. When age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, presence of comorbidities and low grip strength, and abnormal laboratory findings were taken into analyses; age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.054 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.020-1.089]), obesity (OR: 2.822 [95% CI: 1.143-6.966]), COPD (OR: 5.699 [95 %CI: 1.231-26.383]), CRP level (OR: 1.023 [95% CI: 1.010-1.036]) and low grip strength (OR: 3.047 [95% CI: 1.146-8.103]) were observed to be independent predictors for severe COVID-19 disease (all p<.05).

F.alocis is a synergist of such a key pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, as well as a frequent satellite of Fusobacterium nucleatum and, somewhat less frequently, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. F.alocis is practically not found in healthy people (except for smokers), with a high frequency accompanies the aggressive course of periodontal disease, and also recorded in endodontitis. Due to the ability to participate in the metabolism of arginine, expressed protease activity, a wide range of virulence factors, F.alocis not only colonizes the periodontal tissues, but also significantly affects the formation of the community of periodontal microorganisms (including viruses), contributing to their invasion of epithelial tissues. F. alocis has a number of unique properties, including resistance to oxidative stress conditions in the home defeat, induction of apoptosis of epithelial cells, extracellular matrix degradation of periodontal tissues, activation of proinflammatory cytokines formulation in sites of its presence, suppression of protective reactions of neutrophilic granulocytes, inhibition of the process of complement activation.","output":"[Filifactor alocis and its role in the etiology of chronic periodontitis]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented pressure on health systems and economies worldwide. Delivery services have grown as an alternative source of revenue for many people. Consumers generally perceive that delivery services are safer than going into a restaurant, because they reduce exposure to other people and their risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion. There are no studies analyzing viral load or the burden of COID-19 within this population. This study aims to describe the presence of SARS-CoV-2 among food delivery riders in the city of Quito, Ecuador. STUDY DESIGN: From July and August 2020, bike and motorbike riders self-employed in two of the main online delivery services in Quito, Ecuador, were invited for RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the compulsory lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-qPCR Diagnostic Panel was used to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. All samples were processed in the BSL2 certified molecular biology laboratory at Universidad de Las Americas. RESULTS: A total of 22 out of 145 delivery workers (15.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The majority of workers were men (n = 138), the average age of male workers was 32 years-old (7.3) and 38 years-old ( 10.6) for females. The presence of mild symptoms was reported in only 9 subjects (6%). The calculated viral load was higher among males with 1.31E+08 copies/mL vs 2.30E+06 in females, although this difference was not statistically significant (p value: 0.68, [CI: -53 to -79]). CONCLUSIONS: The self-employed food delivery riders have a high incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to the national average. It is important to point out that this is the first study of its kind in Latin-American and probably one of the very few in the world. The results emphasize the need for policy makers to look at the pandemic from as many population's sub-groups as possible.

This was not associated with any haemorrhagic complications. Despite exposure to large volumes of blood, the alloimmunisation rate was only 0.027/100 units of red cells. The absence of any iron loading was confirmed by serial Ferriscans, performed over a number of years. However, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease showed evidence of iron loading due to reduced innate haemopoiesis and were subsequently switched to simple transfusions.

In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an involuntary delay in the surgical treatment of rotator cuff disease, creating a natural experiment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and healing of patients who underwent delayed surgical treatment of chronic degenerative RCTs as compared with the nondelayed surgical treatment of RCTs. Methods This was a prospective study of two groups: patients planned to undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between March 16, 2020 and May 1, 2020the end of the ban on elective surgeryand patients who underwent rotator cuff repair starting six weeks after the ban on elective surgery had been lifted. Preoperatively and at six months postoperatively, we collected the Simple Shoulder Test, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and the visual analog scale for pain. We also obtained magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at six months postoperatively. A power analysis was conducted, and assuming a mean  standard deviation ASES score of 93.1  13.9 points and a minimum clinically important difference in the ASES score of 27.1 points, 7 patients per group (14 patients in total) would be necessary to have 90% chance of finding a difference. Results We included 15 patients within each group and obtained 100% follow-up at six months. In the delay group, the mean  standard deviation delay was 63  24 days. There were no significant preoperative differences between groups in demographics or tear characteristics. Intraoperatively, there were no differences between groups in repair characteristics. Using a repeated-measures analysis of variance, there were significant preoperative vs. postoperative differences in ASES scores (P < .001), visual analog scale scores (P < .001), and Simple Shoulder Test scores (P < .001), but no differences between groups (P = .910, .519, and 0.852, respectively). On MRI, within the delay group, 58% had healed, whereas within the control group, 85% had healed (P = .202). Conclusion COVID-19 caused a two-month delay in the operative treatment of RCTs. This delay did not significantly alter patient-reported outcomes. This delay resulted in a 27% difference in MRI healing rates, which was not statistically significant in this small study.

METHODS: Recommendations by Levac et al. (2010) and PRISMA-ScR were followed in the conduct and reporting of this review, respectively. Patients and exercise professionals participated in developing the research question and data extraction form, interpreting the findings, and drafting the manuscript.

The inclusion criteria were (a) original peer-reviewed articles and grey literature, (b) intervention study design, and (c) behavioural interventions targeted towards improving strength training participation. Two reviewers performed data screening, extraction, and coding. The interventions were coded using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy version 1. Data were synthesized using descriptive and frequency reporting. RESULTS: Twenty-seven unique interventions met the inclusion criteria. Social cognitive theory (n = 9), the transtheoretical model (n = 4), and self-determination theory (n = 2) were the only behaviour change theories used. Almost all the interventions were delivered face-to-face (n = 25), with the majority delivered by an exercise specialist (n = 23) in community or home settings (n = 24), with high variability in exercise prescription parameters.

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma have an aggressive clinical course, but cardiac involvement is very rare. In our patients case, pericardial involvement was observed after treatment and scanning revealed that recurrence took place in an area different from the pericardium. Cooperation of clinicians and pathologists and rapid evaluation are very important in cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma relapse. Although a tumoral invasion of the pericardium mostly suggests secondary malignancies, it should be kept in mind that recurrence of lymphoma is also possible.","output":"Recurrence of lymphoma with isolated pericardial mass: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: Beside socio-economic issues, coronavirus pandemic COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a deep impact in the scientific community, that has considerably increased its effort to discover the infection strategies of the new virus. Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. RESULTS: We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks, and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.","output":"Alignment of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks by integer linear programming: SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who developed pneumatosis intestinalis (PI).

With limited diagnostic test resources, the early detection of symptoms and their specificity for Covid-19 are of great importance, so that a better understanding of their characteristics is necessary. Material and methods As part of secondary prophylaxis, employees (n = 1734) from retirement and nursing homes were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and asked about subjective restrictions on the sense of smell and any nasal co-symptoms. In addition, patients (n = 41) after confirmed and healed Covid-19 infection were questioned and examined with regard to hyp-/anosmia using a questionnaire and olfactory testing (Sniffin 'sticks with SDI rating). Results Approx. 1% of the employees surveyed reported subjective hyposmia. Acute hyposmias were accompanied by nasal obstruction, chronic hyposmias showed no co-symptoms. In the patients after Covid-19 infections, the identification (Imed = 14) and the discrimination (Dmed = 12) of the odors were only slightly limited, but there was a persistent pathologically increased threshold value for odor perception (Smed = 1.75) in the median 75 days after the onset of infection. Discussion Acute hyp-/anosmia without nasal co-symptoms rarely occurs in the SARS-CoV-2 negative population, so that its occurrence is currently suspicious of a Covid-19 infection and should be examined further e.g. via nasopharyngeal swab. In the further course the odor restrictions can regress again, the different odor qualities seem to do this with different latencies, whereby the increased odor threshold persists the longest.","output":"Characteristics of hyp- and anosmia in the context of Covid-19 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To provide advanced practice nurses (APNs) with information necessary to participate in pandemic influenza planning and response.

Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of international travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research to 13 November 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID-19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. MAIN RESULTS Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel (31 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low-certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID-19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. There was very low-certainty evidence that cross-border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID-19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) Screening measures covered symptom/exposure-based screening or test-based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. For symptom/exposure-based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low-certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. For test-based screening, one modelling study provided very low-certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low-certainty evidence). Quarantine (12 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low-certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low-certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure-based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel-related control measures from a societal perspective.","output":"International travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Domestic violence and gender-based violence has been studied and recognised for many years in Greece.

Whether maternal infection causes changes in the transfer of immunity to infants remains unclear. Maternal infections have previously been associated with compromised placental antibody transfer, but the mechanism underlying this compromised transfer is not established. Here, we used systems serology to characterize the Fc-profile of influenza-, pertussis-, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies transferred across the placenta. Influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies were actively transferred. However, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer was significantly reduced compared to influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and cord titers and functional activity were lower than in maternal plasma. This effect was only observed in third trimester infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to altered SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profiles and was partially rescued by infection-induced increases in IgG and increased FCGR3A placental expression.

For example, at the beginning of 2020, the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 seriously affected terminal production and increased the short-term pressure of handling at container terminals. Consequently, a large number of containers were stacked at terminals, and the problem of terminal congestion became more serious. To solve the congestion problem of container terminals and ensure the priority dispatch of emergency materials, this study uses the optimized arrival patterns of external trucks and a priority dispatch strategy for emergency materials to establish a bilevel optimization model for container terminals and proposes a chaotic genetic algorithm based on logistic mapping as a solution. Through numerical experiments, the algorithm proposed in this study was compared with the genetic algorithm and adaptive genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that the model and algorithm proposed in this study can effectively reduce the total cost of containers in a terminal while ensuring the priority dispatch of emergency materials, reducing the overlapping part of the time window, optimizing the arrival mode of external trucks, and reducing the waiting time of external trucks, effectively alleviating the terminal congestion problem.

With a diagnostic and educational toolkit that is heavily centred on face-to-face clinical examination, dermatology education has been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Online channel-based messaging apps such as Slack offer an opportunity to engage students in remote, multi-modal collaborative learning by reproducing a classroom environment in the virtual space. OBJECTIVE To determine feasibility, acceptability and proof of concept for an online Slack community in undergraduate dermatology education. METHODS Undergraduate medical students participated in an online classroom for a six-week programme encompassing case-based discussions, seminars and journal clubs. The platform was facilitated by junior doctors (n=10) and patient educators (n=6). Students and faculty completed a post-course evaluation. Students additionally completed a pre- and post-intervention dermatology quiz. Mixed methods analyses included quantitative analyses to explore data trends and qualitative phenomenographic analyses to assimilate key underlying themes. RESULTS Students (n=65) were enrolled to join the platform. The evaluation was completed by students (n=52) from UK universities (n=27). The majority of students (n=27) interacted with the platform as passive observers, with a small group of \\"super-users\\" (n=4). 96% of participants and 100% of faculty described the overall quality of the course as excellent. CONCLUSION A community-based online classroom can act as an enjoyable, acceptable and collaborative means of delivering dermatology education to undergraduate medical students.

The involvement of Google and Apple to support combating a public health emergency fuelled controversy over addressing profit-driven private interests at the expense of public values. Concerns have been raised about the dominant position of US based big tech companies in political decision concerning public values. This research investigates how public values are safeguarded in cooperation with big tech companies in the Austrian contact tracing app Stopp Corona. Contact tracing apps manifest a bigger trend in literature, signifying power dynamics of big tech companies, governments, and civil society in relation to public values. The theoretical foundation of this research form prevailing concepts from Media and Communication Studies (MCS) and Science and Technology Studies (STS) about power dynamics such as the expansion of digital platforms and infrastructures, the political economy of big tech companies, dependencies, and digital platforms and infrastructure governance. The cooperative responsibility framework guides the empirical investigation in four main steps. First steps identify key public values and main stakeholders. The next steps analyse public deliberations on advancing public values and the translation of public values based on the outcome of public deliberations. This research applies a qualitative case study, including document analysis and expert interviews. In total, 52 documents were analysed and six expert interviews conducted. Findings show that key public values at stake concerning Stopp Corona involve data protection and privacy, (cyber-)security and safety, accuracy, voluntariness and consent, accessibility, inclusiveness, transparency, trust, etc. Public deliberations of multiple stakeholders about public values can help to safeguard public values. While an involvement of EU, state, civil society, and science and research can be witnessed in defining and advancing public values, Google and Apple, ultimately, translate the outcome of public deliberations through technological design choices. Therefore, public deliberations require a public-value oriented process which is transparent and involves a strong civil society and science and research community, and a unified EU voice. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Public values and the interests of big tech companies: The case of the Austrian Contact Tracing App Stopp Corona"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is effective for treating Barrett's esophagus (BE) but often involves multiple endoscopy sessions over several months to achieve complete response. OBJECTIVE Identify structural markers that correlate with treatment response by using 3-dimensional (3-D) optical coherence tomography (OCT; 3-D OCT). DESIGN Cross-sectional. SETTING Single teaching hospital. PATIENTS Thirty-three patients, 32 male and 1 female, with short-segment (<3 cm) BE undergoing RFA treatment. INTERVENTION Patients were treated with focal RFA, and 3-D OCT was performed at the gastroesophageal junction before and immediately after the RFA treatment. Patients were re-examined with standard endoscopy 6 to 8 weeks later and had biopsies to rule out BE if not visibly evident. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS The thickness of BE epithelium before RFA and the presence of residual gland-like structures immediately after RFA were determined by using 3-D OCT. The presence of BE at follow-up was assessed endoscopically. RESULTS BE mucosa was significantly thinner in patients who achieved complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia than in patients who did not achieve complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia at follow-up (257  60 m vs 403  86 m; P < .0001). A threshold thickness of 333 m derived from receiver operating characteristic curves corresponded to a 92.3% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and 87.9% accuracy in predicting the presence of BE at follow-up. The presence of OCT-visible glands immediately after RFA also correlated with the presence of residual BE at follow-up (83.3% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 90.6% accuracy). LIMITATIONS Single center, cross-sectional study in which only patients with short-segment BE were examined. CONCLUSION Three-dimensional OCT assessment of BE thickness and residual glands during RFA sessions correlated with treatment response. Three-dimensional OCT may predict responses to RFA or aid in making real-time RFA retreatment decisions in the future.","output":"Structural markers observed with endoscopic 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography correlating with Barrett's esophagus radiofrequency ablation treatment response (with videos)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The addition of hydrogen to anaerobic digesters is an emerging technique for the sustainable upgrading of biogas to biomethane with renewable electricity. However, it is critically dependent on the effective gas-liquid transfer of hydrogen, which is a sparingly soluble gas. Very little is known about the impact of liquid and gas flow and bubble size on gas-liquid transfer during H2 injection in full-scale anaerobic digesters. A computational fluid dynamic model was developed using a two-fluid approach for non-Newtonian liquid in the open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform, OpenFOAM. The newly developed model was validated against published experimental data-sets of a gas-mixed, laboratory-scale anaerobic digester, with good agreement between the numerical and experimental velocity fields. The hydrodynamics of the full-scale in-situ biomethanation system using venturi ejectors for H2 injection was then simulated to investigate gas-liquid dynamics, including gas-liquid mass transfer, at different operational conditions. Gas-liquid mixing is mainly controlled by the gas-plumes interaction, which promotes turbulence at the interaction zone, resulting in increasing gas bubbles mixing with the liquid and the gas-liquid interfacial area. However, beyond the plume interaction zone, the digester had flow short-circuiting and inactive zones. It was found that, due to this short-circuiting behaviour, an increase in gas flow-rate may not be an effective option in reducing inactive zones, although it can increase the gas-liquid interfacial area. Comparative analysis of the impact of gas flow and bubble size indicated that gas flow had a linear effect on both kLa and gas holdup, but that bubble size had a non-linear impact, with higher kLa values achieved at bubble sizes less than 2 mm. Comparison against measured data in the same system indicated the predicted kLa values were at the same level as measured kLa, at a bubble size of 2 mm.","output":"Hydrodynamic analysis of full-scale in-situ biogas upgrading in manure digesters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people globally.

METHODS: We studied spike- and RBD-specific Ig isotypes in convalescent and acute plasma/sera using a multiplex bead assay. We also determined virus neutralization activities in plasma, sera, and purified Ig fractions using a VSV pseudovirus assay. RESULTS: Spike- and RBD-specific IgM, IgG1, and IgA1 were produced by all or nearly all subjects at variable levels and detected early after infection. All samples displayed neutralizing activity.

The presence of skin diseases and exposure to biologics also did not seem to affect clinical outcomes including mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying skin diseases did not appear to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or mortality from COVID-19.

There are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional status on the severity and progress of these lesions. Ageing is also an important risk factor. In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3C4) (Ang-(3C4)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3C4) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.","output":"Angiotensin-(3C4) modulates angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) downregulation in proximal tubule cells due to overweight and undernutrition: implications regarding the severity of renal lesions in Covid-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In general terms, virus replication involves three broad stages which are present in all viruses: initiation of infection, replication and expression of the genome, and the release of mature virions from the infected cell.

A recently introduced \\"Pulse CO-Oximeter\\" (Masimo Rainbow SET(R) Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter, Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA) is intended to additionally monitor noninvasively the fractional carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin content in blood. The purpose of our study was to determine whether hypoxia affects the new device's estimated methemoglobin reading accuracy, and whether the presence of methemoglobin impairs the ability of the Radical-7 and a conventional pulse oximeter (Nonin 9700, Nonin Medical Inc., Plymouth, MN) to detect decreases in Sao2. METHODS Eight and 6 healthy adults were included in 2 study groups, respectively, each fitted with multiple sensors and a radial arterial catheter for blood sampling. In the first group, IV administration of approximately 300 mg sodium nitrite increased subjects' methemoglobin level to a 7% to 8% target and hypoxia was induced to different levels of Sao2 (70%-100%) by varying fractional inspired oxygen. In the second group, 15% methemoglobin at room air and 80% Sao2 were targeted. Pulse CO-oximeter readings were compared with arterial blood values measured using a Radiometer multiwavelength hemoximeter. Pulse CO-oximeter methemoglobin reading performance was analyzed by observing the incidence of meaningful reading errors at the various hypoxia levels. This was used to determine the impact on predictive values for detecting methemoglobinemia. Spo2 reading bias, precision, and root mean square error were evaluated during conditions of elevated methemoglobin. RESULTS Observations spanned 66.2% to 99% Sao2 and 0.6% to 14.4% methemoglobin over the 2 groups (170 blood draws). Masimo methemoglobin reading bias and precision over the full Sao2 span was 7.7% +/- 13.0%. Best accuracy was found in the 95% to 100% Sao2 range (1.9% +/- 2.5%), progressing to its worst in the 70% to 80% range (24.8% +/- 15.6%). Occurrence of methemoglobin readings in error >5% increased over each 5-point decrease in Sao2 (P < 0.05). Masimo Spo2 readings were biased -6.3% +/- 3.0% in the 95% to 100% Sao2 range with 4% to 8.3% methemoglobin. Both the Radical-7 and Nonin 9700 pulse oximeters accurately detected decreases in Sao(2) <90% with 4% to 15% methemoglobin, despite displaying low Spo2 readings when Sao2 was >95%. CONCLUSIONS The Radical-7's methemoglobin readings become progressively more inaccurate as Sao2 decreases <95%, at times overestimating true values by 10% to 40%. Elevated methemoglobin causes the Spo2 readings to underestimate Sao2 similar to conventional 2-wavelength pulse oximeters at high saturation. Spo2 readings from both types of instruments continue to trend downward during the development of hypoxemia (Sao2 <90%) with methemoglobin levels up to 15%.","output":"Accuracy of methemoglobin detection by pulse CO-oximetry during hypoxia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: This study investigated the association between serological biomarkers at hospital admission with the development of long-term post-COVID pain symptoms in previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors. A cohort study including patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 in one urban hospital of Madrid (Spain) during the first wave of the outbreak was conducted. Hospitalisation data, clinical data and eleven serological biomarkers were collected at hospital admission. Participants were scheduled for an individual telephone interview after hospital discharge for collecting data about post-COVID pain symptoms. A total of 412 (mean age: 62, SD: 15 years; 46.1% women) were assessed twice, a mean of 6.8 and 13.2 months after discharge. The prevalence of post-COVID pain symptoms was 42.7% (n=176) and 36.2% (n=149) at 6.8 and 13.2 months after hospital discharge. Patients reporting post-COVID pain exhibited a greater number of COVID-19 associated symptoms at hospital admission, more medical comorbidities, higher lymphocyte count, and lower glucose and creatine kinase (CK) levels (all, P<0.01) than those not reporting post-COVID pain. The multivariate analysis revealed that lower CK and glucose levels were significantly associated, but just explaining 6.9% of the variance of suffering post-COVID pain. In conclusion, the association between serological biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity at hospital admission and the development of post-COVID pain is small. Other factors, e.g., higher number of COVID-19 onset symptoms (higher symptom load) could be more relevant for the development of post-COVID pain. As inflammatory biomarkers were not directly analyzed, they may have stronger predictive strengths for the development of post-COVID pain symptoms.","output":"Serological biomarkers of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission are not related to long-term post-COVID pain symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a transmembrane glycoprotein, is an important part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In the COVID-19 epidemic, it was found to be the receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). ACE2 maintains homeostasis by inhibiting the Ang II-AT1R axis and activating the Ang I (1-7)-MasR axis, protecting against lung, heart and kidney injury. In addition, ACE2 helps transport amino acids across the membrane. ACE2 sheds from the membrane, producing soluble ACE2 (sACE2). Previous studies have pointed out that sACE2 plays a role in the pathology of the disease, but the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. Recent studies have confirmed that sACE2 can also act as the receptor of SARS-COV-2, mediating viral entry into the cell and then spreading to the infective area. Elevated concentrations of sACE2 are more related to disease. Recombinant human ACE2, an exogenous soluble ACE2, can be used to supplement endogenous ACE2.

Primary endpoint of the study was the primary patency rate at 12 months. Secondary endpoints were 30-day and overall mortality, sustained clinical improvement [ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford category] and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). Follow-up examinations were performed by clinical examination, color duplex ultrasound, and ABI measurement at 12 months. RESULTS Mean length of the 21 lesions in the DEB group was 27.119.2 mm vs 20.011.4 mm for the 25 lesions in the BA group (p=0.508), while the grade of restenosis was 70.4%18.4% and 64.0%16.1% (p=0.255), respectively.

Study design: Children ages 0-22 years with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presenting to urgent care clinics or being hospitalized for confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) were offered enrollment in the MGH Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository. Enrolled children provided nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and/or blood specimens. SARS-CoV-2 viral load, ACE2 RNA levels, and serology for SARS-CoV-2 were quantified. RESULTS: A total of 192 children (mean age 10.2 +/- 7 years) were enrolled. Forty-nine children (26%) were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; an additional 18 children (9%) met criteria for MIS-C. Only 25 (51%) of children with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with fever; symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, if present, were non-specific. Nasopharyngeal viral load was highest in children in the first 2 days of symptoms, significantly higher than hospitalized adults with severe disease (P = .002). Age did not impact viral load, but younger children had lower ACE2 expression (P=0.004). IgM and IgG to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were increased in severe MIS-C (P<0.001), with dysregulated humoral responses observed.

METHODS We collected data of adult GBS patients who were hospitalized from 2009-2018 in all five tertiary healthcare centers in Serbia. The incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and further corrected for the estimated number of patients hospitalized in secondary centers. Mortality rates were also assessed. GBS was considered severe if patients were not able to walk at least 10 meters without assistance. RESULTS 640 GBS patients were registered in tertiary centers in a ten-year period. The proportion of severe cases was 75% at nadir, and 52% on discharge. GBS incidence rate in Serbia was 1.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, and estimated incidence if patients from secondary centers included 1.2 per 100,000. Peak incidence was observed during the sixth decade of life. During the acute phase, 5.6% of GBS patients died, while overall 9.7% of them died during six-month period from disease onset.

Newer research and old experience with other corona-viruses highlighted a probable underlying mechanism of disturbance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that is associ-ated with intrinsic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aimed to describe the intimate connections between the RAS components, the immune system and COVID-19 pathophysiology. METHODS: This non-systematic review article summarizes recent evidence on the relationship between COVID-19 and the RAS. RESULTS: Several studies have indicated that the downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2 may exert a key role for the impairment of immune functions and for COVID-19 patients' outcome. The downregulation may occur by distinct mecha-nisms, particularly: (1) the shedding process induced by SARS-CoV-2 fusion pathway, which reduces the amount of mem-brane-bound ACE2, stimulating more shedding by the high levels of Angiotensin II; (2) the endocytosis of ACE2 receptor with the virus itself and (3) by the interferon inhibition caused by SARS-CoV-2 effects on immune system, which leads to reduction of ACE2 receptor expression. CONCLUSION: Recent research provides evidence of a reduction of the components of the alternative RAS axis, including ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1-7). In contrast, increased levels of Angiotensin II can activate the AT1 receptor in several organs. Consequently, increased inflammation, thrombosis and angiogenesis occur in patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Atten-tion should be paid to the interactions of the RAS and COVID-19, mainly in the context of novel vaccines and proposed medications.","output":"Downregulation of Membrane-bound Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Receptor has a Pivotal Role in COVID-19 Immunopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A solid-phase radioimmunoassay is described for the detection of antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus.

Results: After statistical analysis, it was found that the decrease in TLC, RBC, Hb, HCT, and LDH in Wistar rats after RNB intervention in Group A as compared to that of before RNB intervention, was found to be statistically significant (P=0.001, P=0.002, P=0.001, P=0.039, and P=0.008). On the other hand, an increase was observed in MCV, Urea, Creatinine and ALT values in the Wistar rats after RNB intervention in Group A as compared to that of before RNB intervention and this increase in values was statistically significant (P=0.007, P=0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.038). After RNB intervention in Group B, the increase in MCH, fibrinogen concentration, and monocytes percentage, was found to be statistically significant (P=0.004, P=0.033, and P=0.001) as well as the decrease in PT and APTT was statistically significant (P=0.007and P=0.002). After comparing the Mean Hematobiochemical and coagulation test parameters in the rats of Group A and Group B, after RNB intervention, it was observed that the concentration of Urea, Creatinine, APTT, and D-dimer were less in Group B as compared to that of Group A and this difference was statistically significant(P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.022). Histologically the findings in the lungs of group B were more distortion of lung architecture, most of the alveoli become collapse and make emphysematous changes, more diffuse inflammatory infiltrate within interalveolar septa and around bronchioles as compared to Group A. In the liver of group B rats, the histological findings were mild to moderate distortion of lobular architecture, healthy hepatocytes with more activation of kupffer cells as well as larger and more aggregates of inflammatory cells as compared to group A. Histological findings of kidneys in group A and group B rats were similar to that of control group rats. Conclusion: The results suggest that the RNB is having an immunomodulatory effect. It might be helpful in the restoration of coagulation factors and can help treat the COVID patients. No harmful effects on the lungs, liver, kidney, and spleen were seen. These findings may act as baseline data for planning further clinical trials in human study subjects to evaluate the effects on various comorbidities.","output":"Hematobiocemical and Histopathological Studies on the Effects of Raj Nirwan Bati (a Novel Allovedic Drug) in Wistar Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implementing and monitoring infection prevention and control (IPC) measures at immigration points of entry (PoEs) is key to preventing infections, reducing excessive use of antimicrobials, and tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Both proteins are presumably translated from a single subgenomic RNA. We have identified two translational strategies operating in pr12 gene expression. Internal initiation at the first and the second AUG codon of the pr12 coding sequence results in the synthesis of the 12K protein. In addition the protein is produced as a CP/12K transframe protein by ribosomal frameshifting. For these studies parts of the CP and pr12 coding sequences including the putative frameshift region were introduced into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase gene. Mutational analyses in conjunction with in vitro translation experiments identified a homopolymeric string of four adenosine nucleotides which together with a 3' flanking UGA stop codon were required for efficient frameshifting. The signal AAAAUGA is the first frameshift signal with a shifty stop codon to be analyzed in the eukaryotic system. Substitution of the four consecutive adenosine nucleotides by UUUU increased the efficiency of frameshifting, while substitution by GGGG or CCCC dramatically reduced the synthesis of the transframe protein. Also, UAA and UAG could replace the opal stop codon without effect on the frameshifting event, but mutation of UGA to the sense codon UGG inhibited transframe protein formation. These findings suggest that the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting at the PVM signal is different from the one described by the 'simultaneous slippage' model in that only the string of four adenosine nucleotides represents the slippery sequence involved in a -1 P-site slippage.","output":"The nucleic acid-binding zinc finger protein of potato virus M is translated by internal initiation as well as by ribosomal frameshifting involving a shifty stop codon and a novel mechanism of P-site slippage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ribonucleoprotein bodies are exemplars of membraneless biomolecular condensates that can form via spontaneous or driven phase transitions. The fungal protein Whi3 forms ribonucleoprotein condensates with different RNA molecules, and these condensates are implicated in key processes such as cell-cycle control and generating cell polarity. Whi3 has a modular architecture that includes a Q-rich intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a tandem RNA recognition module. Here, we demonstrate that a 21-residue stretch within the Q-rich IDR has a weak intrinsic preference for forming alpha-helical conformations. Through mutagenesis, we find that increased alpha helicity enhances oligomerization in the dilute phase. One consequence of enhanced oligomerization is a dilution of Whi3 in the dense phase. The opposite behavior is observed when helicity within the 21-residue stretch of the Q-rich region is abrogated. Thus, the formation of dilute phase oligomers, driven by a specific sequence motif and potential synergies with the rest of the IDR, opposes incorporation of the Whi3 protein into the dense phase, thereby altering the dense phase stoichiometry of protein to RNA. Our findings, which stand in contrast to other systems where oligomerization has been shown to enhance the drive for phase separation, point to a mechanism that might be operative for influencing compositions of condensates. Our work also points to routes for designing synthetic ribonucleoprotein condensates whereby modulation of protein oligomerization via homotypic interactions can impact dense phase concentrations, stoichiometries, and material properties.","output":"Dilute phase oligomerization can oppose phase separation and modulate material properties of a ribonucleoprotein condensate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic in early 2020.

The current study examined the relationship between coping strategies and wellbeing and quality of working life in nurses, midwives, allied health professionals, social care workers and social workers who worked in health and social care in the UK during its first wave of COVID-19. Data were collected using an anonymous online survey (N = 3425), and regression analyses were used to examine the associations of coping strategies and demographic characteristics with staff wellbeing and quality of working life. The results showed that positive coping strategies, particularly active coping and help-seeking, were associated with higher wellbeing and better quality of working life. Negative coping strategies, such as avoidance, were risk factors for low wellbeing and worse quality of working life.

Decontamination of PPE could be useful to maintain adequate supplies, but there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of decontamination technologies. METHODS: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70C for 30 minutes. We assessed the decontamination of 3 commercial N95 respirators inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2 and Phi6; the latter is an enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for coronaviruses. Three and 6 log(10) reductions on respirators were considered effective for decontamination and disinfection, respectively. RESULTS: UV-C administered as a 1-minute cycle in a UV-C box or a 30-minute cycle by a room decontamination device reduced contamination but did not meet criteria for decontamination of the viruses from all sites on the N95s. The high-level disinfection cabinet was effective for decontamination of the N95s and achieved disinfection with an extended 31-minute cycle. Dry heat at 70C for 30 minutes was not effective for decontamination of the bacteriophages. CONCLUSIONS: UV-C could be useful to reduce contamination on N95 respirators.

We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials of participants with BPH who underwent TUMT. We used standard Cochrane methods, including a GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence (CoE). RESULTS In this update of a previous Cochrane review, we included 16 trials with 1,919 participants. TUMT probably results in little to no difference in urologic symptom scores at short-term follow-up compared to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). There is likely to be little to no difference in the quality of life. TUMT likely results in fewer major adverse events. TUMT, however, probably results in a large increase in the need for retreatment. There may be little to no difference in erectile function between these interventions. However, TUMT may result in fewer cases of ejaculatory dysfunction compared to TURP. The overall CoE was moderate to low. CONCLUSIONS TUMT provides a similar reduction in urinary symptoms compared to TURP, with fewer major adverse events and fewer cases of ejaculatory dysfunction at short-term follow-up.

The doctors were selected using disproportionate stratified sampling and medical undergraduates using stratified cluster sampling. Data were gathered using a Google form containing socio-demographic details, perception on the pandemic and the General Health Questionnaire-12(GHQ-12). Result There were 468 participants in the study and among them 243(51.9%) were doctors. Mean age of the doctors is 34.54(SD = 7.43) years and more than half (50.06%) were in post graduate training. Majority were worried about their health (65%) and their loved one's health (90.1%).

Prescribing changes were completed on an individually risk assessed basis to reduce attendance at the chemist, specifically to reduce transmission, keep patients in treatment and to ensure chemists could continue to function. We document some of the service changes during the COVID-19 lockdown.MethodService evaluation had approval from Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust. Data retrieved on one Hub of a community addictions service in North England, UK. Patients prescribed opioid substitution treatment for opioid dependence were assessed, with data retrieval through electronic healthcare records. Data were analysed by Microsoft Excel anonymously.ResultIn lockdown (March 2020 to June 2020), we identified 112 patients with opioid dependence prescribed opioid substitution (OST) with methadone or buprenorphine at the Hub. All white British, mean 42 years, most male (75%) and prescribed methadone (78%). Ten were new starts and 8 restarts to OST. Attendance rates did not change: 91% before and 92% during lockdown.

Our results show that the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 nW/(cm*cm*sr), respectively. We found that the Number Of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness, after the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for the whole country, with cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on people's daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of China has improved with the reduction of non-essential industries and motor vehicle usage.","output":"Spatiotemporal Patterns of COVID-19 Impact on Human Activities and Environment in China Using Nighttime Light and Air Quality Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After detection of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iran, the National Committee on COVID-19 Epidemiology in Ministry of Health and Medical Education was established.

During their replication cycle, viral RNA intermediates can be recognized and degraded by different antiviral mechanisms that include RNA decay, RNA interference, and RNase L pathways. As a consequence of viral RNA degradation, infected cells can accumulate virus\\\\derived small RNAs at high levels compared to cellular molecules. These small RNAs are imprinted with molecular characteristics that reflect their origin. First, small RNAs can be used to reconstruct viral sequences and identify the virus from which they originated. Second, other molecular features of small RNAs such as size, polarity, and base preferences depend on the type of viral substrate and host mechanism of degradation. Thus, the pattern of small RNAs generated in infected cells can be used as a molecular footprint to identify and characterize viruses independent on sequence homology searches against known references. Hence, sequencing of small RNAs obtained from infected cells enables virus discovery and characterization using both sequence\\\\dependent strategies and novel pattern\\\\based approaches.

Triage, an effective solution proposed in disaster medicine, also works well to manage Emergency Department (ED) flow. The aim of this study was to describe the role of an ED Triage Center for patients with suspected novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and characterize the patient flow. METHODS: In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Lige University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms. In 82.00% of the cases, no risk factor of virus transmission was found. The SARS-Cov2 positive patients represented 29.26% of the screened patients. 83.00% of patients were discharged home while 17.00% were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that triage centers for the assessment and management of Covid-19 suspected patients is an essential key strategy to prevent the spread of the disease among non-symptomatic patients who present to the EDs for care. This allows for a disease-centered work-up and safer diversion of Covid-19 patients to specific hospital units.","output":"Immersion in an emergency department triage center during the Covid-19 outbreak: first report of the Lige University hospital experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Dengue infection is the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. One of the complications of dengue is dehydration which, if not carefully monitored and treated, may lead to shock, particularly in those with dengue haemorrhagic fever. WHO has recommended oral fluid intake of five glasses or more for adults who are suspected to have dengue fever. However, there have been no published studies looking at self-care intervention measures to improve oral fluid intake among patients suspected of dengue fever. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using a fluid chart to improve oral fluid intake in patients with suspected dengue fever in a primary care setting. METHODS: This feasibility study used a randomized controlled study design. The data was collected over two months at a primary care clinic in a teaching hospital. The inclusion criteria were: age > 12 years, patients who were suspected to have dengue fever based on the assessment by the primary healthcare clinician, fever for > three days, and thrombocytopenia (platelets < 150 x 10(9)/L). Both groups received a dengue home care card. The intervention group received the fluid chart and a cup (200ml). Baseline clinical and laboratory data, 24-hour fluid recall (control group), and fluid chart were collected. The main outcomes were: hospitalization rates, intravenous fluid requirement and total oral fluid intake. FINDINGS: Among the 138 participants who were included in the final analysis, there were fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group (n = 7, 10.0%) than the control group (n = 12, 17.6%) (p = 0.192). Similarly, fewer patients (n = 9, 12.9%) in the intervention group required intravenous fluid compared to the control group (n = 15, 22.1%), (p = 0.154). There was an increase in the amount of daily oral fluid intake in the intervention group (about 3,000 ml) compared to the control group (about 2,500 ml, p = 0.521). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This is a feasible and acceptable study to perform in a primary care setting. The fluid chart is a simple, inexpensive tool that may reduce hospitalization and intravenous fluid requirement in suspected dengue patients. A randomized controlled trial with larger sample size is needed to determine this conclusively.

Methods & Materials The working strategy developed in the municipality of Valencia consisted of monitoring wastewater effluents collected by 790,000 people. The city was divided into 24 different hydraulic sectors. 3,023 samples of untreated wastewater were collected and analysed between May 2020 and May 2021. RNA extraction from sewage material was carried out using the NucleoSpin RNA virus Kit. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed by RT-qPCR using One-Step PrimeScript? RT-PCR Kit (Perfect Real Time), targeting the nucleoprotein (N), N1 and N2 fragments, and envelope protein (E) gene. Mengovirus RNA recovery rates were used as quality assurance parameters according to ISO 15216-1:2017. Results A total of 2,169 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA material. SARS-CoV-2 variations were detected throughout the entire study evidencing trends during the first, second and third wave. As the National State of Emergency ended (June 2020), SARS-CoV-2 values began to increase reaching the first and most significant concentration spike of the study (20th-26th of July 2020), with a weekly average aggregate concentration of 34,5M GC/L (an increase of 2 units in the log scale). This translated in the worsening of epidemiological indicators (number of cases, hospitalizations, deaths and cumulative incidence (CI)), which maintained a stable increase until a second spike was detected during an important bank holiday in October (9th-12th), where the concentration changed from 28M GC/L to 345M GC/L in a 3-day period while the city was registering 1,100 new weekly cases and a CI of 200 cases/100,000 residents. Finally, a third wave placed Valencia with the worst historical epidemiological data (6,545 new cases; 1,000 new hospitalizations; CI= 1,318,04 cases/100,000 inhabitants) with a weekly SARS-CoV-2 average aggregate concentration of 967M GC/L, leading health officials to implement new restrictive measures. Conclusion Wastewater surveillance could be used as a complimentary tool to estimate the presence and prevalence of COVID-19 in communities and can be used for preventive purposes, as an increasing SARS-CoV-2 trend in wastewater could be a signal of the possible re-emergence of the pandemic.","output":"Implementing a SARS-CoV-2 Early Warning System in Valencia (Spain) and its Correlation with Epidemiological Indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the positive effects of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injection into the neural arborized area, there is no anatomical evidence in the literature regarding the neural arborization of the supraspinatus muscle.

We describe development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine, taking into account the effect of stimulation on its sedative properties. Methods In a two-period, randomized study in 18 healthy volunteers, dexmedetomidine was delivered in a step-up fashion by means of target-controlled infusion using the Dyck model. Volunteers were randomized to a session without background noise and a session with pre-recorded looped operating room background noise. Exploratory pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and covariate analysis were conducted in NONMEM using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring of processed EEG. Results We found that both stimulation at the time of Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale scoring and the presence or absence of ambient noise had an effect on the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine. The stimuli associated with MOAA/S scoring increased the BIS of sedated volunteers because of a transient 170% increase in the effect-site concentration necessary to reach half of the maximal effect. In contrast, volunteers deprived of ambient noise were more resistant to dexmedetomidine and required, on average, 32% higher effect-site concentrations for the same effect as subjects who were exposed to background operating room noise. Conclusions The new pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models might be used for effect-site rather than plasma concentration target-controlled infusion for dexmedetomidine in clinical practice, thereby allowing tighter control over the desired level of sedation.

It is common within large dog populations, such as those in re\\\\homing or training kennels. Vaccines are vital in its management of CIRD, but they often fail to prevent disease. Recently, a number of novel pathogens have been identified in CIRD outbreaks and represent new targets for vaccination. KEY FINDINGS: Innate immune responses provide a vital first line of defence against the infectious agents involved in the development of CIRD. Once breeched, adaptive mucosal immunity is necessary to prevent infection and limit spread. Current vaccines target only a few of the agents involved in CIRD. Evidence, from the limited amount of published data, indicates that although vaccinating against these agents reduces infection rates, duration of shedding and severity of disease, it does not induce sterilising immunity; and this has important consequences for the management of the disease, and the future of CIRD vaccine development.

Here, experiments on cGAS deficient (cGAS(-/-)) mice were conducted using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection sepsis models and macrophages. Severity of CLP in cGAS(-/-) mice was less severe than in wildtype (WT) mice, as indicated by mortality, serum LPS, cfDNA, leukopenia, cytokines (TNF-, IL-6 and IL-10), organ histology (lung, liver and kidney) and spleen apoptosis. With the LPS injection model, serum cytokines in cGAS(-/-) mice were lower than in WT mice, despite the similar serum cfDNA level. Likewise, in LPS-activated WT macrophages, the expression of several mitochondria-associated genes (as revealed by RNA sequencing analysis) and a profound reduction in mitochondrial parameters, including maximal respiration (determined by extracellular flux analysis), DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial abundance (revealed by fluorescent staining), were demonstrated. These data implied the impact of cfDNA resulting from LPS-induced cell injury. In parallel, an additive effect of bacterial DNA on LPS, seen in comparison with LPS alone, was demonstrated in WT macrophages, but not in cGAS(-/-) cells, as indicated by supernatant cytokines (TNF- and IL-6), M1 proinflammatory polarization (iNOS and IL-1), cGAS, IFN- and supernatant cyclic GMPCAMP (cGAMP).

Infectious disease specialists, pneumologists and intensivists were not enough to face the enormous amount of patients that needed hospital care; therefore, many doctors have been recruited from other medical specialties trying to take care of as many patients as possible. The 'call to duty' of such doctors for urgent COVID-19 cases, however, diverted the attention from the care of patients with chronic conditions, which might have been neglected or undervalued. In this extremely difficult time, the standard of care of chronic patients has been reduced and this might have determined an increased rate of complications secondary to undermanagement. Thousands of patients with acute and chronic non-COVID-19 conditions have not accessed specialist care in the last weeks in Italy. Moreover, even those patients who have had scheduled an outpatient visit did not attend it for fear of leaving their home or due to the inability to go. During the pandemic, there was a drastic reduction in the number of hospital admissions for any medical conditions different from COVID-19. Self-presentation to the emergency department (ED) has been discouraged and the patients' own fear of being infected by going to the hospital led to also a significant decrease in ED access. During the lockdown, in San Giuseppe Hospital MultiMedica IRCCS, Milan, the ED admissions dropped from the mean of 2361/month in December 2019-February 2020 to 1102 (- 53%) and 861 (- 63%) in March and April 2020, respectively. For all the above-mentioned reasons, it is possible that some clinical conditions will further progress with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. To prevent this, it is essential that patients with chronic conditions should be at least monitored and managed with telephone or online health consultation, identifying those who need urgent access to care, prioritizing outpatient visits based on disease severity. Patients with mild conditions could be managed outside the hospital by implementing telemedicine and creating networks of general practitioners who can consult with in-hospital specialists.","output":"Treat all COVID 19-positive patients, but do not forget those negative with chronic diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To report our short-term and long-term experience with laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) using a bioabsorbable plug.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We used machine learning to conduct exploratory partitioning cluster analysis to identify possible subgroups of sepsis patients who may benefit from early antibiotics. We further tested the influence of several traits within these subgroups, using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: We found a significant interaction between age and benefits of early antibiotics (P = .03). When we adjusted for this interaction and several other confounders, there was a significant benefit of early antibiotic treatment (OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.79; P = .03).

Prior to the procedure, anatomical landmarks, including the thyroid cartilage, crico-thyroid membrane and tracheal rings, were identified using USG. The distance of the trachea from skin was checked and absence of a high innominate artery as well as other vascular anomalies was confirmed with USG. A bronchoscope inserted through the endotracheal tube (ETT) was used to pull the ETT out just distal to the vocal cords. Bronchoscopic visualization was also used to confirm a midline puncture and to avoid puncture of the posterior tracheal wall. After cannulation, the bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheostomy tube to confirm adequate distance from the carina. A post-procedure USG was performed to check for the absence of a pneumothorax. Results:The average BMI of patients was 28 with an average age of 72. 2 patients were therapeutically anticoagulated and three patients were on clopidogrel. 5 patients had COVID 19 ARDS. Accidental decannulation was noted in 2 patients early on in the course and the procedure modified to include sutures through the tracheostomy holder along with a tracheostomy tie, following which there were no recurrences. 1 patient had persistent oozing which needed treatment with lidcoaine with epinephrine.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a 14-month prospective real-world cohort study in which the main risk factor was 2 previous vaccinations with BCG and the main outcome was COVID-19 detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A Cox proportional hazards model was used. Among the 406 included patients, 113 were diagnosed with leprosy. During follow-up, 69 (16.99%) patients contracted COVID-19. Survival analysis showed that leprosy was associated with COVID-19 (p<0.001), but multivariate analysis showed that only COVID-19-positive household contacts (hazard ratio (HR) = 8.04; 95% CI = 4.93C13.11) and diabetes mellitus (HR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.04C4.06) were significant risk factors for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leprosy patients are vulnerable to COVID-19 because they have more frequent contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, possibly due to social and economic limitations. Our model showed that the use of corticosteroids, thalidomide, pentoxifylline, clofazimine, or dapsone or BCG vaccination did not affect the occurrence or severity of COVID-19.","output":"The influence of leprosy-related clinical and epidemiological variables in the occurrence and severity of COVID-19: A prospective real-world cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered a global health emergency and brought disaster to humans. Tremendous efforts have been made to control the pandemic, among which neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are of specific interest to researchers. Neutralizing antibodies are generated within weeks after infection or immunization, and can protect cells from virus intrusion and confer protective immunity to cells. Thus, production of NAbs is considered as a main goal for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines and NAbs may be used for patient treatment in the form of monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization assays are capable of quantitatively detecting NAbs against SARS-CoV-2, allowing to explore the relationship between the level of NAbs and the severity of the disease, and may predict the possibility of re-infection in COVID-19 patients. They can also be used to test the effects of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma and vaccines. At present, wild-type virus neutralization assay remains the gold standard for measuring NAbs;while pseudovirus neutralization assays, Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), and high-throughput versions of neutralization assays are popular alternatives with their own advantages and disadvantages. In this review article, we summarize the characteristics and recent progress of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. Special attention is given to the current limitations of various neutralization assays so as to promote new possible strategies with NAbs by which rapid SARS-CoV-2 serological diagnosis and antiviral screening in the future will be achieved.","output":"Advances in Neutralization Assays for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global emergency and has raised social and economic concerns which will also spill over to environmental issues.

In the Gram-positive model bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, the final maturation steps of the two large ribosomal subunit (50S) rRNAs, 23S and 5S pre-rRNAs, are catalyzed by the double-strand specific ribonucleases (RNases) Mini-RNase III and RNase M5, respectively. Here we present a protocol that allowed us to solve the 3.0 and 3.1 ? resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of these RNases poised to cleave their pre-rRNA substrates within the B. subtilis 50S particle. These data provide the first structural insights into rRNA maturation in bacteria by revealing how these RNases recognize and process double-stranded pre-rRNA. Our structures further uncover how specific ribosomal proteins act as chaperones to correctly fold the pre-rRNA substrates and, for Mini-III, anchor the RNase to the ribosome. These r-proteins thereby serve a quality-control function in the process from accurate ribosome assembly to rRNA processing.","output":"Structures of B. subtilis Maturation RNases Captured on 50S Ribosome with Pre-rRNAs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacomechanical Thrombectomy (PMT) is recognized as a recent advancement in the treatment of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

GlycoGrip utilizes glycopolymers for primary capture and antispike antibodies labeled with gold nanoparticles for signal-generating detection. A lock-step integration between experiment and computation has enabled efficient optimization of GlycoGrip test strips which can selectively, sensitively, and rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in biofluids. Employing the power of the glycocalyx in a diagnostic assay has distinct advantages over conventional immunoassays as glycopolymers can bind to antigens in a multivalent capacity and are highly adaptable for mutated strains. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are identified, GlycoGrip will serve as a highly reconfigurable biosensor for their detection. Additionally, via extensive ensemble-based docking simulations which incorporate protein and glycan motion, we have elucidated important clues as to how heparan sulfate and other glycocalyx components may bind the spike glycoprotein during SARS-CoV-2 host-cell infection. GlycoGrip is a promising and generalizable alternative to costly, labor-intensive RT-PCR, and we envision it will be broadly useful, including for rural or low-income populations that are historically undertested and under-reported in infection statistics.","output":"GlycoGrip: Cell Surface-Inspired Universal Sensor for Betacoronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic Covid-19 is responsible for a major education crisis globally and has a drastic impact on medical training as well.

As uncontrolled early infection may develop into systemic infection and eventually progress to sepsis, it is important to address infection at an early stage. Furthermore, early detection and prompt diagnosis of infection are the basis of clinical intervention. However, as a result of the interference of complex aetiologies, including fever and trauma, problems regarding the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic indices remain, such as for C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophil ratio (NEU%), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D-dimer. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop new biomarkers to diagnose infection. METHODS: From January to October 2021, consecutive patients in the emergency department (ED) were recruited to investigate the feasibility of fibulin-2 as a diagnostic indicator of early infection. Fibulin-2 concentrations in plasma were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The performance of fibulin-2 for predicting infection was analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: We found that the plasma fibulin-2 level was elevated in patients with infection compared with those without infection. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for fibulin-2 was 0.712. For all patients included, the diagnostic ability of fibulin-2 (AUC 0.712) performed as well as CRP (AUC 0.667) and PCT (AUC 0.632), and better than WBC (AUC 0.620), NEU% (AUC 0.619), IL-6 (AUC 0.561) and D-dimer (AUC 0.630). In patients with fever, fibulin-2 performed as well as PCT and better than the other biomarkers in infection diagnosis. In particular, fibulin-2 performed better than all these biomarkers in patients with trauma. CONCLUSION: Fibulin-2 is a novel promising diagnostic biomarker for predicting infection.

Despite the discriminating properties to recognize emotions, the first three methods have been regarded as ineffective as the probability of humans voluntary and involuntary concealing the real emotions can not be ignored. Physiological signals, on the other hand, are capable of providing more objective, and reliable emotion recognition. Based on physiological signals, several methods have been introduced for emotion recognition, yet, predominantly such approaches are invasive involving the placement of on-body sensors. The efficacy and accuracy of these approaches are hindered by the sensor malfunctioning and erroneous data due to human limbs movement. This study presents a non-invasive approach where machine learning complements the impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) signals for emotion recognition. First, the feasibility of using IR-UWB for emotion recognition is analyzed followed by determining the state of emotions into happiness, disgust, and fear. These emotions are triggered using carefully selected video clips to human subjects involving both males and females. The convincing evidence that different breathing patterns are linked with different emotions has been leveraged to discriminate between different emotions. Chest movement of thirty-five subjects is obtained using IR-UWB radar while watching the video clips in solitude. Extensive signal processing is applied to the obtained chest movement signals to estimate respiration rate per minute (RPM). The RPM estimated by the algorithm is validated by repeated measurements by a commercially available Pulse Oximeter. A dataset is maintained comprising gender, RPM, age, and associated emotions which are further used with several machine learning algorithms for automatic recognition of human emotions. Experiments reveal that IR-UWB possesses the potential to differentiate between different human emotions with a decent accuracy of 76% without placing any on-body sensors. Separate analysis for male and female participants reveals that males experience high arousal for happiness while females experience intense fear emotions. For disgust emotion, no large difference is found for male and female participants.

The direct risk to the health of children is low. However, disease-containment measures have society-wide impacts. This study explored the pandemic experiences of parents of children with oesophageal atresia/tracheo-oesophageal fistula (OA/TOF) in the UK. DESIGN: A phenomenological approach underpinned use of an asynchronous online forum method, in collaboration with a patient support group. Data were evaluated using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The online forum ran between 7 November and 18 December 2020 with 109 participants. Pandemic experiences were divided into themes relating to healthcare and disease containment. Participants described positive experiences with remote healthcare but identified limitations. Delays and cancellations led to escalation of care to an emergency level, slower developmental progress and feelings of being abandoned by services. Inpatient care was perceived as safe but caring alone was emotionally and practically challenging. Disease containment themes revealed anxiety regarding health risks, collateral damage to well-being because of isolation, and an impact on finances and employment. Parents described a transition from worry about direct health risks to concern about the impact of isolation on socialisation and development. A process of riskCbenefit analysis led some to transition to a more normal life, while others continued to isolate. Benefits to their childs health from isolation were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Parents experiences of caring for a child with OA/TOF during the pandemic were varied. Rapid adoption of telehealth has demonstrated the enormous potential of remote healthcare delivery but requires refinement to meet the needs of the individual. Future pandemic planning should aim to retain community healthcare services to avoid escalation of care to an emergency, manage chronic and developmental concerns, and support parental well-being.

We previously reported the establishment of spontaneous JEV persistent infection, assisted by defective interfering particle accumulation and/or attenuated helper viruses, in BHK-21 cells devoid of virus-induced apoptosis, cBS6-2 and cBS6-3. However, cell-specific factors may play important roles in controlling JEV replication and have never been assessed for this specific phenomenon. Recent evidence suggests that viruses have evolved various mechanisms to cope with endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways for their efficient amplification and transmission, including the unfolded protein response (UPR). RESULTS: To identify the host cell factors that affect JEV persistence, we investigated the expression of essential UPR factors in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells. Of the selected UPR factors tested, the most noticeable deviations from those of the normal BHK-21 cells with JEV acute infection were as follows: the suppression of C/EBP homologous binding protein (CHOP) and the constant up-regulation of immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP) expression in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells. In JEV acute infection on normal BHK-21 cells, silencing CHOP expression through specific siRNA blocked cell death almost completely. Meanwhile, depletion of BiP by specific siRNA unlocked CHOP expression in cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells, resulting in massive cell death. Fulminant apoptotic cell death for both cell clones on tunicamycin treatment revealed that the JEV persistently infected cells still contained functional arms for cell fate decisions. CONCLUSIONS: BHK-21 cells with JEV persistent infection strive against virus-induced apoptosis through constant up-regulation of BiP expression, resulting in the complete depletion of CHOP even with apparent virus amplification in the cells. Accordingly, the attenuation of virus replication as well as the modifications to cell metabolism could be additional factors contributing to the development of JEV persistent infection in mammalian cells.

Conventional moderate-intensity exercise reduces post-load plasma glucose levels at the acute phase. This study aimed to reveal acute effects of WBVE on post-load glucose metabolism. METHODS: This randomized crossover trial enrolled 18 healthy men. They completed the following three interventions in a random order: (1) a 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) without WBVE (OGTT-alone), (2) 20-minute WBVE before an OGTT (WBVE  OGTT), and (3) 20-minute WBVE during an OGTT (OGTT  WBVE). Post-load glucose metabolism in the WBVE  OGTT and OGTT  WBVE interventions were compared with that in the OGTT-alone intervention. RESULTS: Plasma glucose levels in the WBVE  OGTT and OGTT  WBVE interventions were not significantly different from those in the OGTT-alone intervention at any time point except 15 min, wherein the WBVE  OGTT intervention had higher glucose levels (111 [interquartile range, 102C122] mg/dL vs 122 [111C134] mg/dL, P = 0.026).

The digestive tracts of individuals of this species and sediment samples were examined for plastic particles in this region. In total, 107 plastic particles were found in the sediment. All were fibers and 94.4% were microplastics, the rest were mesoplastics. The gastrointestinal tracts of 142 rays were analysed, and it was determined that this is a benthic feeder. A total of 386 plastic particles were recovered from 46 individuals (32.4%). On average 10.2 (7.4) plastic particles were found per specimen, with plastic lengths ranging from 0.00821 mm to 0.953 mm.

Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a relatively long incubation period, in which individuals experience no symptoms, but may already contribute to the spread. Unable to selectively isolate these invisible spreaders, we resort to population-wide restrictions. However, under the alternating quarantine routine, if an individual was exposed during their active week, by the time they complete their quarantine they will, in most cases, begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the majority of pre-symptomatic individuals during their infectious phase, leading to a rapid decline in the viral spread, thus addressing one of the main challenges in COVID-19 mitigation.","output":"Alternating quarantine for sustainable epidemic mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthy internet activity (eg, making use of eHealth and online therapy) is positively associated with well-being However, unhealthy internet activity (too much online time, problematic internet use/PIU, internet dependency/ID, etc ) is associated with reduced well-being, loneliness, and other related negative aspects While most of the evidence is correlational, some research also shows that internet activity can be predictive for well-being Objective: The aim of this article is to elaborate on the question as to what extent internet activity is predictive of psychological well-being by means of (a) a scoping review and (b) theoretical understanding which model the interrelation of internet activity and psychological well-being Methodology: We searched different electronic databases such as Web of Science by using the search terms Internet OR App OR digital OR online OR mobile application AND Use OR Activity OR Behavior OR Engagement AND Well-being OR Loneliness for (a, the scoping review) or CCAM for (b, the theoretical understanding) Results: The scoping review (a) summarizes recent findings: the extent to which internet activity is predictive for well-being depends on the internet activity itself: internet activity facilitating self-management is beneficial for well-being but too much internet activity, PIU and ID are detrimental to well-being To understand (b) why, when and how internet activity is predictive for well-being, theoretical understanding and a model are required While theories on either well-being or internet activity exist, not many theories take both aspects into account while also considering other behaviors One such theory is the Compensatory Carry-Over Action Model (CCAM) which describes mechanisms on how internet use is related to other lifestyle behaviors and well-being, and that individuals are driven by the goal to adopt and maintain well-being - also called higher-level goals C in the CCAM There are few studies testing the CCAM or selected aspects of it which include internet activity and well-being Results demonstrate the potentials of such a multifactorial, sophisticated approach: it can help to improve health promotion in times of demographic change and in situations of lacking personnel resources in health care systems Conclusion and Recommendation: Suggestions for future research are to employ theoretical approaches like the CCAM and testing intervention effects, as well as supporting individuals in different settings The main aim should be to perform healthy internet activities to support well-being, and to prevent unhealthy internet activity Behavior management and learning should accordingly aim at preventing problematic internet use and internet dependency","output":"To What Extent is Internet Activity Predictive of Psychological Well-Being?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

While COVID-19 related disparities among those with chronic conditions have been observed, research regarding the uptake of COVID-related preventive behaviors is scarce. Methods: We utilized data from a sample of 2190 U.S. adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey to examine associations between the presence of underlying chronic health conditions and COVID-19-related preventive behaviors (e.g., use of face masks, hand washing, social distancing, etc.). We used multivariable logistic regression models to model associations between COVID-19 preventive behaviors across demographic and health characteristics. Results: Adults with cardiometabolic disease were more likely to report staying home because they felt unwell, compared with individuals without cardiometabolic disease. Individuals with underlying respiratory conditions were more likely to work from home, compared with individuals without a respiratory condition. Adults with immune conditions were twice more likely to report wearing a face mask when compared with individuals without immune conditions. Conclusion: This study provides U.S. national prevalence estimates and differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those with and without the presence of underlying chronic health conditions. The prevalence of key preventive measures was high in the overall sample. Yet, engagement in COVID-19-related preventive behaviors varied significantly across chronic disease conditions. Messages around continued maintenance of the behaviors should be reinforced.

Encephalopathy caused by or arising from seizures, especially nonconvulsive seizures (NCS), often requires electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring for diagnosis. The prevalence of seizures and other EEG abnormalities among COVID-19-infected patients is unknown. METHODS Medical records and EEG studies of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infections over a 2-month period at a single US academic health system (four hospitals) were reviewed to describe the distribution of EEG findings including epileptiform abnormalities (seizures, periodic discharges, or nonperiodic epileptiform discharges). Factors including demographics, remote and acute brain injury, prior history of epilepsy, preceding seizures, critical illness severity scores, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were compared to EEG findings to identify predictors of epileptiform EEG abnormalities. RESULTS Of 111 patients monitored, most were male (71%), middle-aged or older (median age 64 years), admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU; 77%), and comatose (70%). Excluding 11 patients monitored after cardiac arrest, the most frequent EEG finding was moderate generalized slowing (57%), but epileptiform findings were observed in 30% and seizures in 7% (4% with NCS). Three patients with EEG seizures did not have epilepsy or evidence of acute or remote brain injury, although all had clinical seizures prior to EEG. Only having epilepsy (odds ratio [OR] 5.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-21) or seizure(s) prior to EEG (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.7-13) was independently associated with epileptiform EEG findings. SIGNIFICANCE Our study supports growing evidence that COVID-19 can affect the central nervous system, although seizures are unlikely a common cause of encephalopathy. Seizures and epileptiform activity on EEG occurred infrequently, and having a history of epilepsy or seizure(s) prior to EEG testing was predictive of epileptiform findings. This has important implications for triaging EEG testing in this population.","output":"Continuous EEG findings in patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to a New York academic hospital system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review: The purposes of the review are as follows: (1) to define acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and their phenotypes, (2) to highlight the ARS management according to international guidelines, (3) to compare the physicians' management with the ARS guideline recommendations, and (4) to report ARS socioeconomic burden Recent Findings: Bacterial and non-bacterial ARS have similar symptoms, although they can be discriminated by using a combination of specific signs and symptoms The prescription of antibiotics should be limited to clearly suspected bacterial ARS There is an overuse of diagnosis tools and treatment prescriptions The total cost per ARS episode in Europe is over 1000 Summary: ARS is mainly an inflammatory disease triggered by viral infection, and few cases end up developing bacterial infection In most of the cases, it is a self-resolving disease which diagnosis is mainly clinical and the treatment symptomatic The incidence of complications is low and independent of antibiotic use There is a high socioeconomic burden associated to ARS Copyright ? 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","output":"Common Cold and Acute Rhinosinusitis: Up-to-Date Management in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Gossypiboma is defined as developing an exudative inflammatory process around retained foreign bodies (RFBs).

After initial imaging, we found a twisted string-like object in epigastrium. Considering clinical findings and imaging, the patient was taken to the operating room with a diagnosis of RFB. After an explorative laparoscopy, we found an encapsulated fibrotic mass around a surgical sponge with pus-like secretions. CONCLUSION: After diagnosing either RFB or gossypiboma, surgical intervention is mandatory, even in asymptomatic patients. Laparoscopy can help the surgeon to remove the retained item safely.

In general, we are facing both, technological and legal issues, when reconstructing the precise trajectories of the infected persons.

A newly developed urine assay, Xpert Bladder Cancer Detection (Xpert), measures five mRNA targets (ABL1, CRH, IGF2, UPK1B, and ANXA10) that are frequently overexpressed in BC. OBJECTIVE To validate the performance of Xpert in patients with haematuria. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Voided precystoscopy urine specimens were prospectively collected at 22 sites from patients without prior BC undergoing cystoscopy for haematuria. Xpert, cytology, and UroVysion procedures were performed. Technical validation was performed and specificity (SP) was determined in patients without BC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Test characteristics were calculated based on cystoscopy and histology results, and compared between Xpert, cytology, and UroVysion. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS We included 828 patients (mean age 64.5 yr, 467 males, 401 never smoked). Xpert had an SN of 78% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66-87) overall and 90% (95% CI: 76-96) for high-grade (HG) tumours. The NPV was 98% (95% CI: 97-99) overall. The SP was 84% (95% CI: 81-86). In patients with microhaematuria, only one HG patient was missed (NPV 99%). Xpert had higher SN and NPV than cytology and UroVysion. Cytology had the highest SP (97%). In a separate SP study, Xpert had an SP of 89% in patients with benign prostate hypertrophy and 92% in prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS Xpert is an easy-to-use, noninvasive test with improved SN and NPV compared with cytology and UroVysion, representing a promising tool for identifying haematuric patients with a low likelihood of BC who might not need to undergo cystoscopy. PATIENT SUMMARY Xpert is an easy-to-perform urine test with good performance compared with standard urine tests.

METHODS We conducted an observational study of all suicide deaths that occurred among Newfoundland and Labrador residents between 1997 and 2016 using a linked data set derived from a comprehensive review of provincial medical examiner records. We used t tests and 2 to assess associations between rural/urban status and variables related to demographics, circumstances, and manner of death, as well as social and medical history. Logistic regression was utilized to assess the independent contribution of any variable found to be significant in univariate analysis. RESULTS Rural people who died by suicide accounted for 54.8% of all deaths over a 20-year period. Overall, 81.6% of people who died were male. Compared to urban, rural people who died by suicide were younger, more likely to use firearms or hanging, and had a higher mean blood alcohol content at the time of death (27.69 vs. 22.95 mmol/L). Rural people were also less likely to have had a known history of a prior suicide attempt, psychiatric disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, or chronic pain.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in pwMS specifically associated with different DMT in a nationwide population-based study. METHODS: We included patients aged 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of MS and a diagnosis of COVID-19 established between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. We classified COVID-19 course as either mild, severe or fatal. Impact of DMT and specifically immunosuppressants (alemtuzumab, cladribine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab or rituximab) on COVID-19 outcome was determined by multivariable models, adjusted for a-priori-risk. RESULTS: Of 126 MS patients with COVID-19 (mean age 43.2 years [SD 13.4], 71% female), 86.5% had a mild course, 9.5% a severe course and 3.2% died from COVID-19. A-priori-risk significantly predicted COVID-19 severity (R(2) 0.814; p<0.001) and mortality (R(2) 0.664; p<0.001). Adjusting for this a-priori-risk, neither exposure to any DMT nor exposure to specific immunosuppressive DMT were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; p = 0.667 and OR 1.9; p = 0.426) or mortality (OR 0.5; p = 0.711 and 2.1; 0.233) when compared to no DMT. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based MS cohort, COVID-19 outcome was not associated with exposure to DMT and immunosuppressive DMT when accounting for other already known risk factors.

Freshly isolated Mphi from SpragueCDawley rats 2 weeks after 5/6-nephrectomy and from patients on intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) were stimulated by heat shock (HS) and compared to stimulated Mphi of control rats or healthy volunteers (CTR). Expression of HSP72 (inducible HSP70) was assessed by RT-PCR, and/or flow cytometry. Apoptosis of Mphi was detected by flow cytometry (CD14/annexin V-labelling). Results. In rat Mphi, baseline HSP72 expression was similar in both groups, but its induction was significantly impaired in renal insufficiency (214  68% less HSP70-mRNA versus CTR, n = 6).

However, the need for anaesthetic and surgical care is escalating owing to the increasing size and ageing of the Swiss population. In addition, to address the persistent and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis, the speciality of anaesthesia is under tremendous pressure to maintain an effective workforce in order to address population needs. The current number, characteristics and future evolution of the physician anaesthesia workforce in Switzerland are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the size and professional and sociodemographic characteristics of the current anaesthesia workforce in Switzerland and to forecast its development up to 2034. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a 150-item questionnaire prepared by the National Anaesthesia Workforce Study Group (NAWOS). We included all physicians (trainees and certified) practising anaesthesia in Switzerland. We collected demographic and professional information, such as the current position, hospital characteristics, workload, number of shifts and future life plans. We built a computer-based Markov model with Monte Carlo simulations to project both supply and demand for physician anaesthesia provider positions. RESULTS: Of the 2661 distributed questionnaires, 1985 (74.2%) were completed and returned. We found that the average age of anaesthesiologists practising in Switzerland was 45.2 years, with 44.3% of them being women and 76.9% holding a Swiss specialist title. Only 59.6% of respondents worked full time. The forecasting model showed a steady increase in the number of anaesthesiologists retiring by 2034, with 27% of full-time equivalent jobs being lost in the next 8 years. Even if existing full-time equivalent training positions are all filled, a gradual deficit of anaesthesiologists is to be expected after 2022, and the deficit should culminate in 2034 with a deficit ratio of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the upcoming high retirement rate of anaesthesiologists, Switzerland is likely to face a shortage of anaesthesiologists in the near future. To compensate for the shortage, the country will likely increase its reliance on medical staff trained abroad. Southern and eastern cantons of Switzerland are particularly at risk, given that they already heavily rely on foreign anaesthesia workforce. This reliance should be considered a national priority because anaesthesiologists are heavily involved in both the treatment of patients with respiratory complications of SARS-CoV2 infection and the care of surgical patients, the number of which is expected to rise steadily in upcoming years.","output":"Physician anaesthesia providers in Switzerland today and tomorrow: results of the National Anaesthesia Workforce Study (NAWOS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social workers not only help service users, they also help each other, and they know the group as a space through which opportunities to give and receive help multiply In Italy, the initiative ?Social Workers Helping Each Other? was launched to help practitioners stay resilient and mutually supportive during the COVID-19 pandemic In these unprecedented and turbulent times, social workers have been called on to face new challenges and new concerns for service users and for themselves The initiative consisted of online mutual support groups for social workers conducted through a virtual platform Participants were 45 social workers divided into three groups on the basis of the social workers? area of intervention The author facilitated the groups, encouraging the development of reciprocal support dynamics typical of self-help and mutual aid groups Group sessions were very rich in content, and the discussion focused on several topics following the participants? needs The content analysis revealed that the mutual support conversations among social workers focused on three main categories: practical and organizational;methodological and ethical;and personal and emotional The groups offered supervision and mutual support based on experiential learning processes The article presents the rationale, methods and outcomes of the experience This initiative could inspire the development of online mutual support groups for social workers","output":"Social workers helping each other during the COVID-19 pandemic: Online mutual support groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a worldwide attempt to develop prevention strategies against SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

We used best obstetric estimate of gestational age to classify births as very preterm (VPTB, <32 weeks), PTB (< 37 weeks), early term (37 and 38 weeks), and term (39-44 weeks), as each confer independent risks to infant health and development. Separately, we calculated the joint effects of COVID-19 diagnosis, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity on preterm and early term birth. Findings: COVID-19 diagnoses on birth certificates increased for all racial/ethnic groups between July 2020 and January 2021, and was highest for American Indian/Alaska Native (12.9%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (11.4%), and Latinx (10.3%) birthing people. COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of VPTB (aRR 1.6, 95% CI [1.4, 1.9]), PTB (aRR 1.4, 95% CI [1.3, 1.4]), and early term birth (aRR 1.1, 95% CI [1.1, 1.2]). There was no effect modification of the overall association by race/ethnicity or insurance status. COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with elevated risk of PTB in people with comorbidities.

Several studies have shown the therapeutic potential effect of MSC or their derived products. However, the functional heterogeneity of MSC constitutes an important barrier for transferring these capabilities to the clinic. MSC heterogeneity depends on their origin (biological niche) or the conditions of potential donors (age, diseases or unknown factors). It is accepted that many culture conditions of the artificial niche to which they are subjected, such as O2 tension, substrate and extracellular matrix cues, inflammatory stimuli or genetic manipulations can influence their resulting phenotype. Therefore, to attain a more personalized and precise medicine, a correct selection of MSC is mandatory, based on their functional potential, as well as the need to integrate all the existing information to achieve an optimal improvement of MSC features in the artificial niche.","output":"Functional heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cells from natural niches to culture conditions: implications for further clinical uses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most effective strategies for eliminating new and emerging infectious diseases is effective immunization. The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) warrants the need for a maximum coverage vaccine. Moreover, mutations that arise within the virus have a significant impact on the vaccination strategy. Here, we built a comprehensive in silico workflow pipeline to identify B-cell- and T-cell-stimulating antigens of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Our in silico reverse vaccinology (RV) approach consisted of two parts: (1) analysis of the selected viral proteins based on annotated cellular location, antigenicity, allele coverage, epitope density, and mutation density and (2) analysis of the various aspects of the epitopes, including antigenicity, allele coverage, IFN-gamma induction, toxicity, host homology, and site mutational density. After performing a mutation analysis based on the contemporary mutational amino acid substitutions observed in the viral variants, 13 potential epitopes were selected as subunit vaccine candidates. Despite mutational amino acid substitutions, most epitope sequences were predicted to retain immunogenicity without toxicity and host homology. Our RV approach using an in silico pipeline may potentially reduce the time required for effective vaccine development and can be applicable for vaccine development for other pathogenic diseases as well.","output":"Identification of Highly Conserved SARS-CoV-2 Antigenic Epitopes with Wide Coverage Using Reverse Vaccinology Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has had significant impacts on biomedical research, often complicating data sharing among researchers.

Binding is initiated by a down-to-up conformational change in the spike protein, the change that presents the RBD to the receptor. To date, computational and experimental studies that search for therapeutics have concentrated, for good reason, on the RBD. However, the RBD region is highly prone to mutations, and is therefore a hotspot for drug resistance. In contrast, we here focus on the correlations between the RBD and residues distant to it in the spike protein. This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular recognition events and prediction of the highest-effect key mutations in distant, allosteric sites, with implications for therapeutics. Also, these sites can appear in emerging mutants with possibly higher transmissibility and virulence, and pre-identifying them can give clues for designing pancoronavirus vaccines against future outbreaks. Our model, based on time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) and protein graph connectivity network, is able to identify multiple residues that exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening. Residues involved in the most ubiquitous D614G mutation and the A570D mutation of the highly contagious UK SARS-CoV-2 variant are predicted ab-initio from our model. Conversely, broad spectrum therapeutics like drugs and monoclonal antibodies can target these key distant-but-conserved regions of the spike protein. Significance Statement The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic resulted in the largest public health crisis in recent times. Significant drug design effort against SARS-CoV-2 is focused on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, although this region is highly prone to mutations causing therapeutic resistance. We applied deep data analysis methods on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to identify key non-RBD residues that play a crucial role in spike-receptor binding and infection. textcol-orredBecause the non-RBD residues are typically conserved across multiple coronaviruses, they can be targeted by broad spectrum antibodies and drugs to treat infections from new strains that might appear during future epidemics.","output":"Distant Residues Modulate Conformational Opening in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neoadjuvant systemic therapy has now become the standard in early breast cancer management.

Vaccination may be the most effective way to prevent and control the spread of the virus. The safety of vaccines is the focus of preclinical research, and the repeated dose toxicity test is the key safety test to evaluate the vaccine before clinical trials. The purpose of this study was (i) to observe the toxicity and severity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cells) in rodent Sprague Dawley rats after multiple intramuscular injections under the premise of Good Laboratory Practice principles and (ii) to provide a basis for the formulation of a clinical trial scheme. The results showed that all animals in the experimental group were in good condition, no regular changes related to the vaccine were found in the detection of various toxicological indexes, and no noticeable stimulating reaction related to the vaccine was found in the injected local tissues. The neutralizing antibodies in the low- and high-dose vaccine groups began to appear 14 days after the last administration. In the negative control group, no neutralizing antibodies were observed from the administration period to the recovery period. Therefore, the repeated administration toxicity test of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cells) in Sprague Dawley rats showed no obvious toxic reaction. It was preliminarily confirmed that the vaccine can stimulate production of neutralizing antibodies and is safe in Sprague Dawley rats.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (Vero cells) shows good safety in repeated administration toxicity test of Sprague Dawley rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An effective adsorbent of methylene blue was synthesized from coal fly ash (FA; waste material from a coal power plant) by a denaturing process with an alkaline solution at 90 C. The denatured fly ash (D-FA) has a surface area and pore volume of 66.39 m2 g-1 and 15.33 cm3 g-1, respectively, whereas the values of the original FA are negligible, i.e., 3.55 m2 g-1 and 0.02 cm3 g-1. The removal of methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution by D-FA was increased in the range of initial MB concentration (10-20 mg L-1); contact time (0-120 min); pH (2-8); D-FA dosage (1-4 g L-1). However, a larger value of those operational parameters would not improve the removal activity. Furthermore, the methylene blue adsorption on the denatured FA was fitted with the Langmuir model with R 2 = 0.9991; the maximum adsorption capacity was determined as 28.65 mg g-1 from the model. Overall, the highest removal efficiency of MB using D-FA with the dosage of 4 g L-1 was 97.1% in 30 mg L-1 solution of methylene blue at pH = 7.

However, challenges exist in obtaining the maximum yield from industrial fermentations. One challenge arises from the nature of alcohols. These compounds are chaotropic (i.e. causes disorder in the system) which causes stress in the microbes producing the biofuel. Brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) typically cannot grow at ethanol concentration much above 17% (v/v). Mitigation of these properties has the potential to increase yield. Previously, we have explored the effects of chaotropes on model enzyme systems and attempted (largely unsuccessfully) to offset these effects by kosmotropes (compounds which increase the order of the system, i.e. the \\"opposite\\" of chaotropes). Here we present some theoretical results which suggest that high molecular mass polyethylene glycols may be the most effective kosmotropic additives in terms of both efficacy and cost. The assumptions and limitations of these calculations are also presented. A deeper understanding of the effects of chaotropes on biofuel-producing microbes is likely to inform improvements in bioethanol yields and enable more rational approaches to the \\"neutralisation\\" of chaotropicity.","output":"Destressing Yeast for Higher Biofuel Yields: Can Excess Chaotropicity Be Mitigated?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a virus known as SARS-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Without a targeted-medicine, this disease has been causing a massive humanitarian crisis not only in terms of mortality, but also imposing a lasting damage to social life and economic progress of humankind. Therefore, an immediate therapeutic strategy needs to be intervened to mitigate this global crisis. Here, we report a novel KepTide? (Knock-End Peptide) therapy that nullifies SARS-CoV2 infection. SARS-CoV2 employs its surface glycoprotein spike (S-glycoprotein) to interact with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for its infection in host cells. Based on our in-silico-based homology modeling study validated with a recent X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB ID:6M0J), we have identified that a conserved motif of S-glycoprotein that intimately engages multiple hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions with ACE-2 enzyme. Accordingly, we designed a peptide, termed as ACIS (ACE-2 Inhibitory motif of Spike), that displayed significant affinity towards ACE-2 enzyme as confirmed by biochemical assays such as BLItz and fluorescence polarization assays. Interestingly, more than one biochemical modifications were adopted in ACIS in order to enhance the inhibitory action of ACIS and hence called as KEpTide?. Consequently, a monolayer invasion assay, plaque assay and dual immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that KEpTide? efficiently mitigated the infection of SARS-CoV2 in vitro in VERO E6 cells. Finally, evaluating the relative abundance of ACIS in lungs and the potential side-effects in vivo in mice, our current study discovers a novel KepTide? therapy that is safe, stable, and robust to attenuate the infection of SARS-CoV2 virus if administered intranasally.","output":"ACIS, A Novel KepTide?, Binds to ACE-2 Receptor and Inhibits the Infection of SARS-CoV2 Virus in vitro in Primate Kidney Cells: Therapeutic Implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the existence of an active vaccination program, recently emerged strains of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Korea have caused significant economic losses in the poultry industry.

Ten percentage of the homes in the city were destroyed, and many more structures were damaged. Since youth are particularly vulnerable to negative effects of natural disasters, we examined possible long-term psychological impacts. To assess this, we partnered with Fort McMurray Public and Catholic Schools, who surveyed Grade 7C12 students (aged 11C19) in November 2017, 2018, and 2019i.e., at 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 years after the wildfire. The survey included validated measurement scales for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, drug use, alcohol use, tobacco use, quality of life, self-esteem, and resilience. Data analysis was done on large-scale anonymous surveys including 3,070 samples in 2017; 3,265 samples in 2018; and 3,041 samples in 2019. The results were unexpected and showed that all mental health symptoms increased from 2017 to 2019, with the exception of tobacco use. Consistent with this pattern, self-esteem and quality of life scores decreased. Resilience scores did not change significantly. Thus, mental health measures worsened, in contrast to our initial hypothesis that they would improve over time. Of note, we observed higher levels of mental health distress among older students, in females compared to male students, and in individuals with a minority gender identity, including transgender and gender-non-conforming individuals. These findings demonstrate that deleterious mental health effects can persist in youth for years following a wildfire disaster. This highlights the need for multi-year mental health support programs for youth in post-disaster situations. The indication that multi-year, post-disaster support is warranted is relatively novel, although not unknown. There is a need to systematically investigate factors associated with youth recovery following a wildfire disaster, as well as efficacy of psychosocial strategies during later phases of disaster recovery relative to early post-disaster interventions.","output":"Mental Health Symptoms Unexpectedly Increased in Students Aged 11C19 Years During the 3.5 Years After the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire: Findings From 9,376 Survey Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structures of immunogens that elicit the most potent neutralization antibodies to prevent COVID-19 infection are still under investigation.

These steps are ideally undertaken using a One Health cross-sectorial collaboration approach involving partners from public health, food safety, and the veterinary and environmental sectors. In order to firmly identify the source of the outbreak, descriptive epidemiology is often combined with more robust evidence from analytical epidemiology such as a case-control study. A case-control study assesses whether a specific exposure is associated with illness, firstly by identifying cases (persons known to have been ill) and controls (persons who have not been ill, used as a reference group), and then retrospectively through interviews determining specific exposures for all persons. This information ultimately leads to the calculation of an odds ratio (see Note 3) which indicates the strength of the association between specific exposures and the outcome (illness or no illness).

The population and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 infections are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that in addition to individual clinical factors, demographic, socioeconomic and racial characteristics play an important role. Methods. We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results. Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data, with hot spots in all five boroughs. Spatial risk did not correspond precisely to population-based rates of positive tests. The strongest univariate association with positive testing rates was the proportion of residents in a ZIP Code Tabulation Area with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). For every one unit increase in a scaled standardized measure of COPD in a community, there was an approximate 8-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test in a ZCTA (Incidence Density Ratio = 8.2, 95% Credible Interval 3.7, 18.3). The next strongest association was with the proportion of Black and African American residents, for which there was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7). Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black/African American residents and proportion of older persons. Conclusions. The population and spatial patterns of COVID-19 infections differ by race, age, physical environment and health status.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sport industry had to rapidly change and adjust to international border closures and reduced physical contact activity. Many people involved in the sport industry are located outside of their home country and form part of the diaspora network of sport professionals. The diaspora is highly active in the sport industry in terms of disseminating ideas and utilizing their social networks for international entrepreneurial purposes. The aim of this article is to examine the impact of the diaspora on international sport entrepreneurship thereby contributing a novel approach to the international entrepreneurship, sport entrepreneurship and diaspora entrepreneurship fields in a way that has not been contemplated before. A qualitative research methodology is employed to interview sport entrepreneurs about their diaspora and international entrepreneurship activities. This enables a holistic understanding about the role of international public/private partnerships for the success of innovative and futuristic entrepreneurial sport activity. A theoretical framework based on the interview data was developed that incorporated a three-level process of international drivers, diaspora types and sport entrepreneurship outcomes. A number of research propositions were then derived from the data that highlight how the sport industry is highly international and relies on internationalization to foster new business activity. Policy and managerial implications about the role of diaspora for international sport entrepreneurship are highlighted together with future research suggestions. ? 2022 The Author.

Reported here is a baseline study of a suite of host-specific FIB microbial source tracking (MST) markers in the coastal shoreline and reef waters around the island of Saipan. Three sampling campaigns were conducted in September 2017, March 2018, and August 2018. Samples were collected from the nearshore surface waters of Saipan, the reef waters of Saipan Lagoon, and groundwater from beaches along the Saipan Lagoon shoreline. Measurements of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into nearshore waters and isotopic source tracking of nitrogen inputs were conducted concurrently with MST. Environmental DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for MST gene markers of fecal Bacteroidales specifically associated with humans, dogs, cows, and pigs, and for an MST gene marker of Catellicoccus associated with seabirds. MST assessments were combined with local knowledge, assessments of sanitary infrastructure, and routine watershed surveys. This study identified hotspots of human FIB along the western Saipan Lagoon shoreline in both surface waters and groundwater, plus another hotspot of human FIB at a popular tourist bathing area known as the Grotto. FIB hotspots on the Lagoon shoreline coincided with areas of high SGD and nitrogen isotopic data indicating sewage-derived N inputs. It appears that faulty sanitary infrastructure may be contributing to inputs to Saipan Lagoon, while bather shedding is likely a primary input for the Grotto area. Moderate levels of dog fecal contamination were common and widespread across the island. High levels of seabird fecal contamination were more random, both spatially and temporally, and mostly concentrated along the less developed northeast region of Saipan. No significant levels of cow or pig fecal marker were detected in coastal water samples. This study provides demonstration and establishment of analytical capacity to resource management in CNMI for MST technology to aid in trouble-shooting water quality issues involving land-based sources of microbial contaminants to CNMI coastal waters.","output":"Microbial Source Tracking of Fecal Indicating Bacteria in Coral Reef Waters, Recreational Waters, and Groundwater of Saipan by Real-Time Quantitative PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Asthma is diagnosed based on a history of the characteristic symptoms and evidence of expiratory airflow limitation.

Then, we evaluated their properties as hypoxia imaging probes for positron emission tomography (PET) compared with conventional compounds ([68Ga]DN-2 and [68Ga]NN-2). METHODS The precursors of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were synthesized through a two-step reaction, and then reacted with 68GaCl3 to be 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds. FaDu cells were treated with 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds and then incubated under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. The radioactivity of these cells was measured 2 h after incubation. The biodistribution and PET/CT imaging of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds in FaDu-bearing Balb/c nude mice were evaluated 2 h after intravenous injection. RESULTS The 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were synthesized with radiochemical purities over 95%. In the in vitro study, the levels of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were significantly higher in hypoxic cells than in normoxic cells. In hypoxic cells, the compounds we designed in this study demonstrated higher accumulation than the conventional compounds. In the in vivo biodistribution study, [68Ga]DN-3 exhibited the highest accumulation in tumor. In the in vivo PET/CT imaging study, the tumor tissues of the FaDu-xenografted mice were visualized at 2 h after intravenous administration of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds.

However, due to their ecological design, based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO(2) and PM(25) on COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 in England using high geographical resolution. METHODS: We included 38 573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level in England (n=32 844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO(2) and PM(25) concentration during 2014C2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation. FINDINGS: We find a 05% (95% credible interval: ?02%?12%) and 14% (?21%?51%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate for every 1 g/m(3) increase in NO(2) and PM(25) respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect of 093 and 078 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO(2) exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM(25) remains more uncertain.

METHODS We describe a multidisciplinary vascular access team's development to improve frontline providers' workflow by placing central venous and arterial catheters. Herein we describe the development, organization, and processes resulting in the rapid formation and deployment of this team, reporting on notable clinical issues encountered, which might serve as a basis for future quality improvement and investigation. We describe a retrospective, single-center descriptive study in a large, quaternary academic medical center in a major city. The COVID-19 vascular access team included physicians with specialized experience in placing invasive catheters and whose usual clinical schedule had been lessened through deferment of elective cases. The target population included patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the medical ICU (MICU) needing invasive catheter placement. The line team placed all invasive catheters on patients in the MICU with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Primary data collected were the number and type of catheters placed, time of team member exposure to potentially infected patients, and any complications over the first three weeks. Secondary outcomes pertained to workflow enhancement and quality improvement. 145 invasive catheters were placed on 67 patients. Of these 67 patients, 90% received arterial catheters, 64% central venous catheters, and 25% hemodialysis catheters. None of the central venous catheterizations or hemodialysis catheters were associated with early complications. Arterial line malfunction due to thrombosis was the most frequent complication.

Its non-selectivity makes it ideal for the removal of a range of microorganisms including those with antimicrobial resistance. Optimum parameters such as pH, temperature, hydrogen peroxide and iron concentrations and the intensity and wavelength of light irradiation are important to carry out an efficient photo-Fenton process. Traditionally photo-Fenton has been carried out at low acidic pH to obtain greater efficiency, but recent studies have been performed at near neutral. The current review examines the effectiveness of the photo-Fenton process at a near neutral pH for the disinfection of water. The optimal pH was seen to be at 2.8, with the efficiency of the photo-Fenton process decreasing as the pH rises. The optimal reagent concentrations showed considerable variation depending on the iron catalyst used and the iron to hydrogen peroxide concentration used. The effect of irradiance and temperature showed improved efficiency with higher levels. Different types of microorganisms such as E. coli, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella spp., total Coliforms, MRSA, MSSA, B. subtilis, Clostridium sp., Faecal Coliform, MS2 coliphage and Curvularia sp. are also examined and the effect the process will have on them. The design of reactors, such as compound parabolic reactors are also examined. The impact of light sources, including the recent reports on LEDs, on the production of hydrogen peroxide and thereby the improvement in the overall photo-Fenton disinfection is also discussed in detail.

METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured dyadic interviews with 13 couples (N = 26) carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality. All couples had an informative consultation in our PGT centre in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Almost all couples considered PGT or natural conception combined with prenatal diagnosis (PND) as the only two reproductive options. Among several considerations mentioned, the majority indicated that the wish to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy was the most important motive to opt for PGT. All couples who opted for PGT had first tried to conceive spontaneously and entered the PGT programme because of their adverse experiences during these attempts (infertility, recurrent miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, birth of an affected child). Couples that refrained from PGT were of advanced maternal age and expressed the long trajectory of PGT as the main reason to refrain. If conceiving spontaneously would not lead to an ongoing pregnancy, these couples also indicated that they would use PGT. CONCLUSION: This study shows that couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality consider PGT and spontaneous conception with PND as relevant reproductive options. They are looking for the option that is in their opinion the fastest way to establish a successful pregnancy. Information on the perceived pros and cons of PGT or spontaneous conception in these couples can help to optimize counselling and psychological support during the decision-making process.","output":"Motives and considerations regarding PGT in couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality: a qualitative exploration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, efforts have been made to rethink the health system and provide various recommendations to the best care of patients and for the protection of health personnel. In patients with suspicion or confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who require surgical intervention and anesthetic management, strategies must be established to minimize aerosol-generating procedures. Regional anesthesia (RA) is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure per se and is currently proposed such as a safe strategy and part of comprehensive perioperative care. However, the preoperative evaluation has undergone changes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, so in addition to routine preoperative evaluation, a patient-oriented history, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluation should be performed, and a series of general recommendations should be taken into account before, during, and after the performance of RA procedure.

Objective To identify county-level factors associated with obesity using traditional epidemiologic and machine learning methods. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study using linear regression models and machine learning models to evaluate the associations between county-level obesity and county-level demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and environmental factors from summarized statistical data extracted from the 2018 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings and merged with US Census data from each of 3138 US counties. The explanatory power of the linear multivariate regression and the top performing machine learning model were compared using mean R2 measured in 30-fold cross validation. Exposures County-level demographic factors (population; rural status; census region; and race/ethnicity, sex, and age composition), socioeconomic factors (median income, unemployment rate, and percentage of population with some college education), health care factors (rate of uninsured adults and primary care physicians), and environmental factors (access to healthy foods and access to exercise opportunities). Main Outcomes and Measures County-level obesity prevalence in 2018, its association with each county-level factor, and the percentage of variation in county-level obesity prevalence explained by linear multivariate and gradient boosting machine regression measured with R2. Results Among the 3138 counties studied, the mean (range) obesity prevalence was 31.5% (12.8%-47.8%). In multivariate regressions, demographic factors explained 44.9% of variation in obesity prevalence; socioeconomic factors, 33.0%; environmental factors, 15.5%; and health care factors, 9.1%. The county-level factors with the strongest association with obesity were census region, median household income, and percentage of population with some college education. R2 values of univariate regressions of obesity prevalence were 0.238 for census region, 0.218 for median household income, and 0.160 for percentage of population with some college education. Multivariate linear regression and gradient boosting machine regression (the best-performing machine learning model) of obesity prevalence using all county-level demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and environmental factors had R2 values of 0.58 and 0.66, respectively (P < .001).

The majority of deaths are among children under five years. This population-based cross-sectional study investigates the association between solid biomass usage and risk of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in 37 LMICs within Africa, Americas, Southeast Asia, European, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions. Materials and methods: Using population-based data obtained from Demographic and Health surveys (2010C2018), domestic cooking energy sources were classified solid biomass (wood, charcoal/dung, agricultural crop) and cleaner energy sources (e.g., Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), electricity, biogas and natural gas). Composite measures of ARI (shortness of breath, cough) and ALRI (shortness of breath, cough and fever) were composed using maternally reported respiratory symptoms over the two-week period prior to the interview. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the association between biomass fuel usage with ARI and ALRI, accounting for relevant individual, household and situational confounders, including stratification by context (urban/rural). Results: After adjustment, in the pooled analysis, children residing in solid biomass cooking households had an observed increased adjusted odds ratio of ARI (AOR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.09C1.25) and ALRI (AOR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.07C1.25) compared to cleaner energy sources. In stratified analyses, a comparable association was observed in urban areas (ARI: 1.16 [1.06C1.28]; ALRI: 1.14 [1.02C1.27]), but only significant for ARI among those living in rural areas (ARI: 1.14 [1.03C1.26]). Conclusion: Switching domestic cooking energy sources from solid biomass to cleaner alternatives would achieve a respiratory health benefit in children under five years worldwide. High quality mixed-methods research is required to improve acceptability and sustained uptake of clean cooking energy source interventions in LMIC settings.","output":"A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Association between Domestic Cooking Energy Source Type and Respiratory Infections among Children Aged under Five Years: Evidence from Demographic and Household Surveys in 37 Low-Middle Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epigastric herniation occurs through a weakness in the linea alba from the xiphisternum to the umbilicus.

Cell-matrix adhesions are important molecular mechanosensors that their formation and maturation are force-dependent processes. However, most studies focused on the role of cell contractility or substrate stiffness in these processes. How external mechanical force stimulates the formation and maturation of cell-matrix adhesions is largely unknown. Here, by using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)-collagen microtissues as a 3D model, we found that upon short-term dynamic compression, integrin V binding, focal adhesion formation, and subsequent FAK activation, are stimulated. This compression-stimulated FAK signaling also leads to YAP activation, suggesting crosstalk between integrin-based signaling and mechanosensing. More importantly, long-term compression induces maturation of 5-integrin based adhesions to form long, slender 3D-matrix adhesions (3DMAs), which are distinct from 2D focal adhesions in composition and morphology and previously found only in cell-derived matrices and native tissues. Mechanical preconditioning hMSCs with long-term compression loading induces the formation of mature integrin 5-dependent 3DMAs and potentiates their osteogenesis.

In addition, maternal GWG below or above guidelines had slightly higher odds of low Apgar score (below guidelines: OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.03C1.06, above guidelines: OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.15C1.18). The results were largely similar among women with GWG below or above guidelines across pre-pregnancy BMI categories of underweight, overweight, and obesity grade 1 to grade 3. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with GWG below or above the IOM guidelines have increased odds of selected adverse infant birth outcomes. Monitoring maternal GWG could enable physicians to provide tailored nutrition and exercise advice as well as prenatal care to pregnant women to reduce the likelihood of adverse birth outcomes.","output":"Associations Between Gestational Weight Gain and Adverse Birth Outcomes: A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study of 9 Million Mother-Infant Pairs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent critic levels two new charges against Sir William Osler: (1) that in 1912 he was a vice president of the First International Eugenics Congress; and (2) that in 1914 he asserted Canada should remain a \\"a white man's country.\\" Osler was indeed among the 31 vice presidents of the First International Eugenics Congress, but he did nothing further in this area.

Intraperitoneal administration of murine IgG on day 3, or both on day 3 and 6, post-inoculation improved survival and decreased intestinal and renal pathology. When given on both day 3 and 6 post-inoculation IgG treatment also improved kidney function in infected mice. Murine and human commercially available IgG preparations bound to proteins in culture filtrates from E. coli O157:H7. Bound proteins were extracted from membranes and peptide sequences were identified by mass spectrometry. The findings showed that murine and human IgG bound to E. coli extracellular serine protease P (EspP) in the culture filtrate, via the IgG Fc domain. These results were confirmed using purified recombinant EspP and comparing culture filtrates from the wild-type E. coli O157:H7 strain to a deletion mutant lacking espP. Culture filtrates from wild-type E. coli O157:H7 exhibited enzymatic activity, specifically associated with the presence of EspP and demonstrated as pepsin cleavage, which was reduced in the presence of murine and human IgG. EspP is a virulence factor previously shown to promote colonic cell injury and the uptake of Shiga toxin by intestinal cells.

The understanding of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and evolution is a prerequisite to foresee the global trend of emerging vaccine-breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 variants and the design of mutation-proof vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We integrate the genotyping of 1,489,884 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients, a library collection of 130 human antibodies, tens of thousands of mutational data points, topological data analysis (TDA), and deep learning to reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolution mechanism and forecast emerging vaccine-escape variants. We show that infectivity-strengthening and antibody-disruptive co-mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) can quantitatively explain the infectivity and virulence of all prevailing variants. We demonstrate that Lambda is as infectious as Delta but is more vaccine-resistant. We analyze emerging vaccine-breakthrough co-mutations in 20 COVID-19 devastated countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), Denmark (DK), Brazil (BR), Germany (DE), Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE), Italy (IT), Canada (CA), France (FR), India (IN), and Belgium (BE), etc. We envision that natural selection through infectivity will continue to be a main mechanism for viral evolution among unvaccinated populations, while antibody disruptive co-mutations will fuel the future growth of vaccine-breakthrough variants among fully vaccinated populations. Finally, we have identified the following sets of co-mutations that have the great likelihood of becoming dominant: [A411S, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, N501Y], [V401L, L452R, T478K], [K417N, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, E484K, N501Y], and [P384L, K417N, E484K, N501Y].

It is intended to inform national and global accreditation standards, planning and action at the institutional level as well as highlight the role of individuals in transforming health professions education. Many countries have agreed to 'rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes' to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% within 10 years and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, including in healthcare. Currently, however, health professions graduates are not prepared for their roles in achieving these changes. Thus, to reduce emissions and meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), health professions education must equip undergraduates, and those already qualified, with the knowledge, skills, values, competence and confidence they need to sustainably promote the health, human rights and well-being of current and future generations, while protecting the health of the planet. The current imperative for action on environmental issues such as climate change requires health professionals to mobilize politically as they have before, becoming strong advocates for major environmental, social and economic change. A truly ethical relationship with people and the planet that we inhabit so precariously, and to guarantee a future for the generations which follow, demands nothing less of all health professionals. This Consensus Statement outlines the changes required in health professions education, approaches to achieve these changes and a timeline for action linked to the internationally agreed SDGs. It represents the collective vision of health professionals, educators and students from various health professions, geographic locations and cultures. 'Consensus' implies broad agreement amongst all individuals engaged in discussion on a specific issue, which in this instance, is agreement by all signatories of this Statement developed under the auspices of the Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE). To ensure a shared understanding and to accurately convey information, we outline key terms in a glossary which accompanies this Consensus Statement (Supplementary Appendix 1). We acknowledge, however, that terms evolve and that different terms resonate variably depending on factors such as setting and audience. We define education for sustainable healthcare as the process of equipping current and future health professionals with the knowledge, values, confidence and capacity to provide environmentally sustainable services through health professions education. We define a health professional as a person who has gained a professional qualification for work in the health system, whether in healthcare delivery, public health or a management or supporting role and education as 'the system comprising structures, curricula, faculty and activities contributing to a learning process'.

The HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) system is a platform used extensively in studies of cell entry, screening of novel entry inhibitors, assessing the phenotypes of clinically observed E1 and E2 glycoproteins and, most pertinently, in characterizing neutralizing antibody breadth induced upon vaccination and natural infection in patients. Nonetheless, some patient-derived clones produce pseudoparticles that are either non-infectious or exhibit infectivity too low for meaningful phenotyping. The mechanisms governing whether any particular clone produces infectious pseudoparticles are poorly understood. Here we show that endogenous expression of CD81, an HCV receptor and a cognate-binding partner of E2, in producer HEK 293T cells is detrimental to the infectivity of recovered HCVpp for most strains. Many HCVpp clones exhibited increased infectivity or had their infectivity rescued when they were produced in 293T cells CRISPR/Cas9 engineered to ablate CD81 expression (293T(CD81KO)). Clones made in 293T(CD81KO) cells were antigenically very similar to their matched counterparts made parental cells and appear to honour the accepted HCV entry pathway. Deletion of CD81 did not appreciably increase the recovered titres of soluble E2 (sE2). However, we did, unexpectedly, find that monomeric sE2 made in 293T cells and Freestyle 293-F (293-F) cells exhibit important differences. We found that 293-F-produced sE2 harbours mostly complex-type glycans whilst 293T-produced sE2 displays a heterogeneous mixture of both complex-type glycans and high-mannose or hybrid-type glycans. Moreover, sE2 produced in 293T cells is antigenically superior; exhibiting increased binding to conformational antibodies and the large extracellular loop of CD81. In summary, this work describes an optimal cell line for the production of HCVpp and reveals that sE2 made in 293T and 293-F cells are not antigenic equals. Our findings have implications for functional studies of E1E2 and the production of candidate immunogens.","output":"Optimized cell systems for the investigation of hepatitis C virus E1E2 glycoproteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, data regarding new infections were commonly presented and used to guide policy decisions (e.g., whether to close schools) and personal choices (e.g., whether to dine at a restaurant).

Data on infections-like much time series data-can be presented as either stocks (the total number of cases) or flows (the number of new cases over some interval). We show that seeing the same data presented in one format versus the other can shift judgments of risk and behavioral intentions. Specifically, when participants were shown data that depicted the number of new cases each day (flow) decreasing, they judged the current risk of COVID-19 to be lower than participants who were shown the same data as the total (cumulative) number of cases (stock), which-by its nature-continued to increase. Risk appraisal, in turn, predicted a wide array of behavioral intentions (e.g., likelihood of dining indoors at a restaurant). Thus, the choice of how to present pandemic data can lead people to different conclusions about risk and can have practical consequences for risky behavior.

Various agents have been developed to inhibit mediators of the inflammatory response; one prospective agent is -sitosterol (S), a phytosterol with a structure similar to cholesterol. This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of S on the biomarkers of inflammation and liver function in cecal ligation and puncture- (CLP-) induced septic rats. METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were divided equally into six groups as follows: sham, CLP, CLP+dexamethasone (DX, 0.2 mg/kg), CLP+S (1 mg/kg), CLP+imipenem (IMI, 20 mg/kg), and CLP+IMI (20 mg/kg)+S (1 mg/kg). Serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, AST, ALT, and liver glutathione (GSH) were assessed by ELISA. Liver expression levels of TNF- and NF-Bi mRNAs were evaluated by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, ALT, and AST and mRNA levels of TNF- and NF-Bi were all significantly higher in septic rats than in normal rats (p < 0.05). Liver GSH content was markedly lower in the CLP group than that in the sham group. S-treated rats had remarkably lower levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, NF-Bi, AST, and ALT (51.79%, 62.63%, 41.46%, 54.35%, 94.37%, 95.30%, 34.87%, and 46.53% lower, respectively) and greater liver GSH content (35.71% greater) compared to the CLP group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: S may play a protective role in the septic process by mitigating inflammation. This effect is at least partly mediated by inhibition of the NF-B signaling pathway. Thus, S can be considered as a supplementary treatment in septic patients.","output":"-Sitosterol Alters the Inflammatory Response in CLP Rat Model of Sepsis by Modulation of NFB Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between frailty and short-term mortality in older adults hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: Retrospective single-center observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-one patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Geriatrics department of a general hospital in Belgium. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical, and radiologic variables, comorbidities, symptoms, and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65-97 years) and a median CFS score of 7 (range 2-9); 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within 6 weeks, 18 patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = .03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = .011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; r = 0.301, P = .009), lymphocyte count (r = -0.262, P = .02), and RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct, r = -0.285, P = .015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium, or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH, and RT-PCR Ct (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival.

When new respiratory infectious diseases become widespread, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers' adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines becomes even more important. Strategies in these guidelines include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, face shields, gloves and gowns; the separation of patients with respiratory infections from others; and stricter cleaning routines. These strategies can be difficult and time-consuming to adhere to in practice. Authorities and healthcare facilities therefore need to consider how best to support healthcare workers to implement them. OBJECTIVES To identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers' adherence to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. SEARCH METHODS We searched OVID MEDLINE on 26 March 2020. As we searched only one database due to time constraints, we also undertook a rigorous and comprehensive scoping exercise and search of the reference lists of key papers. We did not apply any date limit or language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA We included qualitative and mixed-methods studies (with a distinct qualitative component) that focused on the experiences and perceptions of healthcare workers towards factors that impact on their ability to adhere to IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases. We included studies of any type of healthcare worker with responsibility for patient care. We included studies that focused on IPC guidelines (local, national or international) for respiratory infectious diseases in any healthcare setting. These selection criteria were framed by an understanding of the needs of health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Four review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts and full texts identified by our search. We used a prespecified sampling frame to sample from the eligible studies, aiming to capture a range of respiratory infectious disease types, geographical spread and data-rich studies. We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this synthesis. We assessed methodological limitations using an adapted version of the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tool. We used a 'best fit framework approach' to analyse and synthesise the evidence. This provided upfront analytical categories, with scope for further thematic analysis. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and developed implications for practice. MAIN RESULTS We found 36 relevant studies and sampled 20 of these studies for our analysis. Ten of these studies were from Asia, four from Africa, four from Central and North America and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), tuberculosis (TB), or seasonal influenza. Most of these healthcare workers worked in hospitals; others worked in primary and community care settings. Our review points to several barriers and facilitators that influenced healthcare workers' ability to adhere to IPC guidelines. The following factors are based on findings assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Healthcare workers felt unsure as to how to adhere to local guidelines when they were long and ambiguous or did not reflect national or international guidelines. They could feel overwhelmed because local guidelines were constantly changing. They also described how IPC strategies led to increased workloads and fatigue, for instance because they had to use PPE and take on additional cleaning. Healthcare workers described how their responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the level of support they felt that they received from their management team. Clear communication about IPC guidelines was seen as vital. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They also thought it was a problem when training was not mandatory. Sufficient space to isolate patients was also seen as vital. A lack of isolation rooms, anterooms and shower facilities was a problem. Other important practical measures described by healthcare workers included minimising overcrowding, fast-tracking infected patients, restricting visitors, and providing easy access to handwashing facilities. A lack of PPE, and equipment that was of poor quality, was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. They also pointed to the need to adjust the volume of supplies as infection outbreaks continued. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw the value of it. Some healthcare workers felt motivated to follow the guidance because of fear of infecting themselves or their families, or because they felt responsible for their patients. Some healthcare workers found it difficult to use masks and other equipment when it made patients feel isolated, frightened or stigmatised. Healthcare workers also found masks and other equipment uncomfortable to use. The workplace culture could also influence whether healthcare workers followed IPC guidelines or not. Across many of the findings, healthcare workers pointed to the importance of including all staff, including cleaning staff, porters, kitchen staff and other support staff when implementing IPC guidelines. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Healthcare workers point to several factors that influence their ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines when managing respiratory infectious diseases. These include factors tied to the guideline itself and how it is communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, training, physical space, access to and trust in personal protective equipment, and a desire to deliver good patient care. The review also highlights the importance of including all facility staff, including support staff, when implementing IPC guidelines.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to healthcare workers' adherence with infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases: a rapid qualitative evidence synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its related disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been rapidly spreading all over the world and is responsible for the current pandemic.

The circumstances and stories of individual families have been picked up in the press focussing on the difficulties of people adjusting to their changed living arrangements. Yet, there have been few empirical analyses on how such changes might influence peoples health and wellbeing. Therefore, this study explored the changing patterns of perceived stress by living arrangements change during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. METHODS: The data used relates to 12,532 cohort members in the special Covid-19 surveys conducted with the participants of the 1958, 1970, 2000-01 British birth cohorts and Next Steps (born in 1989C90) in May 2020. Probit regression models were used to assess the chance of reporting increased stress amongst those who had experienced changes in living arrangements during the pandemic compared to those who had not. RESULTS: The results provide strong evidence that those individuals whose living arrangements changed during the Covid-19 pandemic have a higher likelihood of reported increased stress than those whose living arrangements remained unchanged. This was most clearly seen for older cohorts. Increased interpersonal conflict plays a role in mediating the association, especially for the younger cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm that during the first lockdown, changing living arrangements were negatively associated with individuals mental wellbeing. As prolonged periods of stress can lead to serious health problems and policymakers need to be mindful that services may need to take these new, albeit for many temporary, forms of living arrangements into account.","output":"Changing living arrangements and stress during Covid-19 lockdown: Evidence from four birth cohorts in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Use of appropriate personal protective equipment is essential for healthcare workers when dealing with patients who have tested positive or are suspected of having Covid-19.

The corona virus mainly causes damage to the pulmonary epithelial cells of lung, as well as other organs such as the hearts and immune system by interaction of its spike protein with host ACE2 receptor. There is currently no specific treatment for coronary disease. Mesenchymal stem cell may be a potential treatment for refractory pulmonary illnesses. Methods: To conduct this review study, the databases of PubMed, Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov, world health organization international clinical trials registry platform and european union clinical trials register were searched using the keywords of COVID-19 and mesenchymal stem cells in 2020. Then, by exact examining of the title, the summary and full text of articles, repeat studies and cases that lacked inclusion criteria were excluded. In these studies, the pathological symptoms of coronary patients as well as the characteristics, origin, and potential mechanisms of stem cells in coronary artery disease and MSC-based clinical trials were investigated. Results: Mesenchymal stem cells have significant effects on the treatment of COVID-19 disease due to their unique properties such as immune system regulation and tissue regeneration capabilities. Also, in this way, several studies have been licensed to enter the clinical phase and are under investigation. Conclusion: Although treatment of corona disease using stem cells is a very promising method, but the limitations of this therapeutic approach must be considered. So, there is an urgent need for large-scale investigations to confirm the safety and efficacy profile of these therapies and rigorous resolution on several fronts, including MSC fate after infusion, homing capability and MSC resistance to the disease microenvironment. ? 2021, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences.

A total of 611 healthcare workers were included in the final analysis from 1 August 2020 to 31 August 2020. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and overall psychological problems was 26.84%, 34.70%, 34.53%, and 46.48%, respectively. The prevalence rates of anxiety were approximately equal amongst the groups of healthcare workers, and moderate-to-severe anxiety was the most common in physicians (11.11%). The prevalence of depression was the highest in nurses (38.65%) and moderate-to-severe depression was mainly found in physicians (11.81%). The prevalence rates of insomnia were 34.03% in physicians, 36.20% in nurses, and 31.21% in technicians;in particular, the rate of moderate-to-severe insomnia was higher in physicians and nurses compared to technicians. The prevalence of overall moderate-to-severe psychological problems was the highest among physicians (14.58%), followed by nurses (12.58%) and technicians (9.22%).

Although cannabis was traditionally assumed to only have mild vegetative side effects, it has become evident in recent years that severe cardiovascular complications can occur. Cannabis use has recently even been added to the risk factors for myocardial infarction. This review is dedicated to pathogenetic factors contributing to cannabis-related myocardial infarction. Tachycardia is highly important in this respect, and we provide evidence that activation of CB(1) receptors in brain regions important for cardiovascular regulation and of presynaptic CB(1) receptors on sympathetic and/or parasympathetic nerve fibers are involved. The prototypical factors for myocardial infarction, i.e., thrombus formation and coronary constriction, have also been considered, but there is little evidence that they play a decisive role. On the other hand, an increase in the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, impaired mitochondrial respiration, cardiotoxic reactions and tachyarrhythmias associated with the increased sympathetic tone are factors possibly intensifying myocardial infarction. A particularly important factor is that cannabis use is frequently accompanied by tobacco smoking. In conclusion, additional research is warranted to decipher the mechanisms involved, since cannabis use is being legalized increasingly and (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and its synthetic analogue nabilone are indicated for the treatment of various disease states.","output":"Why Do Marijuana and Synthetic Cannabimimetics Induce Acute Myocardial Infarction in Healthy Young People?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decisions about whether or not to become a parent are significant parts of normative human development.

The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a protocol for the standardised measurement of the disease burden of RSV infection in primary care in children aged < 5 years. METHODS: The standardised protocol was evaluated in Italy and the Netherlands during the 2019/20 winter. Children aged < 5 years who consulted their primary care physician, met the WHO acute respiratory infections (ARI) case definition, and had a laboratory confirmed positive test for RSV (RT-PCR) were included. RSV symptoms were collected at the time of swabbing. Health care use, duration of symptoms and socio-economic impact was measured 14 days after swabbing. Health related Quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the parent-proxy report of the PedsQL?4.0 generic core scales (2C4 years) and PedsQL?4.0 infant scales (0C2 years) 30 days after swabbing. The standardised protocol was evaluated in terms of the feasibility of patient recruitment, data collection procedures and whether parents understood the questions. RESULTS: Children were recruited via a network of paediatricians in Italy and a sentinel influenza surveillance network of general practitioners in the Netherlands. In Italy and the Netherlands, 293 and 152 children were swabbed respectively, 119 and 32 tested RSV positive; for 119 and 12 children the Day-14 questionnaire was completed and for 116 and 11 the Day-30 questionnaire. In Italy, 33% of the children had persistent symptoms after 14 days and in the Netherlands this figure was 67%. Parents had no problems completing questions concerning health care use, duration of symptoms and socio-economic impact, however, they had some difficulties scoring the HRQoL of their young children. CONCLUSION: RSV symptoms are common after 14 days, and therefore, measuring disease burden outcomes like health care use, duration of symptoms, and socio-economic impact is also recommended at Day-30. The standardised protocol is suitable to measure the clinical and socio-economic disease burden of RSV in young children in primary care.","output":"Evaluation of a standardised protocol to measure the disease burden of respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children in primary care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a new viral respiratory infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in the city of Wuhan, China COVID-19 quickly spread across the world, leading the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a similar virus to those involved in other epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Epidemiological studies have shown that COVID-19 frequently affects young adults of reproductive age and that the elderly and patients with chronic disease have high mortality rates Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and breastfeeding Most COVID-19 cases present with mild flu-like symptoms and only require treatment with symptomatic relief medications, whereas other cases with COVID-19 require treatment in an intensive care unit There is currently no specific effective treatment for COVID-19 A large number of drugs are being used to fight infection by SARS-CoV-2 Experience with this therapeutic arsenal has been gained over the years in the treatment of other viral, autoimmune, parasitic, and bacterial diseases Importantly, the search for an effective treatment for COVID-19 cannot expose pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 to the potential teratogenic risks of these drugs Therefore, it is necessary to determine and understand the safety of anti-COVID-19 therapies prior to conception and during pregnancy and breastfeeding","output":"COVID-19 Treatment: Drug Safety Prior to Conception and During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existence of a substantial but unclear number of asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 patients worldwide has raised concerns among global public health authorities.

This guideline was triggered by the ACTT-1 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 22 May 2020. CURRENT PRACTICE Remdesivir has received worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for severe covid-19. After rapid market approval in the US, remdesivir is already being used in clinical practice. RECOMMENDATIONS The guideline panel makes a weak recommendation for the use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 while recommending continuation of active enrolment of patients into ongoing randomised controlled trials examining remdesivir. HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED An international panel of patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The recommendations are based on a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis. The panel considered an individual patient perspective and allowed contextual factors (such as resources) to be taken into account for countries and healthcare systems. THE EVIDENCE The linked systematic review (published 31 Jul 2020) identified two randomised trials with 1300 participants, showing low certainty evidence that remdesivir may be effective in reducing time to clinical improvement and may decrease mortality in patients with severe covid-19. Remdesivir probably has no important effect on need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on hospital length of stay. UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION Most patients with severe covid-19 would likely choose treatment with remdesivir given the potential reduction in time to clinical improvement. However, given the low certainty evidence for critical outcomes and the fact that different perspectives, values, and preferences may alter decisions regarding remdesivir, the panel issued a weak recommendation with strong support for continued recruitment in randomised trials.","output":"Remdesivir for severe covid-19: a clinical practice guideline."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiologists suggest that even as we deal with the current COVID-19 crisis, we also prepare for future pandemics The purpose of this special report is to document the impact of COVID-19 on the food service industry, as well as provide strategies based on empirical evidence and suggestions for future preparedness Studies have found a need for increased emphasis on specific arenas within the food service industry: 1) cleaning and sanitation of fomites such as doorknobs, menus, and table surfaces, 2) rigorous hand-washing and mask-wearing practices to decrease transmissibility of the virus, 3) effective ventilation within operations, and 4) empathetic leadership to enhance resiliency as food service operations across the country cope and work toward reopening From the practitioner's standpoint, clear and effective communication is key for working with food service operations The importance of social distancing and mask wearing has been documented using science-based evidence;however, the ways in which these measures are enforced in food service establishments vary across counties and cities within each state, leading to confusion and frustration As we prepare for the next pandemic, having a rigorous plan to deal with different biological hazards across multiple organizational levels will help with preparedness and the speed of implementation","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the United States Food Service Industry and Science-Based Strategies for Pandemic Preparedness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a global survey on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the research activities of materials scientists by distributing a questionnaire on 9 October 2020 with a response deadline of 23 October 2020.

In this study, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the age-specific COVID-19 attributable deaths over time in the United States. The model is specified by a novel non-parametric spatial approach, a low-rank Gaussian Process (GP) projected by regularised B-splines. We show that this projection defines a new GP with attractive smoothness and computational efficiency properties, derive its kernel function, and discuss the penalty terms induced by the projected GP. Simulation analyses and benchmark results show that the spatial approach performs better than standard B-splines and Bayesian P-splines and equivalently well as a standard GP, for considerably lower runtimes. The B-splines projected GP priors that we develop are likely an appealing addition to the arsenal of Bayesian regularising priors. We apply the model to weekly, age-stratified COVID-19 attributable deaths reported by the US Centers for Disease Control, which are subject to censoring and reporting biases. Using the B-splines projected GP, we can estimate longitudinal trends in COVID-19 associated deaths across the US by 1-year age bands. These estimates are instrumental to calculate age-specific mortality rates, describe variation in age-specific deaths across the US, and for fitting epidemic models. Here, we couple the model with age-specific vaccination rates to show that lower vaccination rates in younger adults aged 18-64 are associated with significantly stronger resurgences in COVID-19 deaths, especially in Florida and Texas. These results underscore the critical importance of medically able individuals of all ages to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to limit fatal outcomes.","output":"Regularised B-splines projected Gaussian Process priors to estimate time-trends of age-specific COVID-19 deaths related to vaccine roll-out"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spondylolisthesis refers to the slippage of one vertebral body over the adjacent one. It is a chronic condition that requires early detection to prevent unpleasant surgery. The paper presents an optimized deep learning model for detecting spondylolisthesis in X-ray radiographs. The dataset contains a total of 299 X-ray radiographs from which 156 images are showing the spine with spondylolisthesis and 143 images are of the normal spine. Image augmentation technique is used to increase the data samples. In this study, VGG16 and InceptionV3 models were used for the image classification task. The developed model is optimized by utilizing the TFLite model optimization technique. The experimental result shows that the VGG16 model has achieved a 98% accuracy rate, which is higher than InceptionV3's 96% accuracy rate. The size of the implemented model is reduced up to four times so it can be used on small devices. The compressed VGG16 and InceptionV3 models have achieved 100% and 96% accuracy rate, respectively. Our finding shows that the implemented models were outperformed in the diagnosis of lumbar spondylolisthesis as compared to the model suggested by Varcin et al. (which had a maximum of 93% accuracy rate). Also, the developed quantized model has achieved higher accuracy rate than Zebin and Rezvy's (VGG16 + TFLite) model with 90% accuracy.

METHODS A total of 156 consecutive patients with lung lesions who received anatomical pulmonary segmentectomy by VATS between 2015 and 2016 in our hospital were enrolled. All the subjects had high-resolution, thin-section chest computed tomography (CT) examinations with 3-dimensional reconstruction, a pulmonary function test, abdominal ultrasonography, electrocardiogram and cardiac ultrasonography. The lung lesion was localized before the operation using CT reconstruction or a hookwire to plan the operative method. RESULTS Uniportal VATS pulmonary segmentectomy was successfully completed in 151 (96.8%) patients. Most cases involved the right apical and apical posterior segments and the left trisegment. Only 1 patient had a right middle interior segmentectomy, left upper apical anterior segmentectomy or a right lower posteriolateral segmentectomy, respectively. There were 26 cases of benign lesions (including 17 cases of atypical hyperplasia) and 130 cases of non-small-cell lung cancer. Operation time (146  56 vs 113  32 min), blood loss (63  17 vs 54  13 ml) and complication rates (13.5% vs 5.8%) were obviously lower in 2016 compared with 2015 (P < 0.01). In contrast, the preoperative hookwire localization rate was markedly higher in 2016 compared with 2015.

One strategy is presentation of research work at national conferences in the specialty of interest; another is simply attending these events for networking purposes with program directors. However, attending these conferences carries cost. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost incurred by medical students to attend the premier annual scientific meeting of each major medical specialty in 2020, during the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to evaluate whether \\"research intensive\\" specialties carried greater conference registration costs. METHODS: Potential medical specialties to which students can apply upon graduation were identified in the National Residency Match Program (NRMP). \\"Research intensive\\" specialties were defined as those with a mean number of abstracts, presentations, or publications &#8805;10 per matched applicant in the 2020 NRMP. The premier conference for each specialty was determined by membership in the American Medical Association House of Delegates in the NRMP. The cost to be a member of each conference's parent organization and attend the annual meeting were determined by internet search. Subgroup analysis was conducted to compare cost between research intensive and non research intensive specialties. RESULTS: The registration cost of 19 virtual conferences held in 2020 were analyzed in this study. The average cost to attend as a medical student member of the hosting organization for all conferences was $49.82 (range, $0-$331; SD$92.18), while the average cost to attend as a nonmember across all conferences was $188.16 (range, $0-$595; SD$176.35; p<0.001). Seven of 19 (36.8%) meetings had free registration for medical students who are members of the hosting organization. The premier meetings affiliated with the seven research intensive specialties had a significantly higher mean cost for medical students who were members of the parent organization than the meetings of the other specialties ($125.60 vs. $49.20; p=0.031). There was no significant difference in mean registration cost between research intensive and non research intensive specialty conference registration for nonmember medical students (p=0.85). Vascular surgery, radiation oncology, and emergency medicine were the three specialties with the most expensive medical student member registration fees overall ($331, $200, and $195, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Medical student attendance and presentation at national scientific meetings was found to be significantly more costly for research intensive specialties, although all meetings were held in an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, this reflects an increased financial burden to an already indebted medical student population and compounds the stresses brought on by the pandemic. More national medical societies might consider free meeting registration to reflect support for medical students and encourage their continued participation in research to advance their specialty of interest.","output":"Analyzing the cost of medical student virtual conference registration by specialty during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The successful development of COVID-19 vaccines within an unprecedented short time needs to be followed by rapid vaccine uptake, in particular, in high-risk populations such as patients with cancer.

It has been accepted by many local and global health authorities as a suitable approach for preventing and responding to infectious disease outbreaks including pandemics. MAIN BODY One Health (OH) is a multisectoral and interdisciplinary framework for managing the animal, human, and ecosystem determinants of health. Globally, the majority of emerging infections in humans including SARS-Cov2-the causative agent of COVID-19-are transmitted from animals through environmental contacts in the last few decades. Yet, even when the biological and social interactions at the human, animal, and environmental interface that drive spillover of zoonotic diseases have been proven, OH strategies to address associated complex health challenges today are still rudimentary in many national health systems. Despite the disproportionate burden of infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, OH is minimally incorporated into routine disease control and national health security programs. Challenges include poor policy support for OH in sub-Saharan Africa, and where some form of policy framework does exist, there are significant implementation bottlenecks. In this paper, we identified ideological, technical, operational, and economic barriers to OH implementation in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa, and highlighted possible recommendations across these domains. In order to yield sustainable benefits, a relevant OH policy approach in the sub-Saharan African health systems must derive from a buy-in of the critical mass of stakeholders in the society. CONCLUSION The implementation of sustainable OH approaches as a countermeasure to recurring emerging infections is a developmental priority for sub-Saharan African countries. A deep understanding of the local context must be leveraged to develop integrative OH solutions that are bold, rooted in science, and proven to be compatible with the level of development in sub-Saharan Africa.","output":"COVID-19: an opportunity to re-evaluate the implementation of a One Health approach to tackling emerging infections in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a novel Ontology-based and user-focused Automatic Text Summarization (OATS) system, in the setting where the goal is to automatically generate text summarization from unstructured text by extracting sentences containing the information that aligns to the user's focus.

During this period, patients, including older adults and those with chronic conditions, need ways to obtain medical attention other than going physically to the clinic, such as telemedicine services. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate attitudes toward telemedicine during the COVID-19 lockdown in Israel, assess willingness to use such services in the future, and evaluate the extent to which consumers have changed their minds regarding these services. Method: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study was conducted among adults (age 20C90) using social media networks (N = 693). Data were collected using an online questionnaire explicitly designed to measure attitudes toward telemedicine. Results: Most of the participants had to use telemedicine during the lockdown and were satisfied therewith. The majority also stated that they would continue using telemedicine in the future. However, only a third stated that they had changed their minds regarding telemedicine. The main predictors of willingness to use telemedicine in the future were the necessity of using such services during lockdown, preference for going to a clinic, and satisfaction with telemedicine, alongside gender and having a chronic illness. Importantly, we found that a preference for visiting the clinic was negatively correlated with willingness to use telemedicine in the future. Education and being single were predictors of the change of mind regarding telemedicine. Participants with chronic conditions are more likely to use these services, and specific attention should be directed to their needs. A small portion of the study sample prefers live appointments with a physician. Conclusions: Telemedicine use is rapidly changing. It is vital for health care providers to identify non-telemedicine users and their common characteristics. Monitoring patients' attitudes regarding telemedicine is essential in the future after the pandemic ends. Targeted outreach plans should be formulated. These plans should be directed at identifying barriers to using telemedicine, and they should generate specific, focused plans.","output":"Using Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Attitudes of Adult Health Care Consumers in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic infections caused by pathogenic Candida species pose a significant threat to public health in the past decades due to increasing resistance to existing antifungal drugs.

Our results revealed that the aggregation of tested yeasts was lower in the first 5 h but increased significantly after 24 h. All strains were able to auto-aggregate in different degrees ranging from 47.46 to 95.95% assessed at 24 h of incubation. Among them the highest auto-aggregation values had C. albicans and C. krusei strains followed by probiotic strain S. boulardii, while the less were observed in C. glabrata strains. In addition, co-aggregation between probiotic and Candida strains was strain-specific. It was evident that S. boulardii significantly inhibited the aggregation of C. albicans ATCC 10261, C. krusei ATCC 6258, and C. glabrata ZIM 2369. However, in C. glabrata ZIM 2382, the aggregation was even enhanced. Temperature and pH also affected the ability to aggregate in a different way only after 5 h of incubation, with the highest cell aggregation evidenced at temperature 37 C in most cases and pH 4.5.

METHODS A total of 95 patients with COVID-19 were randomly divided into a moxibustion group (45 cases) and a basic treatment group (50 cases). The routine treatment of western medicine was applied in the patients of both groups. In the moxibustion group, on the base of the treatment of western medicine, moxibustion was applied to Dazhui (GV 14), Feishu (BL 13), Qihai (CV 6) and Zusanli (ST 36), once daily and consecutively for 14 days. At the end of treatment courses, clinical symptom scores for cough, asthmatic breathing, chest oppression and short breath, as well as their remission rates were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Before and after treatment, the white blood cell (WBC) count, the levels of c-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the absolute number of T lymphocyte subsets, i.e. , and of the peripheral blood were compared in the patients between the two groups. The principal component analysis was adopted to analyze the common data extracted from the above 10 clinical indexes variables and comprehensively evaluate the differences in the therapeutic effect of two regimens. RESULTS The clinical symptom scores were all decreased after treatment in both of the moxibustion group and the basic treatment group as compared with those before treatment (P<0.05). After treatment, the clinical symptom scores of cough, chest oppression and asthmatic breathing in the moxibustion group were lower significantly than those in the basic treatment group (P<0.05) and the remission rates of cough, chest oppression and asthmatic breathing were higher than the basic treatment group (P<0.05). After treatment, WBC count was increased as compared with that before treatment in either group (P<0.05) and the levels of CRP and IL-6 in the moxibustion group were reduced as compared with those before treatment (P<0.05). The reducing range of IL-6 level in the moxibustion group was larger than the basic treatment group (P<0.05). After treatment, the absolute number of , and T lymphocytes was increased as compared with that before treatment in the moxibustion group (P<0.05), and its increase range was larger than the basic treatment group (P<0.05).

CONCLUSION On the base of the routine treatment with western medicine, moxibustion therapy supplemented relieves the clinical symptoms, reduces the levels of inflammatory indexes, i.e. IL-6 and CRP as well as improves the absolute number of peripheral T lymphocyte subsets. The clinical therapeutic effect of such regimen with moxibustion supplemented is significantly better than the simple routine treatment of western medicine.","output":"[Effect of moxibustion on clinical symptoms, peripheral inflammatory indexes and T lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolutionary origin of the genome remains elusive. Here, I hypothesize that its first iteration, the protogenome, was a multi-ribozyme RNA. It evolved, likely within liposomes (the protocells) forming in dry-wet cycling environments, through the random fusion of ribozymes by a ligase and was amplified by a polymerase. The protogenome thereby linked, in one molecule, the information required to seed the protometabolism (a combination of RNA-based autocatalytic sets) in newly forming protocells. If this combination of autocatalytic sets was evolutionarily advantageous, the protogenome would have amplified in a population of multiplying protocells. It likely was a quasispecies with redundant information, e.g., multiple copies of one ribozyme. As such, new functionalities could evolve, including a genetic code. Once one or more components of the protometabolism were templated by the protogenome (e.g., when a ribozyme was replaced by a protein enzyme), and/or addiction modules evolved, the protometabolism became dependent on the protogenome. Along with increasing fidelity of the RNA polymerase, the protogenome could grow, e.g., by incorporating additional ribozyme domains. Finally, the protogenome could have evolved into a DNA genome with increased stability and storage capacity. I will provide suggestions for experiments to test some aspects of this hypothesis, such as evaluating the ability of ribozyme RNA polymerases to generate random ligation products and testing the catalytic activity of linked ribozyme domains.","output":"Genome Evolution from Random Ligation of RNAs of Autocatalytic Sets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is severely challenging the healthcare systems and economies of the world, which urgently demand vaccine and therapy development to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Hence, advancing our understanding of the comprehensive entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, especially the host factors that facilitate viral infection, is crucial for the discovery of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs SARS-CoV-2 has previously been documented to reach cells by binding with ACE2 and CD147 receptors in host cells that interact with the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 A novel entry factor, called neuropilin 1(NRP1), has recently been discovered as a co-receptor facilitating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 NRP1 is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body and acts as a multifunctional co-receptor to bind with different ligand proteins and play diverse physiological roles as well as pathological and therapeutic roles in different clinical conditions/diseases, including COVID-19 The current review, therefore, briefly provides the overview of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, the structure of NRP1, and their roles in health and various diseases, as well as extensively discusses the current understanding of the potential implication of NRP1 in SARS-CoV-2 entry and COVID-19 treatment","output":"Neuropilin 1: A Novel Entry Factor for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and a Potential Therapeutic Target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lung ground-glass opacities (GGOs) are an early manifestation of lung adenocarcinoma.

METHODS: We analyzed the RNA sequencing data of surgical specimens from 21 patients with GGO-featured primary lung adenocarcinoma and verified the changes in the expression of IL-6 and other important immune molecules in the TCGA and GEO databases. Next, we used flow cytometry to detect the protein expression levels of important Th1/Th2 cytokines in GGO and normal lung tissues and the changes in the composition ratio of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Then, we analyzed the effect of IL-6 on NK cells through organoid culture and immunofluorescence. Finally, we explored the changes of related molecules and pathway might be involved. RESULTS: IL-6 may play an important role in the tumor microenvironment of early lung adenocarcinoma. Further research confirmed that the decrease of IL-6 in GGO tissue is consistent with the changes in NK cells, and there seems to be a correlation between these two phenomena.

The emergence and resurgence of these diseases has been linked to environmental changes driven by human activities, particularly land use changes associated with deforestation, forest degradation, and urbanization. However, the effects of these environmental modifications on the transmission dynamics and the increase of infection risks are not well understood in Central America where information is limited and scattered. In this article, we review and analyze the current knowledge and potential impacts of deforestation and urbanization on the risk and transmission dynamics of the most relevant mosquito-borne and tick-borne diseases in Central America. Disease events, such as the recent Zika and dengue epidemics, and the uneven progress towards regional malaria elimination highlight the need to increase awareness regarding the complex ecological interactions and environmental changes taking place in this region and how this information could be used to improve prevention and control strategies. ABSTRACT: Central America is a unique geographical region that connects North and South America, enclosed by the Caribbean Sea to the East, and the Pacific Ocean to the West. This region, encompassing Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Nicaragua, is highly vulnerable to the emergence or resurgence of mosquito-borne and tick-borne diseases due to a combination of key ecological and socioeconomic determinants acting together, often in a synergistic fashion. Of particular interest are the effects of land use changes, such as deforestation-driven urbanization and forest degradation, on the incidence and prevalence of these diseases, which are not well understood. In recent years, parts of Central America have experienced social and economic improvements; however, the region still faces major challenges in developing effective strategies and significant investments in public health infrastructure to prevent and control these diseases. In this article, we review the current knowledge and potential impacts of deforestation, urbanization, and other land use changes on mosquito-borne and tick-borne disease transmission in Central America and how these anthropogenic drivers could affect the risk for disease emergence and resurgence in the region. These issues are addressed in the context of other interconnected environmental and social challenges.","output":"The Impact of Deforestation, Urbanization, and Changing Land Use Patterns on the Ecology of Mosquito and Tick-Borne Diseases in Central America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China, leading to worldwide morbidity and mortality, including depression and anxiety. As the pandemic spread throughout Italy, mental health concerns increased for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), who are at greater risk. The aim was to pilot a Telehealth Psychological Support Intervention for pwCF and caregivers to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety during the lockdown in Italy in March 2020. METHODS: This intervention utilized cognitive behavioral skills (e.g., cognitive reframing). Participants included 16 pwCF and 14 parents, who completed four individual telehealth sessions with a psychologist. Stress ratings, Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder, PHQ-8 and GAD-7, were completed, in addition to Feasibility and Satisfaction ratings. RESULTS: Ratings of stress significantly decreased from pre- to post-testing for pwCF (paired t(14) = -4.06, p < .01) and parents (paired t = -5.2, p < .001). A large percentage of both groups scored in the clinical range for depression and anxiety at baseline (pwCF: depression/anxiety = 71%; parents: depression = 57%; anxiety = 79%); a large proportion (20%-40%) reported moderate to severe symptomatology. Significant reductions in depression for pwCF were found (pre: M = 8.0 to post: M = 4.7; paired t(14) = 2.8, p < .05) but not anxiety (pre: M = 6.9 to post: M = 5.6, t(14) = 1.2, p = NS-non-significant).

This makes it particularly interesting to compare the hominid neural cells of the neocortex, a part of the brain that plays central roles in those processes. However, well-preserved tissue from great apes is usually extremely difficult to obtain. A variety of new alternative tools, e.g. brain organoids, are now beginning to make it possible to search for such differences and analyse their potential biological and biomedical meaning. Here we present an overview of recent findings from comparisons of the neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) and neurons of hominids. In addition to differences in proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs, and maturation of neurons, we highlight that the regulation of the timing of these processes is emerging as a general foundational difference in the development of the neocortex of hominids.","output":"From stem and progenitor cells to neurons in the developing neocortex - key differences among hominids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), capable of zoonotic transmission, has been associated with emerging viral pneumonia in humans. In this study, a set of highly potent peptides were designed to prevent MERS-CoV fusion through competition with heptad repeat domain 2 (HR2) at its HR1 binding site. We designed eleven peptides with stronger estimated HR1 binding affinities than the wild-type peptide to prevent viral fusion with the cell membrane. Eight peptides showed strong inhibition of spike-mediated MERS-CoV cell-cell fusion with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (0.25-2.3 microM). Peptides #4-6 inhibited 95-98.3% of MERS-CoV plaque formation. Notably, peptide four showed strong inhibition of MERS-CoV plaques formation with EC50 = 0.302 microM. All peptides demonstrated safe profiles without cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 10 muM, and this cellular safety, combined with their anti-MERS-CoV antiviral activity, indicate all peptides can be regarded as potential promising antiviral agents.","output":"Discovery of New Potent anti-MERS CoV Fusion Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread worldwide with over 260 million people infected and more than 5 million deaths, numbers that are escalating on a daily basis.

There is an urgent need for better triage of patients, especially in third world countries, in order to decrease the pressure induced on healthcare facilities. In the struggle to treat life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, scientists have debated the clinical use of ionizing radiation (IR). The historical literature dating back to the 1940s contains many reports of successful treatment of pneumonia with IR. In this work, we critically review the literature for the use of IR for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. We identify details including the computed tomography (CT) scanning considerations, the radiobiological basis of IR anti-inflammatory effects, the supportive evidence for low dose radiation therapy (LDRT), and the risks of radiation-induced cancer and cardiac disease associated with LDRT.

To characterize how SO initiation patterns have changed over time, we examined the long-term effectiveness of SO in a contemporary (2018-2019) cohort. Patients and Methods: Adult Fresenius Kidney Care hemodialysis patients first prescribed SO monotherapy as part of routine care between May 2018 and May 2019 (N = 1792) were followed for 1 year. All patients received a non-SO PB during a 91-day baseline period before SO prescription. Mean PB pills/day and laboratory parameters were compared before and during SO treatment. Results were divided into consecutive 91-day intervals (Q1-Q4) and analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression and Cochran's Q test. These results were contrasted with findings from a historical (2014-2015) cohort (N = 530). Results: The proportion of patients achieving sP 5.5 mg/dl increased after switching to SO (from 27.0% at baseline to 37.8%, 45.1%, 44.7%, and 44.0% at Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all). The mean daily PB pill burden decreased from a baseline of 7.7 to 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, and 4.9, respectively, across quarters (P < 0.0001 for all). Patients in the contemporary cohort had improved sP control (27.0% achieving sP 5.5 mg/dl vs 17.7%) and lower daily PB pill burden (mean 7.7 vs 8.5 pills/day) at baseline than those in the historical cohort. Overall use of active vitamin D was similar between cohorts, although higher use of oral active vitamin D (63.9% vs 15.7%) and lower use of IV active vitamin D lower (23.4% vs 74.2%) was observed in the contemporary cohort. Conclusion: Despite evolving treatment patterns, switching to SO resulted in improved sP control with fewer pills per day in this contemporary hemodialysis cohort.","output":"Serum Phosphorus and Pill Burden Among Hemodialysis Patients Prescribed Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide: One-Year Follow-Up on a Contemporary Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three coatings suitable for biomedical applications, including the dispersion coating composed of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), MWCNTs/TiO2 bi-layer coating, and MWCNTs-Cu dispersion coating, were fabricated by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) on Ti Grade II substrate.

Psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, stress, and disturbances are common among health care workers. The factors causing stress in health workers include workload fear of being infected with COVID-19 the negative stigma of virus carriers and being away from family. The research proposed to know the relationship between psychological condition and sleep quality. Methods: The research population consists of all nurses who have worked in the COVID room. This research used descriptive correlation with a cross-sectional approach. The samples were collected using a simple random sampling technique with 30 respondents as inclusion and exclusion criteria. The questionnaires Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were completed by the respondent. Data analysis was used in Chi-Square. Results: Most of the respondents were females (66.67%) over the age of 30 (70%). Most of them had a nursing education diploma (60%). They were dominant and had normal levels of depression (96.67%) anxiety (86.67%) and stress (93.33%). Most of them had poor sleep quality (63.33%). According to the findings the p-values for depression anxiety and stress in sleep quality were 0.43 0.73 and 0.26. It represents that no relationship exists between one variable and another. Meanwhile some respondents have mild depression, moderate anxiety, and mild stress with poor sleep quality.

Although neurological symptoms are being reported worldwide, neural acute and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown. COVID-19 complications are associated with exacerbated immunoinflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 invasion. In this scenario, pro-inflammatory factors are intensely released into the bloodstream, causing the so-called cytokine storm. Both pro-inflammatory factors and viruses may cross the bloodCbrain barrier and enter the central nervous system, activating neuroinflammatory responses accompanied by hemorrhagic lesions and neuronal impairment, which are largely described processes in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection could trigger and/or worse brain diseases. Moreover, patients with central nervous system disorders associated to neuroimmune activation (e.g. depression, Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease) may present increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or achieve severe conditions. Elevated levels of extracellular ATP induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger hyperactivation of P2X7 receptors leading to NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation as a key mediator of neuroinvasion and consequent neuroinflammatory processes, as observed in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, P2X7 receptor antagonism could be a promising strategy to prevent or treat neurological complications in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Hyperactivation of P2X7 receptors as a culprit of COVID-19 neuropathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the field of mitochondrial medicine, correlation of clinical phenotype with mutation heteroplasmy remains an outstanding question with few, if any, clear thresholds corresponding to a given phenotype.

Patient risk stratification models to identify low-risk patients can help improve patient care processes and allocate limited resources. Many existing deterioration indices are based entirely on structured data from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and ignore important information from other data sources. However, chest radiographs have been demonstrated to be helpful in predicting the progress of respiratory diseases. We developed a joint EHR and chest x-ray (CXR) model method and applied it to identify low-risk COVID19+ patients within the first 48 hours of hospital admission. METHODS: All COVID19+ patients admitted to a large urban hospital between March 2020 and February 2021 were included. We trained an image model using large public chest radiograph datasets and fine-tuned this model to predict acute dyspnea using a cohort from the same hospital. We then combined this image model with two existing EHR deterioration indices to predict the risk of a COVID19+ patient being intubated, receiving a nasal cannula, or being treated with a vasopressor. We evaluated models ability to identify low-risk patients by using the positive predictive value (PPV). RESULTS: The image-augmented deterioration index was able to identify 12% of 716 COVID-19+ patients as low risk with 0.95 positive predictive value in the first 48 hours of admission. In contrast, when used individually, the EHR and CXR models each identified roughly 3% of the patients with a PPV of 0.95.

The bottom plot compares the MCURES fused model to the MCURES model. The top plot compares the EDI fused model to the EDI model. CONCLUSION: Our multi-modal models were able to identify far more patients at low-risk of COVID19 deterioration than models trained on either modality alone. This indicates the importance of combining structured data with chest X-rays when creating a deterioration index performance for infectious respiratory-track diseases.

However, for the development of MV-based recombinant vaccine candidates (rMV), an immune competent mouse model is desirable in order to induce and evaluate meaningful immune response. In this study, humoral and cellular immune response induced by rMV in immune competent mice expressing human MV receptor CD46 (hCD46tg) were compared with those induced in wild-type black/6, and IFNARCD46tg mice. All three strains developed humoral and cellular response against MV, whereas only hCD46tg and IFNARCD46tg mice developed a humoral response against the transgene. Differences were observed in the magnitude of the response, where the IFNARCD46tg mice displayed the strongest immune responses, followed by the hCD46tg mice and the black/6 mice. Interestingly, hCD46tg and wt black/6 mice showed a predominant CD4(+) T-cell response against MV-N, whereas IFNARCD46tg mice developed both, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell response against MV-N. Analysis of the cytokine profile of MV-N specific CD4(+) T-cells and transgene (SIVgag) specific CD8(+) T-cells revealed qualitative differences of the T-cell responses; noticeably a significant reduction of the frequency of CD4(+)IL-2(+) expressing cells in IFNARCD46tg mice as compared with hCD46tg or wt black/6 mice.

With a target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, EHE initially scales up effective HIV prevention and care in 57 localities that comprise the greatest proportion of annual HIV diagnoses in the United States (US). However, the EHE effort has been eclipsed by another infectious disease eleven months into the Initiatives implementation. SARS\\\\COV\\\\2, a novel coronavirus, has infected more than eight million Americans and at least 223,000 (as of October 23, 2020) have succumbed to the disease. This commentary explores the social conditions that place communities of color at greater risk for COVID\\\\19 and HIV, and assesses challenges to EHE in a post COVID\\\\19 universe. DISCUSSION: One of the many common threads between HIV and COVID\\\\19 is the disproportionate impact of each disease among communities of color. A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences surmised that as much as 70% of health outcomes are due to health access, socioeconomic factors and environmental conditions. Social determinants of health associated with greater HIV burden in Black and Brown communities have re\\\\emerged in epidemiological studies of disproportionate COVID\\\\19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in communities of color. Using data from the scientific literature, this commentary makes direct comparisons between HIV and COVID\\\\19 racial disparities across the social determinants of health. Further, I examine three sets of challenges facing EHE: 1. Challenges that hamper both the EHE and COVID\\\\19 response (i.e. insufficiently addressing the social determinants of health; amplification of disparities as new health technologies are introduced) 2. Challenges posed by COVID\\\\19 (i.e. diverting HIV resources to address COVID\\\\19 and tapering of EHE funding generally); and 3. Challenges unrelated to COVID\\\\19 (i.e. emergence of new and related health disparities; repeal of the Affordable Care Act and long\\\\term viability of EHE). CONCLUSION: Racism and discrimination place communities of color at greater risk for COVID\\\\19 as well as HIV. Achieving and sustaining an end to the U.S. HIV epidemic will require structural change to eliminate conditions that give rise to and maintain disparities.","output":"New Pathogen, Same Disparities: Why COVID\\\\19 and HIV Remain Prevalent in U.S. Communities of Color and Implications for Ending the HIV Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chalcones are secondary metabolites belonging to the flavonoid (C(6)-C(3)-C(6) system) family that are ubiquitous in edible and medicinal plants, and they are bioprecursors of plant flavonoids.

Unfortunately, neurology residents are increasingly uncomfortable performing fundoscopy and interpreting findings because of diminishing skills and lack of experience. This became more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic as fundoscopy requires proximity to the patient. With the recent dramatic improvement of smartphone cameras, fundus photography using the PanOptic Ophthalmoscope (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY) with a smartphone adapter offered an alternative to direct fundoscopic examination. We present the first experience with our own design of a universal smartphone adapter. METHODS: This is a single-center case series, consecutive for a single user and certain presenting neurological symptoms, which is aimed to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of a new, universal PanOptic smartphone adapter. Presenting symptoms included headache, ocular symptoms, seizure, or encephalopathy. We used 3D modeling and printing techniques to create the adapter. We also developed a methodology of capturing stereoscopic images of the optic disc using a single smartphone camera, but the method was not systematically evaluated in this paper. RESULTS: Here we present our initial experience of fundus video/photography in patients, who presented with encephalopathy, headache, seizure, vision loss, and other ocular symptoms. Fundoscopic abnormalities were discovered in 11 out of 100 patients. Some were incidental findings and were unrelated to the presentation. In one case, fundoscopy played a critical role in establishing the correct diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our custom-designed smartphone adapter allowed obtaining high-quality video and photo recordings using PanOptic Ophthalmoscope. The acquisition of high-quality photos enables a high-yield diagnostic tool and allows revisiting the image in the patients chart. Improvement of smartphone cameras opens vast horizons for stereo-fundoscopy and 3D reconstruction of the ocular fundus without using sophisticated and costly equipment.

Consideration is also given to economic advantage, resilience, compliance, and sustainability emerging from transparency in financial processes that comes with digital data sharing. The chapter provides a practical framework to identifying the role of maritime informatics in supporting financial management and decision-making by classifying cost/risk categories and digital data streams of relevance by looking at three dimensions: resiliency, compliance, and sustainability.","output":"Support for Financial Decision-Making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polypeptide variants of the HA1 antigenic domain of the H5N1 avian influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) molecule were produced in plants using transient and stable expression systems and fused with His/c-myc tags or with mouse or human Fc antibody fragments.

To resolve this inconsistency, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to precisely examine the association between BMI and UTI. METHODS This meta-analysis was performed based on the PRISMA recommendations. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched for all published observational studies that reported the risk of UTI based on BMI categories up to March 2020. RESULTS Fourteen (n = 14) articles comprising 19 studies in different populations met our inclusion criteria. The overall analysis showed a significant increased risk of UTI in subjects affected by obesity vs. individuals without obesity (RR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.28 - 1.63; I2 = 94%), and a non-significant increased risk of UTI in subjects who were overweight (RR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.10; I2 = 49.6%) and underweight (RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.81 - 21; I2 = 0.0%) when compared to subjects who had normal weight. In the stratified analysis, we showed that obesity increased the risk of UTI in females (RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.38 - 1.93) and in subjects below 60 years old (RR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.33 - 1.75). CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta-analysis recognized a significant relationship between BMI and incidence of UTI in obese vs. non-obese subjects, as well as in females and in individuals below 60 years old.","output":"Association between body mass index and urinary tract infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Constructivist theory defines a learning process whereby a learner denotes meaning for him/herself as he/she learns Its challenges inform us that focus and intervention needs to be given to our curricular and instructional material, so that we may have something to offer students in the next century in terms of scientific development, drawing us into technological isolation Study seeks to ascertain readability of some textbooks used in the teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics in tertiary institutions in Delta State We chose 72 institutions using quota sampling To uphold the virtues of internationalization, results show we must devise strategies against de-territorializing of knowledge And thus, redefine educational goals to meet globalization as a means of network and unification Thus, constructivism yields and apt description of both individual, group and organizational adoption patterns of technology for teaching and learning across disciplines at the various schools and educational levels It images exemplary practices for teaching, learning and research, highlighting evidences that links technology integration, readability and quality students learning ? 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science All rights reserved","output":"Extending the three-tier constructivist learning model for alternative delivery: Ahead the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amplicon-based sequencing methods have been central in characterizing the diversity, transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, but need to be rigorously assessed for clinical utility.

Methods A multi-institutional database was utilized to assess all COVID-19 patients supported with and separated from ECMO between March 2020 and December 2021, inclusive. Descriptive analysis was stratified by four time categories: Group-A=3/20-6/20, Group-B=7/20-12/20, Group-C=1/21-6/21, Group D=7/21-12/21. A Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression was used to assess continuous trends in survival where time was operationalized as the number of days between each patients cannulation and that of the first patient in March 2020, controlling for multiple variables and risk factors. Results At hospital discharge, of 594 patients: 221 survived (37.2%) and 373 died. Throughout the study: median age [interquartile range] declined (Group-A=51.0[41.0-60.0], Group-D=39.0[32.0-48.0], P<.001); median days between COVID-19 diagnosis and intubation increased Group-A=4.0[1.0-8.5], Group-D=9.0[5.0-14.5], P<.001); use of medications (glucocorticoids, interleukin-6 blockers, anti-virals, anti-malarials) and convalescent plasma fluctuated significantly (all P<.001). Estimated odds of survival varied over the study period with a decline between 1Apr20 and 21Nov20 (OR=0.39, 95% credibility interval (CrI)=[0.8-0.87], probability of reduction in survival=95.7%), improvement between 21Nov20 and 17May21 (OR=1.85, 95% CrI=[0.86-4.09], probability of improvement=93.4%), and decline from 17May21 and 1Dec21 (OR=0.49, 95% Cr=[0.19-1.44], probability of decrease=92.1%).

METHODS: In total, 21 patients who received autologous or allogeneic HCT for hematological malignancies were screened from April 30, 2020, to July 15, 2020. The telehealth platform assisted in the daily collection of vital signs as well as physical and psychological symptoms for two weeks after hospital discharge. The required medical devices (oximeter and blood pressure monitor) were given to patients and a dedicated smartphone app was developed to collect this data. The data were reviewed daily through web-based software by a hematologist specializing in HCT. RESULTS: Only 12 of 21 patients were able to join and complete the study. Technological barriers were the most frequent limiting factor in this study. Among the 12 patients who completed the study, adherence to data reporting was high. The patients experience of using such a system was considered good. In two cases, the system enabled the early recognition of acute complications. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that telehealth systems can be applied in the early posttransplant setting, with evident advantages for physicians and patients for both medical and psychological aspects.

Various language measures have been studied as cognitive predictors of MCI conversion to Alzheimer's type dementia. Understanding textual inferences is considered a high-demanding task that recruits multiple cognitive functions and, therefore, could be sensitive to detect decline in the early stages of MCI. Thus, we aimed to compare the performance of subjects with MCI to healthy elderly in a textual inference comprehension task and to determine the best predictors of performance in this ability considering one verbal episodic memory and two semantic tasks. We studied 99 individuals divided into three groups: (1) 23 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), (2) 42 individuals with non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), (3), and (4) 34 cognitively healthy individuals for the control group (CG). A reduced version of The Implicit Management Test was used to assess different types of inferential reasoning in text reading. MCI patients performed poorer than healthy elderly, and there were no differences between MCI subgroups (amnestic and non-amnestic). The best predictors for inference-making were verbal memory in the aMCI and semantic tasks in the naMCI group. The results confirmed that the failure to understand textual inferences can be present in MCI and showed that different cognitive skills like semantic knowledge and verbal episodic memory are necessary for inference-making.","output":"Textual Inference Comprehension in Mild Cognitive Impairment: The Influence of Semantic Processing and Verbal Episodic Memory."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic requires accurate identification and isolation of confirmed cases for effective control.

We have examined the growth properties of three JHM virus isolates in primary rat glial cultures and found a correlation with their ability to cause disease. Wild type JHM virus has the propensity to cause lytic infections in glial cultures, and a temperature-sensitive mutant designated JHM-ts43 invariably produces persistent infections with reduced cytopathic effects (CPE) as compared to the wild type. Moreover, a non-neurotropic isolate, designated JHM-Pi virus, produces either non-productive persistent infections at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) or productive persistent infections at high m.o.i., with, however, no CPE. The phenotypic expression of persistence is glial cell-dependent, since all three viruses produce similarly lytic infections when grown on various susceptible cell lines. The genetic basis of JHM virus persistence can be explained at the level of direct virus-glial cell interactions.","output":"Growth pattern of various JHM coronavirus isolates in primary rat glial cell cultures correlates with differing neurotropism in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study evaluated the build-back-better considerations in post-disaster recovery, following the devastation of Chipinge and Chimanimani communities by Cyclone Idai-induced floods in 2019.

Alternatively, utilization of old drugs or available medicine that can suppress the viral activity or replication may provide an urgent solution to suppress the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV. Andrographolide is a highly abundant natural product of the medicinal plant, Andrographis paniculata, which has been clinically used for inflammatory diseases and anti-viral therapy. We herein demonstrate that both andrographolide and its fluorescent derivative, the nitrobenzoxadiazole-conjugated andrographolide (Andro- NBD), suppressed the main protease (M(pro)) activities of 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Moreover, Andro-NBD was shown to covalently link its fluorescence to these proteases. Further mass spectrometry (MS) analysis suggests that andrographolide formed a covalent bond with the active site Cys(145) of either 2019-nCoV M(pro) or SARS-CoV M(pro). Consistently, molecular modeling analysis supported the docking of andrographolide within the catalytic pockets of both viral M(pro)s. Considering that andrographolide is used in clinical practice with acceptable safety and its diverse pharmacological activities that could be beneficial for attenuating COVID-19 symptoms, extensive investigation of andrographolide on the suppression of 2019-nCoV as well as its application in COVID-19 therapy is suggested.","output":"Andrographolide and its fluorescent derivative inhibit the main proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV through covalent linkage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with severe aortic stenosis are increasingly treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as a safer option to surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR).

Patient demographics, laboratory values, mechanical thrombectomy technique, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Four patients with COVID-19 presented with anterior circulation occlusions and one patient with COVID-19 presented with both anterior and posterior circulation occlusions. All patients had coagulation abnormalities. Mean patient age was 52.8 years. Three patients presented with an intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion. Two patients presented with an intracranial occlusion and a tandem thrombus in the carotid bulb. One patient presented with an occlusion in both the internal carotid and basilar arteries.

In this Review, we assess the advantages and challenges of bioplastics in transitioning towards a circular economy. Compared with fossil-based plastics, bio-based plastics can have a lower carbon footprint and exhibit advantageous materials properties; moreover, they can be compatible with existing recycling streams and some offer biodegradation as an EOL scenario if performed in controlled or predictable environments. However, these benefits can have trade-offs, including negative agricultural impacts, competition with food production, unclear EOL management and higher costs. Emerging chemical and biological methods can enable the upcycling of increasing volumes of heterogeneous plastic and bioplastic waste into higher-quality materials.

This study aimed to expose variations in dysphagia management practices and explore their associations with SAP. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS Speech pathologists from 166 stroke units in England and Wales were surveyed about dysphagia assessment and management, oral care, and NGT placement. Survey data were then linked to the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), the national register of stroke. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were fitted to estimate the association between dysphagia management practices and SAP incidence. RESULTS 113 hospitals completed the survey (68%). Variation was evident in dysphagia screening protocols (DSPs), oral care, and NGT practice while specialist swallow assessment data patterns were more consistent. Multivariable analysis showed no evidence of an association in incidence of SAP when using a water-only hospital DSP compared to a multiconsistency DSP (B -0.688, 95% CI: -2.912 to 1.536), when using written swallow assessment guidelines compared to not using written guidelines (B 0.671, 95% CI: -1.567 to 2.908), when teams inserted NGTs overnight compared to teams which did not (B -0.505, 95% CI: -2.759 to 1.749), and when teams had a written oral care protocol compared to those which did not (B -1.339, 95% CI: -3.551 to 0.873).

METHODS: We retrieved data from the national database on SARS-CoV-2 infections. We studied in-family transmission. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. RESULTS: We studied 203 SARS-CoV-2-infected children (median age: 11 years; range: 6 days to 18.4 years); 111 (54.7%) had an asymptomatic infection. Among the 92 children (45.3%) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 24 (26.1%) were hospitalized. Infants <1 year were more likely to develop COVID-19 (19.5% of all COVID-19 cases) (P-value = 0.001). There was no significant difference between viral load and age, sex, underlying condition, fever and hospitalization, as well as between type of SARS-CoV-2 infection and age, sex, underlying condition and viral load.

Methods Five databases were searched from inception to April 1, 2019 for studies reporting on SFTP management. Results Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria (1542 patients, all non-comparative case series); 98% of these patients underwent resection and all SFTP included were pathologically diagnosed. 394 out of 1299 cases (30.5%, 95% CI 27.8-32.8%) were malignant with recurrence rates of between 0% and 42.9%. A pleural effusion was always associated with a negative outcome, but no other features were consistently reported to have negative associations. Preoperative biopsies incorrectly reported malignant histology in two studies. Over 25% of cases of recurrence occurred when a complete (R0) resection had been achieved. The first recurrence occurred >5 years after the initial resection in at least 23% of cases. Conclusions There is strong evidence to support long-term surveillance after surgical resection of SFTP, even where a complete (R0) resection has been achieved; however, there is no clear evidence to inform clinicians regarding the selection of patients who should undergo resection. The rates of malignant SFTP and SFTP recurrence are higher than previously reported.

Israel provides an interesting case study based on the highly non-uniform distribution of urban populations, the existence of one of the most densely populated cities in the world and diversified populations. Moreover, COVID19 challenges the consensus regarding compact planning design. Consequently, it is important to analyze the relationship between COVID19 spread and population density. The outcomes of our study show that ceteris paribus projected probabilities to be infected from coronavirus rise with population density from 1.6 to 2.72% up to a maximum of 5.17C5.238% for a population density of 20,282C20,542 persons per square kilometer (sq. km.).

A possible interpretation is that while denser cities facilitate human interactions, they also enable and promote improved health infrastructure. This, in turn, contributes to medical literacy, namely, elevated awareness to the benefits associated with compliance with hygienic practices (washing hands), social distancing rules and wearing masks.

Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, first postoperative flatus time, time to out-of-bed activity, mean maximum postoperative body temperature, and duration of fever were all significantly shorter and less severe in the VH group compared with the AH group. In addition, vaginal length in the VH group was significantly shorter than in the AH group. CONCLUSIONS Vaginal hysterectomy has advantages over AH in the treatment of benign gynaecological diseases, providing greater efficacy and safety with minimal invasiveness.","output":"Comparison of vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy:A prospective non-randomized trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We defined inpatients with severe COVID-19 as those requiring admission to the Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU).

The transmission of lyssaviruses from bats-to-humans, domestic animals, or other wildlife species is uncommon, but interest in these pathogens remains due to their ability to cause an acute, progressive, invariably fatal encephalitis in humans. Consequently, the detection and characterisation of bat lyssaviruses continues to expand our knowledge of their phylogroup definition, viral diversity, host species association, geographical distribution, evolution, mechanisms for perpetuation, and the potential routes of transmission. Although the opportunity for lyssavirus cross-species transmission seems rare, adaptation in a new host and the possibility of onward transmission to humans requires continued investigation. Considering the limited efficacy of available rabies biologicals it is important to further our understanding of protective immunity to minimize the threat from these pathogens to public health. Hence, in addition to increased surveillance, the development of a niche pan-lyssavirus vaccine or therapeutic biologics for post-exposure prophylaxis for use against genetically divergent lyssaviruses should be an international priority as these emerging lyssaviruses remain a concern for global public health.","output":"Renewed Public Health Threat from Emerging Lyssaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: With significant levels of mental distress reported by populations, globally, the magnitude of suicidal ideation during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic is a central concern. The goal of this study was to quantify the extent of pandemic-related suicidal ideation in the Canadian population during the first ten months of the pandemic and identify sociodemographic and pandemic-related stressors associated with increased risk of ideation. METHOD: Data were derived from three rounds of a mental health monitoring survey, nationally representative by age, gender, household income, and region, delivered online in May and September 2020 and January 2021. Bivariate analyses were used to quantify the proportion of respondents in Canada reporting suicidal ideation by sociodemographic factors and pandemic-related stressors. Unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between suicidal ideation and correlates within four pandemic-related stressor categories (financial, relationship, substance use, COVID-19 exposure). RESULTS: Of the 7002 respondents, 6.2% (n = 433) reported experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings as a result of the pandemic within the two weeks prior to taking the survey. In terms of sociodemographic factors, suicidal ideation was more commonly reported among those who were not cisgender, <65 years-old, single, Indigenous, LGBT2Q+, and who experience a pre-existing mental health condition. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, indicators across all four pandemic-related stressor categories were associated with two or more times the odds of suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: Disparities in COVID-19 related suicidal ideation have persisted throughout the first year of the pandemic for specific sociodemographic sub-groups and those who have faced stressors related to finances, relationships, increased substance use, and COVID-19 virus exposure. To best address these disparities and to prevent a transition from suicidal ideation to action, appropriate planning, resources, and policies are needed to ensure health and well-being for everyone.","output":"Correlates of suicidal ideation related to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Repeated cross-sectional nationally representative Canadian data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: COVID-19 reached Belgium in February and quickly became a major public health challenge. It is of importance to evaluate the actual impact of COVID-19 on patients and staff in Belgian radiotherapy departments (RTDs). This was evaluated through a weekly national survey sent to departments measuring key factors that were affected by the pandemic. Materials and Methods: The Belgian SocieTy for Radiation Oncology (BeSTRO) together with the Belgian College for physicians in Radiation Oncology invited all 26 RTD to participate in a survey that started on March 2nd and was re- submitted weekly for 4 months to assess variations in time. The survey focused on: (1) the COVID-19 status of patients and staff; (2) the management of clinically suspected COVID patients and COVID positive patients; (3) the impact of COVID-19 on RTD activities; (4) its impact in radiotherapy indications and fractionation schemes. Results: Seventy-three percent of 26 RTDs completed the first survey and 57% responded to all weekly surveys. In the RTD staff, 24 members were COVID-positive of whom 67% were RTTs. Over the study period, the number of patients treated dropped by a maximum of 18.8% when compared to March 2nd. In 32.3% of COVID-positive and 54% of COVID suspected patients, treatment was continued without any interruptions. Radiotherapy indications were adapted within the 1st weeks of the survey in 47.4% of RTD, especially for urological and breast tumors. Fractionation schemes were changed in 68.4% of RTD, mainly for urological, breast, gastro-intestinal, and lung tumors. Conclusions: Between March and June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an important decrease in treatment activity in RTD in Belgium (18.8%). The COVID-19 infection status of patients influenced the continuity of the radiotherapy schedule.

Studies on BLV have shown the association with human breast cancer. However, the exact molecular mechanism is neither known nor their appropriate preventative measure to halt the disease initiation and progression. In this study, we designed a multi-epitope vaccine against BLV using a computational analyses. METHODS: Following a rigorous assessment, the vaccine was constructed using the T-cell epitopes from each BLV-derived protein with suitable adjuvant and linkers. Both physicochemistry and immunogenic potency as well as the safeness of the vaccine candidate were assessed. Population coverage was done to evaluate the vaccine probable efficiency in eliciting the immune response worldwide. After homology modeling, the three-dimensional structure was refined and validated to determine the quality of the designed vaccine. The vaccine protein was then subjected to molecular docking with Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) to evaluate the binding efficiency followed by dynamic simulation for stable interaction. RESULTS: Our vaccine construct has the potential immune response and good physicochemical properties. The vaccine is antigenic and immunogenic, and has no allergenic or toxic effect on the human body. This novel vaccine contains a significant interactions and binding affinity with the TLR3 receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed vaccine candidate would be structurally stable and capable of generating an effective immune response to combat BLV infections.

Hence, the rapid identification of COVID-19 has become a challenging work within a short period. Clinical trials of patients with COVID-19 have shown that most of the patients affected by COVID-19 experience lung infection that can cause inflammation in the lung after virus-contiguity. It can damage the cells and tissue that is inside the lung. However, pneumonia is also a lung infection that can cause inflammation in the air sacs inside the lung. Chest X-rays and CT scans perform an essential role in the detection of lung-related illnesses. Therefore, concerning the diagnosis of COVID-19, radiography and chest CT are considered as fundamental imaging approaches. This study presents a densely interconnected convolutional neural network-based approach to identify COVID-19, Pneumonia and Normal patients from chest X-ray images. To experiment with the proposed methodology, a new dataset is generated by combining two different datasets from Kaggle named COVID-19 Radiography Database and Chest X-ray (COVID-19 & Pneumonia). The dataset comprises of 500 X-ray images of COVID-19 affected people, 2600 X-ray images of Normal people, and 3418 X-ray images of pneumonia affected people.

We take advantage of the increasing mobile phone penetration rate in rural areas to evaluate the feasibility of using cell phones to monitor the provision of key health and nutrition interventions linked to the first 1,000 days of life, a critical period of growth and development. We examine response rates to calendarized text messages (SMS) and phone calls sent to 1,542 households over a period of four months. These households have children under two years old and pregnant women and are located across randomly selected communities in Quiche, Guatemala. We find that the overall (valid) response rate to phone calls is over 5 times higher than to text messages (75.8% versus 14.4%). We also test whether simple SMS reminders improve the timely reception of health services but do not find any effects in this regard. Language, education, and age appear to be major barriers to respond to text messages as opposed to phone calls, and the rate of response is not correlated with a household's geographic location (accessibility). Moreover, response veracity is high, with an 84-91% match between household responses and administrative records. The costs per monitored intervention are around 1.12 US dollars using text messages and 85 cents making phone calls, with the costs per effective answer showing a starker contrast, at 7.76 and 1.12 US dollars, respectively. Our findings indicate that mobile phone calls can be an effective, low-cost tool to collect reliable information remotely and in real time.

This link between singing and infection rates supports the possibility that aerosols are partly responsible for person-to-person infection. In contrast to droplets, the smaller aerosol particles do not fall to the ground within a short distance after being expelled by e.g. a singer. Aerosol particles hover and spread via convection in the environmental air. According to the super-spreading theory, choir singing and loud talking (theater and presentations) during rehearsals or performances may constitute a high risk of infectious virus transmission to large numbers of people. Thus, it is essential to define the safety distances between singers in super-spreading situations. The aim of this study is to investigate the impulse dispersion of aerosols during singing and speaking in comparison to breathing and coughing. Ten professional singers (5 males and 5 females) of the Bavarian Radio Chorus performed 9 tasks including singing a phrase of Beethovens 9th symphony, to the original German text. The inhaled air volume was marked with small aerosol particles produced via a commercial e-cigarette. The expelled aerosol cloud was recorded with three high definition TV cameras from different perspectives. Afterwards, the dimensions and dynamics of the aerosol cloud was measured by segmenting the video footage at every time point. While the median expansion was below 1m, the aerosol cloud was expelled up to 1.4m in the singing direction for individual subjects. Consonants produced larger distances of aerosol expulsion than vowels. The dispersion in the lateral and vertical dimension was less pronounced than the forward direction. After completion of each task, the cloud continued to distribute in the air increasing its dimensions. Consequently, we propose increasing the current recommendations of many governmental councils for choirs or singing at religious services from 1.5m to the front and 1m to the side to a distance between choir singers of 2m to the front and 1.5m to the sides.","output":"Impulse dispersion of aerosols during singing and speaking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on the analysis of scanpath data captured by an eye tracker as students solved problems with access to worked examples.

RESULTS: The statins should continue to use patients with COVID-19 based on their efficacy, safety, immunosuppressive effects, anti-inflammatory availability and accessibility. Depending on the cardiovascular risk levels of these patients, the use of high potency statins and/or ezetimibe and/or iPCSK9 may be necessary in patients with high and very high cardiovascular risk. Patients treated with iPCSK9 should continue treatment for its beneficial effects in preventing cardiovascular disease. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and COVID-19 are especially vulnerable to cardiovascular disease and should continue to receive severe lipid lowering therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, the majority of baseline CVDs are of atherosclerotic origin, with the worst prediction for patients with high risk and very high risk of CVD.

METHODS: We queried the electronic medical record system for an integrated health system of 10 hospitals in the Chicago metropolitan area to identify cases of COVID-19. Comorbidities and outcomes were ascertained by ICD-10-CM coding and medical record data. We evaluated the risk for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and respiratory failure associated with OSA by univariate tests and logistic regression, adjusting for diabetes, hypertension, and BMI to account for potential confounding in the association between OSA, COVID-19 hospitalization, and progression to respiratory failure. RESULTS: We identified 9405 COVID-19 infections, among which 3185 (34%) were hospitalized and 1779 (19%) were diagnosed with respiratory failure. OSA was more prevalent among patients requiring hospitalization than those who did not (15.3% versus 3.4%, p < 0.0001; OR 5.20, 95% CI (4.43, 6.12)), and among those who progressed to respiratory failure (19.4% versus 4.5%, p < 0.0001; OR 5.16, 95% CI (4.41, 6.03)).

The model has been trained on these set of images and got 94% of accuracy on training dataset and 96% of accuracy on validation dataset. The proposed model has achieved the test accuracy of 94% for 3 classes in Chest X-Ray image classification. The main motive behind developing this model is to reduce its computational time by using less layers and more hyper parameter tuning. The proposed model is compared with pre-existing models as they were more complex and took much training time. Till now 94% of accuracy has been achieved on test dataset. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"COVID-19 Diagnosis using X-Ray Images and Deep learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is a wireless networking technology which operates without using any cables or wiring.

Hypothalamic lesion could cause neuroendocrine obesity. Hypothalamic obesity could be reproduced through ventromedial hypothalamic lesion in animals and attenuated that by subdiafragmatic vagotomy (VT). VT decreased food intake and insulinemia. Injection of monosodium glutamate (MSG) neonatally in rats produces adiposity, hyperphagia, without weight gain because it injures arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, site of growth hormone releasing hormone production. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the MSG effect on weight, stature, Lee index (3 square root body weight/nasoanal length), gonadal fat (GF) and food intake in rats and the VT effect on these parameters. Fifty-two male Wistar rats were used, divided into two groups of twenty-six animals each. SALINA group was subcutaneously injected with saline solution 12.5% (1.25 mg/g body weight/dayly/5days) and MSG group was injected with MSG solution 24% (4 mg/g body weight/dayly/5 days), after the rats were born, in the posterior cervical region without adverse reaction. On the 30th day of life, the animals were divided into four groups and submitted to operation, sham operated groups (LAPSAL and LAPMSG) and vagotomized groups (VTSAL and VTMSG). On operation day, weight, nasoanal length (NAL) and Lee index were obtained. Food intake were obtained from the 30th day until 90th day. On 90th day, the animals were sacrificed and weight, NAL, Lee index and GF were obtained. Statistic analysis was performed by the Students t test. NAL was smaller and Lee index was greater in MSG group than in SALINA group on the 30th day. Weight gain and NAL were smaller and Lee index and GF were greater on the 90th day, and food intake from the 30th to 90th day period was greater in LAPMSG group than in LAPSAL group. Weight gain, Lee index and GF were smaller and NAL trended smaller in VTMSG group than in LAPMSG group on the 90th day. Food intake from the 30th to 60th day period was smaller and trended greater from the 60th to 90th day period in VTMSG group than in LAPMSG. Vagal regeneration could explain that food intake inversion. These results suggest that MSG injected neonatally increases food intake and adiposity, and decreases stature and weight gain from the 30th to 90th day period. VT performed on the 30th day decreases food intake in first 30 days and decreases weight gain, Lee index and GF in MSG injected rats.","output":"Efeito da vagotomia troncular em ratos injetados na fase neonatal com glutamato monossdico: estudo biomtrico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are gratified to see the broad discussion of our manuscript, \\"Use of SARS-CoV-2 infected deceased organ donors: Should we always 'just say no?'\\" and the companion manuscript by Shah et al., \\"Utilization of deceased donors during a pandemic: An argument against using SARS-CoV-2 positive donors.\\"1,2 Our viewpoint argues that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic donors is likely very low.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the decision to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza in cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey prepared by the authors was made available to patients at the Chemotherapy Department at the Greater Poland Cancer Center. The survey covered 236 respondents, both female (67.4%, n = 159) and male (32.6%, n =77). A 0C10 point numerical scale was used to assess the fear of coronavirus infection and the influenza. Data were collected from June 8 to September 30, 2020. The survey included 25 questions. The patients were informed by physicians about the voluntary and anonymous nature of the survey, to which they gave their oral consent. IBM SPSS Statistics 26 was used for the analysis. RESULTS: The vast majority of patients (69.5%, n = 164) have never been vaccinated against influenza and 30.5% (n = 72) have been vaccinated at least once in the past. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost ? of the patients (24.6%, n = 58) stated that they wanted to be vaccinated against influenza. Only 33.5% (n = 79) of the respondents believed that the influenza vaccine was effective.

They are critical global nodes that link the world and facilitate economic development. In 2020, the global aviation industry was brought to a near standstill by the COVID-19 pandemic, with devastating global economic and associated impacts. This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the airports sector. Using archival and secondary data from authoritative sources such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), EUROCONTROL and Flightradar24, it emerged that COVID-19 had a negative impact on airport operations mainly affecting their revenue streams. Travel restrictions and border closures had a debilitating impact on the airports and the aviation component of the tourism industry. With airlines grounded, the airports converted into parking lots and ghost towns. With this, there were drastic declines in receipt in landing, departure fees and non-aeronautical revenue. The remaining limited operations that continued in many airports related to service and facilitate the delivery of medical and other essential supplies, including food and critical raw materials. These could not raise adequate revenues to sustain many airports. Globally, the closure of airports also affected more than 6 million people directly employed in these airport-related services, including shops, car rental companies, airport restaurants and that of air navigation systems. The study recommends that the same support offered to the aviation industry in the form of grants, tax exemptions, preferential loans and so on be extended to airports.

METHODS: We searched in four bibliographic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science) for studies March 10, 2020 focused on the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV for meta-analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to quality assessment, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger's test. In the meta-analysis, a random-effects model with Stata/SE software, v.14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) was used to obtain a pooled incidence rate. RESULTS: Fifty studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis with 8815 patients and the mean age was 46 years and 4647 (52.7%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of clinical symptoms were: fever (83%, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.89), cough (59%, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.69), myalgia or fatigue (31%, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.39), sputum production (29%, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.39), and dyspnea (19%, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.26).

Our results reveal that regions where the outbreak had just started when the lockdown was implemented had 1.62 fewer daily deaths per 100,000 inhabitants when compared to regions for which the lockdown arrived 10+ days after the pandemics outbreak. As a result, a total of 4,642 total deaths (232 deaths/daily) could have been avoided by the end of our period of study Ca figure representing 23% of registered deaths in Spain at the time. We rule out differential pre-COVID mortality trends and self-distancing behaviors across the compared regions prior to the swift lockdown, which was also uniformly observed nationwide.

In the US, three highly effective Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Cauthorized vaccines are currently available, and Remdesivir is approved for the treatment of hospitalized patients. However, moderate vaccination rates and the sustained evolution of new viral variants necessitate the ongoing search for new antivirals. Several viral proteins have been prioritized as SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug targets, among them the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the main protease (Mpro). Inhibition of these proteases would target viral replication, viral maturation, and suppression of host innate immune responses. Knowledge of inhibitors and assays for viruses were quickly adopted for SARS-CoV-2 protease research. Potential candidates have been identified to show inhibitory effects against PLpro and Mpro, both in biochemical assays and viral replication in cells. These results encourage further optimizations to improve prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we examine the latest developments of potential small-molecule inhibitors and peptide inhibitors for PLpro and Mpro, and how structural biology greatly facilitates this process.","output":"Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Proteases for COVID-19 Antiviral Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate both the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) admission, and demographic, angiographic, procedural characteristics, and in-hospital clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 positive STEMI in Turkey. METHODS: This was a multi-center and cross-sectional observational study. The study population included 1788 STEMI patients from 15 centers in Turkey. The patients were divided into two groups: COVID-19 era (March 11stCMay 15st, 2020; n = 733) or pre- COVID-19 era group (March 11stCMay 15st, 2019; n = 1055). Also, the patients in COVID-19 era were grouped as COVID-19 positive (n = 65) or negative (n = 668). RESULTS: There was a 30.5% drop in STEMI admission during COVID-19 era in comparison to pre-COVID-19 era. The patients admitted to the medical centers during COVID-19 era had a longer symptom-to-first medical contact time [120 (75C240) vs. 100 (60C180) minutes, p < 0.001]. COVID-19 positive STEMI patients had higher thrombus grade and lower left ventricular ejection fraction compared to COVID-19 negative patients. COVID-19 positive patients had higher mortality (28% vs. 6%, p < 0.001) and cardiogenic shock (20% vs. 7%, p < 0.001) rates compared with those without COVID-19. Matching based on propensity scores showed higher mortality and high thrombus grade in STEMI patients who were infected by SARS-COV-2 (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We detected significantly lower STEMI hospitalization rates and significant delay in duration of symptom onset to first medical contact in the context of Turkey during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Additional to functioning as a protease inhibitor, A1AT is an important acute phase protein. Here, we set out to compare the proteoform profiles of A1AT purified from the human serum and milk of eight healthy donors to determine the origin of human milk A1AT. Following affinity purification, size-exclusion chromatography coupled to native mass spectrometry was used to monitor individual proteoform profiles comparing inter- and intra-donor profiles. The A1AT intra-donor proteoform profiles were found to be highly identical between serum and milk, while they were highly distinct between donors, even when comparing only serum or milk samples. The observed inter-donor proteoform variability was due to differences in the abundances of different N-glycoforms, mainly due to branching, fucosylation, and the relative abundance of N-terminally processed A1AT fragments. From our data we conclude that nearly all A1AT in serum and milk is synthesized by a common source, i.e. the liver, and then secreted into the circulation and enters the mammary gland via diffusion or transport.

The louder the noise is, the harder it is for health opinions within a group to reach a consensus. But even in a noisy environment, super-influencers could influence the overall cognition on public health in the social network fundamentally. When the super-influencers held positive opinions in public health, the medical elite keeping silent had a noise-tolerant effect on opinion communication in public health, and vice versa.

Most Israeli respondents completed the survey in Hebrew (83.2%) followed by Arabic (9.4%), though responses were recorded in all seven of the survey languages. The median age was 33 (IQ = 22) years, and 75.7% were female. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet, and 25.2% indicated they had gained weight during the pandemic. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQ = 3). While the median General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score was 5 (IQ = 8), only 37.3% of participants reported at least mild anxiety (a GAD-7 score of 5 or more), while 10.7% reported moderate anxiety or greater (a GAD-7 score of 10 or more). In a multivariate logistic regression model of at least mild anxiety, being male and completing the survey in Hebrew significantly reduced odds of at least mild anxiety, while a worsening of diet quality during the pandemic, weight gain, and isolation significantly increased odds of at least mild anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID pandemic, changes in nutrition quality and habits were associated with greater anxiety. These findings suggest the need for routine and continuous surveillance of the nutritional and psychological consequences of outbreaks as part of healthcare preparedness efforts. Organizations responsible for community-based health services (such as Israeli health plans) should adopt specific interventions to improve case finding and support individuals at increased risk of anxiety and declining nutrition status within primary healthcare settings. These interventions should include the provision of appropriate diagnostic instruments, training of medical staff, feedback to physicians and nurses, and raising awareness among the relevant patient population and their caregivers. Primary care physicians should refer people with high anxiety or substantial weight gain during the pandemic to appropriate mental health and dietetic treatment, as needed.

In this chapter, we first (Sect. 7.1) recapitulate the development of these arrays and highlight a couple of key improvements in the array production and the application in proteomics research. For clinical and biomarker development applications, it is important to measure entities that are directly related to physiological function (and dysfunction). In this respect, the assessment of enzymatic activities is obviously preferable to genotyping, expression profiling, or even measurement of protein amounts. In Sect. 7.2, an original technology based on peptides arrayed onto a porous support allows detailed profiling of kinase activities in a biological sample. The applications described range from kinase characterization to inhibition profiles, detection of off-target effects, and drug response prediction in a clinical setting, allowing rational choice of the drug to be used. Such directly functional approaches will have an important role in the transition to more personalized medicine. Finally, in Sect. 7.3, a recently developed method for laser printing of peptide arrays that will make these approaches much more practical is presented.","output":"Peptide Arrays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sledding is generally considered to be a relatively harmless winter leisure activity. The increased incidence of injuries, some of them severe, in our emergency department in the catchment area of several sledding slopes prompted an analysis of this patient population with respect to frequency and severity of injuries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on the hospital documentation system, a retrospective evaluation of all emergency department visits in the winters 2016C2019 was performed. The words sled, sledge, bob, sledding, sleighing, sledging were used as keywords, and the recorded data were analyzed with respect to outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, inpatient treatment days, treatment days in the intensive care unit, number of necessary operations, injury patterns, and injury severity. RESULTS: A total of 175 injured patients were recorded over the 3?year period. In 94 patients (54%) the injury was classified as mild, 70 patients (40%) required inpatient treatment with an average length of stay of 8 days, resulting in a total of 590 inpatient treatment days. Surgical treatment was given to 49 (28%) of the injured with a total of 66 operations, 81 patients suffered from severe injuries up to multiple trauma with an injury severity score (ISS) of 34. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that sledding has a significantly higher injury potential than generally assumed and that the resulting costs and consequences of accidents are relevant. Especially on the designated sledge slopes, an increase in safety standards could be achieved through appropriate measures and rules.","output":"Das untersch?tzte Verletzungsrisiko beim Rodeln im Freizeitsport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Establishing a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and distinguishing it from other forms of interstitial lung diseases represents a common challenge in clinical practice. This review summarizes the latest literature and guidelines on HP while integrating some real-life conundrums. RECENT FINDINGS Advances in the understanding of the pathobiology of fibrotic HP and other progressive pulmonary fibrosis have changed how we approach the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung disease. Classifications now embrace distinguishing two clinical phenotypes: nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP because of distinct disease behavior and prognosis implications. International guidelines on HP were recently published and proposed a framework and algorithm to guide the diagnostic process. SUMMARY The diagnosis of HP relies on the integration of multiples domains: clinical assessment of exposure, imaging, bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytosis and histopathological findings. These features are reviewed in multidisciplinary discussion and lead to an estimation of the degree of confidence for HP diagnosis. Further research is warranted to improve knowledge on the pathophysiology of HP and ultimately improve its diagnostic approaches.","output":"Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis: real world diagnostic criteria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Homeless shelters are a high-risk setting for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission because of crowding and shared hygiene facilities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 case counts across several adult and family homeless shelters in a major metropolitan area. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, community-based surveillance study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04141917) SETTING: 14 homeless shelters in King County, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1434 study encounters were done in shelter residents and staff, regardless of symptoms. INTERVENTION: Two strategies were used for SARS-CoV-2 testing: routine surveillance and contact tracing (surge testing) events. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was test positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection at shelters, determined by dividing the number of positive cases by the total number of participant encounters, regardless of symptoms. Sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic variables were assessed as correlates of viral positivity. RESULTS: Among 1434 encounters, 29 (2% [95% CI, 1.4% to 2.9%]) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected across 5 shelters. Most (n = 21 [72.4%]) were detected during surge testing events rather than routine surveillance, and most (n = 21 [72.4% {CI, 52.8% to 87.3%}]) were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection. Persons who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently aged 60 years or older than those without SARS-CoV-2 (44.8% vs. 15.9%). Eighty-six percent of persons with positive test results slept in a communal space rather than in a private or shared room. LIMITATION: Selection bias due to voluntary participation and a relatively small case count. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance and surge testing were used to detect multiple cases of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in homeless shelters. The findings suggest an unmet need for routine viral testing outside of clinical settings for homeless populations.

It is an independent factor for postoperative complications and longer length of stay (LOS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which preoperative anemia impacts on enhanced recovery programs (ERP) outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data for patients scheduled for colorectal surgery between 2015 and 2019, were analyzed (n = 494). All patients were managed with the same ERP. Demographic data, preoperative risk factors, postoperative complications, LOS and adherence to ERP were compared between anemic and non-anemic patients. Anemia was defined by a hemoglobin concentration < 13 g dL-1 in men and < 12 g dL-1 in women. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In total, 173 patients had preoperative anemia. They were older (p < 0.001) and more often male (p = 0.02). The following risk factors were significantly more frequent in the anemic group: renal failure (p = 0.04), malnutrition (p < 0.001), cardiac arrhythmia (p < 0.001), coronaropathy (p = 0.02) and anticoagulant treatment (p < 0.001). Despite more risk factors, anemic patients did not experience more postoperative complications (38.2% vs. 31.2%, p = 0.12). Overall adherence to ERP was similar (18 [16-19] vs. 18 [17-19], p = 0.06). LOS was 4 [3-7] and 3 [2-6.25] days in the anemic and the non-anemic groups, respectively (p < 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that anemia did not affect LOS (p = 0.27).

This virus causes a disease now known as coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. As an increasing proportion of the at-risk population becomes infected, and patients with severe illness are hospitalized, it is essential for hospitalists to remain current on how to best care for people with suspected or confirmed disease. Establishing a system for logistical planning, and accurate information sharing is strongly recommended. Infection control remains the ultimate goal. As such, healthcare workers should be educated on universal and isolation precautions, and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment. Social distancing should be encouraged to prevent the spread of infection, and creative and innovative ways to reduce contact may need to be considered. Moreover, it is imperative to prepare for contingencies as medical staff will inevitably get sick or become unavailable.

The virus employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into human cells. ACE2 is expressed on different organs, which is raising concern as to whether these organs can be infected by the virus or not. The testis appears to be an organ enriched with levels of ACE2, while the possible mechanisms of involvement of the male reproductive system by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully elucidated. The major focus of the present studies is on the short-term complications of the coronavirus and gains importance on studying the long-term effects, including the possible effects of the virus on the male reproductive system. The aim of this review was to provide new insights into different possible mechanisms of involvement of male gonads with SARS-CoV-2 including investigating the ACE2 axis in testis, hormonal alterations in patients with COVID-19, possible formation of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) and subsequently immunological infertility as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we suggest measuring the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) as a determiner of male fertility impairment in patients with COVID-19 along with other options such as sex-related hormones and semen analysis. Invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to the spermatogonia, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells can lead to sex hormonal alteration and impaired gonadal function. Once infected, changes in ACE2 signalling pathways followed by oxidative stress and inflammation could cause spermatogenesis failure, abnormal sperm motility, DNA fragmentation and male infertility.","output":"Potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 action on male gonadal function and fertility: Current status and future prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine storm in COVID-19 infection is an excessive immune response to external stimuli where the pathogenesis is complex.

The main barrier to implementing Education 4.0 in schools is that teachers have not been trained for it. Given the advances and new resources of the technological field, teacher preparation will be insufficient if it focuses on technological skills but does not incorporate the necessary dispositions for lifelong learning. Universities have the ethical imperative to update teacher education so teachers can become lifelong learners. The objective of this study was to understand whether practice-based curricula offer opportunities to promote lifelong learning tendencies. We used a sequential explanatory method. Quantitative and qualitative instruments were applied to pre-service teachers (survey: n = 231, semi-structured interviews: n = 8), and causal and descriptive approaches were supported by a structural equation model and constant comparative method, respectively. Data triangulation confirmed and added depth to the relationship found. Practice opportunities provided by teacher educators in learning activities and assessment tasks promote curiosity, motivation, perseverance, and self-learning regulation, when they are (i) systematic;(ii) relevant to the classroom work;(iii) presented with clear instructions and effective rubrics;(iv) accompanied with feedback focused on the task, soliciting reflection, and performed by peers and teacher educators in a trustworthy environment.

The nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships. An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is given for the basic SI (\\"susceptible-infective\\") network contagion model, which focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main result is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of the system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network models, including\\"removed\\"(R) and\\"exposed\\"(E) classes, are formulated. These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic modelling.","output":"COVID-19: Analytics Of Contagion On Inhomogeneous Random Social Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visuomotor adaptation arises when reaching in an altered visual environment, where ones seen hand position does not match their felt (i.e., proprioceptive) hand position in space. Here, we asked if proprioceptive training benefits visuomotor adaptation, and if these benefits arise due to implicit (unconscious) or explicit (conscious strategy) processes. Seventy-two participants were divided equally into 3 groups: proprioceptive training with feedback (PTWF), proprioceptive training no feedback (PTNF), and Control (CTRL). The PTWF and PTNF groups completed passive proprioceptive training, where a participants hand was moved to an unknown reference location and they judged the felt position of their unseen hand relative to their body midline on every trial. The PTWF group received verbal feedback with respect to their response accuracy on the middle 60% of trials, whereas the PTNF did not receive any feedback during training. The CTRL group did not complete proprioceptive training and instead sat quietly during this time. Following proprioceptive training or time delay, all three groups reached when seeing a cursor that was rotated 30 clockwise relative to their hand motion. The experiment ended with participants completing a series of no-cursor reaches to assess implicit and explicit adaptation. Results indicated that the PTWF group improved the accuracy of their sense of felt hand position following proprioceptive training. However, this improved proprioceptive acuity (i.e., the accuracy of their sense of felt hand) did not benefit visuomotor adaptation, as all three groups showed similar visuomotor adaptation across rotated reach training trials. Visuomotor adaptation arose implicitly, with minimal explicit contribution for all three groups. Together, these results suggest that passive proprioceptive training does not benefit, nor hinder, the extent of implicit visuomotor adaptation established immediately following reach training with a 30 cursor rotation.

By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and is the last to unbind from ACE2 under force.

Some HCoV strains, including HCoV-OC43, can invade the central nervous system, where they infect neurons, with unclear consequences. We have previously reported that HCoV-OC43 infection of human neurons activates the unfolded-protein response and caspase-3 and induces cell death and that the viral spike (S) glycoprotein is involved in the process. We now report on underlying mechanisms associated with the induction of programmed cell death (PCD) after infection by the reference HCoV-OC43 virus (rOC/ATCC) and a more neurovirulent and cytotoxic HCoV-OC43 variant harboring two point mutations in the S glycoprotein (rOC/U(S183-241)). Even though caspase-3 and caspase-9 were both activated after infection, the use of caspase inhibitors neither reduced nor delayed virus-induced PCD, suggesting that these proteases are not essential in the process. On the other hand, the proapoptotic proteins BAX, cytochrome c (CytC), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were relocalized toward the mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus, respectively, after infection by both virus variants. Moreover, LA-N-5 neuronal cells treated with cyclosporine (CsA), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeabilization transition pore (mPTP), or knocked down for cyclophilin D (CypD) were completely protected from rOC/ATCC-induced neuronal PCD, underlining the involvement of CypD in the process. On the other hand, CsA and CypD knockdown had moderate effects on rOC/U(S183-241)-induced PCD.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA over 1 year among 136 health care workers infected during the first COVID-19 wave and in a subgroup after booster vaccination approximately 1 year later. Furthermore, spike-protein-reactive memory T cells were quantified approximately 7 months after the infection and after booster vaccination. Thirty healthy individuals without history of COVID-19 who were routinely vaccinated served as controls. RESULTS: Levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM- and IgA-antibodies showed a rapid decay over time, whereas IgG-antibody levels decreased more slowly. Among individuals with history of COVID-19, booster vaccination induced very high IgG- and to a lesser degree IgA-antibodies. Antibody levels were significantly higher after booster vaccination than after recovery from COVID-19. After vaccination with a two-dose schedule, healthy control subjects developed similar antibody levels as compared to individuals with history of COVID-19 and booster vaccination. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell counts did not correlate with antibody levels. None of the study participants suffered from a reinfection.

By mediating an active and steady-state cell-to-cell communication, EVs contribute to regulating and preserving cellular homeostasis. On the other hand, EVs can also spread pathogen-derived molecules during infections, subverting the host immune responses during infections and thus worsening pathophysiological processes. In recent years, the biological functioning of EVs has become a widespread research field in basic and clinical branches of medical sciences due to their potential role in therapeutic applications for several diseases. This review aims to summarize the main recent findings regarding the implication of EVs shed by human macrophages (M-EVs) and how they can modulate the host immune response to control or increase the damage caused by infectious agents. We will also present the methods used to describe M-EVs, as well as the potential of these EVs as disease diagnostic tools for some human pathogens. We believe that an in-depth understanding of the hostCpathogen interactions mediated by M-EVs may trigger the development of innovative therapeutic strategies against infectious diseases.","output":"The Role of Extracellular Vesicles from Human Macrophages on Host-Pathogen Interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African pygmy hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris) are popular exotic pets in Japan, and their breeding numbers have recently increased.

A novel herpesvirus named Atelerix albiventris herpesvirus 1 (AAHeV), and African pygmy hedgehog adenovirus 1 (AhAdV-1) were detected in 14 and 3 oral swab samples, respectively. AAHeV infection may be related to neurological clinical signs. Interestingly, no hedgehog with a neoplastic disorder tested positive for AAHeV.

This paper explores the potential impact of these changes on vulnerable children and their families. Relationship-based practice is integral to social work and the shift to digital communication during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to accelerated practice changes and implications for relationship building both with and between service users. Going forward, social workers and other professionals are likely to move to an increasingly hybrid model of communication, combining both digital and face-to-face methods. This article identifies the impact of digital communication on relationships in professional practice, drawing on three studies of digital communication in the UK carried out at the University of East Anglia. The first considered how child protection social workers responded to the challenges of COVID-19, the second looked at how children in care were keeping in touch with their birth families and the third focused on the approaches being taken to moving children from foster care to adoptive families. Five themes related to relationships were identified across all three studies: the significance of the age and developmental stage of the child; the frequency of contact and communication; digital literacy/exclusion; the impact of the lack of sensory experience; and the importance of the relationship history. The article concludes with implications for utilising digital methods in building and maintaining relationships in practice and highlights the need to consider both the inner and outer worlds of those involved.","output":"Relationship-based practice and digital technology in child and family social work: Learning from practice during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The roles of methylprednisolone in treatment of patients with COVID-19 remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone in treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Statistical pooling was reported as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with corresponding 95 % confidence interval (CI). Thirty-three studies were eligible, including 5 randomized trials and 28 observational studies. Meta-analysis showed that compared with no glucocorticoids, methylprednisolone in treatment of COVID-19 patients was associated with reduced short-term mortality (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60C0.89), less need for ICU admission (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.66C0.91) and mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.57C0.84), increased 28-day ventilator-free days (MD 2.81; 95% CI 2.64C2.97), without increasing risk of secondary infections (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.82C1.32), but could prolong duration of viral shedding (MD 1.03; 95% CI 0.25C1.82). Subgroup analyses revealed that low-dose (2mg/kg/day) methylprednisolone treatment for  7 days in severe COVID-19 patients was associated with relatively better clinical outcomes, without increasing duration of viral shedding. Compared with no glucocorticoids, methylprednisolone treatment in COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced short-term mortality and better clinical outcomes, without increasing secondary infections, but could slightly prolong duration of viral shedding.

New therapeutics are desperately needed, especially those that target the underlying causes and prevent disease progression. Although asthma and COPD have distinct etiologies, both are associated with reduced airflow caused by excess infiltration of inflammatory cells into healthy lung tissues. As selectin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium is a key early event in the initiation of the inflammatory response, selectin inhibition is thought to be a good target for therapeutic intervention. Three known selectins are expressed in distinct subsets of cells: P-selectin is presented on the surface of activated platelets and endothelial cells, L-selectin is constitutively expressed on leukocytes, and E-selectin synthesis is upregulated in activated endothelial cells. They mediate cell-cell adhesion in the shear flow of the bloodstream via specialized interactions with clusters of oligosaccharides presented on cell surface glycopeptide ligands. The role of selectin-ligand interactions in the inflammatory response has been demonstrated in various animal models, prompting considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry. Drug discovery efforts have yielded many different classes of selectin inhibitors, including soluble protein ligands, antibodies, oligosaccharides and small molecules. Although many selectin inhibitors have shown activity in preclinical models, clinical progress of selectin-directed therapies has been slow. Early approaches employed carbohydrate-based inhibitors to mimic the natural ligand sialyl Lewis X; however, these compounds proved challenging to develop. Cytels CY 1503, a complex oligosaccharide, progressed to phase II/III trials for reperfusion injury, but further development was halted when it failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Two protein-based selectin inhibitors have reached phase II development. These included Wyeths recombinant soluble P-selectin ligand, TSI (PSGL-1), which was discontinued after disappointing results in myocardial infarction trials and Protein Design Labs humanized anti-L-selectin monoclonal antibody, which is currently in development for trauma. Bimosiamose, discovered by Encysive Pharmaceutical and presently being developed by Revotar Biopharmaceuticals, is an 863 g/mol molecular weight dimer with minimal carbohydrate content and is, to date, the leading selectin inhibitor in clinical development. This compound has shown promise in a phase Ha proof of concept trial in patients with asthma, reducing airway recruitment of eosinophils after intravenous administration. Further clinical development of an inhaled formulation is underway. Despite a significant need for new therapeutics, selectin inhibitors have not yet been explored for the treatment of COPD. Bimosiamose represents an important proof of principle, and hopefully continued success will spark renewed interest in selectin-directed therapeutics for respiratory diseases.","output":"Selectin Antagonists: Therapeutic Potential in Asthma and COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly discovered Novel Coronavirusa?s (COVID-19) transmission rate has been found by scientists to surpass any similar disease in history As of May 2020, CO","output":"Mapping the Spatiotemporal Patterns of COVID-19 Risk in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main power of artificial intelligence is not in modeling what we already know, but in creating solutions that are new.

Understanding both direct and indirect damage caused to the heart and the vascular system by SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary to identify optimal clinical care strategies. The homeostasis of the cardiovascular system requires a tight regulation of the gene expression, which is controlled by multiple types of RNA molecules, including RNA encoding proteins (messenger RNAs) (mRNAs) and those lacking protein-coding potential, the noncoding-RNAs.

Of all age groups, older adults have the greatest risk of severe COVID-19 and the associated complications. Globally, there are many reports of the rapid spread of COVID-19 among residents of skilled nursing facilities, with high associated rates of morbidity and mortality. With over 1.3 million residents in nursing home care in the USA, there is an urgent need for therapeutic strategies to prevent COVID-19 in these populations.

METHODS: International data bases of Covid-19 statistics and health metrics available primarily at WHO were reviewed to collect information for 113 countries. The dependent variable was Covid-19 case fatality rate. Independent variables were demographic, social, clinical, economic, heath care and child health factors. RESULTS: Case fatality rate of Covid-19 varies across countries with an average of 4.2  3.8%, and about half of countries had fatality rate >3.2% (median). Significant relationships were observed between Covid-19 fatality rate and socio-economic, clinical, and health variables at the unadjusted regression analysis.

Among these cryptographic techniques, Data Encryption Standard (DES) has been widely employed, however, it suffers from key and differential attacks. To overcome these attacks, several DES modifications have been proposed in literatures. Most modifications have focused on enhancing DES encryption key; however, the strength of a cryptographic technique is determined by the encryption key used and the number of encryption rounds. It is a known fact that Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic technique with 14 encryption rounds is stronger than AES with 12 rounds while AES with 12 rounds is stronger than AES with 10 rounds. Therefore, this study proposed a DES cryptographic technique whose number of rounds is dynamic. Users are expected to specify the number of encryption and decryption rounds to be employed at run time. Moreover, a predefined number of shifting operations which is left circular shift 2 was chosen for each encryption round. As, a trade-off in complexity, the number of Substitution box (S-box) was also reduced to 4, so that the input to the S-boxes would be arranged in four 12-bit blocks for the X-OR operation and not six 8-bit blocks as in the traditional DES. Finally, three keys were used to encrypt, decrypt and encrypt the plaintext ciphertext as in triple DES.

Finally, in this study, we will investigate the role and position of miRNAs with a focus on miR-200c in viral and severe acute respiratory syndromeCrelated coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infections. METHODS: Systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library was conducted for all relative papers from 2000 to 2021 with the limitations of the English language. Finally, we selected 128 articles which fit the best to our objective of study, among which 5 articles focused on the impact of miR-200c. RESULTS: Due to the therapeutic results of various drugs in different races and populations, epigenetic processes, especially miRNAs, are important. The overall results showed that different types of miRNAs can be effective on the process of various lung diseases through different target pathways and genes. It is likely that amplified levels of miR-200c may lead to decreased angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression, which in turn may increase the potential of infection, inflammation, and the complications of coronavirus disease.

Therefore, the notochord is appropriately positioned to play a role in mechanically elongating the somitic compartment. We use multi-photon cell ablation to remove specific regions of the notochord and quantify the impact on axis elongation. We show that anterior expansion generates a force that displaces notochord cells posteriorly relative to adjacent axial tissues, contributing to the elongation of segmented tissue during post-tailbud stages. Unexpanded cells derived from progenitors at the posterior end of the notochord provide resistance to anterior notochord cell expansion, allowing for stress generation along the AP axis.

PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein and as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin (Ub) moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2/DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly to the wild-type (WT) virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to that of the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.05) in viral titer in liver and spleen at day 5 postinfection (d p.i.), although both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of the PLP2-ubiquitin complex and that PLP2/DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (deconjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced replication in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","output":"Structure-Guided Mutagenesis Alters Deubiquitinating Activity and Attenuates Pathogenesis of a Murine Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, causing a respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) of varying severity in Wuhan, China, and subsequently leading to a pandemic. The transmissibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood. We evaluate its tissue and cellular tropism in human respiratory tract, conjunctiva, and innate immune responses in comparison with other coronavirus and influenza virus to provide insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. METHODS: We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from a patient with confirmed COVID-19, and compared virus tropism and replication competence with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (H1N1pdm) in ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus (n=5) and lung (n=4). We assessed extrapulmonary infection using ex-vivo cultures of human conjunctiva (n=3) and in-vitro cultures of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. Innate immune responses and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression were investigated in human alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. In-vitro studies included the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5N1) and mock-infected cells as controls. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infected ciliated, mucus-secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes in the lung, and the conjunctival mucosa. In the bronchus, SARS-CoV-2 replication competence was similar to MERS-CoV, and higher than SARS-CoV, but lower than H1N1pdm. In the lung, SARS-CoV-2 replication was similar to SARS-CoV and H1N1pdm, but was lower than MERS-CoV. In conjunctiva, SARS-CoV-2 replication was greater than SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 was a less potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokines than H5N1, H1N1pdm, or MERS-CoV. INTERPRETATION: The conjunctival epithelium and conducting airways appear to be potential portals of infection for SARS-CoV-2.

Wide adoption of digital pathology requires efficient visualization and navigation in Web-based digital slide viewers, which is poorly defined. OBJECTIVE. To define and quantify relevant performance metrics for efficient visualization of cases and slides in digital slide viewers. DESIGN. With a universal slide viewer used in clinical routine diagnostics, we evaluate the impact of slide caching, compression type, tile, and block size of whole slide images generated from Philips, Leica, and 3DHistech scanners on streaming performance on case, slide, and field of view levels. RESULTS. Two hundred thirty-nine pathologists routinely reviewed 60 080 whole slide images over 3 months. The median time to open a case's slides from the laboratory information system was less than 4 seconds, the time to change to a slide within the case was less than 1 second, and the time to render the adjacent field of view when navigating the slide was less than one-quarter of a second. A whole slide image's block size and a viewer tile size of 1024 pixels showed best performance to display a field of view and was preferrable over smaller tiles due to fewer mosaic effects. For Philips, fastest median slide streaming pace was 238 ms per field of view and for 3DHistech, 125 ms. For Leica, the fastest pace of 108 ms per field of view was established with block serving without decompression. CONCLUSIONS. This is the first study to systematically assess user-centric slide visualization performance metrics for digital viewers, including time to open a case, time to change a slide, and time to change a field of view. These metrics help to improve the viewer's configuration, leading to an efficient visualization baseline that is widely accepted among pathologists using routine digital pathology.","output":"Efficient Visualization of Whole Slide Images in Web-based Viewers for Digital Pathology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We shall apply a generalized SEIR model to study the outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil.

Transmission of this epidemic pathogen occurs mainly via mosquitoes, but it is also capable of placental and sexual transmission. Although the characteristics of these viruses are well defined, infections are unpredictable in terms of disease severity, unusual clinical manifestations, unexpected methods of transmission, long-term persistence, and the development of new strains. Recently, ZIKV has gained huge medical attention following the large-scale epidemics around the world, and reported cases of congenital abnormalities associated with Zika virus infections which have created a public health emergency of international concern. Despite continuous research on ZIKV, no specific treatment or vaccine has been developed, excepting a preventive strategy for congenital ZIKV infection. Probiotics, known as GRAS, are bacteria that confer various health beneficial effects, and have been shown to be effective at curing a number of viral diseases by modulating the immune system. Furthermore, probiotic preparations consisting of dead cells and cellular metabolites, so-called \\"Ghost probiotics\\", can also act as biological response modifiers. Here, we review available information on the epidemiology, transmission, and clinical features of ZIKV, and on treatment and prevention strategies. In addition, we emphasize the use of probiotics and plant-based natural remedies and describe their action mechanisms, and the green technologies for microbial conversion, which could contribute to the development of novel therapies that may reduce the pathogenicity of ZIKV. Accordingly, we draw attention to new findings, unanswered questions, unresolved issues, and controversies regarding ZIKV.","output":"Ghost probiotics with a combined regimen: a novel therapeutic approach against the Zika virus, an emerging world threat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected care home residents and staffs access to health care and advice. Health and social care professionals adapted rapidly to using video consultation (videoconferencing) technology without guidance. We sought to identify enablers and barriers to their use in supporting care home residents and staff. METHODS: a scoping review of the evidence on remote consultations between healthcare services and care homes. Interviews with English health and social care professionals about their experiences during the pandemic. Findings were synthesised using the non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, sustainability framework. RESULTS: 18 papers were included in the review. Twelve interviews were completed. Documented enablers and barriers affecting the uptake and use of technology (e.g. reliable internet; reduced travelling) resonated with participants. Interviews demonstrated rapid, widespread technology adoption overcame barriers anticipated from the literature, often strengthening working relationships with care homes. Novel implementation issues included using multiple platforms and how resident data were managed. Healthcare professionals had access to more bespoke digital platforms than their social care counterparts. Participants alternated between platforms depending on individual context or what their organisation supported. All participants supported ongoing use of technologies to supplement in-person consultations. CONCLUSIONS: the evidence on what needs to be in place for video consultations to work with care homes was partly confirmed. The pandemic context demolished many documented barriers to engagement and provided reassurance that residents assessments were possible. It exposed the need to study further differing resident requirements and investment in digital infrastructure for adequate information management between organisations.","output":"Using video consultation technology between care homes and health and social care professionals: a scoping review and interview study during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: There have been long-standing concerns about communication and safety on the Bethlem site out-of-hours due to its size, acuity and the number of specialist services; these issues were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. A Quality Improvement Project was designed to address communication and safety concerns from the on-call team at the Bethlem Royal psychiatric hospital out-of-hours through the introduction of weekend safety huddles. METHOD: Daily weekend safety huddles were introduced to improve communication regarding workload, acuity, new admissions, seclusion reviews, deteriorating patients; and to improve team cohesiveness and trainee support out-of-hours. The QIP team involved the deputy medical director, the associate director for speciality units, consultants, the college tutor, specialty registrars and core psychiatry trainees. Prior to initiating the huddles, the QIP team met to decide which specialties to involve, to agree on an agenda and liaise with other sites regarding existing huddles. Once the huddles began in April 2020, the team met periodically to agree next courses of action and to troubleshoot. The huddles initially involved acute services and eventually included CAMHS, Forensic, Older Adults, Specialist Units, all on-call consultants, the on-call registrar, two core trainees, the psychiatric liaison manager and the duty senior nurse. RESULT: Data were gathered throughout the QIP using Likert scale surveys which were sent to all junior doctors on the out-of-hours rota. Paper surveys were used initially but were later replaced with Microsoft Forms to ensure anonymity. The percentage of respondents who answered most of the time or all of the time increased across all parameters when comparing data from before and after implementation of the safety huddles. These results included improvement in: understanding of workload and acuity (9% before vs 69% after), discussion of new admissions on site (4% before vs 90% after), discussion of patients with deteriorating mental health (35% before vs 90% after) and physical health (22% before vs 83% after), understanding of number of patients in seclusion (61% before vs 93% after) and feeling part of a cohesive on-call team (17% before vs 86% after). In addition, the results suggested a reduction in frequency of safety concerns on site (83% answered at least sometimes before vs 62% after). CONCLUSION: The results of the final survey demonstrated a measurable and positive impact on communications between the out-of-hours team, improved team cohesiveness and a reduction in safety concerns. The lessons learnt also influenced decisions made in formatting safety huddles at other trust sites.","output":"A quality improvement project (QIP) to address communication and safety concerns from the on-call team at the Bethlem Royal psychiatric hospital out-of-hours through the introduction of weekend safety huddles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper illustrates the potential of using wood as a structural material in terms of sustainable construction and analyses the opportunities offered by the plant of production processes based on the use of locally-grown wood to the end of promoting the development of sustainable economies in narrow and interconnected communities like those of the islands.

Articles published within one year prior to April 20th, 2020 were screened with no language restriction imposed. Databases were searched for terms related to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and neurological manifestations, using a pre-established protocol registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (ID: CRD42020187994). Results: : A total of 2441 articles were screened for relevant content, of which 92 full-text publications were included in the analyses of neurological manifestations of COVID-19.

Moreover, anticancer, antioxidant, antibacterial and antiviral properties of its bioactive compounds are also reported. The Mpro (Main proteases) was docked with different compounds of Centaurea jacea through molecular docking. All the studied compounds including apigenin, axillarin, Centaureidin, Cirsiliol, Eupatorin and Isokaempferide, show suitable binding affinities to the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease with their binding energies -6.7 kcal/mol, -7.4 kcal/mol, -7.0 kcal/mol, -5.8 kcal/mol, -6.2 kcal/mol and -6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Among all studied compounds, axillarin was found to have maximum inhibitor efficiency followed by Centaureidin, Isokaempferide, Apigenin, Eupatorin and Cirsiliol. Our results suggested that axillarin binds with the most crucial catalytic residues CYS145 and HIS41 of the Mpro, moreover axillarin shows 5 hydrogen bond interactions and 5 hydrophobic interactions with various residues of Mpro. Furthermore, the molecular dynamic calculations over 60 ns (6106 femtosecond) time scale also shown significant insights into the binding effects of axillarin with Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 by imitating protein like aqueous environment. From molecular dynamic calculations, the RMSD and RMSF computations indicate the stability and dynamics of the best docked complex in aqueous environment.

Here, we build and characterize the performance of a novel modular 3-axis TMS coil that can be utilized as a unit element in large-scale multichannel TMS arrays. METHODS We determined the basic physical characteristics of the 3-axis TMS coil x-, y- and z-elements using a custom 2-channel programmable stimulator prototype. We mapped the temporal rate-of-change of the induced magnetic field (dB/dt) on a 2D plane parallel to the coil surface (including an extended line for full spatial coverage) and compared those values with predictions from magnetic field simulations. Temperature measurements were carried out to assess the incorporated air-cooling method. We measured the mutual and self-inductances of the x/y/z-elements to assess coupling between them. Additionally, we measured and calculated the coupling between z-elements in the array configuration. Finally, we performed electric field simulations to evaluate the stimulation intensity and focality of the coil and compared the results to conventional TMS coils as well as demonstrated suitability of the 3-axis coil for a multichannel array configuration. RESULTS The experimentally obtained dB/dt values validated the computational model of the 3-axis coil and therefore confirmed that both the coil and stimulator system are operating as intended. The air-cooling system was effective for brief high-frequency pulse trains and extended single- and paired-pulse TMS protocols. The electromagnetic simulations suggested that an array of the 3-axis coils would have comparable stimulation intensity to conventional TMS coils, therefore enabling clearly suprathreshold stimulation of the human brain. The recorded coil coupling between the x/y/z-elements was < 1% and the maximal coupling between z-elements in the array configuration was 1.8% and 3.4% for the measured and calculated values, respectively. CONCLUSION We presented a 3-axis coil intended for multichannel TMS arrays. The electromagnetic measurements and simulations verified that the coil fabrication met the desired specifications and that the inductive coupling between the elements was negligible.

OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors associated with developing ARF during SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was an observational study of 60 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected from March 26, 2020 to May 26, 2020 in a tertiary academic hospital in Poland. All patients reached final outcome (discharge from the hospital or death). We divided patients into 2 groups based on whether they developed ARF, compared their clinical data, and performed multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (36%) from the observed cohort developed ARF. Logistic regression identified that a high sequential organ failure assessment score at admission (odds ratio (OR) = 6.97 (1.57-30.90, p = 0.011)), and a long time from admission until pneumonia (OR = 1.41 (1.06-1.87, p = 0.016)), correlated with ARF development.

In the recent pandemic event of Covid-19, many believe that for the achievement of high speed in 5G, it will be required to have high power and this high power will decrease the immune system in short term. But actually, the reality doesnt support the above condition. This paper defines how the speed will increase with the help of low bit error rate and also through different useful techniques thereby not just by increasing the power. In addition of high-frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, the implementation will contribute to a negative public health outcome both from physical and mental health perspectives to a certain extent.

Historical and ongoing macro-level policies and forces over time have induced disproportionately higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality among Black women and birthing people, and contemporary macroeconomic and healthcare policies and factors continue to hold particular consequence. These factors induce detrimental psychological, health, and behavioral responses that contribute to maternal health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to disproportionately impact Black women and birthing people, as policy responses have failed to account for the their unique socioeconomic and healthcare contexts. The resulting consequences may form a 'vicious cycle', with upstream impacts that exacerbate upstream macro-level policies and forces that can further perpetuate the clustering of maternal morbidity and mortality in this population. Understanding the impacts of COVID-19 among Black women and birthing people requires theoretical frameworks that can sufficiently conceptualize their multi-level, interacting, and dynamic nature. Thus, we advocate for the proliferation of syndemic perspectives to guide maternal disparities research and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. These perspectives can enable a holistic and nuanced understanding of the intersection of endemic and COVID-19-specific vulnerabilities and disparities experienced by Black women and birthing people. Syndemic-informed research can then lead to impactful multi-level prevention strategies that simultaneously tackle both endemic and COVID-19-specific factors and outcomes that lead to the clustering of vulnerabilities and disparities over time.","output":"Syndemic Perspectives to Guide Black Maternal Health Research and Prevention During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urbanization has been positioned as an important driving force for economic development. This article examines the impact of urbanization on environmental regulation efficiency (ERE) in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Based on a panel dataset of 97 cities in the YRB from 2005 to 2016, a spatial econometric model was used for analysis. Results show that the average ERE in the YRB is relatively low and manifests in the shape of a curved smile. The urbanization level of the permanent population is far lower than the average level of developed countries. However, the urbanization level is showing a steady growth trend. During this period, ERE in the Yangtze River middle, upper, and lower reaches was measured at 0.77, 0.58, and 0.52, respectively. The urbanization rate was measured at 0.59, 0.45, and 0.39, in the lower, middle, and upper reaches, respectively. When only considering population urbanization, the previously observed negative correlation between ERE and the Kuznets curve disappears. However, if the carrying capacity of economic activities is considered, the U-shaped relationship between urbanization rate and ERE returns. The environmental Kuznets curve is consequently verified. In addition, there is an inverted U-shaped nonlinear relationship between economic development and ERE. The results of this article show that there are unsustainable risks in the rapid pursuit of population urbanization. Only by improving the quality of urbanization and adapting the level of urbanization to the carrying capacity of resources and environment can we truly promote high-quality economic development. The article puts forward some suggestions to promote the green development of the economy.","output":"Impact of Urbanization on the Environmental Regulation Efficiency in the Yangtze River Basin Based on the Empirical Analysis of Spatial Econometrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE 1) to compare the QIAreachTM QuantiFERON-TB (QIAreach QFT) vs. QuantiFERON?-TB Gold Plus assay (QFT-Plus) to detect tuberculosis (TB) infection; 2) to evaluate diagnostic sensitivity of QIAreach QFT using active TB as surrogate for TB infection; 3) to preliminarily evaluate QIAreach QFT in immunocompromised individuals. METHODS QIAreach QFT measures the level of interferon- (IFN-) in plasma specimens from blood stimulated by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides in one blood collection tube (equivalent to the TB2 tube of the QFT-Plus).

Despite its legal status, South Africas growing lion farming industry is a contentious issue. In 2020, a high-level panel was appointed to review the policies, legislation, and management of breeding, hunting, trade, and handling of four wildlife species, namely rhino, elephant, leopard, and lions. In May 2021, it was announced that the government will stop issuing permits to new entrants into this industry as well as the issuance of hunting permits and will start amending permit conditions to prohibit breeding and exclude tourism interactions with captive lions, effectively ending the lion farming industry. In order to follow this line of action, a comprehensive, well-managed plan will be required to ensure a responsible transition away from the current industry. Here, using a gap analysis management tool, we outline some of the key considerations necessary for a responsible, well-managed exit from the lion farming industry in South Africa. We compiled key background information about the current state of the industry and use this information to identify desired management states and specific steps that could facilitate a successful phase out of lion farming. ABSTRACT: African lions (Panthera leo) are commercially farmed across South Africa for sport hunting, tourism, and the international bone trade, primarily in Southeast Asia. Despite its legal status, South Africas growing lion farming industry is a contentious issue. In 2020 a high-level panel was initiated to review the policies, legislation, and management regarding the breeding, hunting, trade, and handling of four wildlife species, including lions. In May 2021, it was announced that the government intends to amend existing permit conditions to prohibit lion breeding and tourism interactions with captive lions, as well as to stop issuing permits to new entrants into the industry, effectively ending lion farming. In order to follow this line of action, a comprehensive, well-managed plan will be necessary to execute a responsible exit from the industry as it currently stands. Using a gap analysis management tool, we aim to: (1) outline some of the key considerations regarding the current state of the lion farming industry in South Africa; and (2) propose specific action steps that could be taken within five key areas (regulation, animal welfare, health and safety, equitability, and conservation) to help inform a responsible transition away from this type of wildlife farming in the biodiversity economy. For our gap analysis, we conducted a semi-systematic literature search to compile key background information about the current state of the industry. This information was then used to identify corresponding desired management states, and steps that could facilitate a successful phase out of lion farming in South Africa. We hope our approach helps identify key considerations for a responsible transition and can help aid decisions during the management of this process.","output":"Ending Commercial Lion Farming in South Africa: A Gap Analysis Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As governments around the globe navigate the effects of COVID\\\\19 crisis, the urban poor endure the unevenly distributed socio\\\\economic impacts of the pandemic.

To help administrators respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and better understand its impacts, we surveyed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among NOVA University employees and assessed community mental health. Methods: Data were collected from voluntary participants at six NOVA University locations, in the Lisbon metropolitan area, from June 15C30, 2020. All subjects provided written informed consent. Of 1,627 recruited participants (mean age 42.0  12.3 years), 1,624 were tested. Prior to blood collection, participants completed a questionnaire that assessed: COVID-19 symptoms during the previous 14 days, chronic non-communicable diseases, chronic medication, anxiety, and depression symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 serology tests were then performed, and results communicated approximately 4 days after blood draw. Participants with positive serology tests were contacted to assess COVID-19 symptoms since February. Results: Estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 3.1% (n = 50), of which 43.5% reported symptoms in the previous 4 months. The Medical School had the highest seroprevalence (6.2%). Participants reported having at least one chronic disease (63.7%), depression-like symptoms (2.1%), and anxiety symptoms (8.1%). Rates of depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly higher in women, with sleep hours and occasional alcohol consumption negatively associated with depression. Male gender, older age, and sleep hours negatively associated with anxiety symptoms. School of employment and presence of comorbidities positively associated with anxiety. Conclusion: By measuring seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among NOVA employees and assessing subjects' mental health, we aim to help administrators at European public universities in urban areas, such as Lisbon, Portugal, better understand the needs of their communities. This study resulted in implementation of a stricter contingency plan in the Medical School, while other schools continued to follow Government mitigation guidelines. These findings may also guide the development of tailored strategies to ensure physical and mental health of the academic community during this pandemic crisis.

BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of data on SoA in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Altogether, 543 community-dwelling older adults (50+ years) were recruited via the three-tier mental health network in Wuhan, China, and completed an online questionnaire in April 2020, the first month after the reopening of Wuhan. SoA, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were measured by using the General Social Alienation Scale, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, and a single standardized question, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of SoA was 52.3% (95% confidence interval: 48.1C56.5%). Factors associated with higher levels of SoA were religious belief ( = 1.960, P = .024), monthly family income<4000 RMB ( = 1.405, P = .022), unemployment ( = 1.217, P = .039), fair or poor physical health ( = 2.202, P = .002), never and sometimes receiving community support ( = 2.297, P < .001 and  = 3.417, P < .001), perceiving a low possibility of a cure for COVID-19 ( = 2.379, P < .001), and affirmative and unsure fear of COVID-19 patients ( = 2.025, P = .007 and  = 1.101, P = .027).

Here, we developed a new methodology to successfully perform HR in Rhizopus microsporus. We isolated an uracil auxotrophic recipient strain and optimized the critical steps in the genetic transformation of this fungus. This was followed by an adaptation of a plasmid-free CRISPR-Cas9 system coupled with microhomology repair templates. We reproducibly generated stable mutants in the genes leuA and crgA, encoding a 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase and an ubiquitin ligase, respectively. Our new genetic model showed that mutations in the gene pyrF, a key virulence gene in several bacterial and fungal pathogens, correlated with an avirulent phenotype in an immunocompetent murine host. This was reverted by gene complementation, showing the broad possibilities of our methodology. Graphical Highlights ? Isolates and characterizes a mutagen-free recipient R. microsporus strain? Establishes and optimizes the conditions for protoplast transformation? Establishes a CRISPR-based procedure to generate stable homokaryotic mutant strains? Tests the virulence of the generated mutant strains in immunocompetent mice Motivation Due to increasing cases of the fatal fungal disease mucormycosis, including cases associated with COVID-19 patients, there is an urgent need to improve genetically tractable models of the causative fungal species. Genetic manipulation tools are available in Mucor lusitanicus, but this species shows low virulence and is therefore not the ideal model. Our goal was to develop tools for genetic manipulation of Rhizopus microsporus, because it is a virulent and frequently causative agent of mucormycosis and has also been used to model interactions between Mucorales and endobacteria. With our methodology, which combines the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and microhomology DNA templates, we have achieved stable targeted integrations by homologus recombination. This has allowed us to analyze the first visual phenotypes in R. microsporus caused by gene disruption and to discover a possible role for the pyrF gene in virulence. Considering these newly developed genetic tools, we propose R. microsporus as a model to study virulence and molecular genetics in the mucormycosis field. Lax et al. establish a procedure for genetic manipulation of the fungus Rhizopus microsporus, one of the main causal agents of mucormycosis.

In order to ascertain the risk to patients awaiting cataract surgery, this study aimed to identify the presence of systemic comorbidities that are associated with a high risk of severe disease or death due to COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective study of 315 patients (630 eyes) was conducted from 3rd June to 31st July 2020. An electronic health record was used to identify any systemic comorbidities that would render a patient 'clinically extremely vulnerable' to COVID-19, as outlined by the Department of Health for Northern Ireland. Patient demographics, best-corrected visual acuity (VA) and risk of postoperative anisometropia were also recorded. RESULTS: The median age of patients awaiting cataract surgery was 76 years (range 22-97). Of the 315 patients, 72% were aged over 70 and 16% were aged over 85. A systemic comorbidity that would confer high risk status was identified in 21% of patients. This high risk status was attributable to severe respiratory disease, cancer, and immunosuppression therapies in the majority of cases. The high risk group were younger than those deemed non-high risk, but there were no significant differences with respect to gender, anticipated degree of surgical difficulty, VA, or whether the patient was undergoing first or second eye surgery. Of those patients awaiting first eye cataract surgery, the mean VA in the listed eye was 0.84 logMAR and 39% (70/179) had a VA <0.3 logMAR (6/12 Snellen acuity) in their fellow eye. 57% of patients were awaiting first eye surgery, and 32% of those patients would be at risk of symptomatic anisometropia postoperatively. CONCLUSION: One-fifth of patients awaiting cataract surgery were found to be at high risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19 and these patients may experience delays in their surgical care. Additional planning is required in order to minimise the morbidity associated with delayed cataract surgery.","output":"Surgical planning during a pandemic: Identifying patients at high risk of severe disease or death due to COVID-19 in a cohort of patients on a cataract surgery waiting list"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore efficacy, risk factors, safety, and persistence of teriflunomide in relapsingCremitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) cohort. METHODS: This prospective, observational cohort study included 217 consecutive teriflunomide treated RRMS patients, 192 of which with at least 3-month persistence on teriflunomide were included in effectiveness and risk factor analyses. Multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with failure of no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) 3. RESULTS: At baseline 82% patients were treatment na?ve while 18.0% interferon-1b treated patients had stopped treatments for more than 1 year. After treatment, 79.0% patients achieved NEDA 3 at 12-month, mean annualized relapse rate (ARR) reduced significantly (0.79  0.80 vs 0.16  0.70; P < 0.001), and mean expanded disability status score (EDSS) remained stable (1.40  1.67 vs 1.56  1.88; P > 0.05). Male sex (hazard ratio [HR] 1.856; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.118C3.082, P < 0.05), baseline EDSS score  4 (HR 2.682; 95% CI 1.375C5.231, P < 0.01), and frequent relapses before treatment (HR 3.056; 95% CI 1.737C5.377, P < 0.01) were independent factors significantly associated with failure of NEDA 3. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were hair thinning, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation, and leukopenia, the latter two most commonly lead to teriflunomide discontinuation during the first 3 months. Persistence rates at 6, 12, and 24 months after teriflunomide initiation were 86.9%, 72.4%, and 52.8%, respectively.

Methods The clinical data of severe and critical COVID-19 patients treated in General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA from Jan. 2020 to Mar. 2020 were collected. The patients were divided into non-myocardial injury group and myocardial injury group. The baseline data, clinical characteristics, auxiliary examination, treatment and prognosis were compared between the two groups, and the risk factors of myocardial injury and the effect on the prognosis of the severe and critical COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Results A total of 56 patients were included, with 22 in the non-myocardial injury group and 34 in the myocardial injury group. Patients were mostly male in both groups, and there was no significant difference in gender composition between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Compared with the non-myocardial injury group, the age of onset was significantly higher in the myocardial injury group (78.5[ 70.8, 89.0] years vs 56.5[ 50.3, 68.3] years, P&lt;0.01), and the proportions of patients over 65 years old and combined with coronary heart disease were significantly greater (85.3%[ 29/34] vs 31.8%[ 7/22] and 38.2% [13/34] vs 9.1%[ 2/22], both P&lt;0.05). In terms of symptoms, fever (87.5%, 49/56), cough (64.3%, 36/56) and fatigue (46.4%, 26/56) were the most common ones, and there were no significant differences between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). For the CT findings of the lungs, the proportion of patients having patch-like/plaque-like shadows and ground-glass opacities was significantly greater in the non-myocardial injury group versus the myocardial injury group (72.7%[ 16/22] vs 38.2%[ 13/34], 2=6.364, P&lt;0.05), and other signs were not significantly different between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Compared with the non-myocardial injury group, the levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, procalcitonin and IL-6 were significantly higher in the myocardial injury group (4 939.5[ 1 817.0, 9 450.3] pg/mL vs 612.5[ 301.0, 1 029.5] pg/mL, 4 386.5 [2 309.5, 9 635.3] ng/mL vs 850.5 [343.5, 2 333.8] ng/mL, 0.46 [0.23, 3.79] ng/mL vs 0.18 [0.13, 0.39] ng/mL, and 138.6 [41.9, 464.8] pg/mL vs 65.1[ 34.7, 99.3] pg/mL, respectively), and the differences were significant (all P&lt;0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age65 years old (odds ratio[ OR] =18.62, 95% confidence interval[ CI] 1.61-215.96, P&lt;0.05) and D-dimer level3 000 ng/mL (OR=15.48, 95% CI 1.45-164.77, P&lt;0.05) were the independent risk factors for myocardial injury in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. There were no significant differences in the use of antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, or glucocorticoids between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the myocardial injury than that in the non-myocardial injury group (58.8% [20/34] vs 9.1% [2/22], P&lt;0.01). Patients who received tracheal intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and other invasive life support measures were all in the myocardial injury group. Conclusion Older age, male gender, coronary heart disease and (or) cardiac insufficiency, and elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin and IL-6 are the risk factors of myocardial injury in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Myocardial injury can aggravate the condition and some patients need invasive circulating breathing support, with poor prognosis and high mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fresh bovine livers were used to create three in vitro models: blood-perfused, Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution-perfused, and nonperfused. The perfused models were connected to a heart-lung machine via the portal vein and perfused with heparinized autologous blood or KH solution under physiologic conditions. Six swine were used as in vivo liver models. A cluster electrode and RF ablation system was operated in impedance mode for 12 minutes in all models. Ablated livers were sectioned, with long- and short-axis measurements of the ablations obtained, and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 39, 23, 17, and 12 ablations were performed in 14, 6, 5, and 6 blood-perfused bovine livers, KH solution-perfused bovine livers, nonperfused bovine livers, and in vivo porcine livers, respectively. On cut specimens, the average diameters of ablation zones were 4.00 cm (95% CI, 3.88-4.13) in blood-perfused livers, 4.34 cm (95% CI, 4.14-4.50) in KH solution-perfused livers, 4.67 cm (95% CI, 4.50-4.83) in nonperfused livers, and 3.56 cm (95% CI, 3.26-3.83) in in vivo porcine livers. In all models, the ablation zone diameters were normally distributed.

In such critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can serve as salvage therapy. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) COVID-19 ECMO registry reports that 49% of its patients were classified as obese as of 12/01/2020. However, the morbidity and mortality outcomes of this subgroup remains unclear. As such, this high-risk population merits further examination. Methods: We identified adult COVID-19 ARDS patients who were candidates for either veno-venous ECMO or veno-arterial ECMO between March 13, 2020 and August 31, 2020. The eligibility for ECMO was selected based on our institutional algorithm and the EOLIA Trial criteria (except for high BMI cutoff). Patients were divided into two groups, obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI &lt; 29.9 kg/m2). We compared the pre-cannulation characteristics including time elapsed between admission to ECMO, intubation to ECMO and respiratory indices. We then examined length on ECMO, ICU or hospital length of stay and disposition. Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze categorical and continuous data. Results: We identified a total of 41 patients, 33 (80.5%) were obese and 8 (19.5%) were non-obese [Table 1]. The average age of the obese and non-obese groups was 47.8 years and 55.5 years respectively. The median BMI was 39.85 kg/m2 (IQR: 35.63, 43.00) in the obese group and 29.05 kg/m2 (IQR: 25.35, 29.39) in the non-obese group (p &lt;0.00001). There was no difference in precannulation characteristics between the groups. In terms of timelines, the obese group was borderline significant with regards to more time elapsed between admission to ECMO (p = 0.058), however, no other significant changes were noted. The ICU length of stay was lower in the obese group with median runtime of 22 days versus 35.5 days (p = 0.029). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality (p = 0.43) or dispositions between the two groups. Conclusion: In our study, the obesity group did not have worse outcomes than the non-obese group.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has led to a pandemic and has changed the lives many throughout the world. The mode of transmission of this virus is from person to person through the transfer of respiratory droplets. Therefore, non-essential healthcare services involving direct patient interactions, including deprescribing, has been on hiatus to reduce spread. Barriers to deprescribing before the pandemic include patient and system related factors, such as resistance to change, patient's knowledge deficit about deprescribing, lack of alternatives for treatment of disease, uncoordinated delivery of health services, prescriber's attitudes and/or experience, limited availability of guidelines for deprescribing, and lack of evidence on preventative therapy. Some of these barriers can be mitigated by using the following interventions:patient education, prioritization of non-pharmacological therapy, incorporation of electronic health record (EHR), continuous prescriber education, and development of research studies on deprescribing. Currently, deprescribing cannot be delivered through in person interactions, so virtual care is a reasonable alternative format. The full incorporation of EHR throughout Canada can add to the success of this strategy. However, there are several challenges of conducting deprescribing virtually in the elderly population. These challenges include, but are not limited, to their inability to use technology, lack of literacy, lack of assistance from others, greater propensity for withdrawal effects, and increased risk of severe consequences, if hospitalized. Virtual care is the future of healthcare and in order to retain the benefits of deprescribing, additional initiatives should be in place to address the challenges that elderly patients may experience in accessing deprescribing virtually.

METHODS: Participants were 119 older adults (69 males, 50 females; average age 77.3  8.3 years) requiring long-term care who used outpatient rehabilitation services. Our outpatient rehabilitation service involved day care for older adults undergoing rehabilitation including pick-up and drop-off services under the long-term care insurance system. They were divided into two groups: participants who discontinued using outpatient rehabilitation services and participants who continued their use. To find the factors associated with this discontinuation, binomial logistic regression analysis was performed, in which the following independent variables were used: gender, age, height, weight, long-term care level, grip strength, and normal walking speed. Frailty status was investigated in April 2020 and again in September 2020 through interviews and telephone surveys utilizing the Frailty Screening Index. RESULTS: Women and normal walking speed were independent factors associated with the discontinuation of outpatient rehabilitation due to COVID-19. According to the results of the Frailty Screening Index, similar tendencies were exhibited in both April and September. The discontinued group indicated that they were getting less exercise and having stronger feelings of fatigue than the continuing group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are in accordance with other studies indicating that women are more likely to employ prevention measures against COVID-19, as seen among the community-dwelling older adults requiring long-term care who used outpatient rehabilitation services. People with higher levels of physical function were also likely to refrain from using outpatient rehabilitation services.

In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence severe SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyzes. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P = 2.19  10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P = 9.04  10-12). Further analyzes using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protection from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P = 2.32  10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence severe SARS-CoV-2 was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P = 0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples. INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or covid-19 progression are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for severe covid-19 disease.

Particular attention must be paid to alcohol consumption among young people. It has been shown that 25% of young peoples deaths are attributable to alcohol, and around 35 million people aged over 11 had consumed at least one alcoholic beverage in 2015. Study Design: Young people aged 18C24 were the most vulnerable to binge drinking in Italy, and 50.6% of teenagers drunk alcohol. Only a few studies in the literature have investigated those habits in university students. This study aims to examine alcohol use habits in a population of university students in Italy. Methods: Between 2018 and 2019, an anonymous online questionnaire was randomly sent to university students from 17 different universities in a network of research centres to study alcohol use disorders. The survey included socio-demographic information, questions about alcohol use, knowledge about alcohol consumption, and related risks. Used questionnaires were the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) and the Drinking Motive Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R). Results: the AUDIT-C revealed that 53.3% of students were high-risk drinkers. Regarding binge drinking habits, 13.1% of students admitted to binge drinking behavior at least once a month. In our sample, male students are more likely to be low-risk drinkers than female peers (p < 0.008). Students from northern Italy are more likely to be high-risk drinkers (p = 0.003). Beer (65.9%) and wine (60.9%) were the most consumed alcoholic beverages. The most common places to drink alcohol were pubs (85.5%). The most likely motivations to drink alcohol were enhancement (40.43%), social (38.39%), coping (15.63%), and social pressure or conformity (5.55%). Only 43.8% of participants reported having attended an educational course on alcohol. Conclusions: University students were not fully aware of the implications of alcohol misuse and will be part of the adult society as critical figures and future leaders. It is imperative to inform students about alcohol consumption risks and investigate the motivations to drink. Stress, anxiety, and social pressure are only a few issues young people are exposed to. Special attention must be paid to young people and their coping strategies that involve substance abuse by using educative, preventive, and motivational approaches.","output":"Knowledge and Practice towards Alcohol Consumption in a Sample of University Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reading is a crucial skill in the 21st century.

According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has caused a severe threat to the health of the vulnerable groups, notably the elderly. There is still some disagreements regarding the source of the virus and its intermediate host. However, the spread of this disease has caused most countries to enforce strict curfew laws and close most industrial and recreational centres. This study aims to show the potential positive effects of COVID-19 on the environment and the increase of renewable energy generation in Malaysia. To prevent the spread of this disease, Malaysia enacted the Movement Control Order (MCO) law in March 2020. Implementation of this law led to a reduction in environmental pollution, especially air pollution, in this country. The greenhouse gases (GHG) emission , which was 8 Mt CO(2) eq. from January 2020 to March 2020, reduced to <1 Mt CO(2) eq. for April and May. The reduction of GHG emission and pollutant gases allowed more sunlight to reach photovoltaic panels, hence increasing the renewable energy generation.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 virus on reducing GHG emission and increasing energy generated by renewable energy sources: A brief study in Malaysian context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fast spread of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) calls for immediate action to counter the associated significant loss of human life and deep economic impact.

This study measured post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome, burnout, depression, PERMA, quality of life, life satisfaction, and sleep quality to test the relationships. Results demonstrated that post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome and burnout predicted distracting sleep behavior and sleep health. Depression was significantly related to PERMA. The better the emergency workers' PERMA was, the better their quality of life and life satisfaction were. PERMA significantly predicted sleep behavior, a portion of sleep quality. Depression had an indirect influence on quality of life mediated by PERMA. Post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome, burnout, and PERMA were significant predictors of low sleep health and sleep behavior. The results indicate that South Korean emergency workers struggle with depression and sleep quality.

Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection is crucial in the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines. The infection process is triggered by direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many efforts have been made to design or repurpose therapeutics to deactivate RBD or ACE2 and prevent the initial binding. In addition to direct inhibition strategies, small chemical compounds might be able to interfere and destabilize the meta-stable, pre-fusion complex of ACE2-RBD. This approach can be employed to prevent the further progress of virus infection at its early stages. In this study, Molecular docking is employed to analyze the binding of two chemical compounds, SSAA09E2 and Nilotinib, with the druggable pocket of the ACE2-RBD complex. The structural changes as a result of the interference with the ACE2-RBD complex are analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that both Nilotinib and SSAA09E2 can induce significant conformational changes in the ACE2-RBD complex, intervene with the hydrogen bonds, and influence the flexibility of proteins. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis suggests that the presence of small molecules can trigger large-scale conformational changes that may destabilize the ACE2-RBD complex.","output":"Small Molecules to Destabilize the ACE2-RBD Complex: A Molecular Dynamics Study for Potential COVID-19 Therapeutics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Little is known about the neuronal substrates of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19 and their evolution during the course of the disease. We aimed at describing the longitudinal brain metabolic pattern in COVID-19-related encephalopathy using 18F-FDG-PET/CT. METHODS: Seven patients with variable clinical presentations of COVID-19-related encephalopathy were explored thrice with brain 18F-FDG-PET/CT, once in the acute phase, 1 month later and 6 months after COVID-19 onset. PET images were analysed with voxel-wise and regions-of-interest approaches in comparison with 32 healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients' neurological manifestations during acute encephalopathy were heterogeneous. However, all of them presented with predominant cognitive and behavioural frontal disorders. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the CSF was negative for all patients. MRI revealed no specific abnormalities for most of the subjects. All patients had a consistent pattern of hypometabolism in a widespread cerebral network including the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula and caudate nucleus. Six months after COVID-19 onset, the majority of patients clinically had improved but cognitive and emotional disorders of varying severity remained with attention/executive disabilities and anxio-depressive symptoms, and lasting prefrontal, insular and subcortical 18F-FDG-PET/CT abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The implication of this widespread network could be the neural substrate of clinical features observed in patients with COVID-19, such as frontal lobe syndrome, emotional disturbances and deregulation of respiratory failure perception.

Preparedness of individual nations and the hospitals is important to effectively deal with the surge of cases. We aimed to obtain nation wide data from Nepal, about hospital preparedness for COVID-19. METHODS: Online questionnaire was prepared in accordance with the Center for Disease Control recommendations to assess preparedness of hospitals for COVID-19. The questionnaire was circulated to the over 800 doctors across the nation, who are the life members of six medical societies. RESULTS: We obtained 131 completed responses from all seven provinces. Majority of respondents had anaesthesiology as the primary specialty. Only 52 (39.7%) participants mentioned that their hospital had policy to receive suspected or proven cases with COVID-19. Presence of isolation ward was mentioned by 83 (63.4%) respondents, with only 9 (6.9%)mentioning the presence of airborne isolation. Supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) was inadequate as per 124 (94.7%) respondents. Critical care services for COVID-19 patients were possible only in hospitals of 42 (32.1%)respondents.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study, analysing routinely collected clinical data from CPME reports in a rapid response to the pandemic lockdown. SETTING: Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which provides all routine CPME for Birmingham, England, population 1.1 million including 288 000 children. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged under 18 years attending CPME during an 18-week period from late February to late June during the years 2018C2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of referrals, source of disclosure and outcomes from CPME. RESULTS: There were 78 CPME referrals in 2018, 75 in 2019 and 47 in 2020, this was a 39.7% (95% CI 12.4% to 59.0%) reduction in referrals from 2018 to 2020, and a 37.3% (95% CI 8.6% to 57.4%) reduction from 2019 to 2020.

In all years 75.9% of children were known to social care prior to CPME, and 94% of CPME concluded that there were significant safeguarding concerns. CONCLUSIONS: School closure due to COVID-19 may have harmed children as child abuse has remained hidden. There needs to be either mandatory attendance at schools in future or viable alternatives found.

These methodologies may yield distorted results because DSB-associated effects are often falsely assumed to be consequences of gene perturbation itself, especially when high copy-number sites are targeted. In the present study, we report a DSB-independent, genome-wide CRISPR screening method, termed iBARed cytosine base editing-mediated gene KO (BARBEKO). This method leverages CRISPR cytosine base editors for genome-scale KO screens by perturbing gene start codons or splice sites, or by introducing premature termination codons. Furthermore, it is integrated with iBAR, a strategy we devised for improving screening quality and efficiency. By constructing such a cell library through lentiviral infection at a high multiplicity of infection (up to 10), we achieved efficient and accurate screening results with substantially reduced starting cells. More importantly, in comparison with Cas9-mediated fitness screens, BARBEKO screens are no longer affected by DNA cleavage-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa-, K562- or DSB-sensitive retinal pigmented epithelial 1 cells.

In this study, we investigated the effect of targeting the CD206 receptor with a novel fragment of a Host Defense Peptide (HDP), RP-832c to decrease cytokines that cause fibrosis. RP-832c selectively binds to CD206 on M2 polarized bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) in vitro , resulting in a time-dependent decrease in CD206 expression, and a transient increase in M1 marker TNF&#945;, which resolves over a 24hr period. To elucidate the antifibrotic effect of RP-832c, we used a murine model of bleomycin (BLM) -induced early-stage pulmonary fibrosis. RP-832c significantly reduced bleomycin-induced fibrosis in a dosage dependent manner, as well as decreased CD206, TGF-?1 and &#945;-SMA expression in mouse lungs. Interestingly we did not observe any changes in the resident alveolar macrophage marker CD170 expression. Similarly, in an established model of lung fibrosis, RP-832c significantly decreased fibrosis in the lung, as well as significantly decreased inflammatory cytokines TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-10, INF-?3, CXCL1/2, and fibrosis markers TGF-?1 and MMP-13. In comparison with FDA approved drugs, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, RP-832c exhibited a similar reduction in fibrosis compared to Pirfenidone, and to a greater extent than Nintedanib, with no apparent toxicities observed on body weight or blood chemistry.

METHODS: We used CDCs OHZDP tool to prioritize zoonoses. Workshop participants selected criteria for prioritization, and developed questions and weights for each criterion. Questions were answered using available literature and expert opinion with subsequent scoring resulting in a ranked zoonotic disease list. After agreeing on a final prioritized disease list, participants used components of the One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit, developed by USDA and University of Minnesota, to review multidisciplinary coordination processes for the prioritized zoonotic diseases. RESULTS: Participants selected epidemic or pandemic potential, disease severity, economic impact, introduction or increased transmission potential, and national security as criteria to prioritize 56 zoonoses. The eight prioritized zoonotic diseases for the US were zoonotic influenzas, salmonellosis, West Nile virus, plague, emerging coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), rabies, brucellosis, and Lyme disease. Agencies then discussed recommendations to enhance One Health approaches to surveillance, response, prevention, and control of the prioritized zoonoses. Key themes and next steps for further implementation of One Health approaches were identified. CONCLUSION: This OHZDP workshop represents the first use of a One Health approach to zoonotic disease prioritization in the United States.

Conventional video compression causes resolution reduction under limited bandwidth. Semantic video conferencing maintains high resolution by transmitting some keypoints to represent motions because the background is almost static, and the speakers do not change often. However, the study on the impact of the transmission errors on keypoints is limited. In this paper, we initially establish a basal semantic video conferencing (SVC) network, which dramatically reduces transmission resources while only losing detailed expressions. The transmission errors in SVC only lead to a changed expression, whereas those in the conventional methods destroy pixels directly. However, the conventional error detector, such as the cyclic redundancy check, cannot reflect the degree of expression changes. To overcome this issue, we develop an incremental redundancy hybrid automatic repeat-request (IR-HARQ) framework for the varying channels (SVC-HARQ) incorporating a novel semantic error detector. The SVC-HARQ has flexibility in bit consumption and achieves good performance. In addition, SVC-CSI is designed for channel state information (CSI) feedback to allocate the keypoint transmission and enhance the performance dramatically.

METHOD: 100 patients with AECOPD admitted to the Department of Respiratory and Critical Medicine of Pukou District Central Hospital of Nanjing from March 2020 to February 2021 were selected. The patients were randomly divided into study group (50 cases) and control group (50 cases); both groups were given routine treatment such as bronchodilators, low-dose glucocorticoids, and antibiotics. During the treatment, the vital signs, inflammatory response indexes, fluid balance, and nutrition were continuously monitored; the body position was changed every 2 hours; and the curative effect was evaluated one week after treatment. On this basis, the control group received routine oxygen therapy combined with NIV (low flow conventional oxygen therapy + NIV), and the study group received HFNC combined with NIV (HFNC + NIV). The oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), first-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) level were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Moreover, SECS scores before ventilation and 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after ventilation were collected and analyzed. In addition, complications during oxygen therapy were compared. RESULT: Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the levels of PaCO2, FEV1, SaO2, PEFR, and SvO2 between the two groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, the levels of PaCO2 in the study group were lower than those in the control group, and the levels of FEV1, SaO2, PEFR, and SvO2 in the study group were higher than those in the control group P < 0.05(P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in SECS scores between the two groups before ventilation and 2 hours after ventilation (P > 0.05).

The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with neonatal death in cases of gastroschisis managed in a tertiary hospital in Brazil. It was included 49 cases of gastroschisis managed at IMIP, Recife - Brazil, between 1995 and 2001. The dependent variable was neonatal death and the independent variables were: prenatal diagnosis, route and site of delivery, gestational age, birthweight, birth-to-admission interval, birth-to-surgery interval, primary or staged-silo repair, need of mechanical ventilation and postoperative infection. Prevalence ratio (PR) and its 95% confidence interval of neonatal death was determined. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine adjusted relative risk of neonatal death. Overall mortality was 53% (26 cases) and infection was the main cause of death (92%). Prenatal diagnosis was associated with significant reduction of 74% in the risk of death. This risk was significantly increased ( > twice) among newborns with gestational age below 37 weeks, birthweight below 2.5Kg and outborn babies. A significantly greater risk of neonatal death was observed for birth-to-admission interval of 2h or more and birth-to-surgery interval of 4h or more (2.5 and 3.4 times, respectively). Need of mechanical ventilation was associated with an increased risk of death (2.6 times). In multivariate analysis, variables that persisted strongly associated to neonatal death were gestational age below 37 weeks and birth-to-surgery interval greater than 4h. A high mortality was observed among babies of gastroschisis which is explained by factors like absence of prenatal diagnosis, prematurity, low birthweight, delivery outside the tertiary center, longer birth-to-surgery intervals and need of mechanical ventilation.","output":"Fatores prognsticos para bito em recm-nascidos com gastrosquise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>This paper aims to examine the frequency of co-movements and asymmetric dependencies between bitcoin (BTC), gold, Brent crude oil and the US economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index.Design/methodology/approach>The authors use a wavelet approach and a quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) method.Findings>The results show a positive interdependence between BTC and commodity price returns at both medium and low frequencies over the sample period.

A quantitative comparison of performed surgeries during this period and the same period a year earlier was conducted. RESULTS: 193 surgical residents (46%) completed the survey. 63% of residents were no longer admitted to multidisciplinary oncologic meetings and 107 (55%) residents had no longer any scientific meetings at all. 46% of the residents indicated more than 50% reduction in time in the operating theater. 31% of residents was involved in care for COVID-19 positive surgical patients. 78% of the residents experienced a negative impact on their surgical training and 41% experienced a negative influence on their private situation. Performed surgical cases during the COVID-19 period were on average 40% less for second, third- and fourth-year residents.CONCLUSION: Surgical residents perceived a high negative impact on personal and professional lives during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Flanders.

Meanwhile corporate interest in serious gaming in business has rapidly grown internationally. However the level of awareness and adoption of serious gaming among South African corporates in business is still unclear. This interpretive study explores South African corporate awareness of serious gaming in business and the barriers to its adoption. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from managers in Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies. Eight participants were interviewed across four different industries. Data analysis was guided by the general inductive approach. The absence of serious gaming adopters among the participants, and the general lack of awareness of serious gaming in business were identified as the most salient features. The analysis suggests that corporates currently use technologies related to serious games (e-learning, collaborative tools, and simulation tools), and that there is a demand for the greater promotion and use of serious gaming. While the findings provide new insights into the level of serious gaming awareness, caution should be exercised when attempting to generalize these findings due to the small sample and the scarcity of prior research.","output":"How Corporates in South Africa Are Using Serious Games in Business"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dynamic changes of RNA and antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients remain largely unknown, and influence factors for antibody production have not been fully clarified.

Moreover, 162 serial serum samples from 31 patients were tested for seroconversion of IgM and IgG. Meanwhile, IgM and IgG were also detected in 409 COVID-19 patients and 389 controls. Additionally, the logistic regression analysis was executed to identify the possible influence factors for antibody production.

The median time of seroconversion for IgM and IgG were both day 12 (IQR, 10C15). The sensitivity and specificity for IgM (or IgG) was 87.04% and 96.92%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that reduced lymphocytes and short positive conversion time for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were independent factors for negative results of IgM and IgG.

IMPLEMENTATION This initiative, established by an integrated health care system, is the first to utilize mobile health clinics into a holistic community health outreach program in partnership with barbershops and beauty salons to provide medical and social services to underserved populations. In addition to the mobile health clinics, key features of this program included lay first responder trainings on topics of physical and behavioral health, on-site medical and social services offered by community partners, and culturally relevant mental health programming. The majority of participants (n = 1823) were male (58%), Black (86%), and between the ages of 45 and 64 years (51%). EVALUATION Data presented include the number of clinical and social services provided. More than 8000 clinical and social services were provided between September 2016 and March 2020. Blood pressure (n = 2317), diabetes (n = 469), tobacco (n = 448), and cholesterol (n = 443) were the most accessed clinical screening services.

Biorelevant dissolution media are compositionally complex, can require multiple steps to fabricate, and are utilized across differing laboratories. The objective was to determine the contributions of location, operator, media fabrication method, day, and tablet to total dissolution variability into biorelevant media. Thirty min dissolution data from a prior report were subjected to analysis-of-variable (ANOVA). Results showed that total dissolution variance was highest for medium dissolution (versus high or low dissolution). Overall, across both ibuprofen and ketoconazole, the rank-order importance of sources of variation were location > operator (nested in sequence) > day > fabrication method > tablet. Location and day were the factors that most frequently were significant sources of variability. However, location was generally much more impactful than day, and location frequently contributed to the majority of total variance. Day never contributed as the majority factor and was generally minor. Fabrication method was occasionally significant, although never a majority contributor. Overall, of all factors, location contributed most to dissolution variance here, using biorelevant media, as observed in other studies not using biorelevant media.

Following severe tissue trauma, patients frequently develop acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) despite modern surgical and intensive care concepts. The underlying complex pathophysiology of life-threatening ALI/ARDS has been intensively studied in experimental and clinical settings. However, currently, the coronavirus family has become the focus of ALI/ARDS research because it represents an emerging global public health threat. The clinical presentation of the infection is highly heterogeneous, varying from a lack of symptoms to multiple organ dysfunction and mortality. In a particular subset of patients, the primary infection progresses rapidly to ALI and ARDS. The pathophysiological mechanisms triggering and driving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced ALI/ARDS are still poorly understood. Although it is also generally unknown whether insights from trauma-induced ARDS may be readily translated to SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS, it was still recommended to treat coronavirus-positive patients with ALI/ARDS with standard protocols for ALI/ARDS. However, this strategy was questioned by clinical scientists, because it was documented that some severely hypoxic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients exhibited a normal respiratory system compliance, a phenomenon rarely observed in ARDS patients with another underlying etiology. Therefore, coronavirus-induced ARDS was defined as a specific ARDS phenotype, which accordingly requires an adjusted therapeutic approach. These suggestions reflect previous attempts of classifying ARDS into different phenotypes that might overall facilitate ARDS diagnosis and treatment. Based on the clinical data from ARDS patients, two major phenotypes have been proposed: hyper- and hypo-inflammatory. Here, we provide a comparative review of the pathophysiological pathway of trauma-/hemorrhagic shock-induced ARDS and coronavirus-induced ARDS, with an emphasis on the crucial key points in the pathogenesis of both these ARDS forms. Therefore, the manifold available data on trauma-/hemorrhagic shock-induced ARDS may help to better understand coronavirus-induced ARDS.","output":"Inflammation, Thrombosis, and Destruction: The Three-Headed Cerberus of Trauma- and SARS-CoV-2-Induced ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented challenge to all health care professionals.

Using HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (CM) as a case study, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials to determine how inclusive and representative they were both in terms of the affected population and the involvement of local investigators. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, Africa-Wide, CINAHL Plus, and Web of Science. Data were extracted for 5 domains: study location and design, screening, participants, researchers, and funders. Data were summarised and compared over 3 time periods: pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) (pre-2000), early ART (2000 to 2009), and established ART (post-2010) using chi-squared and chi-squared for trend. Comparisons were made with global disease burden estimates and a composite reference derived from observational studies. RESULTS: Thirty-nine trials published between 1990 and 2019 were included. Earlier studies were predominantly conducted in high-income countries (HICs) and recent studies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Most recent studies occurred in high CM incidence countries, but some highly affected countries have not hosted trials. The sex and ART status of participants matched those of the general CM population. Patients with reduced consciousness and those suffering a CM relapse were underrepresented. Authorship had poor representation of women (29% of all authors), particularly as first and final authors. Compared to trials conducted in HICs, trials conducted in LMICs were more likely to include female authors (32% versus 20% p = 0.014) but less likely to have authors resident in (75% versus 100%, p < 0.001) or nationals (61% versus 93%, p < 0.001) of the trial location. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked shift in CM trials over the course of the HIV epidemic. Trials are primarily performed in locations and populations that reflect the burden of disease, but severe and relapse cases are underrepresented. Most CM trials now take place in LMICs, but the research is primarily funded and led by individuals and institutions from HICs.","output":"Equity in clinical trials for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis: A systematic review of global representation and inclusion of patients and researchers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to rely on a diverse poolof suppliers, besides achieving cost effectiveness.

Results: A total of 287 patients, 55 with AKI and 232 without AKI, were included in the analysis. Compared to patients without AKI, AKI patients were older, predominantly male, and were more likely to present with hypoxia and have pre-existing hypertension and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, AKI patients had higher levels of white blood cells, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, a higher prevalence of hyperkalemia, lower lymphocyte counts, and higher chest computed tomographic scores.

In the surgical world, elective cases ceased to help \\"flatten the curve\\" and prevent the infection from spreading to hospital staff and patients. We explored the effect of the cancellation of these procedures on trainee operative experience at our high-volume, multihospital neurosurgical practice. Methods: Our department cancelled all elective cases starting March 16, 2020, and resumed elective surgical and endovascular procedures on May 11, 2020. We retrospectively reviewed case volumes for 54 days prelockdown and 54 days postlockdown to evaluate the extent of the decrease in surgical volume at our institution. Procedure data were collected and then divided into cranial, spine, functional, peripheral nerve, pediatrics, and endovascular categories. Results: Mean total cases per day in the prelockdown group were 12.26  7.7, whereas in the postlockdown group, this dropped to 7.78  5.5 (P = 0.01). In the spine category, mean cases per day in the prelockdown group were 3.13  2.63;in the postlockdown group, this dropped to 0.96  1.36 (P &lt; 0.001). In the functional category, mean cases per day in the prelockdown group were 1.31  1.51, whereas in the postlockdown group, this dropped to 0.11  0.42 (P &lt; 0.001). For cranial (P = 0.245), peripheral nerve (P = 0.16), pediatrics (P = 0.34), and endovascular (P = 0.48) cases, the volumes dropped but were not statistically significant decreases. Conclusion: The impact of this outbreak on operative training does appear to be significant based solely on statistics. Although the drop in case volumes during this time can be accounted for by the pandemic, it is important to understand that this is a multifactorial effect. Further studies are needed for these results to be generalizable and to fully understand the effect this pandemic has had on trainee operative experience.

It has been used to detect diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic image analysis is still a required field with many open problems. The quality of many images it produced is rather unacceptable due to the nature of this imaging system, which causes some issues to prognosticate by physicians and computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper, a novel technique is proposed to improve the quality of images captured by the WCE. More specifically, it enhanced the brightness, contrast, and preserve the color information while reducing its computational complexity. Furthermore, the experimental results of PSNR and SSIM confirm that the error rate in this method is near to the ground and negligible. Moreover, the proposed method improves intensity restricted average local entropy (IRMLE) by 22%, color enhancement factor (CEF) by 10%, and can keep the lightness of image effectively. The performances of our method have better visual quality and objective assessments in compare to the state-of-art methods.","output":"Image quality enhancement in wireless capsule endoscopy with adaptive fraction gamma transformation and unsharp masking filter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological age is the greatest risk factor for nearly every major cause of death and disability, including COVID-19. Yet, traditional biomedical research and clinical approaches have focused on waiting until people are sick and treating individual diseases one at a time. Attempts to cure age-related diseases have proven unsuccessful, and the impact of disease-first approaches continue to be incremental. Recent advances in understanding them mechanisms linking biological aging to disease, or geroscience, have identified interventions that directly target the molecular hallmarks of aging. Unlike disease-specific approaches, such interventions have the potential to prevent multiple diseases of aging simultaneously, thereby greatly enhancing healthspan and lifespan for most individuals. Here I will provide an overview of translational geroscience, which I believe will become the paradigm for the practice of medicine in the 21st century. I will also discuss recent work with one such intervention, the drug rapamycin, and our efforts to eventually delay or reverse biological aging in companion dogs and people.","output":"Targeting Biological Aging: A New Paradigm for 21st Century Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: to describe the experience of military nursing in Operation Return to Brazil in an aeromedical evacuation Method: this is an experience report of the nursing staff in the Aeromedical Evacuation of potentially-contaminated Brazilians who were in Wuhan, China, after the outbreak of the new coronavirus Results: the report was constructed from nursing care performed in three stages: pre-flight, screening, and flight Pre-flight care would include aircraft configuration and material prediction In screening, the staff was concerned with being properly attired In the health assessment of returnees, in-flight, attention was focused on Personal Protective Equipment handling to minimize the risk of contamination by prolonged contact with potentially-contaminated passengers Final considerations: nursing was committed to planning all the actions of this mission, which was one of the longest, strenuous and unprecedented in the history of aeromedical transport in Brazil RESUMEN Objetivo: describir la experiencia de enfermera militar en la Operacin Regreso a Brasil en una evacuacin aeromdica Mtodo: este es un informe de experiencia del equipo de enfermera, en la evacuacin aeromdica de brasile?os potencialmente contaminados que se encontraban en Wuhan, China, despus del brote del nuevo coronavirus Resultado: el informe se construy a partir de la atencin de enfermera realizada en tres etapas: pre-vuelo, deteccin y vuelo En el prevuelo, el cuidado incluy la configuracin de la aeronave y el pronstico del material En la evaluacin, al equipo le preocupaba estar bien preparado En la evaluacin de la salud de los retornados, durante el vuelo, la atencin se centr en el manejo de equipos de proteccin personal para minimizar el riesgo de contaminacin por contacto prolongado con pasajeros potencialmente contaminados Consideraciones finales: la enfermera se comprometi a planificar todas las acciones de esta misin, que fue una de las ms largas, extenuantes y sin precedentes en la historia del transporte aeromdico en Brasil RESUMO Objetivo: descrever a experincia da enfermagem militar na Operao Regresso ao Brasil em uma evacuao aeromdica Mtodo: trata-se de um relato de experincia da equipe de enfermagem, na evacuao aeromdica dos brasileiros potencialmente contaminados que estavam em Wuhan, China, aps o surto do novo coronavrus Resultado: o relato foi construdo a partir de cuidados de enfermagem realizados em trs etapas: pr-voo, triagem e voo No pr-voo, os cuidados incluram a configurao da aeronave e a previs?o do material Na triagem, a equipe preocupou-se em estar devidamente aparamentada Na avaliao de sade dos repatriados, durante voo, concentrou-se a ateno no manejo dos Equipamentos de Proteo Individual para minimizar o risco de contaminao pelo contato prolongado, com passageiros potencialmente contaminados Consideraes finais: a enfermagem empenhou-se no planejamento de todas as aes dessa miss?o, que foi uma das mais longas, extenuantes e inditas da histria do transporte aeromdico do Brasil","output":"Military Nursing in \\"Operation Return to Brazil\\": aeromedical evacuation in the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE.: To report the high incidence of barotrauma in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to discuss its implications. DESIGN.: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING.: ICU of an academic county hospital in Los Angeles, CA admitted from March 15-June 20, 2020. PATIENTS.: 77 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 75 patients met inclusion criteria. RESULTS.: 21% of patients with severe COVID-19 sustained barotrauma (33% of patients receiving IMV, 8% of patients receiving (NIV). There were no differences between the barotrauma and non-barotrauma groups regarding demographics, illness severity, or medications received, nor tidal volume or average/peak airway pressures in those receiving IMV. In the barotrauma group there was a greater proportion of patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (81% vs. 47%, p = 0.023) and ventilated using airway pressure release ventilation mode (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.043). Barotrauma was associated with increased likelihood of receiving a tracheostomy (OR 2.58 [0.23-4.9], p = 0.018]), longer median ICU length of stay (17 days vs. 7 days, p = 0.03), and longer median length of hospitalization (26 days vs. 14 days, p < 0.001). There was also a trend toward prolonged median duration of IMV (12.5 days vs 7 days, p = 0.13) and higher average mortality (56% vs 37%, p = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS.: Barotrauma is seen in 5-12% of patients with ARDS receiving IMV and is exceedingly rare in patients receiving NIV. We report a high incidence of barotrauma observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring either NIV or IMV. While there was a trend toward increased mortality in patients with barotrauma, this did not reach statistical significance. The increased incidence of barotrauma with COVID-19 may be a product of the pathophysiology of this disease state and a heightened inflammatory response causing rampant acute lung injury. Evidence-based medicine and lung-protective ventilation should remain the mainstay of treatment.","output":"High Incidence of Barotrauma in Patients With Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To reflect on the mental health of Nursing professionals in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.

Although necessary to control spread of the virus and preserve personal protective equipment, this shift highlights existing disparities in access and care. Patients without the skills and tools to access telehealth services may increase their risk of exposure by seeking care in person or may delay care entirely. We know that patients need internet access, devices capable of visual communication, and the skills to use these devices to experience the full benefits of telehealth, yet we also know that disparities are present in each of these areas. Currently, federal programs have given physicians greater flexibility in providing care remotely and have expanded internet access for vulnerable patients to promote telehealth services. However, these changes are temporary and it is uncertain which will remain when the pandemic is over.

Accumulating evidence suggests that emotional and cognitive self-regulation is particularly needed to effectively cope with stress. Therefore, we investigated the predictive value of affective and inhibitory prefrontal control for stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis. Physical and mental health burden were assessed using an online survey, which was administered to 104 participants of an ongoing at-risk birth cohort during the first wave in April 2020. Two follow-ups were carried out during the pandemic, one capturing the relaxation during summer and the other the beginning of the second wave of the crisis. Prefrontal activity during emotion regulation and inhibitory control were assessed prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Increased inferior frontal gyrus activity during emotion regulation predicted lower stress burden at the beginning of the first and the second wave of the crisis. In contrast, inferior and middle frontal gyrus activity during inhibitory control predicted effective coping only during the summer, when infection rates decreased but stress burden remained unchanged. These findings remained significant when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical confounders such as stressful life events prior to the crisis or current psychopathology. We demonstrate that differential stress-buffering effects are predicted by the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation and cognitive regulation at different stages during the pandemic. These findings may inform future prevention strategies to foster stress coping in unforeseen situations.","output":"Coping under stress: Prefrontal control predicts stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We report on a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak among adolescents at an inpatient behavioral health facility that was identified within 5 weeks of known viral transmission in the surrounding community. METHODS: Clinical records were reviewed for all inpatients aged <18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 23 and April 21, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 19 COVID-19Cpositive patients aged 11C17 years were identified. Patients most commonly presented with sore throat (37%) and nausea/vomiting (32%). Only 26% of patients presented with cough, shortness of breath, or fever. The most common medical comorbidity was asthma (32%), and the most common psychiatric comorbidity was posttraumatic stress disorder (63%). Infected patients were colocated and managed together on a separate COVID-19 unit to maintain a therapeutic group milieu. Mental health treatment was modified to limit staff exposure. Patients received daily medical assessment by an in-house pediatrician. One patient required intravenous fluids. No patients required transfer to a medical facility. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents in psychiatric inpatient settings may be especially vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.

However, the mechanistic basis and the regulatory control of such damage is poorly characterized. Previous studies have identified A. fumigatus mediated pathogenesis as occurring at early ( 16 hours) or late (>16 hours) phases of the fungal interaction with epithelial cells, and respectively involve direct contact with the host cell or the action of soluble factors produced by mature fungal hyphae. Both early and late phases of epithelial damage have been shown to be subject to genetic regulation by the pH-responsive transcription factor PacC. This study sought to determine whether other transcriptional regulators play a role in modulating epithelial damage. In particular, whether the early and late phases of epithelial damage are governed by same or distinct regulators. Furthermore, whether processes such as spore uptake and hyphal adhesion, that have previously been documented to promote epithelial damage, are governed by the same cohorts of epithelial regulators. Using 479 strains from the recently constructed library of A. fumigatus transcription factor null mutants, two high-throughput screens assessing epithelial cell detachment and epithelial cell lysis were conducted. A total of 17 transcription factor mutants were found to exhibit reproducible deficits in epithelial damage causation. Of these, 10 mutants were defective in causing early phase damage via epithelial detachment and 8 mutants were defective in causing late phase damage via epithelial lysis. Remarkably only one transcription factor, PacC, was required for causation of both phases of epithelial damage. The 17 mutants exhibited varied and often unique phenotypic profiles with respect to fitness, epithelial adhesion, cell wall defects, and rates of spore uptake by epithelial cells. Strikingly, 9 out of 10 mutants deficient in causing early phase damage also exhibited reduced rates of hyphal extension, and culture supernatants of 7 out of 8 mutants deficient in late phase damage were significantly less cytotoxic. Our study delivers the first high-level overview of A. fumigatus regulatory genes governing lung epithelial damage, suggesting highly coordinated genetic orchestration of host-damaging activities that govern epithelial damage in both space and time. Contribution to the Field Statement Aspergillus fumigatus is a soil dwelling fungus that can cause lethal lung infections in individuals with a compromised immune system. Disease initiates with inhalation of the fungal spores, followed by growth of the fungus leading to destruction of the lung. Our understanding of the A. fumigatus genes and mechanisms driving lung damage leading to establishment of disease is limited. This study has identified the genes moderating lung damage by assessing 479 regulatory mutants of A. fumigatus for their ability to cause epithelial damage using a lung cell line model. We observed that distinct cohorts of transcriptional regulators are required for driving early, and late phases of epithelial damage and that early- and late-occurring damage are associated respectively with hyphal growth rates and secreted fungal products. This study is the first to reveal that mechanistically distinct programs of host damage elicited during early and late stage of fungal interaction with epithelial cells are genetically regulated via distinct cohorts of A. fumigatus transcription factors.","output":"Distinct cohorts of Aspergillus fumigatus transcription factors are required for epithelial damage occurring via contact- or soluble effector-mediated mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus Corona telah menjadi masalah kesehatan yang marak terjadi sejak awal tahun 2020 bermula dari negara China Wuhan. Indonesia telah menjadi salah satu negara di Asia dengan angka kematian (Death Rate) tertinggi di dunia. Banyaknya kasus yang masih belum terdeteksi dan terlaporkan membuat situasi di Indonesia menjadi lebih buruk. Jumlah pasien yang terus meningkat dan keterbatasan fasilitas alat dan tenaga kesehatan menjadi kendala bagi Indonesia untuk menghadapi COVID-19. Berdasarkan permasalahan di atas penulis tertarik membuat sistem prediksi jumlah pasien COVID-19 menggunakan metode Trend Least Square berbasis web. Proses prediksi dilakukan dengan menggunakan tool RStudio. Hasil prediksi akan diimplementasikan ke dalam website. Analisa hasil prediksi dilakukan dengan menghitung nilai Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Sayangnya nilai rata-rata persentase MAPE prediksi pasien COVID-19 di Indonesia sebesar 592 % menunjukkan prediksi dengan metode Trend Least Square tergolong buruk.

Kata Kunci: COVID-19 prediksi trend least square r studio data mining The Coronavirus has become a rife health problem since the beginning of 2020 starting in China Wuhan. Indonesia has become one of the countries in Asia with the highest death rate in the world. The large number of cases that have not been detected and reported has made the situation in Indonesia even worse. The increasing number of patients and limited facilities equipment and health personnel are obstacles for Indonesia to deal with COVID-19. Based on the problems the authors are interested in making a prediction system for the number of COVID-19 patients using the web-based Trend Least Square method. The prediction process is carried out using the RStudio tool. The prediction results will be implemented on the website. Analysis of the prediction results is done by calculating the value of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Unfortunately, the average value of the predicted MAPE percentage for COVID-19 patients in Indonesia is 59.2% indicating that the prediction using Trend Least Square method is poor. This prediction system can predict COVID-19 patients according to the available time and are processed in advance using RStudio. Testing the website using the Black Box method has successful results for each test scenario. The purpose of this study was to create a prediction system for COVID-19 patients using the web-based Trend Least Square method. This system predicts the development of the number of patients who are infected recovered and related to COVID-19 especially in the Indonesian region so that local governments can prepare the right facilities and infrastructure and policies for the COVID-19 epidemic.

Here we depict the clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings of preterm triplets born at 28 6/7 weeks to a mother who contracted COVID-19 just 1 week before delivery. The triplets showed SARS-CoV-2 positivity right after birth, developed significant leukopenia and early-onset pulmonary interstitial emphysema. The most severely affected triplet I required 10 days of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation due to failure of conventional invasive ventilation, and circulatory support for 4 days. Despite a severe clinical course in two triplets (triplet I and II), clinical management without experimental, targeted antiviral drugs was successful. At discharge home, the triplets showed no signs of neurologic or pulmonary sequelae. Placental immunohistology with SARS-CoV-2 N-protein localized strongly to syncytiotrophoblast cells and, to a lesser extent, to fetal Hofbauer cells, proving intrauterine virus transmission.

METHODS: An in-depth analysis of articles published by the Geraldton Guardian in 2019 examined the nature of FV reporting. Analysis was based on deductive coding from existing literature and inductive identification of new themes. A comparative analysis examined articles from the Geraldton Guardian and Albany Advertiser over the same three-month period in 2015, 2017 and 2019 to analyse trends in FV reporting. RESULTS: Of 135 articles analysed, there was alignment with five previously reported themes and two new themes were identified: FV as a public health issue; and community responses to reduce FV. Episodic framing was overwhelmingly associated with court reporting. There was more reporting of efforts at primary prevention of FV over time in both newspapers. CONCLUSIONS: Local media can contribute to the promotion of community and public health issues related to FV. Efforts are needed to improve court reporting to situate FV in a broader context.

It is a safe and feasible approach in the hands of trained surgeons. The introduction of robotics into surgery represents progression in the field of minimally invasive surgery but has seen a slow uptake in the hepatopancreaticobiliary subspeciality. We report our initial experience in 20 cases of laparoscopic robotic liver resection (LRLR). From March 2011 to April 2013 patients with lesions within the liver were assessed and consented for laparoscopic robotic liver surgery. This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively kept database on preoperative details and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. During the time period there were 20 LRLRs. The median age was 62 years (range 39-80 years) with a male to female ratio of 14:6. Ten patients had left lateral sectionectomies, 10 patients had atypical segmental resections; 14 patients had resections for malignancies, 6 patients had resections for benign disease. One case was converted to open resection. The mean operating time was 176.4  74.6 min (range 60-300 min), the mean blood loss was 107  106 ml (range 50-700 ml) and the mean hospital stay was 6.5  3.7 days (range 2-16 days). Two patients required blood transfusions. The incidence of postoperative complications was 10 % (n = 2). LRLR overcomes some of the disadvantages of conventional laparoscopic surgery. It is a technically feasible and safe approach for wedge resections and left lateral sectionectomy of the liver without oncological compromise. However, this surgical technique requires advanced laparoscopic skills and there is an associated steep learning curve. Further studies are needed to determine the potential advantages of this technique for the patient compared to the traditional laparoscopic approach.","output":"Laparoscopic robotic liver surgery: the Henri Mondor initial experience of 20 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the magnitude of smokeless tobacco (SLT) use in India and identified policy gaps to ascertain the priorities for SLT control in India and other high SLT burden countries in the Southeast Asia region.

The recombinant protein r G-CSF was applied as a reference. The studied polysaccharides were shown to stimulate the release of white and red blood cells, as well as platelets from bone marrow in immunosuppressed mice, while r G-CSF was only responsible for the significant increase in the level of leucocytes. The analysis of different populations of leucocytes in blood indicated that r G-CSF mainly stimulated the production of neutrophils, whereas in the cases of the studied saccharides, increases in the levels of monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils were observed. The normalization of the level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the serum and the recovery of cell populations in the spleen were observed in immunosuppressed mice following treatment with the polysaccharides.

Daily application of a 0.1% solution of RA to the shaved skin of UM-HET3 mice on an AL diet produced a severe irritation that was evident by day 4, maximal at day 7C8 and still detectable at day 14. Skin irritation was characterized by redness, dryness, flaking and failure of the hair to grow at the treated site. In CR mice, the same treatment produced little detectable irritation. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the retinoid-treatment period (day 7 or day 14) and skin from these animals was examined histologically. In both AL and CR mice, a similar degree of epidermal hyperplasia was observed. Numerous inflammatory cells (mononuclear cells and granulocytes) were present in the skin of both groups. Occasional S100-positive cells (presumably Langerhans cells) were also observed in the epidermis of skin from both groups. S100-positive cells were also observed in the dermis. When skin from CR and AL mice was incubated in organ culture for 3 days (on day 7 after initiation of RA treatment), similar levels of four different pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in the conditioned medium. Soluble type I collagen levels were also similar. In contrast, the level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was lower in the conditioned medium of skin from CR mice than in conditioned medium from skin cultures of AL mice. Taken together, these studies suggest that CR may provide a way to mitigate the irritation that normally accompanies RA treatment without compromising the beneficial effects of retinoid use.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, online-based survey study between January 28, 2020, and February 2, 2020 among the adult lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify factors associated with psychological impacts. RESULTS: Among the 4100 participants investigated, a total of 15.9% were compliant with all the five household prevention measures, whereas 74.4% were compliant with all the three community prevention measures investigated. By demographics, participants of younger age, higher income, residing in an urban area, knowing neighbors infected with COVID-19 reported significantly higher psychological impact score. Participants with a lower level of support for quarantine were more likely to have a higher psychological impact score (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96).

DESIGN Retrospective study approved By Committee For The Protection Of Human Subjects at University Of Texas Medical School at Houston. SETTING University-affiliated children's hospital. MEASUREMENTS The records of pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia for electrophysiology procedures were analyzed. Electronic data collected included Bispectral Index (BIS) values, anesthetics (eg, opioids, expired concentration of inhaled anesthetics, muscle relaxants), hemodynamic values (ie, heart rate, invasive blood pressure), respiratory parameters [ie, tidal volume, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2)], and routine arterial blood gases. These parameters were analyzed 10 minutes prior to the start of the isoproterenol infusion (T-pre) and 10 minutes after isoproterenol had reduced the cardiac cycle length by 20% (T-infusion). MAIN RESULTS Of the 29 records that were screened, 22 met the above criteria (mean age 13  5 yrs). BIS values increased by an average of 8 (33  8 to 41  10; P < 0.001) during the isoproterenol infusion. Statistically significant increases in ETCO2 (median 33 - 36 mmHg; P = 0.01), PaCO2 (35 - 38 mmHg; P = 0.002), and lactate (1.1 -1.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001) occurred with infusion of isoproterenol. Patients undergoing controlled mechanical ventilation showed an increase in ETCO2 (mean 34  6 mmHg to 37  5 mmHg; P = 0.001) whereas those breathing spontaneously had an increase in minute ventilation (average increase 111  30 mL/kg). CONCLUSIONS Isoproterenol increases metabolic, respiratory, and BIS values in pediatric patients during general anesthesia.

In this study, we employed network pharmacology to analyze the potential active components and elucidate molecular mechanism of SQSBD in treating AML. A total of 268 active components were identified from SQSBD, among which 9 key components (Quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, licochalcone A, formononetin, wogonin, -sitosterol, oroxylin A, naringenin, and baicalein) were hit by the 6 hub targets (CDK1, MAPK1, JUN, PCNA, HSB1, STAT3) associated with leukemia. Molecular docking showed that two core active components, quercetin and licochalcone A, exhibited the highest component-like properties (DL), and could bind well to CDK1 and MAPK1 protein. The experimental validation of these two components showed that quercetin inhibited cell growth through CDK1 dephosphorylation-mediated cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in human AML U937 and HL60 cells, and licochalcone A induced cell differentiation in these leukemia cells via activation of MAPK1 and upregulation of CD11b.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for cHCoV OC43, NL63, HKU1 and 229E, and 15 other respiratory viruses. We assessed disease severity based on the clinical factors hospitalization length, oxygen requirement, other respiratory support and supplementary fluids. RESULTS: cHCoV was detected in 341 (8%) of 4312 children. Among 104 children with single cHCoV detections, 58 (56%) had lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and 20 (19%) developed severe disease. The proportion with severe disease was lower among single cHCoV detections compared with single RSV detections (338 of 870; 39%), but similar to single RV detections (136 of 987; 14%).

NaOCl hydrolyzes to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl) to kill viruses, which is a relatively efficient chlorine-based disinfectant commonly used in public disinfection. While people enjoy the convenience of NaOCl disinfection, excessive and indiscriminate use of it will affect the water environment and threaten human health. Importantly, HOCl is an indispensable reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human body. Whether its concentration is normal or not is closely related to human health. Excessive production of HOCl in the body contributes to some inflammatory diseases and even cancer. Also, we noticed that the concentration of ROS in cancer cells is about 10 times higher than that in normal cells. Herein, we developed a HOCl-activatable biotinylated dual-function fluorescent probe BTH. For this probe, we introduced biotin on the naphthalimide fluorophore, which increased the water solubility and enabled the probe to aggregate in cancer cells by targeting specific receptor overexpressed on the surface of cancer cell membrane. After reacting to HOCl, the p-aminophenylether moiety of this probe was oxidatively removed and the fluorescence of the probe was recovered. As expected, in the PBS solution with pH of 7.4, BTH could give full play to the performance of detecting HOCl, and it has made achievements in detecting the concentration of HOCl in actual water samples. Besides that, BTH had effectively distinguished between cancer cells and normal cells through a dual-function discrimination strategy, which used biotin to enrich the probe in cancer cells and reacted with overexpressed HOCl in cancer cells. Importantly, this dual-function discrimination strategy could obtain the precision detection of cancer cells, thereby offering assistance for improving the accuracy of early cancer diagnosis.","output":"A new-type HOCl-activatable fluorescent probe and its applications in water environment and biosystems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is a kind of life threat disease encountered at high altitude, but the precise pathogenesis of it is far more understood. Hypobaic hypoxia (HH) and cold are conditions characteristic of high altitude environment. HH is always considered as the central causative factor for the development of HACE, but the effect of cold stress on HACE has been rarely investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of cold stress in the development of HACE and establish a stable experimental animal model. Male SPF Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups for this experiment, control group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 25 a), NC + 2 a group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 2 a), HH group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 25 a), HH+2 a group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 2 a) and HH + 12/2 a (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 12 a/2 a light/dark cycle). After exposure for 72 h, the blood and brain tissues were collected. Brain water content (BWC) and Evans Blue dye extravasation were used to assess the brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Oxidative stress markers and ATPase activity were determined using commercial kits. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of related proteins. Compared to control, HH+2 a could significantly increase the BWC and BBB permeability, and these changes were further exacerbated by HH + 12/2 a. Furthermore, HH+2 a and HH + 12/2 a markedly increased the levels of H2O2 and MDA, restrained SOD and GSH levels and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activitie compared with the control group. In addition, HH+2 a and HH + 12/2 a enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1?, TNF-&#945; and IL-6 in serum and significantly increased the expression of VEGF in brain compared with the control group, but only HH + 12/2 a could increase the expression of AQP4. However, compared with control group, no significant differences in these parameters were observed in HH and NC+2 agroups. These results demonstrated that HH or cold stress alone did not successfully induce brain damage, while HH+2 a could induce the onset of HACE via provoking injury caused by HH. HH + 12/2 a was more obvious and efficient. Collectively, we firstly suggest that cold stress may promote the formation of HACE by aggravating the brain injury induced by HH exposure and supply an effective and reliable experimental rat model of HACE via HH combined with temperature fluctuation.","output":"Establishment of an experimental rat model of high altitude cerebral edema by hypobaric hypoxia combined with temperature fluctuation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This study aims to examine the key components to facilitate flexible work arrangement (FWA) and the issues and challenges arisen in preparing the workplace for FWA during Covid-19, and to recommend better approach of FWA implementation in workplace.

As opposed to fingerprints and ID cards, facial recognition technology can effectively prevent the spread of viruses in public places because it does not require contact with specific sensors. However, people also need to wear masks when entering public places, and masks will greatly affect the accuracy of facial recognition. Accurately performing facial recognition while people wear masks is a great challenge. In order to solve the problem of low facial recognition accuracy with mask wearers during the COVID-19 epidemic, we propose a masked-face recognition algorithm based on large margin cosine loss (MFCosface). Due to insufficient masked-face data for training, we designed a masked-face image generation algorithm based on the detection of the detection of key facial features. The face is detected and aligned through a multi-task cascaded convolutional network;and then we detect the key features of the face and select the mask template for coverage according to the positional information of the key features. Finally, we generate the corresponding masked-face image. Through analysis of the masked-face images, we found that triplet loss is not applicable to our datasets, because the results of online triplet selection contain fewer mask changes, making it difficult for the model to learn the relationship between mask occlusion and feature mapping. We use a large margin cosine loss as the loss function for training, which can map all the feature samples in a feature space with a smaller intra-class distance and a larger inter-class distance. In order to make the model pay more attention to the area that is not covered by the mask, we designed an Att-inception module that combines the Inception-Resnet module and the convolutional block attention module, which increases the weight of any unoccluded area in the feature map, thereby enlarging the unoccluded areas contribution to the identification process. Experiments on several masked-face datasets have proved that our algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of masked-face recognition, and can accurately perform facial recognition with masked subjects. ? 2021 by the authors.

Sarcopenia in ESLD can negatively impact quality of life and increase mortality. Despite this, very little is understood about the mechanisms of sarcopenia in these conditions. One key reason for this is the reluctance to undertake percutaneous muscle biopsies due to the perceived increased risks. ESLD can induce thrombocytopaenia and coagulopathy which significantly increases the risk of bleeding. In addition, patients with either NAFLD or ESLD often have co-morbidities that would require additional care and risk assessment. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish an effective and safe protocol for the implementation of percutaneous muscle biopsies in patients with NAFLD and ESLD. METHODS: A total of 47 patients with ESLD and 9 patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD were recruited from the Liver Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital (Birmingham, United Kingdom). A total of 71 percutaneous vastus lateralis biopsies were attempted over two study visits. A vigorous safety screening occurred prior to and during each visit and a strict protocol was followed to mitigate against complications and risk. RESULTS: A total of 85% of patients consented to the muscle biopsy at either visit (48/56). A total of 9% of consented biopsies could not occur due to medical considerations, including high international normalised ratio (INR) (n = 3) and the use of aspirin (n = 4). Muscle tissue was obtained from 90% of attempts, with a mean average yield (wet weight tissue) of 98.1  52.9 mg.

RESULTS: A decision support surveillance system has been developed which extracts comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data including live data from physiologic monitors and ventilators and incorporates them into an integrated organ icon-based patient display. Live data retrieved from the hospitals network are processed by presenting scrolling median values to reduce artifacts. A total of 48 possible alerts are generated covering a broad range of critical patient care concerns. Notification is achieved by paging or texting the appropriated member of the critical care team. Alerts range from simple out of range values to more complex programing of impending Ventilator Associated Events, SOFA, qSOFA, SIRS scores and process of care reminders for the management of glucose and sepsis. As with similar systems developed for the operating room and labor and delivery, there are green, yellow, and red configurable ranges for all parameters. A census view allows surveillance of an entire unit with flashing or text to voice alerting and enables detailed information by windowing into an individual patient view including live physiologic waveforms. The system runs via web interface on desktop as well as mobile devices, with iOS native app available, for ease of communication from any location. The goal is to improve safety and adherence to standard management protocols. CONCLUSIONS: AWAC is designed to provide a high level surveillance view for multi-bed hospital units with varying acuity from standard floor patients to complex ICU care. Alerts are generated by algorithms running in the background and automatically notify the selected member of the patients care team. Its value has been demonstrated for low acuity patients, further study is required to determine its effectiveness in high acuity patients.","output":"Design of a novel multifunction decision support/alerting system for in-patient acute care, ICU and floor (AlertWatch AC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Health care and non-health care essential workers working in face-to-face interactions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be vulnerable to psychosocial distress. Limited empirical research on COVID-19-related psychosocial outcomes has utilized probability-based samples including both health care and non-health care essential workers. METHOD: We surveyed a sample of 1,821 United States self-identified essential workers, collected using probability-based methods, working in face-to-face interactions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak (March 18, 2020 through April 18, 2020), in three consecutive 10-day cohorts. We assessed acute stress, health-related worries, and functional impairment. Demographics, secondary stressors (lack of childcare or health care, lost wages), and pre-COVID-19 mental and physical health were examined as predictors of psychological outcomes. RESULTS: Acute stress (? = .08, p = .001), health-related worries (? = .09, p = .001), and functional impairment (? = .05, p = .034) increased over time in the early weeks of the outbreak. Health care essential workers reported lower functional impairment (? = -.06, p = .009) and acute stress (? = -.06, p = .015) compared with non-health care essential workers. Across the sample, prior mental and physical health ailments, inability to obtain health care, lost wages, younger age, female gender, and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with acute stress (?s = -.14 to .15, ps  .001), health-related worries (?s = -.09 to .14, ps  .001), and functional impairment (?s = -.08 to .16, ps  .006). Lack of childcare (? = .09, p < .001) was positively associated with acute stress. CONCLUSION: Non-health care essential workers may be vulnerable to negative psychosocial outcomes. Targeted training and support may help facilitate coping with the effects of working in-person during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Findings may help inform intervention efforts, critical as COVID-19 becomes endemic and society must learn to live with its evolving variants.

TPM leads to the leakage of air into the mediastinal cavity and increased pressure in thoracic vessels, respiratory tract, and the heart. Herein, this report presents a series of five cases of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and TPM. All patients were male who had severe ARDS with a secondary lung infection that required invasive ventilation and had moderate positive-end expiratory pressure. All patients required vasopressors to maintain hemodynamics, and two patients needed decompression with chest drains. One patient received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. Three patients had cardiac arrest, and two patients died; thus, the mortality rate was 40%. Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS required invasive ventilation and prone positioning. Secondary lung infection can cause TPM, and TPM may cause cardiac arrest.

This study evaluated the risk of COVID-19 mortality, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with pre-existing mental disorders or exposure to psychopharmacological treatments. Methods: In this PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO-CRD42021233984), we searched Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane, PubMed, and Ovid/PsycINFO databases through March 5, 2021 for studies reporting data on COVID-19 outcomes in psychiatric patients compared to controls. Risk of COVID-19 mortality was defined as the primary outcome, with hospitalization and ICU admission as secondary outcomes. We modeled random-effects meta-analyses to estimate crude (OR) and adjusted (aOR) odds ratios for these three outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, publication bias was tested with Egger regression and visual inspection of funnel plots. Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to explore study quality. We estimated effect sizes associated with any pre-existing mental disorder as well as specific categories of mental disorders (psychotic disorders, mood disorders, substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders), and exposure to psychopharmacological drug classes (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics). Severe mental illness was compared with other mental disorders. We also conducted subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to assess the effects of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting, patient age, country, pandemic phase, quality assessment score and adjustment for confounders. Findings: A total of 32 studies were included in the systematic review and 23 in the meta-analysis, representing 658,702 patients with COVID-19 (41,944 with mental disorders). The presence of any mental disorder was associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (Crude OR 199, 95% CI 156-254;aOR 134, 95% CI 115-156). This association was confirmed in psychotic disorders (Crude OR 211, 95% CI 147-303;aOR 177, 95% CI 134-233), and mood disorders (Crude OR 198, 95% CI 148-264;aOR 144, 95% CI 114-182). An increased mortality risk with substance use disorders (Crude OR 176, 95% CI 130- 238;aOR 112, 95% CI 089-139) and intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders (Crude OR 147, 95% CI 108-201) was only established in unadjusted estimates. We detected no effect for anxiety disorders (Crude OR 106, 95% CI 075-151;aOR 101, 95% CI 076-134). COVID-19 mortality was also associated with exposure to antipsychotics (Crude OR 371, 95% CI 174-791;aOR 243, 95% CI 181-325) and anxiolytics (Crude OR 258, 95% CI 122-544;aOR 147, 95% CI 115-188), but with antidepressant exposure only in unadjusted models (Crude OR 223, 95% CI 106-471;aOR 118, 95% CI 093-150). Overall, mental disorders were consistently associated with increased risk of hospitalization (Crude OR: 224, 95% CI 170-294;aOR: 177, 95% CI 129-242), but not ICU admission (Crude OR 171, 95% CI 1-293;aOR 126, 95% CI 078-205). Increased rates of hospital and ICU admission were found in substance use disorders (Hospitalization - Crude OR: 266, 95% CI 179-395;aOR: 187, 95% CI 116-303;ICU - Crude OR 259, 95% CI 154-438) and for unadjusted estimates in mood disorders (Hospitalization Crude OR 226, 95% CI 133-386;aOR 126, 95% CI 064-250;ICU - Crude OR 239, 95% CI 115-500;aOR 113, 95% CI 070-184). Psychotic disorders were not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (Crude OR 168, 95% CI 086-329;aOR: 134, 95% CI 061-294), and even showed a decreased risk of ICU admission in adjusted estimates (Crude OR 077, 95% CI 042- 142;aOR 075, 95% CI 062-091). Adjusted effect sizes were significantly higher for mortality (p=0005) and lower for ICU admission (p<0001) in severe mental illness compared to other ment l disorders.Interpretation: Pre-existing mental disorders, in particular psychotic and mood disorders, as well as exposure to antipsychotics and anxiolytics, were associated with COVID-19 mortality. Substance use disorders were associated with COVID-19 hospitalization. These findings support the need for targeted approaches for the management and prevention of COVID-19 in patients with mental disorders.

Several purification strategies are evaluated using a variety of chromatography methods, including membrane adsorbers and packed-bed ion-exchange chromatography. Cell harvest is initially treated with endonuclease, clarified, and further concentrated by ultrafiltration before chromatography purification. The use of anion-exchange chromatography in all forms results in strong binding of the virus to the media, necessitating a high salt concentration for elution. The large virus and spike protein binds very strongly to the high surface area of the membrane adsorbents, resulting in poor virus recovery (<15%), while the use of packed-bed chromatography, where the surface area is smaller, achieves better recovery (up to 33%). Finally, a highly efficient chromatography purification process with CaptoTM Core 700 resin, which does not require binding and the elution of the virus, is described. rVSV-S cannot enter the inner pores of the resin and is collected in the flow-through eluent. Purification of the rVSV-S virus with CaptoTM Core 700 resulted in viral infectivity above 85% for this step, with the efficient removal of host cell proteins, consistent with regulatory requirements.

The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310C400 nm, UV-B: 280C310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O(3). In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27C31, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show beneficial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety 72:2013C2019, 2009c, 2010). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed.

The larger the size (or number of VWF multimers), the greater the functionality of the protein. A deficiency or defect of VWF can lead to von Willebrand disease (VWD) and cause bleeding. Conversely, an increase in VWF may create an environment that promotes thrombosis. ADAMS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), sometimes called VWF-cleaving protease, is primarily responsible for controlling the size of VWF. The most severe deficiency (<10% of normal levels) of ADAMTS-13 arises in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a condition characterized by the presence of ultralarge VWF and clinically resulting in enhanced risk of thrombosis. However, ADAMTS-13 deficiency may result from other pathological processes. Of relevance is the recent finding that COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is associated with both increased levels and activity of VWF as well as generally decreased (or occasionally normal) activity levels of ADAMTS-13. Thus, in COVID-19 there is an alteration in the VWF/ADAMTS-13 axis, most often described by increased VWF/ADAMTS-13 ratio (or reduced ADAMTS-13/VWF ratio). COVID-19 is also associated with high prothrombotic risk. Thus, the imbalance of VWF and ADAMTS-13 in COVID-19 may be providing a milieu that promotes (micro)thrombosis, in a clinical picture resembling a secondary thrombotic microangiopathy in some patients. This review therefore assesses the literature on VWF, ADAMTS-13, and COVID-19. Whenever reported in COVID-19, VWF has always been identified as raised (compared with normal reference ranges or control populations). Reports have included VWF level (i.e., VWF antigen) and in some cases one or more VWF \\"activity\\" (e.g., collagen binding; platelet glycoprotein Ib [GPIb] binding, using ristocetin cofactor or more modern versions including VWF:GPIbR [recombinant] and VWF:GPIbM [mutant]). Whenever reported, ADAMTS-13 has been reported as \\"normal\\" or reduced; however, it should be recognized that \\"normal\\" levels may still identify a relative reduction in individual cases.

DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and ninety eyes of 188 patients with primary, rhegmatogenous RD. METHODS: Patients with RD who presented over a 1-year period (September 14, 2019 to September 13, 2020). The relationship between demographic, anatomic, and visual acuity parameters were compared before and after onset of the pandemic using generalized estimating equations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macular status and corrected distance visual acuity on presentation. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven eyes, divided into 2 cohorts: pre-COVID (n = 100 September 14, 2019 to March 13, 2020) and post-COVID (n = 87, March 14, 2020 to September 13, 2020). Of the eyes, 63.2% (n = 87) presented with macular detachment in the post-COVID group compared with 45% (n = 100) in the pre-COVID group (odds ration [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.19C3.86; p = 0.011). As well, eyes in the pre-pandemic cohort had significantly fewer detached quadrants on initial examination (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30C0.93; p = 0.026). Patients in the post-COVID group had a significantly worse corrected distance visual acuity at baseline (mean difference [MD] = C0.35 logMAR, 95% CI, C0.60 to C0.09; p = 0.008), but not at 1 month or at final follow-up. No differences were seen between groups with respect to demographics, lens status, treatment, time to presentation, or chronicity. Pneumatic retinopexy was the most commonly performed procedure in both cohorts, with a 71.5% success rate. CONCLUSIONS: Closures after the COVID-19 pandemic affected the characteristics of RDs at presentation with respect to macular detachment, extent of RD, and presenting visual acuity. At final follow-up, final visual acuity and anatomic outcomes were similar between the 2 groups. These data are helpful for future patient education, triaging, and treatment decision making.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on characteristics of retinal detachments: the Canadian experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tick-borne illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii.

However, less is known about the use of telemedicine in sports and exercise medicine (teleSEM) and its utility to treat emergent craniofacial injuries. Given how common facial trauma is among athletes and its possible complications, incorporation of telemedicine in sports-related injuries may prove to be quintessential for athletes and coaches. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published through December 2020 with multiple search terms related to telemedicine in sports and trauma care. RESULTS: Overall, teleSEM is appreciated by both patients and physicians alike. Studies show that the satisfaction rate among patients and physicians are high. Sports-related telemedicine visits can help improve resource utilization and total costs. Facial trauma studies also reveal that the level of concurrency of treatment options between telemedicine visits and in-person consultations is almost perfect. Further, there are many additional ways that teleSEM can be implemented in treating injured athletes, including possible collaboration between athletic coaches and physicians as well as mobile device applications. Telemedicine may be particularly useful in treating acute injuries in low-resourced areas with limited equipment and training. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has been widely employed for sports-related injuries and in traumatic care. Patients and providers alike have noted its utility over other methods of communication with physicians. Our findings suggest that telemedicine has a significant potential in treating sports-related injuries and improving the efficiency of diagnoses and treatments. It may enhance outcomes for participants in athletic events.

METHODS One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned to the MVL group (n = 40), the PVL group (n = 40), and the DL group (n = 40). Nasotracheal intubation was performed using MVL, PVL, or DL, according to group assignments. The primary outcome was TTI and secondary outcomes were glottic view, ease of intubation, and bleeding. RESULTS The TTI was significantly shorter in the MVL group than in the DL group (45 sec vs 57 sec; difference in means: - 12; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 21 to - 3; P = 0.01). The percentage of glottic opening and Cormack Lehane grade were significantly superior in the MVL and the PVL groups compared with the DL group (both P < 0.001). The intubation difficulty scale and numeric rating scale regarding ease of intubation were also significantly lower in the MVL and PVL groups than in the DL group (all P < 0.007). The incidence of bleeding was significantly lower in the MVL group than in the DL group (3 vs 15, relative risk 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.64; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION This study showed that both MVL and PVL provided better visualization of the glottis and easier intubation, with less additional manipulation than DL during nasotracheal intubation in simulated difficult airways.

In this short review, we discuss the evidence for remote healthcare delivery in the context of osteoporosis. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the lives of people living with, and at risk of, osteoporosis and those caring for them. With osteoporosis outpatient and Fracture Liaison Services on pause, healthcare organisations have already moved to delivering new and follow-up consultations remotely, where staffing permits, by telephone or video. METHODS: In this review, we consider different models of remote care delivery, the evidence for their use, and the possible implications of COVID-19 on osteoporosis services. RESULTS: Telemedicine is a global term used to describe any use of telecommunication systems to deliver healthcare from a distance and encompasses a range of different scenarios from remote clinical data transfer to remote clinician-patient interactions. Across a range of conditions and contexts, there remains unclear evidence on the acceptability of telemedicine and the effect on healthcare costs. Within the context of osteoporosis management, there is some limited evidence to suggest telemedicine approaches are acceptable to patients but unclear evidence on whether telemedicine approaches support informed drug adherence. Gaps in the evidence pertain to the acceptability and benefits of using telemedicine in populations with hearing, cognitive, or visual impairments and in those with limited health literacy. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for further health service evaluation and research to address the impact of remote healthcare delivery during COVID-19 outbreak on patient care, and in the longer term, to identify acceptability and cost- and clinical-effectiveness of remote care delivery on outcomes of relevance to people living with osteoporosis.","output":"Identifying and managing osteoporosis before and after COVID-19: rise of the remote consultation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several neurobiological mechanisms have been proposed to support the hypothesis of a higher COVID-19 risk in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of beta coronavirus family which upon exposure caused a highly infectious disease called novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a probably bat originated disease was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic in March 2020. Since then, despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the disease has affected nearly 56,261,952 laboratory confirmed human population and caused deaths of over 1,349,506 lives worldwide. Virus passes in majority through respiratory droplets and then enters lung epithelial cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and there it undergoes replication and targeting host cells causing severe pathogenesis. Majority of human population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 having fully functional immune system undergo asymptomatic infection while 5-10% are symptomatic and only 1-2% are critically affected and requires ventilation support. Older people or people with co-morbidities are severely affected by COVID-19. These categories of patients also display cytokine storm due to dysfunctional immune response which brutally destroys the affected organs and may lead to death in some. Real time PCR is still considered as standard method of diagnosis along with other serology, radiological and biochemical investigations. Till date, no specific validated medication is available for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Thus, this review provides detailed knowledge about the different landscapes of disease incidence, etiopathogenesis, involvement of various organs, diagnostic criteria's and treatment guidelines followed for management of COVID-19 infection since its inception.

We aimed to evaluate factors associated with resumption of post-operative chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer undergoing explorative laparotomy for bowel obstruction. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2009 and 2013 at Herlev Hospital, Denmark. All patients with advanced cancer were identified from a local electronic database containing all emergency laparotomies. Adult patients with mechanical bowel obstruction were included if they had any kind of cancer and had been under active oncological treatment within the last eight weeks prior to surgery. Demographic, clinical, pre-, and post-operative data were collected and reviewed manually. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for resuming oncological treatment. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients admitted with bowel obstruction and undergoing oncological treatment within eight weeks before surgery were included. Post-operatively, cancer treatment was resumed in 58% of patients. An American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score less-than III (odds ratio = 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9-54.6); p = 0.001) and a performance status less-than 3 (odds ratio = 9.7 (95% CI: 1.4-67.2); p = 0.021) were associated with resuming post-operative cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We found that ASA score and performance status are associated with resumption of cancer treatment post-operatively and should be taken into consideration when considering the treatment strategy for patients with advanced cancer and malignant bowel obstruction.

However, traditional clinical tests of laboratory inspection are unable to achieve rapid and accurate detection of these biomarkers on-site due to shortcomings such as complex experimental operation, expensive equipment, and long test time. Herein, we proposed a lateral flow assay (LFA) strip based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotags (SERS-LFA strips) for the simultaneous and quantitative detection of dual infection biomarkers, serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively. In practice, mesoporous silica (mSiO(2))-coated Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) were used as the SERS substrate. Mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) was embedded in the internal gap between Au NPs and the mSiO(2) shell to prepare Au(MBA)@mSiO(2) NPs, onto which SAA and CRP antibodies were modified to prepare two Au(MBA)@mSiO(2) SERS nanotags. The Raman intensities of the test and control lines were simultaneously identified for the qualitative detection of SAA and CRP, with limits of detection (LODs) as low as 0.1 and 0.05 ng/mL for SAA and CRP, respectively. Finally, aiming at point-of-care testing (POCT) applications, we used a smartphone-based portable Raman spectrometer to quantitatively analyze the SERS-LFA strips. The Raman signal could still be accurately detected when the concentration of SAA and CRP was 10 ng/mL, which is lower than the LOD required in clinical practice for most diseases. Therefore, taking into account its simple operation and short analysis time, by using a portable Raman spectrometer which can be equipped with a 5G cloud-based healthcare management system, the current strategy based on SERS-LFA provides the potential for the quick and on-site diagnosis of infectious diseases such as sepsis, which is of great significance for medical guidance on the treatment of widely spread infection-related diseases in remote areas that lack well-developed medical resources.","output":"Simultaneous Detection of Inflammatory Biomarkers by SERS Nanotag-Based Lateral Flow Assay with Portable Cloud Raman Spectrometer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: On October 15th, 2020, the first Surgical National Consensus Conference on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was promoted by the Italian Association of Breast Surgeons (ANISC).

However, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and much remains unknown about this disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. It is cleaved by type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS)2 and disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain (ADAM)17 to assist viral entry into host cells. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in acute lung injury and lung fibrosis, but the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 induced lung fibrosis are not fully understood. METHODS: The networks of ACE2 and its interacting molecules were identified using bioinformatic methods. Their gene and protein expressions were measured in human epithelial cells after 24 h SARS-CoV-2 infection, or in existing datasets of lung fibrosis patients. RESULTS: We confirmed the binding of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 by bioinformatic analysis. TMPRSS2, ADAM17, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)3, angiotensinogen (AGT), transformation growth factor beta (TGFB1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and fibronectin (FN) were interacted with ACE2, and the mRNA and protein of these molecules were expressed in lung epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased ACE2, TGFB1, CTGF and FN1 mRNA that were drivers of lung fibrosis. These changes were also found in lung tissues from lung fibrosis patients.

Association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical and biochemical predictors, was examined. RESULTS: Data were available on 551 patients. Prevalence of any or &#8805;3  upper limit of normal transaminase elevation on was 61.2 and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1 and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4 and 12.6%, respectively), and at peak (17.7 and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impact on mortality with AST positively, and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs. CONCLUSION: LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are very common, though majority are mild. Admission and peak bilirubin &#8805;1 mg/dl, as well as admission and peak AST:ALT ratio were significant predictors of mortality, along with age, myocardial injury, and chronic medical illness.","output":"The liver in COVID-19: prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As we are witnessing the evolution of social media (SM) use worldwide among the general population, the popularity of SM has also been embraced by health care professionals (HCPs). In the context of SM evolution and exponential growth of users, this scoping review summarizes recent findings of the e-professionalism of HCPs. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review is to characterize the recent original peer-reviewed research studies published between November 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020, on e-professionalism of HCPs; to assess the quality of the methodologies and approaches used; to explore the impact of SM on e-professionalism of HCPs; to recognize the benefits and dangers of SM; and to provide insights to guide future research in this area. METHODS: A search of the literature published from November 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020, was performed in January 2021 using 3 databases (PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus). The searches were conducted using the following defined search terms: professionalism AND social media OR social networks OR Internet OR Facebook OR Twitter OR Instagram OR TikTok. The search strategy was limited to studies published in English. This scoping review follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 1632 retrieved papers, a total of 88 studies were finally included in this review. Overall, the quality of the studies was satisfactory. Participants in the reviewed studies were from diverse health care professions. Medical health professionals were involved in about three-quarters of the studies. Three key benefits of SM on e-professionalism of HCPs were identified: (1) professional networking and collaboration, (2) professional education and training, and (3) patient education and health promotion. For the selected studies, there were five recognized dangers of SM on e-professionalism of HCPs: (1) loosening accountability, (2) compromising confidentiality, (3) blurred professional boundaries, (4) depiction of unprofessional behavior, and (5) legal issues and disciplinary consequences. This scoping review also recognizes recommendations for changes in educational curricula regarding e-professionalism as opportunities for improvement and barriers that influence HCPs use of SM in the context of e-professionalism. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in the reviewed studies indicate the existence of both benefits and dangers of SM on e-professionalism of HCPs. Even though there are some barriers recognized, this review has highlighted existing recommendations for including e-professionalism in the educational curricula of HCPs. Based on all evidence provided, this review provided new insights and guides for future research on this area. There is a clear need for robust research to investigate new emerging SM platforms, the efficiency of guidelines and educational interventions, and the specifics of each profession regarding their SM potential and use.","output":"Dangers and Benefits of Social Media on E-Professionalism of Health Care Professionals: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What explains the great variation in the adoption, timing, and duration of government policies made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? In this article, we explore whether government incentives to repress domestic dissidents influence their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that COVID-19 containment policies are observationally equivalent to those that abusive governments use to limit domestic dissent C that is, policies that restrict citizens freedom of movement. This creates an opportunity for abusive governments to engage in repressive behavior without countervailing pressure from citizens and the international community. Following this logic, we expect abusive governments to be more likely to adopt restrictive policies, adopt them earlier in the course of the pandemic, and take longer to relax restrictions. Empirically, we find that governments that have recently engaged in state violence against civilians or abused citizens human rights were about 10% more likely to enact lockdown and curfew policies. Compared to less repressive countries, these policies were implemented approximately 48 days earlier in the pandemic and kept in place for approximately 23 days longer. Overall, our results advance our understanding of how the repressiveness of state institutions can shape policy responses to a global health crisis.","output":"Windows of repression: Using COVID-19 policies against political dissidents?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the lockdowns of 2020 came into place, subjecting many of us to forms of confinement, we may have been reminded of Derrida's thoughts on house arrest.

Derrida's formulation took on unexpected resonance when, at the height of the pandemic, the Hungarian government repealed its legal recognition of transgenderism: assignations of biological sex would now be strictly binary and permanent. The decision to place sexual difference under house arrest during a time of lockdown was not, I would argue, a coincidence. Rather, it was another kind of assignation, an act of discursive placing designed to eradicate transgenderism under the name of immunisation.","output":"Immunising Birthsex: Ontology's Place in the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS CoV2) infecting humans has emerged in Wuhan, China which caused an unprecedented pandemic involving at least 185 countries infecting 2.5 million people till date. This virus is transmitted directly or indirectly through the upper aerodigestive tract. As it is evident from the recent studies that SARS-CoV-2 requires host enzyme Furin to activate receptor binding domain of its S protein and host Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required as binding receptor, facilitating the entry of virus into the host cell. Evidence from literature shows that oral cancer tissues as well as paracarcinoma tissue exhibit higher expression of both Furin and ACE2, giving rise to the hypothesis that patients with oral cancer have higher chances of SARS CoV2 infection. It is also hypothesised that there will be increased severity of disease due to facilitated entry of the virus into the cells. Therefore, we suggest oral cancer patients require extra attention during COVID-19 pandemic and re-evaluation of current treatment paradigms in oral oncology is also needed.","output":"Increased susceptibility of SARS-CoV2 infection on oral cancer patients; cause and effects: An hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in early 2020, South Korea stood as one of the most successful in preventing a nationwide outbreak. The country was unique in that it did so without enforcing massive border restrictions and tight social distancing measures, instead focusing on maximal testing, contact tracing, and treatment. But as the year 2020 went on, the country has suffered second and third waves, each one being larger and harder to combat than the last. The Korean government, however, has been unwilling to impose stringent measures due to potential economic consequences and has still relied on its initial strategies in an attempt to prevent further disease transmission. It is therefore crucial to revisit their position beyond their early successes to re-evaluate the effectiveness of their strategy, and to finally decide if it is time to move on to more drastic measures.","output":"Riding the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Elevated procalcitonin levels are associated with increased rates of bacterial infection in children. Observational studies have reported high levels of procalcitonin in COVID-19 and correlated procalcitonin level with illness severity. Data on rates of bacterial coinfections in COVID-19 are sparse;small studies suggest a low coinfection rate. We aim to quantify the positive predictive value (PPV) of procalcitonin in identifying bacterial infection in pediatric patients with and without COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of 215 pediatric patients age 1 month to 21 years admitted to our tertiary children's hospital between February 1, 2013 and July 15, 2020 who had procalcitonin levels measured within 48 hours of admission. Confirmed bacterial infection was defined as positive blood, urine, or CSF culture, positive endotracheal/sputum culture with significant leukocytosis on gram stain, or CXR consistent with pneumonia. Contaminated blood cultures were excluded. Suspected bacterial infection was defined as either confirmed bacterial infection or administration of therapeutic antibiotics for &gt;48 hours. Results: Of the 215 patients, 73 were PCR and/or antibody positive for SARS-CoV-2 (53% admitted to PICU, 29% required vasoactive medications) and 142 had alternative diagnoses (32% admitted to PICU, 9% required vasoactive medications). Median procalcitonin level was 1.28ng/mL in the COVID-19 cohort and 0.37ng/mL in the control cohort. There were 10 suspected and 5 confirmed bacterial infections in the COVID-19 cohort and 69 suspected and 44 confirmed bacterial infections in the control cohort. Procalcitonin was greater than 1ng/mL in 39 (53%) of COVID-19 subjects and 44 (31%) of control subjects. PPV of procalcitonin level over 1ng/mL for identifying suspected bacterial infection in the COVID-19 cohort was 10% (CI 1-20%) and in the control cohort was 75% (CI 62%-88%). PPV of procalcitonin level over 1ng/mL for identifying confirmed bacterial infection in the COVID-19 cohort was 3% (CI 0%-8%) and in the control cohort was 55% (CI 40%-69%). Conclusions: Our retrospective review demonstrated a low PPV of elevated procalcitonin level above the established threshold of 1ng/mL in identifying either culture-confirmed or suspected bacterial infection in pediatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Despite 29% of the COVID-19 cohort requiring vasoactive support, indicating a high pretest probability of bacterial sepsis, procalcitonin performed poorly as a marker of bacterial infection. Our results suggest that COVID-19 infection is associated with an elevated procalcitonin level independent of presence of bacterial infection. Given the importance of antibiotic stewardship, alternative means of identifying bacterial coinfection in COVID-19 are needed.","output":"Utility of procalcitonin levels in identifying bacterial infections in children with and without COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Oral cladribine has been approved for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) yet real-world evidence regarding its effectiveness and safety remains scarce. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety outcomes of MS patients following induction of cladribine. METHODS: We evaluated our prospective cohort of cladribine-treated MS patients from two tertiary centres in Germany. Relapses, disability worsening and occurrence of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions were assessed as well as lymphocyte counts and herpes virus infections. RESULTS: Among 270 patients treated with cladribine, we observed a profound reduction of both relapses and new or enlarging MRI lesions. Treatment appeared more efficacious, especially in patients without previous therapy or following platform substances. Patients switching from natalizumab were prone to re-emerging disease activity. Among patients following dimethyl fumarate pre-treatment, severe lymphopenia was common and associated with increased rates of herpes virus manifestations. CONCLUSION: Overall, we observed an efficacy and safety profile of cladribine consistent with data from the phase 3 clinical trial. However, patients switching from natalizumab experienced suboptimal disease control beyond rebound activity following cessation of natalizumab. Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate pre-treatment was associated with a profound risk of developing severe lymphopenia and subsequent herpes virus infections.","output":"Effectiveness and safety of cladribine in MS: Real-world experience from two tertiary centres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has resulted in a considerable amount of morbidity and mortality worldwide since December 2019.

We report two cases of new-onset atrial fibrillation occurring in middle-aged men with no significant past medical history. The first patient presented with symptomatic atrial fibrillation; however, during his hospitalization course, he developed a fever, which led to the diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2. The second patient presented from urgent care after being diagnosed with COVID-19 associated with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Both patients were treated symptomatically for COVID-19 and discharged home after reverting to sinus rhythm. Physicians should be aware of the variable clinical presentations of COVID-19, especially in new or worsening cardiac illnesses, in order to practice the appropriate personal protection practices.

In 20 of them (12 patients and 8 comparison subjects) the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later. Translation and Back Translation was made. Clinical Diagnosis was reached by consensus of two examiners with the use of the SCAN v.2.0 and the IPDE. Statistical Analysis included ANOVA, the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha (alpha) RESULTS Both Sensitivity and specificity exceed 90.00 at 44/45, Chronbach's alpha for the total scale was equal to 0.09, suggesting that the scale covers a broad spectrum of symptoms. Factor analysis revealed five factors (anxiety-depression, thought content, gastrenterological symptoms, irritability and social-interpersonal functioning). The test-retest reliability was satisfactory (Pearson's R between 0.92).

Exogenous trypsin as a medium additive facilitates isolation and propagation of several coronaviruses in vitro. Here, we show that trypsin enhances severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in cultured cells and that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via either a non-endosomal or an endosomal fusion pathway, depending on the presence of trypsin. Interestingly, trypsin enabled viral entry at the cell surface and led to more efficient infection than trypsin-independent endosomal entry, suggesting that trypsin production in the target organs may trigger a high level of replication of SARS-CoV-2 and cause severe tissue injury. Extensive syncytium formation and enhanced growth kinetics were observed only in the presence of exogenous trypsin when cell-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains were tested. During 50 serial passages without the addition of trypsin, a specific R685S mutation occurred in the S1/S2 FCS ((681)PRRAR(685)) that was completely conserved but accompanied by several mutations in the S2 fusion subunit in the presence of trypsin. These findings demonstrate that the S1/S2 FCS is essential for proteolytic priming of the S protein and fusion activity for SARS-CoV-2 entry but not for viral replication. Our data can potentially contribute to the improvement of SARS-CoV-2 production for the development of vaccines or antivirals and motivate further investigations into the explicit functions of cell-adaptation-related genetic drift in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","output":"Trypsin enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection by facilitating viral entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of 2020 a respiratory diseased named COVID-19 rapidly spread worldwide Due to the presence of comorbidities and a greater susceptibility to infections, older adults are the population most affected by this pandemic An efficient pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not ready yet;in the meanwhile, a general quarantine has been initiated as a preventive action against the spread of the disease If on one side this countermeasure is slowing the spread of the virus, on the other side is also reducing the amount of physical activity Sedentariness is associated with numerous negative health outcomes and increase risk of fall, fractures and disabilities in older adults Models of physical inactivity have been widely studied in the past decades, and most studies agreed that is necessary to implement physical exercise (such as walking, low load resistance or in bed exercise) during periods of disuse to protect muscle mass and function from catabolic crisis Moreover, older adults have a blunted response to physical rehabilitation, and a combination of intense resistance training and nutrition are necessary to overcome the loss of in skeletal muscle due to disuse","output":"When COVID-19 affects muscle: effects of quarantine in older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The AtyPical Asthma in China (APAC) cohort is a multi-center prospective, observational cohort set-up to investigate the clinical, pathophysiological features, prognosis, and mechanisms of cough variant asthma (CVA).

Objective: To examine whether COVID-19 test results are associated with differences in vitamin D levels of 30 ng/mL or greater, including for White individuals and for Black individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at an academic medical center in Chicago, Illinois. Participants included individuals with data on vitamin D level within 365 days before COVID-19 testing, which was conducted from March 3 to December 30, 2020. Data were analyzed from September 11, 2020, to February 5, 2021. Exposures: The last vitamin D level before COVID-19 testing was categorized as less than 20 ng/mL (ie, deficient), 20 to less than 30 ng/mL (ie, insufficient), 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, or 40 ng/mL or greater.

Stratified by vitamin D level, estimated COVID-19 positivity rates in Black individuals were 9.72% (95% CI, 6.74%-13.41%) for individuals with a vitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL, 6.47% (95% CI, 3.33%-10.28%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 20 to less than 30 ng/mL, 10.10% (95% CI, 6.00%-15.47%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 30 to less than 40 ng/mL, and 3.82% (95% CI, 1.78%-6.68%) for individuals with a vitamin D level of 40 ng/mL or higher. Multivariate analysis in individuals with a vitamin D level of 30 ng/mL or greater found that the IRR of a positive COVID-19 test result was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P = .008) per 1-ng/mL increase in vitamin D overall and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98; P = .003) per 1-ng/mL increase in vitamin D in Black individuals. Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 risk increased among Black individuals with vitamin D level less than 40 ng/mL compared with those with 40 ng/mL or greater and decreased with increasing levels among individuals with levels greater than 30 ng/mL. No significant associations were noted for White individuals. Randomized clinical trials should examine whether increasing vitamin D level to greater than 40 ng/mL affects COVID-19 risk.","output":"Association of Vitamin D Levels, Race/Ethnicity, and Clinical Characteristics With COVID-19 Test Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The experiences of frontline healthcare professionals are essential in identifying strategies to mitigate the disruption to healthcare services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Between May 12 and August 6, 2020, we collected qualitative and quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyse responses. FINDINGS: 669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since COVID-19. The most common barriers reported to affect patients were: fear of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28% of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also severely impacted. Strategies to address reduced transport needs and costsCincluding proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate lower cost or easier travelwere presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted according to 36% and 31% of HIV and TB respondents respectively; qualitative data suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated. CONCLUSION: Patients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in accessing healthcare facilities, and non-medical support for patients was particularly impacted. Synthesising recommendations of frontline professionals should be prioritised for informing policymakers and healthcare service delivery organisations.","output":"Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis and HIV services: A cross-sectional survey of 669 health professionals in 64 low and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The radiolabeled isatin sulfonamide caspase-3 inhibitor, [18F] 2 (WC-II-89), is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis. The radiolabeling mechanism was studied by 13C NMR, ESI/MS, and computational calculations. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring, which served as a trap for [18F]fluoride, was responsible for the failure of the radiolabeling via nucleophilic substitution of the mesylate group in 7a by [18F]fluoride. Once treated with a strong base, 7a opened the isatin ring completely to form an isatinate intermediate 16, which lost the ability to trap [18F]fluoride, thereby allowing the displacement of the mesylate group to afford the 18F-labeled isatinate 17. [18F] 17 can be converted to isatin [18F] 2 efficiently under acidic conditions. The ring-opening and re-closure of the isatin ring under basic and acidic conditions were confirmed by reversed phase HPLC analysis, ESI/MS and 13C NMR studies. Computational studies of model compounds also support the above proposed mechanism. Similarly, the ring-opening and re-closure method was used successfully in the synthesis of the 11C labeled isatin sulfonamide analogue [11C] 4 (WC-98). A microPET imaging study using [11C] 4 in the Fas liver apoptosis model demonstrated retained activity in the target organ (liver) of the treated mice. Increased caspase-3 activation in the liver was verified by the fluorometric caspase-3 enzyme assay. Therefore, this study provides a useful method for radio-synthesis of isatin derivative radiotracers for PET and SPECT studies, and [11C] 4 is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis.","output":"[18F]- and [11C]-labeled N-benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogues as PET tracers for apoptosis: synthesis, radiolabeling mechanism, and in vivo imaging study of apoptosis in Fas-treated mice using [11C]WC-98."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe a pilot project infection prevention and control (IPC) assessment conducted in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in New York State (NYS) during a pivotal 2-week period when the region became the nation's epicenter for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN: A telephone and video assessment of IPC measures in SNFs at high risk or experiencing COVID-19 activity. PARTICIPANTS: SNFs in 14 New York counties, including New York City. INTERVENTION: A 3-component remote IPC assessment: (1) screening tool; (2) telephone IPC checklist; and (3) COVID-19 video IPC assessment (ie, \\"COVIDeo\\"). RESULTS: In total, 92 SNFs completed the IPC screening tool and checklist: 52 (57%) were conducted as part COVID-19 investigations, and 40 (43%) were proactive prevention-based assessments. Among the 40 proactive assessments, 14 (35%) identified suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. COVIDeo was performed in 26 (28%) of 92 assessments and provided observations that other tools would have missed: personal protective equipment (PPE) that was not easily accessible, redundant, or improperly donned, doffed, or stored and specific challenges implementing IPC in specialty populations. The IPC assessments took a1 hour each and reached an estimated 4 times as many SNFs as on-site visits in a similar time frame. CONCLUSIONS: Remote IPC assessments by telephone and video were timely and feasible methods of assessing the extent to which IPC interventions had been implemented in a vulnerable setting and to disseminate real-time recommendations. Remote assessments are now being implemented across New York State and in various healthcare facility types.

Despite the provision of comprehensive evidence-based national and international guidelines, the COPD burden to frontline healthcare services has increased in the last decade. Suboptimal guidelines concordance can be disruptive to health-related quality of life (HRQoL), hastening pulmonary function decline and surging overall morbidity and mortality. A lack of concordance with guidelines has created an escalating economic burden on health-care systems. Identifying interdisciplinary interventions to facilitate improved adherence to guidelines may significantly reduce re-admissions, enhance HRQoL amongst patients and their families, and facilitate economic efficiency. Materials and Methods This review adhered to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for mixed methods systematic reviews and the PRISMA ScR reporting guidelines. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full text articles in consonance with inclusion criteria. The convergent integrative JBI method collated quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies from nine databases. JBI critical appraisal tools were utilised to assess the quality of research papers. The theoretical domains framework (TDF) along with a specifically developed COPD data extraction tool were adopted as a priori to collect and collate data. Identified barriers and corresponding clinical behavioural change solutions were categorised using TDF domains and behavior change wheel (BCW) to provide future research and implementation recommendations. Results Searches returned 1068 studies from which 37 studies were included (see Figure 1). COPD recommendations identified to be discordant with clinical practice included initiating non-invasive ventilation, over- or under-prescription of corticosteroids and antibiotics, and a lack of discharging patients with a smoking cessation plan or pulmonary rehabilitation. TDF domains with highest frequency scores were knowledge, environmental resources, and clinical behaviour regulation. Electronic order sets/digital proforma with guideline resources at point of care and easily accessible digital community referrals to target both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management appear to be a solution to improve concordance. Conclusion Implementation of consistent quality improvement intervention within hospitals for patients with COPD may exclude any implementation gap and prevent readmissions. Electronic proformas with digital referrals will assist with future evaluation audits to prioritise and target interventions to improve guidelines concordance.

However, the disadvantages of conventional injection systems hamper the delivery of vaccination technologies to developing countries. The imminent practice of easy-to-use vaccination methods is expected to overcome certain issues associated with injectable vaccinations. One innovative method is the transcutaneous immunization (TCI) system. AREAS COVERED Two major strategies for TCI are discussed in this review. One is to promote antigen permeation of the skin barrier by patch systems or nanoparticles. The other is the delivery of antigens into the skin by electroporation and microneedles in order to physically overcome the skin barrier. Moreover, adjuvant development for TCI is discussed. EXPERT OPINION Many different approaches have been developed for TCI, which have the potential to be effective, easy-to-use and painless methods of vaccination. However, in practical terms, the guidelines concerning the manufacturing processes and clinical trial evaluation of the procedures have not kept pace with the development of these novel formulations. The accumulation of information regarding skin characteristics and the properties of TCI devices will help refine TCI system development guidelines and thus lead to the improvement of transcutaneous vaccination.","output":"Transcutaneous vaccines--current and emerging strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic declared the huge need of humanity for new and effective antiviral drugs.

The problem is that the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing. The research purposes were to systematically collect the literature data on the characteristics of those thyroid operations performed and to assess the safety/risks associated with thyroid surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used all the procedures consistent with the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature in MEDLINE (PubMed) and Scopus was made using Thyroid and coronavirus as search terms. RESULTS: Of a total of 293 articles identified, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. The total number of patients undergoing thyroid surgery was 2217. The indication for surgery was malignancy in 1347 cases (60.8%). Screening protocols varied depending on hospital protocol and maximum levels of personal protection equipment were adopted. The hospital length of stay was 2C3 days. Total thyroidectomy was chosen for 1557 patients (1557/1868, 83.4%), of which 596 procedures (596/1558, 38.3%) were combined with lymph node dissections. Cross-infections were registered in 14 cases (14/721, 1.9%), of which three (3/721, 0.4%) with severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19. 377 patients (377/1868, 20.2%) had complications after surgery, of which 285 (285/377, 75.6%) hypoparathyroidism and 71 (71/377, 18.8%) recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. CONCLUSION: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after thyroid surgery is relatively low. Our study could promote the restart of planned thyroid surgery due to COVID-19. Future studies are warranted to obtain more solid data about the risk of complications after thyroid surgery during the COVID-19 era.

The nanoribbons crystallize in a layered structure, with ribbon axis along the armchair direction of the van der Waals layers. The ribbon morphology is determined by catalyst driven fast longitudinal growth accompanied by lateral expansion via edge-specific incorporation into the basal planes. This combined growth mechanism enables temperature controlled realization of ribbons with typical widths of up to 30 m and lengths exceeding 100 m, while maintaining sub-50 nm thickness.

We aimed to leverage genetic data to investigate reported associations. METHODS: Genetic association estimates for liability to Covid-19 and cardiovascular traits were obtained from large-scale consortia. Analyses primarily focused on critical Covid-19, defined as hospitalization with Covid-19 requiring respiratory support or resulting in death. Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations of critical Covid-19 with ischemic stroke, other related cardiovascular outcomes, and risk factors common to both Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease (body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation, estimated using C-reactive protein). Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to investigate whether liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with increased risk of any of the cardiovascular outcomes for which genetic correlation was identified. RESULTS: There was evidence of genetic correlation between critical Covid-19 and ischemic stroke (r(g)=0.29, FDR p-value=4.6510(?3)), body mass index (r(g)=0.21, FDR-p-value=6.2610(?6)) and C-reactive protein (r(g)=0.20, FDR-p-value=1.3510(?4)), but none of the other considered traits. In Mendelian randomization analysis, liability to critical Covid-19 was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] per logOR increase in genetically predicted critical Covid-19 liability 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.00C1.06, p-value=0.03). Similar estimates were obtained when considering ischemic stroke subtypes. Consistent estimates were also obtained when performing statistical sensitivity analyses more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, including multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses adjusting for potential genetic confounding through body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation. There was no evidence to suggest that genetic liability to ischemic stroke increased the risk of critical Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: These data support that liability to critical Covid-19 is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. The host response predisposing to severe Covid-19 is likely to increase the risk of ischemic stroke, independent of other potentially mitigating risk factors.","output":"Leveraging genetic data to elucidate the relationship between Covid-19 and ischemic stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has led to disorder in work and livelihood of a majority of the modern world. In this work, we review its major impacts on procedures and workflow of clinical physics tasks, and suggest alternate pathways to avoid major disruption or discontinuity of physics tasks in the context of small, medium, and large radiation oncology clinics. We also evaluate scalability of medical physics under the stress of social distancing. METHODS: Three models of facilities characterized by the number of clinical physicists, daily patient throughput, and equipment were identified for this purpose. For identical objectives of continuity of clinical operations, with constraints such as social distancing and unavailability of staff due to system strain, however with the possibility of remote operations, the performance of these models was investigated. General clinical tasks requiring on\\\\site personnel presence or otherwise were evaluated to determine the scalability of the three models at this point in the course of disease spread within their surroundings. RESULTS: The clinical physics tasks within three models could be divided into two categories. The former, which requires individual presence, include safety\\\\sensitive radiation delivery, high dose per fraction treatments, brachytherapy procedures, fulfilling state and nuclear regulatory commission's requirements, etc. The latter, which can be handled through remote means, include dose planning, physics plan review and supervision of quality assurance, general troubleshooting, etc. CONCLUSION: At the current level of disease in the United States, all three models have sustained major system stress in continuing reduced operation.

METHODS: Since February 21, 2020, staff in high risk areas such as the ED and ICU of King Hamad University Hospital have worn N95 masks when doing aerosol-generating procedures to protect against the novel coronavirus 2019. At that time, without education enablers or resources that could be directly translated into practice, the hospitals Pressure Injury Prevention Committee explored and created a stepwise process to protect the skin under these masks. This procedure was developed over time and tested to make sure that it did not interfere with the effectiveness of the N95 mask seal. RESULTS: Skin protection was achieved by repurposing a readily available silicone border dressing cut into strips. This was tested on 10 volunteer staff members of various skin types and both sexes who became part of this evidence generation project. Oxygen saturation values taken before and after the 4-hour wear test confirmed that well-fitted facial protection did not compromise the mask seal, but rather improved it. An added advantage was increased comfort with less friction as self-reported by the staff. An educational enabler to prevent MDRPI from N95 mask wear was an important additional resource for the staff. CONCLUSIONS: This creative and novel stepwise process of developing a safe skin protection method by which staff could apply a repurposed silicone border dressing beneath an N95 mask was largely effective and aided by the creation of the enabler.","output":"Preventing Facial Pressure Injury for Health Care Providers Adhering to COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment Requirements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of invasive pulmonary fungal disease and the spectrum of pathogens causing invasive pulmonary fungal disease diagnosed by pathological examination using fungal stains. METHODS: Patients with an invasive pulmonary fungal disease diagnosed by histopathological analysis through the use of fungal stains (including Grocott's methenamine silver and periodic acid-Schiff stains) were included in this study. The clinical records, radiological reports, pathology, and fungal culture results were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-eight invasive pulmonary fungal disease patients diagnosed by histopathological analysis in the Tianjin Haihe Hospital (including 8 cases obtained by pulmonary resection, 35 cases by fiberoptic bronchoscopic biopsy, and 5 cases by percutaneous lung biopsy) were included. There were 24 male and 24 female patients, aged 21C80 years (53  13 years). There were 37 cases of pulmonary aspergillosis, 4 cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis, 2 cases of pulmonary mucormycosis, and 5 in which pathogens were not determined due to limited tissue availability. Among 48 cases, 32 specimens were submitted to fungal culture. No fungus was detected in culture, although 26 cases of fungus infections were diagnosed by histopathological analysis. Only 3 cases were consistent between histopathological and culture results. In 3 cases, the pathogen was identified as Aspergillus spp. by the histopathological analysis, while the contrasting fungal culture results identified Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: Candida albicans pneumonia was rare, while aspergillosis was common in invasive pulmonary fungal disease diagnosed by histopathological analysis. The majority of patients with an invasive pulmonary fungal disease were culture-negative. Although culture can clarify the fungal pathogen species, it has low sensitivity.

Moreover, viral hepatitis-related HCC imposes an important burden on public health in terms of disability-adjusted life years. In order to reduce such a burden, some major challenges must be faced. Universal vaccination against hepatitis B virus, especially in the neonatal period, is probably the most relevant primary preventive measure against the development of HCC. Moreover, considering the large adult population already infected with hepatitis B and C viruses, it is also imperative to identify these individuals to ensure their access to treatment. Both hepatitis B and C currently have highly effective therapies, which are able to diminish the risk of development of liver cancer. Finally, it is essential for individuals at high-risk of HCC to be included in surveillance programs, so that tumors are detected at an early stage. Patients with hepatitis B or C and advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis benefit from being followed in a surveillance program. As hepatitis B virus is oncogenic and capable of leading to liver cancer even in individuals with early stages of liver fibrosis, other high-risk groups of patients with hepatitis B are also candidates for surveillance.

METHODS: The clinical imaging data of 159 patients pathologically confirmed with PCa and who underwent radical prostatectomy in Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital and Jiangsu Hospital of Chinese Medicine from March 2016 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the 2-5-year follow-up results, the patients were divided into the biochemical recurrence (BCR) group (n = 59) and the control group (n = 100). The training set and test set were established in the proportion of 7/3; 4 prediction models were established based on the clinical imaging data. In training set, the area under the curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) by R was conducted to compare the efficiency of 4 prediction models, and then, external validation was performed using the test set. Finally, a nomogram tool for predicting BCR was developed. RESULTS: Univariate regression analysis confirmed that the SmallAreaHighGrayLevelEmphasis, RunVariance, Contrast, tumor diameter, clinical T stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, Gleason score, preoperative PSA, treatment method, CEUS-peak intensity (PI), time to peak (TTP), arrival time (AT), and elastography grade were the influencing factors for predicting BCR.

As the global community learns more about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is strong evidence that a significant modality of transmission is via the long-range airborne route, referred to here as aerosol transmission. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of ventilation, mask effective filtration efficiency, and the combined effect of the two on the reduction of aerosol infection probability for COVID-19 in a classroom setting. The Wells-Riley equation is used to predict the conditional probability of infection for three distinct airborne exposure scenarios: (1) an infectious instructor exposing susceptible students; (2) an infectious student exposing other susceptible students; and (3) an infectious student exposing a susceptible instructor. Field measurements were performed in a classroom using a polydisperse neutralized salt (NaCl) aerosol, generated in a size range consistent with human-generated SARS-CoV-2 containing bioaerosols, as a safe surrogate. Measurements included time-resolved and size-resolved NaCl aerosol concentration distributions and size-resolved effective filtration efficiency of different masks with and without mask fitters. The measurements were used to validate assumptions and inputs for the Wells-Riley model. Aerosol dynamics and distribution measurements confirmed that the majority of the classroom space is uniform in aerosol concentration within a factor of 2 or better for distances > 2 m from the aerosol source. Mask effective filtration efficiency measurements show that most masks fit poorly with estimated leakage rates typically > 50%, resulting in significantly reduced effective filtration efficiency. However, effective filtration efficiencies approaching the mask material filtration efficiency were achievable using simple mask fitters. Wells-Riley model results for the different scenarios suggest that ventilation of the classroom alone is not able to achieve infection probabilities less than 0.01 (1%) for air exchanges rates up to 10 1/h and an event duration of one hour. The use of moderate to high effective filtration efficiency masks by all individuals present, on the other hand, was able to significantly reduce infection probability and could achieve reductions in infection probability by 5x, 10x, or even >100x dependent on the mask used and use of a mask fitter. This enables conditional infection probabilities <0.001 (0.1%) or even < 0.0001 (0.01%) to be reached with the use of masks and mask fitters alone. Finally, the results demonstrate that the reductions provided by ventilation and masks are synergistic and multiplicative. The results reinforce the use of properly donned masks to achieve reduced aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases transmitted via respiratory aerosol indoors and provide new motivation to further improve the effective filtration efficiency of common face coverings through improved design, and/or the use of mask fitters.","output":"Strategies to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in classroom settings: Combined impacts of ventilation and mask effective filtration efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this short essay, we sketch a theory of faith that features resilience in the face of challenges to relying on those in whom you have faith.

Five different nsP2 PI replicons were compared to wild-type (wt) SIN, SFV, and wt nsPs SIN replicons. Replicon PI BHK21 cells had viral RNA synthesis rates that were less than 5% of those of the wt virus and approximately 10% or less of those of SIN wt replicon-infected cells, and, in contrast to wt virus and replicons containing wt nsP2, all showed a phenotype of continuous minus-strand synthesis and of unstable, mature replication/transcription complexes (RC+) that are active in plus-strand synthesis. Minus-strand synthesis and incorporation of [3H]uridine into replicative intermediates differed among PI replicons, depending on the location of the mutation in nsP2. Minus-strand synthesis by PI cells appeared normal; it was dependent on continuous P123 and P1234 polyprotein synthesis and ceased when protein synthesis was inhibited. The failure by the PI replicons to shut off minus-strand synthesis was not due to some defect in the PI cells but rather was due to the loss of some function in the mutated nsP2. This was demonstrated by showing that superinfection of PI cells with wt SFV triggered the shutdown of minus-strand synthesis, which we believe is a host response to infection with alphaviruses. Together, the results indicate alphavirus nsP2 functions to engage the host response to infection and activate a switch from the early-to-late phase.

The purpose of this secondary analysis was to test the hypothesis that initial levels of negative affect can predict treatment-related outcomes in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of extended-release (ER) hydromorphone among opioid-tolerant patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS Four hundred fifty-nine (N = 459) patients participated in the titration/conversion phase of a multicenter study, of which 268 were randomized to receive once-daily hydromorphone or placebo. All patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at baseline and were divided evenly into Low (N = 157), Moderate (N = 155), and High (N = 147) negative affect groups based on their scores. Group differences in numerical pain intensity measures at home and in the clinic, Roland-Morris Disability ratings, and measures of symptoms from the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) throughout the trial were analyzed. RESULTS Two hundred sixty-eight of the initial 459 subjects who entered the 2 to 4-week titration/conversion phase (pretreatment) were successfully randomized to either placebo or ER hydromorphone; a total of 110 patients then completed this double-blind phase of the study. Those in the Moderate and High negative affect groups tended to drop out more often during the titration/conversion phase because of the adverse effects or lack of efficacy of their prescribed opioid than those in the Low negative mood group (P < 0.05). Overall, those patients in the Moderate and High groups reported significantly higher pain intensity scores in at-home and in-clinic pain intensity ratings (P < 0.05), greater disability on the Roland-Morris Scale (P < 0.01), and more withdrawal symptoms on the SOWS (P < 0.05) than those in the Low group. Higher negative affect scores also predicted less favorable ratings of the study drug during the titration phase (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the High negative affect group showed the most improvement in pain in the placebo condition (P < 0.05).

Methods: This retrospective descriptive study was conducted in one of the largest COVID-19 treatment centers in stanbul, Turkey. Four hundred and fifty-six cases confirmed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were included in the study. One hundred inpatients and 356 outpatients were treated. Patients were classified according to the disease severity as asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe. Results: The number of asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe cases were 199 (43.6%), 194 (42.5%), 33 (7.2%) and 30 (6.6%) respectively. Most of the hospitalized patients younger than 5 years old had the mild disease (67.7%), whereas most of the patients over 15 years of age had severe disease (54.2%). Lymphopenia and high ferritin levels at admission were more common in severe cases (p<0.05). Also, multiple regression analysis revealed that high ferritin and D-dimer levels were found to prolong hospital stay (p=0.000;R2=0.404).

In our simple model, we exploit the remarkable similarity in the structure of external costs causing market failure between the socially optimal choices of the COVID-19 pandemic case and the socially optimal urban traffic congestion level. By identifying this similarity, the results obtained from our simple model allow for future pandemic researchers to use the well-established research methodologies for designing socially optimal traffic levels and associated policy tools to find the socially optimal lockdown and travel restrictions. The key results obtained from our COVID-19 model are: (1) individuals do not internalize the external cost of infection risks they impose on others and health care system when making their own travel (social-activity) decisions; In order to induce individual travel decision makers to internalize this external cost, the government actions are necessary; The travel restrictions via lockdown or monetary penalty is one form of such actions; (2) the existence of external cost implies that the socially optimal length of lockdown is always longer than the privately optimal length of the lockdown period; (3) the strictness of the travel restriction and the amount of violation penalty should be higher in the areas with high population density and in larger cities because the external cost of spreading virus by a traveler would be higher. The monetary penalty in this model resembles the classical Pigouvian tax, which should increase with the city's population, people density, and economic prosperity; (4) when a government subsidizes or fully covers medical expenses of COVID-19 patients, stricter travel restrictions with heavier penalties are required.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the variables attributable to the fear of contracting COVID-19. DESIGN: This is a quantitative study based on an online cross-sectional self-administered survey in Chile between 10 July 2020 and 10 August 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 531, comprising over 18-year-old participants from middle- and high-income levels, was selected. OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimations were obtained using a probit regression model with marginal effects. RESULTS: Fear prevailed mainly in women. It has a positive relationship with variables such as chronic illnesses, infectious family or relatives, reduction in economic activity and perception of bad government response to a pandemic. Fear has a negative relationship with knowledge about COVID-19, education level and ageing. Moreover, those who consider socioeconomic impact less important than health care do not fear a COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSIONAND CONCLUSION: The socioeconomic and health aspects help predict fears. Thus, the government should prioritize these variables in implementing policies. The government's credibility and communication systems can also reduce fears of contracting COVID-19.

In this study, in silico potential G4s located in deregulated genes related to the nervous system were initially identified and were found to be significantly enriched.

Among the departmental members, there were 12 suspected and 6 confirmed cases. The weekly frequency of classes was maintained, while the clinical-scientific meetings decreased from ten to three. In addition, the number of surgeries was reduced. Conclusions The present study demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the rapid implementation of intervention protocols in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The protocols focused on reducing the risk of infection for patients and healthcare professionals, adapting work, academic and scientific activities, and modifying the orthopedic treatment. With the application of the protocols, the healthcare, academic and scientific activities remained functional, prioritizing measures to confront the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Intervention Protocol of the Orthopedics and Traumatology Department of a High-Complexity UniversityHospital to Cope with the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of patients with cancer diagnoses and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection will require surgical treatment. The objective of this study was to determine whether a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of adverse postoperative events following surgery in patients with cancer. METHODS: This was a propensity-matched cohort study from April 6, 2020 to October 31, 2020 at the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center. Cancer patients were identified who underwent elective surgery after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched to controls based on patient, disease, and surgical factors. Primary study outcome was a composite of the following adverse postoperative events that occurred within 30 days of surgery: death, unplanned readmission, pneumonia, cardiac injury, or thromboembolic event. RESULTS: A total of 5682 patients were included for study, and 114 (2.0%) had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The average time from infection to surgery was 52 (range 20C202) days. Compared with matched controls, there was no difference in the rate of adverse postoperative outcome (14.3% vs. 13.4%, p = 1.0). Patients with a SARS-CoV-2-related inpatient admission before surgery had increased odds of postoperative complication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.4 [1.6C34.3], p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A minimal wait time of 20 days after recovering from minimally symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be safe for cancer patients undergoing low-risk elective surgery. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections requiring inpatient treatment were at increased risk for adverse events after surgery. Additional wait time may be required in those with more severe infections.

It is possible that in the prebiotic era, polymerases might have used mispolymerisation to accelerate the diversification of genetic information. Even in the current era, polymerases of RNA viruses frequently cause mutations. In this study, primer extension under different molecular crowding conditions was measured using T7 RNA polymerase as a model for the reaction in the prebiotic world. Interestingly, molecular crowding using 20 wt% poly(ethylene glycol) 2000 preferentially promoted the primer extensions with ATP and GTP by T7 RNA polymerase, regardless of WatsonCCrick base-pairing rules. This indicates that molecular crowding decreases the dielectric constants in solution, resulting in enhancement of stacking interactions between the primer and an incorporated nucleotide. These findings suggest that molecular crowding could accelerate genetic diversity in the prebiotic world and may promote transcription error of RNA viruses in the current era.","output":"Molecular crowding induces primer extension by RNA polymerase through base stacking beyond WatsonCCrick rules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious disease outbreaks are expected to grow exponentially in time, when left unchecked Measures such as lockdown and social distancing can drastically alter the growth dynamics of the outbreak.

The adoption of hygiene measures may help to prevent disease spread aboard aircraft. This review summarizes the evidence on hand hygiene and the use of facemasks as viral disease prevention measures in aircraft. METHODS: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to 10 June 2020, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. A population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) approach was used to define the review question. RESULTS: We included four studies published between 2007 and 2020, all targeting influenza virus disease, in the qualitative synthesis. Three studies used mathematical models to simulate single- or multiple-direction flights, and two of them showed that facemask (e.g., N95 respirator) use considerably reduced infection probability. In the third study, hand cleaning by 20 to 60% of people at any time in all airports (including on aircraft) reduced the measure of airports power to spread the disease across the globe by ~ 24 to 69%. The fourth study was a case-control study designed to trace an influenza outbreak in two flights during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic. The study showed that none (0%) of nine infected passengers compared to 15 (47%) of 32 healthy control passengers in the aircraft cabin during one of these flights wore a facemask (odds ratio, 0.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.0C0.7). In contrast, both case and control passengers appeared to be equally compliant in self-assessed hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: Facemask use combined with hand hygiene may minimize the chance of droplet-transmitted virus spread by air travelers. Thus, it is necessary that hygiene measures become an integral part of standard procedures in commercial air travel.

While there are subtle cell type differences in Golgi enzyme subcompartmentation, in general, glycosylation enzymes are localized within the Golgi cisternae in the same sequence in which they act to modify oligosaccharide substrates. The possibility that this enzyme subcompartmentation may control the types of oligosaccharides expressed by a cell has led to an interest in the signals and mechanisms directing enzyme localization in the Golgi cisternae. All glycosidases and glycosyltransferases characterized thus far have very little sequence homology that might suggest a common Golgi retention signal, but they do share a similar domain structure. They are all type II transmembrane proteins consisting of an amino terminal cytoplasmic tail, a signal anchor transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a large luminal catalytic domain. Their lack of sequence homology suggests that these proteins' Golgi retention signals are not linear amino acid sequences, but most likely involve general characteristics or conformations of larger protein domains. The peptide sequences required for Golgi retention of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAcTI), (1,4-galactosyltrans- ferase (GalT) and 2,6-sialyltransferase (ST) have been extensively studied. To do this, researchers created mutant and chimeric proteins, expressed these in tissue culture cells, and localized these proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy. The cell surface expression of deletion mutants suggested that the deleted sequences were necessary for Golgi retention. Then, if these sequences were fused to a non-Golgi reporter protein and this chimeric or hybrid protein was retained in the Golgi, then these sequences were also sufficient for Golgi retention. Due to differences in reporter proteins used to construct these chimeric proteins, different cell types used for protein expression, different levels of protein expression, and different methods of cell surface protein detection, these experiments have led to somewhat confusing results. However, in general, it appears that the GalT relies primarily on its transmembrane domain for Golgi retention, while the GlcNAcTI and ST have requirements for their transmembrane regions, sequences flanking these regions, and luminal stem sequences. Based on these results, two potential Golgi retention mechanisms have been proposed and are now being tested. The observation that glycosyltransferase transmembrane domains are frequently sufficient for Golgi retention has led to the first of these models, the bilayer thickness model. This model proposes that the shorter transmembrane domains of Golgi proteins prevent them from entering cholesterol-rich transport vesicles destined for the plasma membrane,.and that this leads to Golgi retention. The second of these models is supported by the role of multiple protein domains in the Golgi retention of some proteins. This model, the oligomerization/kin recognition model of Golgi retention, proposes that the formation of insoluble protein homo-oligomers or very large hetero-oligomers prevents protein movement into transport vesicles destined for later compartments. Initial work suggests that the bilayer thickness mechanism may play a role in the retention of some Golgi retained proteins; however, it is not the sole retention mechanism. Other evidence suggests that an oligomerization/kin recognition mechanism may be more common, but definitive proof for its general use in Golgi protein retention is lacking. More research is required to further elucidate the sequences and particularly the mechanisms of Golgi retention. In the future, we hope to be able to explain the cell type differences in glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation, the different sequence requirements for the Golgi retention of the same enzyme in various cell types, and whether differences in glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation change the types of oligosaccharides made by a cell.","output":"Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases: more questions than answers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Australian Government is financially incentivising work integrated learning (WIL) to enhance graduate employability.

Rising numbers of deliveries in health facilities, including in high mortality settings like Nigeria, require formalised coordination across the health system to ensure that women and newborns get to the right level of care, at the right time. This study describes and critically assesses the extent to which referral and its components can be captured using three different data sources from Nigeria, examining issues of data quality, validity, and usefulness for improving and monitoring obstetric care systems. METHODS: The study included three data sources on referral for childbirth care in Nigeria: a nationally representative household survey, patient records from multiple facilities in a state, and patient records from the apex referral facility in a city. We conducted descriptive analyses of the extent to which referral status and components were captured across the three sources. We also iteratively developed a visual conceptual framework to guide our critical comparative analysis. RESULTS: We found large differences in the proportion of women referred, and this reflected the different denominators and timings of the referral in each data source. Between 16 and 34% of referrals in the three sources originated in government hospitals, and lateral referrals (origin and destination facility of the same level) were observed in all three data sources. We found large gaps in the coverage of key components of referral as well as data gaps where this information was not routinely captured in facility-based sources. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses illustrated different perspectives from the national- to facility-level in the capture of the extent and components of obstetric referral. By triangulating across multiple data sources, we revealed the strengths and gaps within each approach in building a more complete picture of obstetric referral.

There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN, bilirubin, ALT, AST, systolic blood pressure, and CK.

Interpretation The findings of this meta-analysis- and meta-regression-based systematic review supports elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for mortality and severe complications. D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and locally (i.e., in the lung) hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis. D-dimer and associated clinical biomarkers and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.","output":"Insufficient hyperfibrinolysis in COVID-19: a systematic review of thrombolysis based on meta-analysis and meta-regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has a large portfolio of ongoing cancer clinical trials that involve biospecimencollection and are supported by the NCI-funded National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Biospecimen Banks locatedacross the United States and Canada At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, NCTN biobanks rapidly responded tostaffing consequences of state- and institution-issued stay-at-home orders Many of the NCTN biobanks weredeemed essential by their institutions, allowing for limited and/or socially distanced operations NCTN biobanksquickly worked with NCI and their respective groups to advise participating sites of changes to usual biospecimencollection procedures in order to accommodate limited staffing at the biobanks In many instances, participating sites were navigating their own institutional process change due to the pandemic NCTN cancer clinical trials experiencedan approximate 40% decrease in enrollment from March 11 to May 19, 2020, compared to the same time frame in2019 Likewise, NCTN biobanks saw an approximate 40% and 60% decrease in biospecimen receipt anddistribution, respectively The decrease in biospecimen receipt was likely due to two factors: (1) participating siteCOVID-19 policies limiting patient enrollment on NCI cancer clinical trials and/or biospecimen collection for thosetrials, and (2) NCTN biobank requests for participating sites to hold nonurgent and/or nonmandatory biospecimensduring the initial phase of the pandemic Decrease in biospecimen distributions was mainly due to receivinglaboratory closures as dictated by their institutional COVID-19 policies On May 20, 2020, all states had begun initialreopening phases to some extent At this time, several, but not all, NCTN biobanks had begun measured return tofull operations, following institutional guidance NCTN biobanks are making numerous considerations towardreturning to full operations and will continue to work with NCI and their respective groups to responsibly collect anddistribute biospecimens collected during the COVID-19 pandemic Likely, some patients enrolled on NCTN cancerclinical trials may have had clinical or subclinical COVID-19 at the time of biospecimen collection Additionally, biospecimens will be collected on two recently activated NCI COVID-19 studies: (1) the NCI COVID-19 in CancerPatients Study (NCCAPS): A Longitudinal Natural History Study ( NCT04387656 ), and (2) a tocilizumab treatmenttrial for COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome in cancer patients ( NCT04370834 ) Retrospectiveannotation of these biospecimens may provide a unique resource for translational research efforts and will also be aneeded caveat for interpreting biomarker studies conducted using these biospecimens, as the impact of COVID-19on various biomarkers is currently unknown","output":"National Clinical Trials Networkbiobanking during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As one of the biggest challenges facing mankind in recent history, the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound impact on the United States.

However, it has relatively low sensitivity and time consuming. In contrast, chest computed tomography (CT) has high sensitivity and achieves quick results. It may, therefore, play a critical role in screening and diagnosing COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was done in 212 patients with confirmed cases and patients under surveillance for COVID-19 tested for RT-PCR and chest CT scan. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 23 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). AIM: We aim to investigate the diagnostic value of chest CT in correlation to RT-PCR in Indonesia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done in 212 patients with confirmed cases and patients under surveillance for COVID-19 tested for RT-PCR and chest CT scan. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 23 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: From a total of 212 patients, 92% of them were diagnosed as confirmed cases of COVID-19. It was found that the sensitivity of CT scan for COVID-19 patients was 72.3% (65.5% and 78.5%) with positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.9% (90.9% and 96.0%) and the sensitivity and PPV improve in symptomatic patients. Typical chest CT scan lesions were 8.0 times which were more likely (3.9C16.4;p <0.001) to be detected in symptomatic patients while patients with severe CT scan findings were 4.4 times more likely (3.0C6.5;p <0.001) to be admitted to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: A high PPV suggests that a chest CT scan can detect COVID-19 lesions, but the absence of the lesions would not exclude the diseases presence.","output":"Descriptive analysis of chest computed tomography scan in coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia: Correlation with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and clinical features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has caused the greatest crisis of human civilization Originated in Wuhan, China, it has gradually spread all over the world The deadly virus has been threatening human mankind for the last three months In the surge of COVID-19 pandemic, precise and immediate detection of COVID19 cases will immensely help in the testing for COVID-19 detection Therefore, there is a substantial need for an auxiliary automated detection system which will help in immediate testing Since the virus is targeting the human respiratory system initially, chest X-ray images will come out to be a useful feature for COVID-19 detection in an early stage With the help of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), it is possible to get promising results In this paper, a new fine-tuned deep CNN model has been proposed to generate precise and accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID-19 positive vs COVID-19 negative) using raw chest X-ray images The detailed model architecture and accuracy metrics are presented which are obtained from fivefold cross-validation trained over 1300 image samples The proposed model gained a validation accuracy of 99 39394% which is superior as compared to other studies in this domain ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Detection of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Transfer Learning Using Chest X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been identified in China in late December 2019 SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family Coronaviruses have genetic proofreading mechanism that corrects copying mistakes and thus SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is extremely low Despite lower mutation rate of the virus, researchers have detected a total of 12,706 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the majority of which were single nucleotide polymorphisms Sequencing data revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 accumulates two-single nucleotide mutations per month in its genome Recently, an amino acid aspartate (D) to glycine (G) (D614G) mutation due to an adenine to guanine nucleotide change at position 23,403 at the 614th amino-acid position of the spike protein in the original reference genotype has been identified The SARS-CoV-2 viruses that carry the spike protein D614G mutation have become dominant variant around the world The D614G mutation has been found to be associated with 3 other mutations in the spike protein Clinical and pseudovirus experimental studies have demonstrated that the spike protein D614G mutation alters the virus phenotype However, the impact of the mutation on the rate of transmission between people, disease severity and the vaccine and therapeutic development remains unclear Three variants of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been identified They are B 1 1 7 (UK) variant, B 1 351 (N501Y V2, South African) variant and B 1 1 28 (Brazilian) variant Epidemiological data suggest that they have a higher transmissibility than the original variant There are reports that some vaccines are less efficacious against the B 1 351 variant This review article discusses the effects of novel mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome on transmission, clinical outcomes and vaccine development","output":"Implications of the Novel Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome for Transmission, Disease Severity, and the Vaccine Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2) remains a significant public health concern, particularly in low-income neighborhoods where healthy foods may be scarcer.

Better glycemic control was not correlated with better overall food store score, meaning that people in neighborhoods with better access to healthy foods are not necessarily more likely to manage their diabetes. While perceived healthy food access was not correlated with glycemic control, it was strongly correlated with objective healthy food access at shorter distances from home.

The incidence of complications after cesarean section for mothers and neonates during the second stage of labor significantly increases compared with planned cesarean section. During the second stage of labor, the fetal head is deep in the pelvic cavity.

In addition, we performed a citation search and scanned reference lists. Clinical trials that performed an EEG-based examination on an adult patient group diagnosed with melancholic unipolar depression and compared with a control group of non-melancholic unipolar depression and/or healthy controls were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed by the Strengthening of Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results: A total of 24 studies, all case-control design, met the inclusion criteria and could be divided into three subgroups: Resting state studies (n = 5), sleep EEG studies (n = 10), and event-related potentials (ERP) studies (n = 9). Within each subgroup, studies were characterized by marked variability on almost all levels, preventing pooling of data, and many studies were subject to weighty methodological problems. However, the main part of the studies identified one or several EEG parameters that differentiated the groups. Conclusions: Multiple EEG modalities showed an ability to distinguish melancholic patients from non-melancholic patients and/or healthy controls.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position statement summarizes the nutrient needs of older adults (aged 60 years) based on a systematic review. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare nutrient intake of Women's Health Initiative Long Life Study participants to the Dietary Reference Intakes for nutrients reviewed in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position statement. DESIGN The study is a cross-sectional analysis. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING Participants (n=7,875) were mailed the General Nutrition Assessment Food Frequency Questionnaire during 2012-2013, of whom 77% (n=6,095) completed it, and 5,732 were included in the analytic sample after exclusion for implausible energy intakes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mean intake of energy and protein, calcium, fiber, folate, potassium, sodium, vitamins B-12, D, E, and K were described overall and compared with recommendations. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED Demographic and lifestyle characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. The proportion of participants meeting recommendations was computed. RESULTS Mean age of completers was 797 years and 53.5% were non-Hispanic white, 30% were non-Hispanic black, and 16.5% were Hispanic/Latina. Only one-third of women consumed 21 g/day fiber, whereas fewer met the Recommended Dietary Allowance for calcium (18.6%), vitamin E (16.9%), and vitamin D (1.7%). Just more than half (56%) of participants met the Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight/day, and just less than half (47.0%) met potassium guidelines.

The spread depends on how people move and co-locate with each other, or their mobility patterns. How far such phenomena spread has significance for both policy making and personal decision making, e.g., studying the spread of COVID-19 under different intervention strategies such as wearing a mask. In practice, mobility patterns of an entire population is never available, and we usually have access to location data of a subset of individuals. In this paper, we formalize and study the problem of estimating the spread of a phenomena in a population, given that we only have access to sub-samples of location visits of some individuals in the population. We show that simple solutions such as estimating the spread in the sub-sample and scaling it to the population, or more sophisticated solutions that rely on modeling location visits of individuals do not perform well in practice, the former because it ignores contacts between unobserved individuals and sampled ones and the latter because it yields inaccurate modeling of co-locations. Instead, we directly model the co-locations between the individuals. We introduce PollSpreader and PollSusceptible, two novel approaches that model the co-locations between individuals using a contact network, and infer the properties of the contact network using the subsample to estimate the spread of the phenomena in the entire population. We show that our estimates provide an upper bound and a lower bound on the spread of the disease in expectation. Finally, using a large high-resolution real-world mobility dataset, we experimentally show that our estimates are accurate, while other methods that do not correctly account for co-locations between individuals result in wrong observations (e.g, premature herd-immunity).","output":"Estimating Spread of Contact-Based Contagions in a Population Through Sub-Sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the emphasis of personal hygiene which was long being ignored.

In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population.

In only a few months, it has had a dramatic impact on society and world economies. COVID-19 has presented numerous challenges to all aspects of health care, including reliable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Initial efforts to contain the spread of the virus were hampered by the time required to develop reliable diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science with many applications for health care. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses deep learning with neural network algorithms. It can recognize patterns and achieve complex computational tasks often far quicker and with increased precision than can humans. Methods In this article, we explore the potential for the simple and widely available chest X-ray (CXR) to be used with AI to diagnose COVID-19 reliably. Microsoft CustomVision is an automated image classification and object detection system that is a part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. We utilized publicly available CXR images for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia from other etiologies, and normal CXRs as a dataset to train Microsoft CustomVision. Results Our trained model overall demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity (recall) and positive predictive value (precision), with results for each label showing sensitivity and positive predictive value at 94.8% and 98.9% for COVID-19 pneumonia, 89% and 91.8% for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, 95% and 88.8% for normal lung. We then validated the program using CXRs of patients from our institution with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses along with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXRs. Our model performed with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 97% accuracy, 91% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value. Conclusions We have used a readily available, commercial platform to demonstrate the potential of AI to assist in the successful diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR images. The findings have implications for screening and triage, initial diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and identifying patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Based on the data, a website was created to demonstrate how such technologies could be shared and distributed to others to combat entities such as COVID-19 moving forward.","output":"Using Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Chest X-ray Diagnosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More transmissible variants may be to blame for record numbers of coronavirus cases, reports Michael Le Page","output":"India's covid-19 surge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When one thinks of the Gram+ cell wall, the peptidoglycan (PG) scaffold in particular comes to mind.

In addition, there are completely different molecules that are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane and span the cell wall. These are lipoteichoic acids and bacterial lipoproteins (Lpp). The latter are in the focus of this review. Lpp are present in almost all bacteria. They fulfill a wealth of different tasks.

Furthermore, they perform very diverse and special tasks such as acting as chaperonin, as cyclomodulin, contributing to invasion of host cells or uptake of plasmids via conjugation. All these functions are taken over by the protein part. Nevertheless, the lipid part of the Lpp plays an as important role as the protein part.

Here, we describe an important role of Rtt105 in high-fidelity DNA replication and recombination and demonstrate that these functions of Rtt105 primarily depend on its regulation of RPA. The deletion of RTT105 causes elevated spontaneous DNA mutations with large duplications or deletions mediated by microhomologies. Rtt105 is recruited to DNA double-stranded break (DSB) ends where it promotes RPA assembly and homologous recombination repair by gene conversion or break-induced replication. In contrast, Rtt105 attenuates DSB repair by the mutagenic single-strand annealing or alternative end joining pathway. Thus, Rtt105-mediated regulation of RPA promotes high-fidelity replication and recombination while suppressing repair by deleterious pathways. Finally, we show that the human RPA-interacting protein hRIP-, a putative functional homolog of Rtt105, also stimulates RPA assembly on ssDNA, suggesting the conservation of an Rtt105-mediated mechanism.","output":"Rtt105 promotes high-fidelity DNA replication and repair by regulating the single-stranded DNA-binding factor RPA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally.

Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0C16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features. Findings From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 83 [SD 35] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 385C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 375C385C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavirCritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured. Interpretation Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

Similar results were obtained from surfaces in the surrounding of confirmed SARS- and influenza-patients. A contamination of public surfaces with infectious virus is considerably less likely because there are much less potential viral spreaders around a surface, the contact time between a person and the surface is much shorter, and the asymptomatic carriers typically have no symptoms. In addition, a hand contact with a contaminated surface transfers only a small part of the viral load. A simple cleaning reduces the number of infectious viruses already by 2 log (10) -steps. That is why public surfaces should in general be cleaned because the wide use of biocidal agents for surface disinfection further increases the microbial selection pressure without an expectable health benefit.","output":"Ist die Desinfektion ?ffentlicher Fl?chen zur Pr?vention von SARS-CoV-2 C infektionen sinnvoll?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As some patients infected with the novel coronavirus progress to critical illness, a subset will eventually develop shock.

Although case-based and syndromic surveillance are critical for monitoring the pandemic, these systems rely on persons obtaining testing or reporting a COVID-19-like illness. Using serologic tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an adjunctive strategy that estimates the prevalence of past infection in a population. During April 28-May 3, 2020, coinciding with the end of a statewide shelter-in-place order, CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health conducted a serologic survey in DeKalb and Fulton counties in metropolitan Atlanta to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the population. A two-stage cluster sampling design was used to randomly select 30 census blocks in each county, with a target of seven participating households per census block. Weighted estimates were calculated to account for the probability of selection and adjusted for age group, sex, and race/ethnicity. A total of 394 households and 696 persons participated and had a serology result; 19 (2.7%) of 696 persons had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected. The estimated weighted seroprevalence across these two metropolitan Atlanta counties was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-4.5). Non-Hispanic black participants more commonly had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than did participants of other racial/ethnic groups (p<0.01).

Fifteen SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis and uploaded to the GISAID database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method using MEGAX software. RESULTS Whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA samples revealed 32 missense, 21 synonymous, and 4 non-coding alleles.

Risk strata in medical attention are of dynamic significance for apposite assessment and supply distribution. Presently, no known cultured contrivance is available to fill this gap of this pandemic. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model based on vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model of various orders for gender based daily COVID-19 incidence in Nigeria. This study also aims to proffer empirical evidence that compares incidence between male and female for COVID-19 risk factors. METHODS: Wilcoxon signed-rank test is employed to investigate the significance of the difference in the gender distributions of the daily incidence. A VARMA model of various orders is formulated for the gender based daily COVID-19 incidence in Nigeria. The optimal VARMA model is identified using Bayesian information criterion. Also, a predictive model based on univariate autoregressive moving average model is formulated for the daily death cases in Nigeria. Fold change is estimated based on crude case-fatality risk to investigate whether there is massive underreporting and under-testing of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. RESULTS: Daily incidence is higher in males on most days from 11 April 2020 to 12 September 2020. Result of Wilcoxon signed-rank test shows that incidence among male is significantly higher than female (p-value < 2.22  10(?16)). White neural network test shows that daily female incidence is not linear in mean (p-value = 0.00058746) while daily male incidence is linear in mean (p-value = 0.4257). McLeod-Li test shows that there is autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity in the female incidence (Maximum p-value = 1.4277  10(?5)) and male incidence (Maximum p-value = 9.0816  10(?14)) at 5% level of significance. Ljung-Box test (Tsay, 2014) shows that the daily incidence cases are not random (p-value=0.0000). The optimal VARMA model for male and female daily incidence is VARMA (0,1).

Several insights emerge on changes in consumers fundamental behaviors. First, the share of e-commerce use differs across the types of goods. Grocery goods showed a significant increase immediately after the COVID-19 outbreak. In contrast, machinery/PC applications and book/DVD/software showed only a slight increase immediately after the outbreak. However, only a slight decrease was observed during the third survey. Overall, consumers recognized the importance of e-commerce immediately after the pandemic, with no subsequent significant decline. Second, there may be a positive relationship between the time spent at home and the importance of e-commerce One reason is that an increase in stay-at-home duration decreases the opportunity to shop at retail stores. Consequently, trips to stores decreased during the initial spread of COVID-19. The modes of transportation for shopping and in the living area (infection status) were not significant factors of e-commerce usage. Finally, if consumers recognize its usefulness, they continued to consider e-commerce as important. However, their attitudes toward e-commerce improved after the COVID-19 outbreak because they wanted to avoid infection risks and follow social distancing and safety protocols. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"The use of e-commerce and the COVID-19 outbreak: A panel data analysis in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-COVID-19 pandemic is bringing to light significant issues that require deliberations on how to manage patients at high cardiovascular risk or with proven heart disease The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients","output":"[Being a cardiologist at the time of SARS-COVID-19: is it time to reconsider our way of working?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek (mung bean) is a Chinese functional food with antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. However, little is known about its antiviral activity. We aimed to investigate the antiviral activity and mechanisms of action of Vigna radiata extract (VRE) against influenza virus. HPLC was conducted to analyze the components of the VRE. The anti-influenza viral activity of VRE in Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was evaluated by virus titration assays, hemagglutination assays, quantitative RT-PCR assays, cellular -glucosidase activity assays and neuraminidase activity assays. Chromatographic profiling analysis identified two major flavonoids, vitexin and isovitexin, in the ethanol extract of Vigna radiata. Through in vitro studies, we showed that VRE, at concentrations up to 2,000 g/ml, exhibited no cytotoxicity in MDCK cells. VRE protected cells from influenza virus-induced cytopathic effects and significantly inhibited viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner. A detailed time-of-addition assay revealed that VRE may act on both the early and late stages of the viral life cycle. We demonstrated that 1) VRE inhibits virus entry by directly blocking the HA protein of influenza virus; 2) VRE inhibits virus entry by directly binding to cellular receptors; 3) VRE inhibits virus penetration; 4) VRE inhibits virus assembly by blocking cellular -glucosidase activity, thus reducing HA protein trafficking to the cell surface; and 5) VRE inhibits virus release by inhibiting viral neuraminidase activity. In summary, Vigna radiata extract potently interferes with two different subtypes of influenza viruses at multiple steps during the infectious cycle, demonstrating its broad-spectrum potential as an anti-influenza preventive and therapeutic agent. Continued development of Vigna radiata-derived products into antiviral therapeutics is warranted.","output":"Vigna radiata (L.) R.

The eRT interventions were components of an evidence-based care bundle and included ventilator liberation protocols, low tidal volume protocols, tube patency, and an extubation checklist. In addition, the proactive rounding of patients, including ventilator checks, was included. A standardized data collection sheet was used to facilitate the review of medical records, direct audioCvisual inspection, or direct interactions with staff. In May 2020, a total of 1548 interventions took place, 93.86% of which were coded as routine based on established workflows, 4.71% as urgent, 0.26% emergent, and 1.17% were missing descriptors. Based on the number of coded interventions, we tracked the number of COVID-19 patients in the system. The average intervention took 6.1  3.79 min. In 16% of all the interactions, no communication with the bedside team took place. The eRT connected with the in-house respiratory therapist (RT) in 66.6% of all the interventions, followed by house staff (9.8%), advanced practice providers (APP; 2.8%), and RN (2.6%). Most of the interaction took place over the telephone (88%), secure text message (16%), or audio-video telemedicine ICU platform (1.7%). A total of 5115 minutes were spent on tasks that a bedside clinician would have otherwise executed, reducing their exposure to COVID-19. The eRT service was instrumental in several emergent and urgent critical interventions. This study shows that an eRT service can support the bedside RT providers, effectively monitor best practice bundles, and carry out patientCventilator assessments.

Without this change in travel activity, exposure to out-of-county virus cases could have been twice as high at the end of April 2020. Limiting travel-induced exposure was important because such exposure generated new cases locally. We find a one percent increase in case exposure from travel led to a 0.21 percent increase in new cases added within a county. This suggests the outbreak would have spread faster and to a greater degree had travel activity not dropped accordingly.

Here, 17 implemented policies from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset employed in 90 countries from December 31, 2019, to August 31, 2020, were analyzed.

With that, lagging (0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days) was also considered during the analysis since the effects of policies implemented on a given day may affect the number of confirmed cases several days after implementation. The countries were divided into three groups depending on the number of waves of the pandemic observed in each country. Through subgroup analysis, we showed that with and without lagging, contact tracing and containment policies were significant for countries with two waves, while closing, economic, and health policies were significant for countries with three waves. Wave-specific analysis for each wave showed that significant health, economic, and containment policies varied across waves of the pandemic. Emergency investment in healthcare was consistently significant among the three groups of countries, while the Stringency index was significant among all waves of the pandemic.

The pre-immunosuppressed state along with other existing co-morbidities can influence the outcomes of COVID-19 in transplant patients MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a single centre prospective cohort study done in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), who underwent kidney transplantation (from December 2012 to November 2020), who were actively followed up at our centre and were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease between 1 April and 30 November 2020. RESULTS: A total of 62 kidney-transplant recipients tested positive for COVID-19. Their median age was 39 (19C61). Males were predominantly infected (87.1%). Fever was the most common symptom (77.42%). Thirteen (20.9%) had mild form of disease, 32 (51.6%) had moderate form and 17 (27.4%) had severe disease. Based on initial symptom, 18 (29.03%) were given home treatment, 29 (46.7%) were treated in isolation wards and 15 (24.1%) were treated in intensive care unit. Decrease in the dose of immunosuppressant (anti-metabolites in 67.7%, calcineurin inhibitor in 22.5%) was predominantly carried out as the initial mode of treatment. Remdesivir in 64.5% and anticoagulant therapy in 54.84% were given as a modality of treatment. Mortality rate in our study was 14.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients of kidney transplant are at high risk of getting infected with COVID-19, due to their immunosuppressed state.

The closure of many public library spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has introduced new issues, including limitations to access of print materials, new ease of access to online materials, and additional resource limitations as libraries work with limited budgets and staff. While the shift to online services during the COVID-19 pandemic has likely sped up the transition to increasing availability of online resources in public libraries, an appetite for print materials remains.","output":"Balancing Print and Electronic Collections in Public Libraries: Perspectives for a Changing World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the front line of detection of patients infected with COVID-19 doctors have a high risk of transmission. However doctors ability to provide proper communication with a unique medical interview process and persuasion of health context is needed. Patients can be open and honest about the illness symptoms and get the required information as prevention. This study aimed to determine doctor-patient communication changes and how information can reduce doctor risks of infection. Then this research also aimed to know how the information from health communication to patients and their families can increase awareness toward the outbreak, change patients behavior and likewise build a resilient society. As a qualitative case study through semi-structured interviews with fourteen general practitioners of the Emergency Department and fourteen patients we constructed some barriers and opportunities when doctors gave patients information about COVID-19 and figured out how it could influence behavior. The attitudes and communication behaviors of doctors underwent several modifications namely changes in the premedical examination anamnesis providing information verification of information and a tendency to change the relationship from mutualistic to paternalistic-informative. Provision of knowledge through information was carried out in a balanced way between risk and prevention so that patients behaved according to medical advice. Changes in community behavior indicated a difference in the community lifestyle although it has not yet been consistent to become a resilient adaptive and preventive community against pandemics. This paper provided findings for health communication value and offered useful suggestions for general practitioners especially by educating vulnerable people during catastrophic events such as COVID-19.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in our hospital. Diagnosis was based on a positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal samples. The cohort was divided into two groups, i.e. a favorable evolution (FE) group and an unfavorable evolution (UFE) group, including intensive care unit (ICU) and deceased patients. Results: A total of 198 patients were enrolled in the study, with 138 FE (70%) and 60 UFE (30%). Older age, male gender, comorbidities and dyspnea at admission constituted significantly worse prognosis factors. Among laboratory features, lymphocyte and platelet counts as well as corrected glomerular filtration rate were significantly lower in UFE patients, while neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, inflammation biomarkers, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glycemia and D-dimer were significantly higher. Procalcitonin and LDH appeared as the most accurate variables according to receiver operating characteristic curves.

METHODS: In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). FINDINGS: Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.7%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%.

However, since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, utilization of traditional face mask NIPPV has been curtailed in part due to risk of aerosolization of respiratory particles and subsequent health care worker exposure. A randomized clinical trial in 2016 reported that an alternative interface, helmet NIPPV, may be more effective than traditional NIPPV at preventing intubation and improving mortality. The helmet NIPPV interface provides positive airway pressure, while also theoretically minimizing aerosolization, making it a feasible modality in management of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Case and outcomes: This report describes a single-center experience of a series of three COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure managed with helmet NIPPV. One patient was able to avoid intubation while a second patient was successfully extubated to NIPPV. Ultimately, the third patient was unable to avoid intubation with helmet NIPPV, although the application of the device was late in the progression of the disease. Discussion: NIPPV is an important modality in the management of respiratory failure and has been shown to reduce the need for immediate endotracheal intubation in select populations. For patients unable to tolerate facemask NIPPV, the helmet provides an alternate interface. In COVID-19 patients, the helmet interface may reduce the risk of virus exposure to health care workers from aerosolization. Based on this experience, we recommend that helmet NIPPV can be considered as a feasible option for the management of patients with COVID-19, whether the goal is to prevent immediate intubation or avoid post-extubation respiratory failure. Randomized studies are needed to definitively validate the use of helmet NIPPV in this population.

This study aimed to: (1) identify situations that are most amenable to the use of telemedicine for the provision of palliative care to patients in nursing homes; and (2) understand how telemedicine could best be integrated into the routine practice of mobile palliative care teams. METHODS: A qualitative study based on semi-structured focus groups (n = 7) with professionals (n = 33) working in mobile palliative care teams in France. RESULTS: Between June and July 2019, 7 mobile palliative care teams participated in one focus group each. Using thematic analysis, we found that telemedicine use in palliative care is about navigating between usual and new practices. Several influencing factors also emerged, which influence the use of telemedicine for palliative care, depending on the situation. Finally, we built a use-case model of palliative care to help mobile palliative care teams identify circumstances where telemedicine could be useful, or not. CONCLUSIONS: The potential utility of telemedicine for delivering palliative care in nursing homes largely depends on the motive for calling on the mobile palliative care team. Requests regarding symptoms may be particularly amenable to telemedicine, whereas psycho-social distress may not.

Despite promising treatment options for younger patients, prognosis for the elderly remains poor and efficacy of available treatment options is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a scoping review to identify and summarize the current study pool available evaluating different types and combinations of (immuno) chemotherapy with a special focus on HCT-ASCT in elderly PCNSL. Relevant studies were identified through systematic searches in the bibliographic databases Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect (last search conducted in September 2020). For ongoing studies, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the German study register and the WHO registry. RESULTS In total, we identified six randomized controlled trials (RCT) with 1.346 patients, 26 prospective (with 1.366 patients) and 24 retrospective studies (with 2.629 patients). Of these, only six studies (one completed and one ongoing RCT (with 447 patients), one completed and one ongoing prospective single arm study (with 65 patients), and two retrospective single arm studies (with 122 patients)) evaluated HCT-ASCT. Patient relevant outcomes such as progression-free and overall survival and (neuro-)toxicity were adequately considered across almost all studies. The current study pool is, however, not conclusive in terms of the most effective treatment options for elderly. Main limitations were (very) small sample sizes and heterogeneous patient populations in terms of age ranges (particularly in RCTs) limiting the applicability of the results to the target population (elderly). CONCLUSIONS Although it has been shown that HCT-ASCT is probably a feasible and effective treatment option, this approach has never been investigated within a RCT including a wide range of elderly patients. A RCT comparing conventional (immuno) chemotherapy with HCT-ASCT is crucial to evaluate benefit and harms in an un-biased manner to eventually provide older PCNSL patients with the most effective treatment.","output":"Treatment Regimens for Immunocompetent Elderly Patients with Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Reflect on how the new coronavirus pandemic triggered or accentuated the fear of childbirth in pregnant women and affected childbirth care practices.

METHODS 67 health workers with biological risk in their tasks, who have been filed as non-responders to conventional vaccination against Hepatitis B, were enrolled in the Clinical Trial. All participants were from 18 years up to 64 years old. INCLUSION CRITERIA NHS workers -including university students doing their internships in health centres dependent on the National Health System (inclusion of students is regulated and limited by specific instructions on labour prevention in each autonomous community)- classified as non-responders. The criteria defining them as non-responders to the conventional hepatitis B vaccine is anti HBsAb titers < 10 mUI/ml following the application of six doses of conventional vaccine at 20 g doses (two complete guidelines). The objective of this study was to provide Health workers-staff with an additional protection tool against hepatitis B infection, and to evaluate the efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccine in healthy non-responders to conventional hepatitis B vaccine. The primary outcome was the measurement of antibody antiHBs before the first Fendrix? dose and a month after the administration of each dose. Other outcome was collection of adverse effects during administration and all those that could be related to the vaccine and that occur within 30 days after each dose. In this study, only one group was assigned. There was no randomization or masking. RESULTS The participants were recruited between April 13, 2018 and October 31, 2019. 67 participants were enrolled in the Clinical Trial and included the analyses. The primary immunisation consists of 4 separate 0.5 ml doses of Fendrix?, administered at the following schedule: 1 month, 2 months and 6 months from the date of the first dose. Once the positivity was reached in any of the doses, the participant finished the study and was not given the following doses. 68.66% (46 out 67) had a positive response to first dose of Fendrix?. 57.14% (12 out 21) had a positive response to second dose of Fendrix?. 22.22% (2 out 9) had a positive response to third dose of Fendrix and 42.96% (3 out 7) had a positive response to last dose of Fendrix?. Overall, 94.02% (64 out 67) of participants had a positive response to Fendrix?. No serious adverse event occurred.

While under resting state, MAVS is prevented from spontaneously aggregating to switch off the signal transduction and maintain immune homeostasis. Due to the dual role in antiviral signal transduction and immune homeostasis, MAVS has emerged as the central regulation target by both viruses and hosts.

PATIENTS AND METHODS The community epidemiology and burden of human metapneumovirus and other respiratory viruses (influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and picornaviruses) were examined in a cohort of 234 preschool-aged children from Melbourne, Australia, over a 12-month period by using polymerase chain reaction testing. Parents collected a daily symptom diary for the duration of the study and were taught to collect a combined nose-throat swab and complete an impact diary when the study child had an acute respiratory illness. RESULTS The average incidence of acute respiratory illness was 0.48 per child-month for the duration of the study, with a winter peak. Of 543 illnesses with > or = 1 specimen returned, 33 were positive for human metapneumovirus (6.1%) and 18 for human coronavirus NL63 (3.3%). Of all of the viruses for which we tested, human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus NL63 were most strongly linked to child care attendance, occurring in 82% and 78% of infected children, respectively.

These infections are due to sequence variation in the spike protein leading to a reduction in protection afforded by the current vaccines, which are based on the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, or by natural infection with pre-Omicron strains. MethodsIn a longitudinal cohort study, pre-breakthrough infection sera for Omicron breakthroughs (n=12) were analyzed. Assays utilized include a laboratory-developed solid phase binding assay to recombinant spike protein, a commercial assay to the S1 domain of the spike protein calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, and a commercial solid-phase surrogate neutralizing activity (SNA) assay. All assays employed spike protein preparations based on sequences from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Participant demographics and clinical characteristics were captured. ResultsPre-breakthrough binding antibody (bAB) titers ranged from 1:800-1:51,200 for the laboratory-developed binding assay, which correlated well and agreed quantitatively with the commercial spike S1 domain WHO calibrated assay. SNA was detected in 10/12 (83%) samples. ConclusionsNeither high bAB nor SNA were markers of protection from Omicron infection/re-infection. Laboratory tests with antigen targets based on Wuhan-Hu-1 may not accurately reflect the degree of immune protection from variants with significant spike protein differences.

When compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have decreased lymphocyte counts (0.6 vs. 1.1 10?/L, p < 0.001), eosinopenia (< 0.02  10?/L, 73% vs. 24%, p < 0.001), increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (471.0 vs. 230.0 U/L, p < 0.001) and elevated IL-6 level (47.4 vs. 5.7 pg/ml, p = 0.002) on admission. Eosinopenia and elevated LDH were significantly associated with disease severity in both univariate and multivariate regression models included the above variables. Eosinopenia was also an independent risk factor for mortality of this cohort in a multivariate model included the above variables. Moreover, eosinophil counts and LDH levels tended to return to normal range over time in both groups after treatment and severe patients recovered slower than non-severe patients, especially eosinophil counts. Conclusions: Eosinopenia and elevated LDH are potential predictors of disease severity in COVID-19 patients with underlying chronic airway diseases. Theses predictors may help clinicians identify the severe COVID-19 patients with chronic bronchitis, COPD, and asthma.","output":"Decreased Eosinophil Counts and Elevated Lactate Dehydrogenase Predict Severe COVID-19 Patients with Underlying Chronic Airway Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 symptoms, including hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, ageusia, neurological dysfunctions, D-dimer production, and multi-organ microthrombosis reach beyond effects attributed to impaired angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) signaling and elevated concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II). Although both SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE2 for host entry, distinct COVID-19 pathogenesis coincides with the acquisition of a new sequence, which is homologous to the furin cleavage site of the human epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). This review provides a comprehensive summary of the role of ACE2 in the assembly of Na+-dependent transporters of glucose, imino and neutral amino acids, as well as the functions of ENaC. Data support an osmotic adaptation mechanism in which osmotic and hemostatic instability induced by Ang II-activated ENaC is counterbalanced by an influx of organic osmolytes and Na+ through the ACE2 complex. We propose a paradigm for the two-site attack of SARS-CoV-2 leading to ENaC hyperactivation and inactivation of the ACE2 complex, which collapses cell osmolality and leads to rupture and/or necrotic death of swollen pulmonary, endothelial, and cardiac cells, thrombosis in infected and non-infected tissues, and aberrant sensory and neurological perception in COVID-19 patients. This dual mechanism employed by SARS-CoV-2 calls for combinatorial treatment strategies to address and prevent severe complications of COVID-19.","output":"Osmotic Adaptation by Na+-Dependent Transporters and ACE2: Correlation with Hemostatic Crisis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has paralysed the livelihood of the global population by inflicting higher mortality among the affected patients. Nearly the entire human physiological system can get disrupted by the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, which exemplifies the significance of discovering a potential drug target. Similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) unequivocally expressed on all vital human organs, particularly on nasal/oral respiratory tract, gastrointestinal organs, innate immune cells, heart, brain and urogenital cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Activation of T2Rs by bitter agonists restores vital functions to these organs via activation of large conductance, Ca2+-dependent potassium (K+) channels (BKca), and inducible nitric oxide synthase. T2R activation in the gustatory system can act as the first defence mechanism, primarily preventing or mitigating SARS-CoV-2 entry to the respiratory tract. Moreover, T2R activation is crucial for the improved vasodilation accompanied by the attenuation of systemic inflammation; hyper-innate immune responses; gastrointestinal disorders; defective neurological functions; acute kidney injury; and impotency witnessed in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases.

However, by presenting an immunological challenge to the individual, they could infrequently trigger immune-mediated diseases. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 42-year-old woman, with no previous medical history, who received the first dose of vaccine against COVID-19 and developed inflammatory arthralgias, associated with sudden onset dyspnea and hypoxemia. Pulmonary thromboembolism was documented and the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was suspected. Autoantibodies were measured confirming this suspicion. After a few days, she presented a massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade that required surgical management. She received treatment with hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids and anticoagulation with improvement of all symptoms. DISCUSSION: There is controversy regarding the potential of COVID-19 vaccines to induce autoimmunity. Studies addressing the safety of using these vaccines have reported the occurrence of mild local and systemic reactions, most frequently in young adults. So far there are few reports of patients who have developed autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases after getting vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations.

To this end, NIH3T3 cell lines constitutively expressing pAPN or pAPN mutants were generated. The mutants were; domain VII deletion mutant and domains IVCVI deletion mutant. In the latter, domain VII was linked to the transmembrane segment through domain III. Results showed PEDV infection was restricted to pAPN and pAPN domain VII expressing NIH3T3 cells. Further, reducing PEDV titre 10 fold resulted in 37.8% decrease in foci indicating positive correlation.

In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. Findings: Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43-63), and 20 (588%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [912%]), fatigue (25 [735%]) and dry cough (18 [529%]). 15 (441%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (205%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury.

In this study, we describe the pattern of bed occupancy across England during the first wave of the pandemic, January 31st to June 5th 2020. Methods: Bed availability and occupancy data was extracted from daily reports submitted by all English secondary care providers, between 27-Mar and 5-June. Two thresholds (85% as per Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92% as per NHS Improvement) were applied as thresholds for safe occupancy. Findings: At peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough, there were 8.7% (8,508) fewer general and acute (G&A) beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72%. The closest to (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99.8% for general and acute beds. For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3.7%) spent above 85% of surge capacity, and 154 trust-days (1.8%) spent above 92%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust = 1 [range: 1 to 17]). However, only 3 STPs (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds. Interpretation: Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed-types existed at a national level. Due to an unequal distribution of bed utilization, many trusts spent a significant period operating above safe occupancy thresholds, despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts; a key operational issue to address in preparing for a potential second wave.

The ability to assess the risk of complicated appendicitis (CA) from uncomplicated appendicitis (UA) in acute appendicitis (AA) could reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. The value of platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) as an inflammatory marker increases when its fluctuations are interpreted along with other complementary hematologic indices, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which provides additional information about the disease activity. Hence, we postulated that NLR and/or PLR could serve as a potential surrogate marker in assessing the severity of AA. Aim This study aims to investigate the use of PLR and/or NLR as a surrogate biomarker in differentiating uncomplicated from complicated appendicitis. Material and methods This retrospective study was conducted at Russells Hall Hospital from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. Data of all patients over age 16 years that had histologically confirmed appendicitis were retrieved. NLR and PLR were calculated from the admission hemogram, and the ratios were compared between uncomplicated (UA) or complicated appendicitis (CA). Cut-off values were calculated using the summarized ROC curve; in addition, the sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals were determined using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results A total of 799 patients were analyzed, of which 469 (58.7%) were female. The median age was 31.2 years. The difference between NLR and PLR within the two appendicitis groups was significant (P=0.05; Kruskal-Wallis). Cohens kappa (degree of inter-rater agreement) between NLR and PLR showed a moderate agreement of 0.589 (P<0.001). We equally demonstrated an exponential relationship between PLR and NLR (R(2 )=0.510, P<0.05). For UA, the area under the curve (AUC) and the cut-off for NLR and PLR were 0.715, 4.75 with a confidence interval (CI) of 0.678-0.653 and 0.632, 155 with a CI of 0.591-0.672, respectively. For CA, using NLR and PLR, the AUC and cut-off were 0.727, 6.96 with a CI of 0.687-0.768 and 0.653, 180.5 with a CI of 0.602-0.703, respectively; all were significant with a P of <0.001.

Acceptability of Cytosponge and subsequent endoscopy were recorded with visual analogue scale (VAS), wherein 0 and 10 denoted lowest and highest acceptability. Median VAS scores were compared using a Mann-Whitney test. The number of attempts, failures in swallowing the device and occurrence of adverse events were analyzed. Risk factors for failure in swallowing were analyzed using a multivariate regression model. RESULTS In total, 2672 Cytosponge procedures were performed, in 2418 individuals from 2008 through 2017. There were 2 adverse events related to the device: a minor pharyngeal bleed and a case of detachment (<1:2000). The median acceptability score for the Cytosponge was 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 5.0-8.0), which was higher than the score for endoscopy without sedation (median 5.0; IQR, 3.0-7.0; P < .001) and lower than the score for endoscopy with sedation (median 8.0; IQR, 5.0-9.0; P < .001).

The clinical and immunologic spectrum of MIS-C and its relationship to other inflammatory conditions of childhood have not been studied in detail. METHODS We retrospectively studied confirmed cases of MIS-C at our institution from March to June 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory studies and treatment response were collected. Data were compared with historic cohorts of Kawasaki disease (KD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). RESULTS Twenty-eight patients fulfilled the case definition of MIS-C. Median age at presentation was 9 years (range 1 month to 17 years); 50% of patients had pre-existing conditions. All patients had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seventeen patients (61%) required intensive care, including 7 patients (25%) requiring inotrope support. Seven patients (25%) met criteria for complete or incomplete KD and coronary abnormalities were found in 6 cases. Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevation in inflammatory markers, D-dimer, B-type natriuretic peptide, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were common but not ubiquitous. Cytopenias distinguished MIS-C from KD and the degree of hyperferritinemia and pattern of cytokine production differed between MIS-C and MAS. Immunomodulatory therapy given to MIS-C patients included IVIG (71%), corticosteroids (61%) and anakinra (18%). Clinical and laboratory improvement were observed in all cases, including 6 cases that did not require immunomodulatory therapy. No mortality was recorded in this cohort.

As a result, our center has experienced a dramatic increase in hospitalizations, particularly respiratory distress secondary to COVID-19, which rapidly exceeded the capacity of our internal medicine service. This necessitated the formation of new COVID-19 units throughout the hospital, replacing all former service lines. These units employed management teams composed of residents from many medical and surgical disciplines, including general surgery residents. Methods: Our general surgery residency program established a surgical COVID-19 (SCOVID) management team. Initially, 4 surgical residents (2 senior and 2 junior), 1 attending surgeon, and 1 attending internal medicine physician were allocated to the initial SCOVID team. On day 3 of implementation, to achieve more rapid competence in the complex management of these patients, a senior medicine resident with direct experience in the care of COVID-19 patients was added in an advisory capacity. Results: The addition of an experienced senior medical resident and attending allowed for the quick adoption of uniform management protocols by surgical residents and attendings. Discussion: We describe a protocol for the establishment of COVID-19 management teams staffed with general surgical residents, as well as a strategy for the achievement of rapid increases in competency. The addition of a senior internal medicine resident and attending to our SCOVID team allowed for rapid achievement of competency in the care of COVID-19 patients in our large institution at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Rapid Adoption of an Interdisciplinary Care Team Model for Surgical Residents Managing Coronavirus Disease-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Long waiting times for elective surgery are common to many publicly funded health systems. Inefficiencies in referral systems in high-income countries are more pronounced than lower and middle-income countries. Primary care practitioners play a major role in determining which patients are referred to surgeon and might represent an opportunity to improve this situation. With conventional methods of referrals, surgery clinics are often overcrowded with non-surgical referrals and surgical patients experience longer waiting times as a consequence. Improving the quality of referral communications should lead to more timely access and better cost-effectiveness for elective surgical care. This review summarises the research evidence for effective interventions within the scope of primary-care referral methods in the surgical care pathway that might shorten waiting time for elective surgeries. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases in December-2019 to January-2020, for articles published after 2013. Eligibility criteria included major elective surgery lists of adult patients, excluding cancer related surgeries. Both randomised and non-randomised controlled studies were eligible. The quality of evidence was assessed using ROBINS-I, AMSTAR 2 and CASP, as appropriate to the study method used. The review presentation was limited to a narrative synthesis because of heterogeneity. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42019158455. RESULTS: The electronic search yielded 7543 records. Finally, nine articles were considered as eligible after deduplication and full article screening. The eligible research varied widely in design, scope, reported outcomes and overall quality, with one randomised trial, two quasi-experimental studies, two longitudinal follow up studies, three systematic reviews and one observational study. All the six original articles were based on referral methods in high-income countries. The included research showed that patient triage and prioritisation at the referral stage improved timely access and increased the number of consultations of surgical patients in clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The available studies included a variety of interventions and were of medium to high quality researches. Managing patient referrals with proper triaging and prioritisation using structured referral formats is likely to be effective in health systems to shorten the waiting times for elective surgeries, specifically in high-income countries.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We reviewed the number and the findings of CMR scans performed during the COVID-19 pandemic between March and May 2020 at University of Naples Federico II. The number and the findings of CMR studies acquired in the corresponding months of 2017, 2018 and 2019 were also assessed for direct comparison. RESULTS: A total of 117 CMR studies was considered, including the procedures performed during the pandemic (n = 18) and those performed in the corresponding months of the prior 3 years (n = 99). The number of CMR studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly (P < .01) lower compared to the mean number (n = 33) of the procedures performed in the corresponding months of 2017?2019. The percentage of abnormal CMR studies was similar (P = 0.73) during the pandemic (67 %) compared to that found in the corresponding months of 2017?2019 (70 %) suggesting that many abnormal tests were missed due to the lockdown. CONCLUSION: The number of CMR studies was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the corresponding period of the previous three years. The lack of difference in the prevalence of abnormal CMR studies between the two study time intervals strongly suggests that many patients with potentially abnormal imaging test have been missed during the pandemic.","output":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging during the COVID-19 pandemic: A southern Italian single-center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology, the techniques for the assessment of biological ingredients in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) preparations have also advanced.

The biological ingredients of a handful of classical TCM preparations were analyzed successfully based on this approach in previous studies. However, the universality, sensitivity and reliability of this approach used on TCM preparations remain unclear.

Aside from using the number of confirmed cases and the fatality to measure the impact caused by COVID-19, few adopted the inflection point (IP) to represent the control capability of COVID-19. How to determine the IP days related to the capability is still unclear. This study aims to (i) build a predictive model based on item response theory (IRT) to determine the IP for countries, and (ii) compare which countries (or continents) are hit most. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak data of the number of confirmed cases in all countries as of October 19, 2020. The IRT-based predictive model was built to determine the pandemic IP for each country. A model building scheme was demonstrated to fit the number of cumulative infected cases. Model parameters were estimated using the Solver add-in tool in Microsoft Excel. The absolute advantage coefficient (AAC) was computed to track the IP at the minimum of incremental points on a given ogive curve. The time-to-event analysis (a.k.a. survival analysis) was performed to compare the difference in IPs among continents using the area under the curve (AUC) and the respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An online comparative dashboard was created on Google Maps to present the epidemic prediction for each country. RESULTS: The top 3 countries that were hit severely by COVID-19 were France, Malaysia, and Nepal, with IP days at 263, 262, and 262, respectively. The top 3 continents that were hit most based on IP days were Europe, South America, and North America, with their AUCs and 95% CIs at 0.73 (0.61-0.86), 0.58 (0.31-0.84), and 0.54 (0.44-0.64), respectively. An online time-event result was demonstrated and shown on Google Maps, comparing the IP probabilities across continents. CONCLUSION: An IRT modeling scheme fitting the epidemic data was used to predict the length of IP days. Europe, particularly France, was hit seriously by COVID-19 based on the IP days. The IRT model incorporated with AAC is recommended to determine the pandemic IP.","output":"An online time-to-event dashboard comparing the effective control of COVID-19 among continents using the inflection point on an ogive curve: Observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN INTRODUCCIN.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Program-specific documents, preexisting, and related to COVID-19; documents from provincial, national, and international kidney transplant societies/agencies and organ procurement agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. METHODS: Challenges in the care of pediatric kidney transplant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Society of Transplantation (CST) Pediatric Group. It identified pediatric kidney transplant nephrologists (including a pediatric nephrologist ethicist) across the country and formed a workgroup. The initial guidance document was drafted and members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all suggestions in detail via e-mail and virtual meetings. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CST Kidney Transplant Working Group, by the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) COVID-19 Rapid Response Team (RRT), and an infectious disease expert. The suggestions were presented at an interactive webinar sponsored by CSN in collaboration with the CST and Canadian Association of Pediatric Nephrologists (CAPN), and attended by pediatric kidney health care professionals for further peer input. Final revisions were made based on feedback received. CJKHD editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. KEY FINDINGS: We identified 8 key areas of pediatric kidney transplant care that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) transplant activity, (2) outpatient clinic activity, (3) monitoring, (4) multidisciplinary care, (5) medications (immunosuppression and others), (6) patient/family education/support, (7) school and employment, and (8) management of pediatric kidney transplant patients who are COVID-19 positive. We make specific suggestions for each of these areas. LIMITATIONS: A full systematic review of available literature was not undertaken for the sake of expediency in development of this guideline. There is a paucity of literature to support evidence-based recommendations at this time. Instead, these guidelines were formulated based on expert opinion derived from available knowledge/experience and are subject to the biases associated with this level of evidence. The parallel review process that was created to expedite the publication of this work may not be as robust as standard arms length peer review processes. IMPLICATIONS: These recommendations are meant to serve as a guide to pediatric kidney transplant directors, clinicians, and administrators for providing the best patient care in the context of limited resources while protecting patients and health care providers wherever possible by limiting exposure to COVID-19. We recognize that recommendations may not be applicable to all provincial/local health authority practices and that they may not be delivered to all patients given the time and resource constraints affecting the individual provincial/local health jurisdiction.","output":"Management of Pediatric Kidney Transplant Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Guidance From the Canadian Society of Transplantation Pediatric Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine and hydroxy-chloroquine already established as anti-malarial and lupus drugs have recently gained renewed attention in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.

Twenty-five patients older than 18 years who underwent unilateral selective neck dissection for head and neck cancer were included in the study. In the control group (group 2, 10 patients) only monopolar and bipolar diathermy was used; in the Ligasure group (group 1, 15 patients) Ligasure was used for hemostasis and dissection in addition to the conventional techniques. Cervical lymphadenectomy time, operation time, preoperative hemoglobin levels, preoperative hematocrit levels, postoperative hemoglobin levels, postoperative hematocrit levels, total neck drainage and drain removal time were analyzed and compared between the groups. Median operation time in group 1 and 2 were 95 min (IQR = 35) and 142.5 min (IQR = 63), respectively. Median cervical lymphadenectomy time in group 1 and 2 were 55 min (IQR = 23) and 102.5 min (IQR = 49), respectively. Median operation time and cervical operation time were significantly lower in group 1 (p < 0.05).

The proposed empirical model includes as additional explanatory variables the foreign direct investment (FDI) and the electricity consumption aimed to increase the relevance of the results, correcting the lack of studies that have previously analyzed the EKC for the case of Algeria. Through the ARDL econometric approach, we confirm an N-shaped EKC between the per capita economic growth and ecological footprint in Algeria, reinforcing these results using the FMOLS and DOLS techniques. In the long run, the empirical results confirmed that the N-shaped EKC in Algeria is valid; electricity consumption and foreign direct investment directly impact ecological footprint. Even though the main objective of this study is to assess the N-shaped EKC, the novelty of the paper is the analysis of the interaction between FDI and electricity consumption. The empirical evidence reveals that FDI contributes to reducing the negative impact of fossil sources in the energy mix in Algeria through the transition to a cleaner energy mix pattern. In the final step of our analysis, we explore the causal nexus among variables by applying the Toda Yamamoto non-causality test. The Toda Yamamoto non-causality test reveals a unidirectional causality between economic growth and ecological footprint; one-run relationship flows from electricity consumption to ecological footprint, and economic growth leads to cause foreign-direct investment. These empirical results evidence the necessity of establishing suitable policies after the gold decade of the FDI in Algeria, being required to advance in this line to come back to ascending levels of FDI after the financial crisis of 2008 and the current COVID-19 crisis. In this sense, policymakers should consider the advantages of FDI for promoting clean foreign investment, necessary for reaching a transition to sustainable development in Algeria. In this sense, this study proposes a battery of environmental strategies to achieve this objective and sustainable growth in the country. Thus, policy implications and directions for future research are suggested.

This study aimed to describe the level of awareness and preparedness of hospital HCWs at the time of the first wave. METHODS: This multinational, multicenter, cross-sectional survey was conducted among hospital HCWs from February to May 2020. We used a hierarchical logistic regression multivariate analysis to adjust the influence of variables based on awareness and preparedness. We then used association rule mining to identify relationships between HCW confidence in handling suspected COVID-19 patients and prior COVID-19 case-management training. RESULTS: We surveyed 24,653 HCWs from 371 hospitals across 57 countries and received 17,302 responses from 70.2% HCWs overall. The median COVID-19 preparedness score was 11.0 (interquartile range [IQR] = 6.0C14.0) and the median awareness score was 29.6 (IQR = 26.6C32.6). HCWs at COVID-19 designated facilities with previous outbreak experience, or HCWs who were trained for dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, had significantly higher levels of preparedness and awareness (p<0.001). Association rule mining suggests that nurses and doctors who had a great-extent-of-confidence in handling suspected COVID-19 patients had participated in COVID-19 training courses. Male participants (mean difference = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.22, 0.46; p<0.001) and nurses (mean difference = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.53, 0.81; p<0.001) had higher preparedness scores compared to women participants and doctors. INTERPRETATION: There was an unsurprising high level of awareness and preparedness among HCWs who participated in COVID-19 training courses. However, disparity existed along the lines of gender and type of HCW. It is unknown whether the difference in COVID-19 preparedness that we detected early in the pandemic may have translated into disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 burden of disease by gender or HCW type.","output":"Awareness and preparedness of healthcare workers against the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey across 57 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pneumonia is responsible for the latest pandemics. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan is known to be an essential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19. In this research, the relationship between on-admission chest CT severity score, capillary blood oxygen saturation level, and laboratory inflammatory markers results in patients with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia was investigated. METHODS: This prospective analytical study was conducted in COVID-19 isolation unit, Zagazig University Hospitals, from 1st to end of April 2021. Adult patients with COVID-19 infection were included. Chest CT scan was performed for all patients, and CT severity score was computed. The initial capillary oxygen saturation was also assessed at the time of admission. The information was gathered and analyzed. RESULTS: A total number of 305 COVID-19 patients were involved in the study with the following data: age, gender, presence of co morbidities, capillary blood oxygen saturation, laboratory tests including absolute lymphocytic count, CRP, D-dimer and ferritin levels, as well as chest CT severity score. Based on chest CT severity score, we found that 110 cases (36.1%) were mild, 163 cases (53.4%) were moderate, and 32 cases (10.5%) were severe, with significant male predominance among moderate and severe cases. The initial measurements of blood oxygen saturation values revealed that mean blood oxygen saturation was 95.6% among mild to moderate cases and 85.4% among severe cases. Furthermore, there was a high statistically significant negative correlation between chest CT severity score and absolute lymphocytic count of studied cases, while there was a statistically significant positive correlation with D-dimer, CRP and ferritin levels. CONCLUSIONS: CT scans can help clinicians in developing a management strategy and serve as a predictor of illness severity and possible outcomes. In individuals with COVID-19 infection, the severity of a chest CT scan is positively correlated to inflammatory markers and oxygen demand.","output":"Correlation between chest CT severity scoring system with oxygen saturation and laboratory inflammatory markers in adult patients with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As scientists consider SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design, we discuss problems that may be encountered and how to tackle them by what we term \\"rational vaccine design.\\" We further discuss approaches to pan-coronavirus vaccines.

Assessing facilitators and barriers to successful vaccination initiatives should be carefully considered and addressed by subsequent actions. The COVID-19 vaccination campaigns as part of disease prevention programs could be embedded in the core of theories for a more systematic approach to enhance vaccine acceptance among people. For effective implementation of public health programs, it is imperative to understand human health behaviours and to have sufficient knowledge about cultural and environmental influences. Sufficient and satisfactory COVID-19 vaccine uptake is not only challenged by the availability of vaccines or their distribution, but also by cultural and social norms in the community as well as the complexity of human behaviours.

METHOD: This was a cohort study including patients admitted for HFNO because of respiratory failure despite oxygen therapy through a facial mask. Care was standardized, with systematic use of steroids and prevention or treatment of thromboembolic complications, and tocilizumab when deemed useful. HFNO failure was defined by the requirement for mechanical ventilation and/or death. RESULTS: In August 2021, among 1397 patients with COVID-19 admitted in the emergency department, 110 (7.8%) received HFNO (mean age 55 years, sex-ratio M/F 1.4). Thirteen patients (12%) had received a steroid treatment before hospital admission. At least one comorbid condition was observed in 57% of the patients. Mean duration of the disease at admission was 8.8 days and mean respiratory rate was 34/min. A CT scan was performed for 101 patients (92%), among whom 13 had a pulmonary embolism. All patients received a steroid treatment, and tocilizumab was prescribed in 79 cases (72%). Failure of HFNO was observed in 54 cases (49%); the only risk factor was the absence of tocilizumab administration: AOR [IC95%] 3.50 [1.40-8.69]. We observed a trend toward failure with steroid use before hospital admission: AOR 3.83 [0.96-16.66].

It has had a wide-ranging impact on healthcare provision, with a cessation of elective operating. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on a tertiary referral centre for spinal surgery in England. Methods An 82-day study period from 20th March 2020 to 10th June 2020 was used, and all spinal surgical patients were followed up prospectively, comparing patients from the same date range in 2019. We assessed rate of COVID transmission, 30-day mortality rates, complication rates and length of hospital stay in a large tertiary Teaching hospital in England. Results Seventy-eight patients were operated on during the COVID-19 pandemic period, with a 30-day mortality rate of 4.2%. Two of these deaths were attributable to COVID-19 (2.56%). The mean length of stay was 10.8 days. Neither the 30-day mortality rate or the length of stay was statistically significant compared to the 2019 control period. Five patients (6.4%) tested positive for COVID-19, all were negative at time of surgical intervention. Our complication rate was 10.3% during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Conclusions The number of operative cases performed during the COVID-19 pandemic fell by one-third compared to the same period in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic did not cause a significant increase in 30-day mortality rate, length of stay, or complication rates. Further studies with larger patient numbers and longer-term outcomes will be needed to fully assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spinal surgery.","output":"Spinal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: the experience in a tertiary referral centre."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the fundamental steps of virus life cycles including virusChost interactions is essential for the design of effective antiviral strategies.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using a secondary data analysis approach. SETTING: Data were from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study conducted in the community. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sampling was used. PAwLTPD who participated in year 2 of the longitudinal cohort study were included. Inclusion criteria were age 45-65 years, English speaking, and self-reported onset of a physical disability at least 5 years prior to study recruitment. Two participants completed the survey using both phone and web formats and were thus excluded; 387 participants (N=387) were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Choice of survey format and demographics (age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital status, living arrangement, socioeconomic status) were collected in addition to self-rated physical health. RESULTS: Participants were on average 58.25.6 years old. A total of 33% were male, and 62% were White. Approximately 40% of participants completed phone surveys. The phone survey group was significantly older (t=?4.76, P<.001) and had lower education (U=11133, z=?6.65, P<.001) and lower self-rated physical health (U=15420, z=?2.38, P=.017) than the web survey group. Participants who were White ((2)=60.69; df=1; P<.001; odds ratio [OR], 0.18) or were in a long-term relationship were less likely to choose phone surveys ((2)=42.20; df=1; P<.001; OR, 0.21). Those who earned $10,008 or less annually ((2)=53.90; df=1; P<.001; OR, 5.22) or who lived alone ((2)=36.26; df=1; P<.001; OR, 3.64) were more likely to choose phone surveys. Participants with paid work ((2)=16.81, df=1, P<.001) tended to select web-based surveys, while those on disability leave ((2)=9.61, df=1, P<.01) were more likely to choose phone surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographics are associated with survey format choice in PAwLTPD. Findings largely support the existing understanding of digital literacy but also provide insight into the potential occurrence of sampling bias when multiple survey format options are not offered.

New laser technologies could be useful in reducing the amount of aerosols, but there is a lack of scientific research on this topic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study to analyze the amount of aerosols produced after class I cavity preparation using high-speed air turbine (group 1) and Er,Cr:YSGG laser with two different parameters (groups 2 and 3). Fluorescein dye was incorporated into the coolant reservoir in order to visualize the production of aerosols during each procedure. Tooth preparation was performed in a typodont with human lower molar tooth under rubber dam isolation. The procedure was carried out in a transparent plastic box to avoid aerosols dispersion. Sixteen grade I cellulose filter discs were distributed along the surfaces of the box. The area contaminated with aerosols in the filters was measured using ultraviolet illumination. RESULTS: In group 1, the contaminated surface area covered with fluorescein dye reached 77.3% (1349 cm2) of the total; in group 2 (laser with 80% water) we observed 7.3% (128 cm2) and in group 3 (laser with 40% water) it was 3.8% (68 cm2). The reduction in water parameter from 80% to 40% coincided with 48% reduction of the contaminated area on the filter discs. Focusing on the surfaces of the box, we noted that the mean contamination on the left side was more than on the right side in all three experimental groups. In group 1 using air turbine, we measured a mean of 102.6[7.5 SD]cm2 on the left side, compared to 70.6[32.3 SD]cm2 on the right side. In laser groups 2 and 3, a mean of 12.8[14.9 SD]cm2 and 6.8 [5.7SD]cm2, respectively, was described on the left surface versus 0 cm2 of surface contamination on the right surface. CONCLUSIONS: The contaminated area during the procedure of class I cavity preparation, is reduced by 70% using Er,Cr:YSGG laser compared to high-speed turbine. A slightly higher contamination was observed between laser groups with 80% versus 40% water.

Clinical medicine traditionally being conservative has seen a limited uptake of these new technologies which has seen widespread adoption in other industries. But due to disruptive nature of the pandemic, clinical medicine has also been forced to adapt and capitalize on these new technologies. Chief amongst them is the utilization of extended reality (XR) technologies, which is an umbrella term that encompasses a spectrum of virtual reality (VR) and Augmented reality (AR) devices that blend the physical world with the digital world. VR technologies immerses users in 3D worlds while AR technologies project 3D objects into the users physical environment while permitting full visibility of the users surroundings. XR technologies can assist in infection control measures by revolutionizing clinical ward rounds. Patients key blood results and vitals can be projected above each patient enhancing the speed of clinical ward rounds for large number of patients in community isolation facilities. Examination findings can then be dictated and automatically recorded. XR technologies can also assist clinicians during the planning and execution of highly infective/risky procedures. XR can help proceduralists simulate the procedure, limiting timing spent during the actual procedure. While XR guided robots can actually perform the high risk and delicate procedures, limiting infection risk for the proceduralist. XR technologies can overcome the disruption caused clinical education due to Covid-19 pandemic infection control measures. They can help simulate patient interaction/ clinical scenarios for medical students while keeping both patient and medical students safe from infection. Covid-19 has also generated much psychosocial distress due to the isolation stemming from infection control. XR technologies can be used to help bridge the psychosocial isolation by connecting patients with their family members, hobbies or home towns. This can be especially therapeutic when counselling patients that suffer pandemic related depression/anxiety. Particularly in palliative patients XR technologies can help simulate experiences that would be physically impossible for them. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Use of Extended Reality in Medicine During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has overwhelmed health systems worldwide. It is important to identify severe cases as early as possible, such that resources can be mobilized and treatment can be escalated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a machine learning approach for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 based on clinical and imaging data. METHODS: Clinical dataincluding demographics, signs, symptoms, comorbidities, and blood test resultsand chest computed tomography scans of 346 patients from 2 hospitals in the Hubei Province, China, were used to develop machine learning models for automated severity assessment in diagnosed COVID-19 cases. We compared the predictive power of the clinical and imaging data from multiple machine learning models and further explored the use of four oversampling methods to address the imbalanced classification issue. Features with the highest predictive power were identified using the Shapley Additive Explanations framework. RESULTS: Imaging features had the strongest impact on the model output, while a combination of clinical and imaging features yielded the best performance overall. The identified predictive features were consistent with those reported previously. Although oversampling yielded mixed results, it achieved the best model performance in our study. Logistic regression models differentiating between mild and severe cases achieved the best performance for clinical features (area under the curve [AUC] 0.848; sensitivity 0.455; specificity 0.906), imaging features (AUC 0.926; sensitivity 0.818; specificity 0.901), and a combination of clinical and imaging features (AUC 0.950; sensitivity 0.764; specificity 0.919). The synthetic minority oversampling method further improved the performance of the model using combined features (AUC 0.960; sensitivity 0.845; specificity 0.929).

The prognosis is poor if early recanalization is not achieved. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of self-expanding retrievable stents in the endovascular treatment of acute basilar artery occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients with acute basilar artery occlusion were treated with Solitaire FR or Revive SE devices between December 2009 and May 2012. Additional treatment included intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis (21/24) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/permanent stent placement (7/24). Recanalization was assessed by means of the TICI score. Clinical outcome was determined at discharge (NIHSS), and at 3 months (mRS). RESULTS Median NIHSS score on admission was 24; median duration of symptoms was 254 minutes. Successful recanalization (TICI 2b +3) by thrombectomy only was achieved in 18 patients (75%). Intracranial stent deployment after thrombectomy caused by underlying atherosclerotic stenosis was performed in 7 patients. If these patients with intracranial stent placement are included, successful recanalization was achieved in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%). NIHSS improvement 10 points was reached in 54% of patients (n = 13/24). Mortality during the first 3 months was 29% (7/24). After 3 months, 8 patients (33%) had a favorable clinical outcome (mRS 0-2).

However, the viral spike protein also has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource and identified candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton, and cell signaling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates and may interact with the 2 subunit of the endocytosis-associated AP2 adaptor complex, as well as with various protein domains (namely, I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB, and SH2) found in human signaling and regulatory proteins. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, such as in response to tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs are present in the tails of integrin 3 and ACE2, suggesting that these proteins could directly recruit autophagy components. Our findings identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that could uncover mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and replication against which it may be possible to develop host-directed therapies that dampen viral infection and disease progression.

We aimed to better understand familial recurrence patterns. METHODS: An international, multicentre, retrospective cohort study was conducted in 29 tertiary hospitals in 6 countries between 1990 and 2018, entailing investigation of 1043 unrelated ccTGA probands. RESULTS: Laterality defects and atrioventricular block at diagnosis were observed in 29.9% and 9.3%, respectively. ccTGA was associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia in 11 patients. Parental consanguinity was noted in 3.4% cases. A congenital heart defect was diagnosed in 81 relatives from 69 families, 58% of them being first-degree relatives, including 28 siblings. The most prevalent defects in relatives were dextro-transposition of the great arteries (28.4%), laterality defects (13.6%), and ccTGA (11.1%); 36 new familial clusters were described, including 8 pedigrees with concordant familial aggregation of ccTGA, 19 pedigrees with familial co-segregation of ccTGA and dextro-transposition of the great arteries, and 9 familial co-segregation of ccTGA and laterality defects. In one family co-segregation of ccTGA, dextro-transposition of the great arteries and heterotaxy syndrome in 3 distinct relatives was found. In another family, twins both displayed ccTGA and primary ciliary dyskinesia. CONCLUSIONS: ccTGA is not always a sporadic congenital heart defect.

However, ability to maintain contact with family members and friends (O.R = 0.43 (0.22C0.84), p value = 0.013), and having enough personal protective equipment and safety tools at work place (O.R = 0.44 (0.23C0.84), p value = 0.012) were protective against severe PD. having excessive worry about getting infected with COVID-19, conflicts within a home, segregation by friends or community, longer working hours or involvement in management of suspected or confirmed case were not associated with severe PD. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the need to take into consideration the mental wellbeing of health workers during this COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas hospital workers continue to provide their services during the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown, it is important that they maintain contact with social support networks and be provided with counselling and mental health and psychosocial services in order to optimise their mental health during this pandemic.","output":"Psychological distress and associated factors among hospital workers in Uganda during the COVID-19 lockdown C A multicentre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific and technological developments bring new requirements for university education and, particularly, the training of education professionals. There is a regular need to update curricula to integrate market trends and educational approaches. It is necessary to know future trends in education and teaching programs. Our research in a higher education institution in Ecuador focused on providing perspectives on the future of educational programs by analyzing trends in educational programs designs, students and professors needs for innovative education. We used the descriptive/exploratory case study method, employing quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, focus groups and benchmarking as instruments. The surveys were applied to 337 current students, 384 potential students and 313 graduates of Educational Sciences. We conducted interviews with 20 experts from Mexico, Spain, Colombia and Ecuador. We held focus groups with 32 education professionals, including rectors, principals, educational specialists and primary, secondary and university teachers. Benchmarking was used in our analysis of ten universities. The results focused on five elements that were units of analysis (1) characteristics of education programs, (2) student requirements, (3) required educational modalities, (4) trends in education and (5) future of education programs.

Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), the main character Arthur Morgan contracts tuberculosis. The videogame is set in the United States in 1899, a time when many died from the respiratory infection. The videogame does not provide a cure for the disease, nor does it show when the contagion happens. It is presented as the consequence of an invisible action. Combining auto-ethnographic analysis with (para-)textual readings, in this article, I articulate my engagement with the game and with YouTube videos in which players claim to have identified a strategy to save Arthur. I argue that these paratextual practices address, without fully resolving, an effective response that originates from an unresolved reading of the videogame (Consalvo, 2016;Genette, 1987). The videos on Arthur?s sickness remediate (in the double sense of restoring upon and healing) players? agency (Bolter and Grusin, 1999). I argue that this imagination of a restoration of the player?s agency insists on two levels: a narrative level, interpreted as a navigable database of events, and on the environment, seen as a ?gamespace? of resources and non-player characters to exploit or keep at distance (Jennings, 2019;Stang, 2019;Anikina, 2020;Wark 2007). The duration of the auto-ethnography overlaps with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article concludes by exploring some recent mediations of the virus, observing how they restore a view of human agency that runs parallel to that which players of Red Dead Redemption 2 have articulated in a much more marginal context. The case studies, although diverse in nature, gravity and scale, shed light on the variety of contexts in which agency is negotiated, on the affective potential of these negotiations, and on the pervasiveness of white and able-bodied normativity in contemporary digital culture.","output":"There is no cure: Paratexts as remediations of agency in Red Dead Redemption 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses new and unprecedented challenges to the interpretation of mental health law.

The imaging mechanism of NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and the complexity of human brain tissues cause the brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images to present varying degrees of noise, weak boundaries, and artifacts. Hence, improvements are made over the fuzzy clustering algorithm. A brain image processing and brain disease diagnosis prediction model is designed based on improved fuzzy clustering and HPU-Net (Hybrid Pyramid U-Net Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation) to ensure the model safety performance. Brain MRI images collected from a Hospital, are employed in simulation experiments to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), FCM (Fuzzy C-Means), LDCFCM (Local Density Clustering Fuzzy C-Means), and AFCM (Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means) are included in simulation experiments for performance comparison. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has more nodes, lower energy consumption, and more stable changes than other models under the same conditions. Regarding the overall network performance, the proposed algorithm can complete the data transmission tasks the fastest, basically maintaining at about 4.5 s on average, which performs remarkably better than other models. A further prediction performance analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm provides the highest prediction accuracy for the Whole Tumor under DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficient), reaching 0.936. Besides, its Jaccard coefficient is 0.845, proving its superior segmentation accuracy over other models. In a word, the proposed algorithm can provide higher accuracy, a more apparent denoising effect, and the best segmentation and recognition effect than other models while ensuring energy consumption. The results can provide an experimental basis for the feature recognition and predictive diagnosis of brain images.","output":"Fuzzy System Based Medical Image Processing for Brain Disease Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PTU-25 Table 1 2018 2019 2020 Total FBI Referral 10 20 31 Total DFBI 2 (20%) 4 (20%) 17 (55%) Number of patients 2 2 9 Objects Batteries Toothbrush, coins Bra wire, batteries, pen, glasses, paperclip, screws, toothbrush, blades Discussion2020 demonstrated a marked increase in OGD for FBI, of which 55% were DFBI compared with 20% in preceding years.

Using a radioactive assay, we present evidence of mono-ADPR (MAR) hydrolase activity. In silico analysis presents further evidence on recognition of the ADPR modification for hydrolysis. Mutational analysis of residues within the binding pocket resulted in diminished enzymatic activity and binding affinity.

METHOD Patients with upper respiratory tract infection aged 16 years or over, who were not treated with antibiotics and who had been ill for no more than 3 days, were recruited. Microbiological examinations were undertaken, together with measurements of CRP, ESR and recording of symptoms daily during the first week of illness and on days 10, 14 and 21. RESULTS An aetiological agent was established in 23 of the 41 included subjects. These were: influenza A, influenza B, rhinovirus, and other agents. Among the 15 patients examined on both the second and the third day of illness, the median CRP value increased from 7-10 mg/l, and the mean value was from 19-24 mg/l between day 2 and day 3. Peak CRP values were reached on days 2 to 4. Higher CRP values were found in those infected with influenza A and B than in the other subjects (P <0.001). A CRP value >10 mg/l was found in 26 subjects during the first 7 days, compared to five subjects after 1 week. Evidence of a secondary infection with group A streptococci was found in two of these five subjects. The development of the symptoms of sore throat, fatigue, clamminess, and pain from muscles and joints followed a similar course as the CRP response, while stuffy nose, cough, sputum production, and dyspnoea tended to persist after the CRP values had approached the normal range. CONCLUSION A moderately elevated CRP value (10-60 mg/l) is a common finding in viral upper respiratory tract infection, with a peak during days 2-4 of illness. Moderately elevated CRP values cannot support a diagnosis of bacterial infection when the illness has lasted less than 7 days, but may indicate a complication of viral infection after a week.","output":"The course of C-reactive protein response in untreated upper respiratory tract infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As novel SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, it is critical that their potential to cause severe disease and evade vaccine-induced immunity is rapidly assessed in humans and studied in animal models. In early January 2021, a novel variant of concern (VOC) designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and shown to enhance infectivity in vitro and decrease antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both strains exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most body weight loss among all 3 lineages. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three strains. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the upper respiratory tract (URT) but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and gamma (P.1) dramatically outcompete alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) and zeta (P.2) in the lungs. In the URT gamma, and epsilon dominate, but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427, B.1.429 and ancestral B.1 (614G) variants in hamsters. These results demonstrate enhanced virulence and high relative fitness of the epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) variant in Syrian hamsters compared to an ancestral B.1 (614G) strain.","output":"The B.1.427/1.429 (epsilon) SARS-CoV-2 variants are more virulent than ancestral B.1 (614G) in Syrian hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food systems are significant sources of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to develop a sensitive and simple tool to assess the risk of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and thus select which patients would require a chest imaging study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a cohort of individuals with suspected COVID-19 evaluated in a public academic healthcare center in Buenos Aires city. All adult patients with positive RT-PCR assay for SARS-COV2 between April 24 and May 19 of 2020 were included in the study. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of compatible signs and symptoms with imaging confirmation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed. A risk indicator score was developed. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients were included, 71 (48%) received the diagnosis of pneumonia. The final clinical model included four variables: age >- 40 years, cough, absence of sore throat, and respiratory rate >- 22. To create the score, we assigned values to the variables according to their ORs: 2 points for respiratory rate >- 22 and 1 point to the other variables. The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.80 (CI 95% 0.73-0.86). A cutoff value of 2 showed a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 43.24%.

In perioperative care, the healthcare delivery system can use biosensors to remotely supervise patients who would otherwise be admitted to a hospital. This novel technology has gained a foothold in healthcare with significant acceleration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have attempted to narrate, or systematically analyze, the process of their implementation. We performed an observational study of biosensor implementation. The data accuracy provided by the commercially available biosensors was compared to those offered by standard clinical monitoring on patients admitted to the intensive care unit/perioperative unit. Surveys were also conducted to examine the acceptance of technology by patients and medical staff. We demonstrated a significant difference in vital signs between sensors and standard monitoring which was very dependent on the measured variables. Sensors seemed to integrate into the workflow relatively quickly, with almost no reported problems. The acceptance of the biosensors was high by patients and slightly less by nurses directly involved in the patients care. The staff forecast a broad implementation of biosensors in approximately three to five years, yet are eager to learn more about them. Reliability considerations proved particularly troublesome in our implementation trial. Careful evaluation of sensor readiness is most likely necessary prior to system-wide implementation by each hospital to assess for data accuracy and acceptance by the staff.","output":"Remote Monitoring of Critically-Ill Post-Surgical Patients: Lessons from a Biosensor Implementation Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The crystal structure of a conserved domain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion to 1.4 ? resolution.

Beyond the gastrointestinal tract, H2R is expressed by multiple immune cells, yet little is known about the immunomodulatory effects of such treatment. Clinical reports have associated H2R blockade with leukopenia, neutropenia, and myelosuppression, and has been shown to provide clinical benefit in certain cancer settings. To systematically assess effects of H2R blockade on key immune parameters, a single-center, single-arm clinical study was conducted in 29 healthy subjects. Subjects received daily high dose ranitidine for 6 weeks. Peripheral blood immunophenotyping and mediator analysis were performed at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks into treatment, and 12 weeks after treatment cessation. Ranitidine was well-tolerated, and no drug related adverse events were observed. Ranitidine had no effect on number of neutrophils, basophils or eosinophils. However, ranitidine decreased numbers of B cells and IL-2R (CD25) expressing T cells that remained lower even after treatment cessation. Reduced serum levels of IL-2 were also observed and remained low after treatment. These observations highlight a previously unrecognised immunomodulatory sustained impact of H2R blockade.

We developed and studied the feasibility of using a mobile App to collect daily data on COVID-19 symptoms and peoples movements. METHODS: We used an open source software KoBo Toolbox to develop the App and installed it on low cost smart mobile phones. We named this App Wetaase (protect yourself). The App was tested on 30 selected households from 3 densely populated areas of Kampala, Uganda, and followed them for 3 months. One trained member per household captured the data in the App for each enrolled member and uploaded it to a virtual server on a daily basis. The App is embedded with an algorithm that flags participants who report fever and any other COVID-19 related symptom. RESULTS: A total of 101 participants were enrolled; 61% female; median age 23 (interquartile range (IQR): 17C36) years. Usage of the App was 78% (95% confidence interval (CI): 77.0%C78.8%). It increased from 40% on day 1 to a peak of 81% on day 45 and then declined to 59% on day 90. Usage of the App did not significantly vary by site, sex or age. Only 57/6617 (0.86%) records included a report of at least one of the 17 listed COVID-19 related symptoms. The most reported symptom was flu/runny nose (21%) followed by sneezing (15%), with the rest ranging between 2% and 7%.

To that end, the different transmission routes, and their role in determining the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic are analyzed in this work. Probability of infection caused by inhaling virus-laden droplets (initial, ejection diameters between $0.5-750\\\\mu m$) and the corresponding desiccated nuclei that mostly encapsulate the virions post droplet evaporation, are individually calculated. At typical, air-conditioned yet quiescent indoor space, for average viral loading, cough droplets of initial diameter between $10-50 \\\\mu m$ have the highest infection probability. However, by the time they are inhaled, the diameters reduce to about $1/6^{th}$ of their initial diameters. While the initially near unity infection probability due to droplets rapidly decays within the first $25s$, the small yet persistent infection probability of desiccated nuclei decays appreciably only by $\\\\mathcal{O} (1000s)$, assuming the virus sustains equally well within the dried droplet nuclei as in the droplets. Combined with molecular collision theory adapted to calculate frequency of contact between the susceptible population and the droplet/nuclei cloud, infection rate constants are derived ab-initio, leading to a SEIR model applicable for any respiratory event - vector combination. Viral load, minimum infectious dose, sensitivity of the virus half-life to the phase of its vector and dilution of the respiratory jet/puff by the entraining air are shown to mechanistically determine specific physical modes of transmission and variation in the basic reproduction number $\\\\mathcal{R}_0$, from first principle calculations.","output":"Analyzing the dominant SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes towards an ab-initio SEIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychological resources, such as defense mechanism and mindfulness practice, can mediate the individual reaction to traumatic experiences as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.

CONCLUSION: We provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains. Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.

While the global spotlight is currently focused on combating this pandemic through means ranging from finding a treatment among existing therapeutic agents to inventing a vaccine that can aid in halting the further loss of life. AIM: To collect all systematic reviews and meta-analyses published related to COVID-19 to better identify available evidence, highlight gaps in knowledge, and elucidate further meta-analyses and umbrella reviews that are yet to be performed. METHODS: We explored studies based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the key-terms, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS virus, coronavirus disease, COVID-19, and SARS coronavirus-2. The included studies were extracted from Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases. The publication timeframe of included studies ranged between January 01, 2020, to October 30, 2020. Studies that were published in languages other than English were not considered for this systematic review. The finalized full-text articles are freely accessible in the public domain. RESULTS: Searching Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases resulted in 1906, 669, and 19 results, respectively, that comprised 2594 studies. 515 duplicates were subsequently removed, leaving 2079 studies. The inclusion criteria were systematic reviews or meta-analyses. 860 results were excluded for being a review article, scope review, rapid review, panel review, or guideline that produced a total of 1219 studies. After screening articles were categorized, the included articles were put into main groups of clinical presentation, epidemiology, screening and diagnosis, severity assessment, special populations, and treatment. Subsequently, there was a second subclassification into the following groups: gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, stroke, thrombosis, anosmia and dysgeusia, ocular manifestations, nephrology, cutaneous manifestations, D-dimer, lymphocyte, anticoagulation, antivirals, convalescent plasma, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, technology, diabetes mellitus, obesity, pregnancy, children, mental health(,) smoking, cancer, and transplant.

Here, we identified the associated factors with surviving of COVID-19 ICU patients based on the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to one of the Corona Centre Hospitals of Iran. Materials and Methods: This cohort study was performed retrospectively from February to June 2020 on 133 COVID-19 patients admitted to 4 intensive care units of Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Demographic, medical, clinical manifestation at admission, laboratory parameters and outcome data were obtained from medical records. Also the SOFA and APACHE II scores were calculated. All data were analyzed using SPSS (version 23, IBM Corp.) software. Results: The median (IQR) age of the patients was 62.0 (54.0-72.0) years in total. RT-PCR of throat swab SARS-CoV-2 in 80 patients (60.2%) was positive. Total mortality rate was 57.9 percent (77 patients). Dyspnea, hypertension and chronic pulmonary diseases were significantly common in non-survivors than survivors (p<0.05). Both SOFA and APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the non-survivors (p<0.05). Also other significant differences were observed in other parameters of the study. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU is generally high. Dyspnea as initial presentation and comorbidity, especially hypertension and pulmonary diseases, may be associated with higher risk of severe disease and consequent mortality rate.

METHODS: Women 18 years with cT1\\\\2/cN0 HER2+, TNBC, or high recurrence risk score (31) HR+ invasive breast cancers who received chemotherapy were identified in the National Cancer Database (2010C2016). Cochran\\\\Armitage and logistic regression examined temporal trends and likelihood of undergoing NACT versus adjuvant chemotherapy based on patient age and molecular subtype. RESULTS: Overall, 96,622 patients met study criteria; 25% received NACT and 75% underwent surgery first, with comparable 5\\\\year estimates of overall survival (0.90, 95% CI 0.892C0.905 vs 0.91, 95% CI 0.907C0.913).

However, due to limited contact, adequate rehabilitation is difficult to provide for quarantined patients. Telerehabilitation technology could be a solution; however, issues specific to COVID-19 should be taken into consideration, such as strict quarantine and respiratory symptoms, as well as accessibility to deal with rapid increases in need due to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and to investigate the feasibility of a telerehabilitation system for patients who are quarantined due to COVID-19 by combining existing commercial devices and computer applications. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team has identified the requirements for a telerehabilitation system for COVID-19 and developed the system to satisfy those requirements. In the subsequent feasibility study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=10; mean age 60 years, SD 18 years) were included. A single session of telerehabilitation consisted of stretching exercises, a 15-minute exercise program, and a video exercise program conducted under real-time guidance by a physical therapist through a video call. The system included a tablet computer, a pulse oximeter, videoconferencing software, and remote control software. The feasibility of the system was evaluated using the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ; 14 items) and an additional questionnaire on the telerehabilitation system (5 items). Each item was rated from \\"1 = strongly disagree\\" to \\"5 = strongly agree.\\" RESULTS: The telerehabilitation system was developed by combining existing devices and applications, including a pulse oximeter and remote control mechanism, to achieve user-friendliness, affordability, and safety, which were determined as the system requirements. In the feasibility study, 9 out of 10 patients were able to use the telerehabilitation system without any on-site help. On the TSQ, the mean score for each item was 4.7 (SD 0.7), and in the additional items regarding telerehabilitation, the mean score for each item was 4.3 (SD 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility of this simple telerehabilitation system in quarantined patients with COVID-19, encouraging further investigation on the merit of the system's use in clinical practice.","output":"An Affordable, User-friendly Telerehabilitation System Assembled Using Existing Technologies for Individuals Isolated With COVID-19: Development and Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania were analyzed by comparing with the reference SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence from Wuhan-Hu-1, China.

Nevertheless, it may be possible to estimate the changes that may have occurred in the past, if we can suitably fit a proper model to daily event-occurrences. We have devised a state-space method for fitting the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. This method detects changes occurring in the spread of the contagion in each country. Furthermore, this method can assess the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number representing the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case.

Concrete knowledge of global and regional bacterial AMR data is crucial for developing informed programs and policies to control bacterial AMR and for prudent use of antibiotics to optimize antibiotic therapy in patients with UTI. This study aimed to provide comprehensive global and regional estimates for the AMR burden of UTI in 2019. Methods: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), including death, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), year lived with disability (YLD), and years of life lost (YLL) for bacterial AMR in UTI for 7 GBD super-regions, 21 regions, 14 pathogens, 13 antibiotic classes, and 66 pathogen-antibiotic combinations in 2019. The estimates were based on two counterfactual scenarios: drug-susceptible infection and no infection. Results: Globally, there were 64.89 thousand deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 45.86C93.35) attributed to and 0.26 million deaths (95% UI: 0.18C0.36) associated with bacterial AMR in UTI in 2019. Among regions, the all-age death rates were higher in southern Latin America, tropical Latin America, and Europe and lower in sub-Saharan Africa. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for more than 50% of deaths attributable to and associated with AMR, and resistance was high among multiple types of antibiotic class, including fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and third-generation cephalosporins. There were 2 pathogen-drug combinations that caused more than 6000 resistance-attributable deaths: third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. Conclusions: AMR in UTI is an unignorable health problem, both for the management of urology disease and for global antibiotic resistance.

METHODS. Anonymized data from the regional psychiatric care register have been obtained and analyzed. The seven GHPWs care for approximately 1.4 million inhabitants and have a total of 119 beds. RESULTS. In the 40-day period (February 21CMarch 31, 2020) after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, compared to a similar 40-day period prior to February 21, and compared to two 40-day periods of 2019, there has been a marked reduction in psychiatric admission rates.

The reduction was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for a group of Other diagnoses, which includes anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc. CONCLUSIONS. Large-scale pandemics can modify voluntary admission rates to psychiatric facilities in the early phases following pandemic onset. We suggest that the reduction in admission rates may be due to fear of hospitals, seen as possible sites of contagion, as well as to a change in thresholds of behavioral problems acting as a trigger for admission requests from family relatives or referrals from treating clinicians.

The Western Ghats is one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots and, like many such areas of high biodiversity, is under significant pressure from anthropogenic landscape change. The current study sought to quantify mammalian species richness using ensemble models of the distributions of a sample of species extant in the Western Ghats and to explore its association with KFDV outbreaks, as well as the modifying effects of deforestation on this association. Species richness was quantified as a composite of individual species' distributions, as derived from ensembles of boosted regression tree, random forest, and generalised additive models. Species richness was further adjusted for the potential biotic constraints of sympatric species. Both species richness and forest loss demonstrated strong positive associations with KFDV outbreaks, however forest loss substantially modified the association between species richness and outbreaks. High species richness was associated with increased KFDV risk but only in areas of low forest loss. In contrast, lower species richness was associated with increased KFDV risk in areas of greater forest loss. This relationship persisted when species richness was adjusted for biotic constraints at the taluk-level. In addition, the taluk-level species abundances of three monkey species (Macaca radiata, Semnopithecus hypoleucus, and Semnopithecus priam) were also associated with outbreaks. These results suggest that increased monitoring of wildlife in areas of significant habitat fragmentation may add considerably to critical knowledge gaps in KFDV epidemiology and infection ecology and should be incorporated into novel One Health surveillance development for the region.

Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477a?N substitution in this RBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant. RESULTS: All 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93 %) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 2018/3960 (51%) patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6 %) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR. DISCUSSION: Our in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in about half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.","output":"Implementation of an in-house real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a huge impact on society and the economy and represents one of the biggest challenges for healthcare systems all over the world.

METHODS: a cross-sectional survey of 333 CHEWs randomly selected from public health facilities using self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaire sought information on the knowledge, attitude and practice of CHEWs towards ADRs reporting. The knowledge and attitude questions were scored and categorized. The association between dependent and independent variables assessed with bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions, and p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: among 333 respondents, 205 (61.6%) had encountered patients with ADRs but only 26 (12.6%) had reported it with yellow forms. About half, 169 (50.8%), and 191 (57.4%) respondents had a positive attitude and inadequate knowledge of ADRs reporting respectively.

In this study, a database containing 2017 flavone analogs was prepared and screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using the molecular docking technique. According to the results, 371 flavone analogs exhibited good potency towards Mpro with docking scores less than -9.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding energy calculations, were performed for the top potent analogs in complex with Mpro.

Main outcome measures Time from Lyme disease diagnosis to consultation for any fatigue-related symptoms or diagnosis and for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox models. Results Average incidence rate for Lyme disease across the UK was 5.18 per 100,000 py between 2000 and 2018, increasing from 2.55 in 2000 to 9.33 in 2018. In total 929 events of any types of fatigue were observed, i.e. an incidence rate of 307.90 per 10,000 py in the Lyme cohort (282 events) and 165.60 in the comparator cohort (647 events). Effect of Lyme disease on any subsequent fatigue varied by index season with highest adjusted HRs in autumn [3.14 (95%CI: 1.92 to 5.13)] and winter [2.23 (1.21 to 4.11)].

Grissom. Return to high altitude after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2021.-With the increasing availability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and the eventual decline in the burden of the disease, it is anticipated that all forms of tourism, including travel to high altitude, will rebound in the near future. Given the physiologic challenges posed by hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude, it is useful to consider whether high-altitude travel will pose risks to those previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, particularly those with persistent symptoms after resolution of their infection. Although no studies have specifically examined this question as of yet, available data on the cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 provide some sense of the problems people may face at high altitude and who warrants evaluation before such endeavors. On average, most individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 have normal or near normal gas exchange, pulmonary function testing, cardiovascular function, and exercise capacity, although a subset of individuals have persistent functional deficits in some or all of these domains when examined up to 5 months after infection. Evaluation is warranted before planned high-altitude travel in individuals with persistent symptoms at least 2 weeks after a positive test or hospital discharge as well as in those who required care in an intensive care unit or suffered from myocarditis or arterial or venous thromboembolism. Depending on the results of this testing, planned high-altitude travel may need to be modified or even deferred pending resolution of the identified abnormalities.

Here, we deployed interactive structure- and pharmacophore-based approaches to design short and stable peptides CCoronavirus Spike neutralizing peptides (CSNPs)C capable of neutralizing all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. After in silico structural stability investigation and free energies perturbation of the isolated peptides and target-bound peptides, nine candidate peptides were evaluated for the biophysical interaction through SPR assay. CSNP1, CSNP2, and Pep1 dose-dependently bind the S1 domain of the prototype Spike, whereas CSNP4 binds both S1 and ACE2. After safety and immunocytochemistry evaluation, peptides were probed for their pan-variant inhibitory effects. CSNP1, CSNP2, and CSNP4 inhibited all VOCs dose-dependently, whereas Pep1 had a moderate effect. CSNP2 and CSNP4 could neutralize the wild-type pseudovirus up to 80 % when treated at 0.5 M. Furthermore, CSNP4 synergize the neutralization effect of monoclonal antibody and CSNP1 in Delta variant pseudovirus assay as they target different regions on the RBD. Thus, we suggest that CSNPs are SARS-CoV-2 pan-variant inhibitory candidates for COVID-19 therapy, which may pave a way for combating the emerging immune-escaping variants.

Anchoring bias is one of the major factors leading to diagnostic error. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the high probability of COVID-19 in febrile patients could be a major cause of anchoring bias leading to diagnostic error. In addition, certain evaluations such as auscultation are difficult to perform on a casual basis due to the increased risk of contact infection, which lead to inadequate assessment of the patients with valvular disease. Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) could be a fatal disease in the emergency department, especially if there is a diagnostic error or delay in diagnosis. It is often reported that diagnosis can be difficult even though there is no treatment other than emergent surgery. The diagnosis of acute MR has become more difficult because coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could affect our daily practice especially in febrile patients. We report a case of a diagnostic delay of a febrile patient because of anchoring bias during the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of acute dyspnea and fever. Based on vital signs and computed tomography of the chest, acute pneumonia due to COVID-19 was suspected. Auscultation was avoided because of facility rule based on concern of contact infection. After admission to the intensive care unit, Doppler echocardiography revealed acute mitral regurgitation, and transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral valve tendon rupture. After confirming the negative result for the polymerase chain reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, mitral valvuloplasty was performed on the third day after admission. The patient was discharged 14 days after admission without complications. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 pandemic, anchoring bias suspecting COVID-19 among febrile patients becomes a strong heuristic factor. A thorough history and physical examination is still important in febrile patients presenting with dyspnea to ensure the correct diagnosis of acute mitral regurgitation.

To provide a quantitative reference for official strategies, predicting the near future trend based on finer spatial resolution data and presumed scenarios are urgently needed. In this study, the first attempted COVID-19 case predicting model based on county-level demographic, environmental, and mobility data was constructed with multiple machine learning techniques and a hybrid framework. Different scenarios were also applied to selected metropolitan counties including New York City, Cook County in Illinois, Los Angeles County in California, and Miami-Dade County in Florida to assess the impact from lockdown, Phase I, and Phase III re-opening. Our results showed that, for selected counties, the mobility decreased substantially after the lockdown but kept increasing with an apparent weekly pattern, and the weekly pattern of mobility and infections implied high infections during the weekend. Meanwhile, our model was successfully built up, and the scenario assessment results indicated that, compared with Phase I re-opening, a 1-week and a 2-week lockdown could reduce 4%-29% and 15%-55% infections, respectively, in the future week, while 2-week Phase III re-opening could increase 16%-80% infections.

We previously found that allergic mice with eosinophil-rich inflammation were protected from severe influenza and discovered specialized antiviral effector functions for eosinophils including promoting cellular immunity during influenza. In this study, we hypothesized that eosinophil responses during the early phase of influenza contribute to host protection. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that eosinophils were rapidly and dynamically regulated upon influenza A virus (IAV) exposure to gain migratory capabilities to traffic to lymphoid organs after pulmonary infection. Eosinophils were capable of neutralizing virus upon contact and combinations of eosinophil granule proteins reduced virus infectivity through hemagglutinin inactivation. Bi-directional crosstalk between IAV-exposed epithelial cells and eosinophils occurred after IAV infection and cross-regulation promoted barrier responses to improve antiviral defenses in airway epithelial cells. Direct interactions between eosinophils and airway epithelial cells after IAV infection prevented virus-induced cytopathology in airway epithelial cells in vitro, and eosinophil recipient IAV-infected mice also maintained normal airway epithelial cell morphology. Our data suggest that eosinophils are important in the early phase of IAV infection providing immediate protection to the epithelial barrier until adaptive immune responses are deployed during influenza.","output":"Eosinophil Responses at the Airway Epithelial Barrier during the Early Phase of Influenza a Virus Infection in C57BL/6 Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article has been withdrawn at the request of the author(s) and/or editor The Publisher apologizes for any inconvenience this may cause The full Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal can be found at https://www elsevier com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal","output":"Withdrawn: COVID-19: A global and continental overview of the second wave and its (relatively) attenuated case fatality ratio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: As the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak occurred, most structured clinical communication training were transformed from in-person to remote seminars.

Geneva Faculty of Medicine 3rd year medical students and tutors involved in clinical communication were asked to respond to an online survey. RESULTS: Eighty-five of 149 students and 15/16 tutors responded. Students highly valued both online seminars and reported little technical difficulty. They felt that tutors were well prepared and actively involved them in experiential learning. Tutors globally reported little technical difficulty and felt rather well prepared to do so online. Although both students and tutors preferred the in-person format, half of them could still consider using an online format in the future outside the pandemic but mentioned it required specific rules.

Mental depression is a common disorder that affects most individuals at one time or another. During depression, there are changes in mood and behavior, accompanied by feelings of defeat, hopelessness, or even suicidal thoughts. Depression has a direct or indirect relation with a number of other diseases including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. In addition, antidepressant drugs have several side effects including sedation, increased weight, indigestion, sexual dysfunction, or a decrease in blood pressure. Stopping medication may cause a relapse of the symptoms of depression and pose a risk of attempted suicide. The pandemic of COVID-19 has affected the mental health of individuals, including patients, individuals contacting patients and medical staff with a number of mental disorders that may adversely affect the immune ability of their bodies. Some of the drugs currently included in the protocols for treating COVID-19 may negatively affect the mental health of patients. Evidence accumulated over the years indicates that serotonin (5HT) deficiencies and norepinephrine (NE) in the brain can lead to mental depression. Drugs that increase levels of NE and 5HT are commonly used in the treatment of depression. The common reason for mood disorders, including mania and bipolar disease are not clearly understood. It is assumed that hyperactivity in specific parts of the brain and excessive activity of neurotransmitters may be involved. Early diagnosis and developing new treatment strategies are essential for the prevention of the severe consequences of depression. In addition, extensive research should be directed towards the investigation of the mental health disturbances occurring during and/or after COVID-19 infection. This may lead to the incorporation of a suitable antidepressant into the current treatment protocols.","output":"Mental depression: Relation to different disease status, newer treatments and its association with COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Capsule endoscopy (CE) has become a first-line noninvasive tool for visualisation of the small bowel (SB) and is being increasingly used for investigation of the colon.

The following suggestions in this curriculum are based on the experience of European CE training courses directors. It is suggested that 12 hours be dedicated for either a small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) or a colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) course with 4 hours for an introductory CCE course delivered in conjunction with SBCE courses. SBCE courses should include state-of-the-art lectures on indications, contraindications, complications, patient management and hardware and software use. Procedural issues require approximately 2 hours. For CCE courses 2.5 hours for theoretical lessons and 3.5 hours for procedural issued are considered appropriate. Hands-on training on reading and interpretation of CE cases using a personal computer (PC) for 1 or 2 delegates is recommended for both SBCE and CCE courses. A total of 6 hours hands-on session- time should be allocated. Cases in a SBCE course should cover SB bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), tumors and variants of normal and cases with various types of polyps covered in CCE courses.

Studying its evolution laws has a certain reference effect for the judgment of urban population aggregations, the division of precise control zoning, and the differentiated management of places during the COVID-19 control period. Based on the data of Baidu heat maps and points of interest (POIs), this paper uses three models of the population density index (PDI), the exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and the geological detector (Geodetector) to analyze the characteristics and the influencing factors of the evolution of population distribution of Xian in three stages which are closed control stage, unsealed control stage and slack control stage. The results show that: in the three stages, 1) The value of the PDI and the range of the PDI change in Xian continue to increase. The single-day PDI curve shows low-high-low changing characteristics from morning to night in and within the third ring zone, and high-low-high in the suburb. And, by comparison, it is found that the social vitality of the first and second ring zone is more strongly impacted because of COVID-19 control measures. 2) The overall population density in Xian is gradually increasing, this is represented by gradual increase of the very high- and the high-density areas, and continuous decrease of the low- and the very low-density areas. And the centripetal distribution of population density, which is high inside the city and low outside the city, is becoming more and more obvious. 3) The spatial distribution of population density represents obvious high-value clusters or low-value clusters in the three stages, ESDA shows a circle structure of inner heat and outer cold, and this trend continues to be reinforced. 4) The intensity order of influencing factors of the 7 types of facilities on population distribution is: residential communities &gt; catering facilities &gt; living service facilities &gt; healthy facilities &gt; commercial facilities &gt; office places &gt; green spaces and squares, and the influencing factor intensities show a continuous increasing or a continuous decreasing process in the three stages.","output":"Research on the Evolution of Population Distribution and Influencing Factors in Xian During the COVID-19 Epidemic Control Period: Based on a Perspective of Multi-source Spatio-Temporal Big Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not available.","output":"Possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the breast milk of COVID-19 affected women patients to their infants: worries and strategies to counter it."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Since breast imaging requires very close contact with patients, a protocol is needed to perform safe daily screening activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy to record studies reported the reproductive number of coronavirus from its inception in December 2019. It includes keywords of coronavirus and its reproductive number, which were combined using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). Based on the included studies, we estimated a summary reproductive number by using the meta-analysis. We used narrative synthesis to explain the results of the studies where the reproductive number was reported, however, were not possible to include in the meta-analysis because of the lack of data (mostly due to confidence interval was not reported). RESULTS: Total of 42 studies included in this review whereas 29 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39-3.44).

Our sub-group analysis was found the significant variations of reproductive number across the country for which it was estimated, method and model that were used to estimate the reproductive number, number of case that was considered to estimate the reproductive number, and the type of reproductive number that was estimated. The highest reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.99) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 3.56, 95% CI, 1.62-7.82).

Through discussion they explored the reasons behind the lack of diversity in their daily diets and identified the social, economic and cultural barriers to food intake in the context of their own poverty. They undertook collective exercises in nutrition sensitive agricultural planning. The transformative behaviour of the CHFs was captured through observation, interviews and focus group discussion with a set of qualitative indicators. RESULTS: The methodology of dialogue as a pedagogic tool generated a discussion about food security among the community. CHFs identified key messages and shared them with fellow villagers in imaginative ways. The process of critical reflection and analysis helped understand gender disparities, the bottlenecks in food production, brought in life style changes to improve food intake and created a demand for technical training for improving agricultural productivity. Thirty eight had started a nutri-garden and several took on leadership roles on other issues of importance besides food security.

There is great optimism that the application of artificial intelligence (AI) can provide substantial improvements in all areas of healthcare from diagnostics to treatment. It is generally believed that AI tools will facilitate and enhance human work and not replace the work of physicians and other healthcare staff as such. AI is ready to support healthcare personnel with a variety of tasks from administrative workflow to clinical documentation and patient outreach as well as specialized support such as in image analysis, medical device automation, and patient monitoring. In this chapter, some of the major applications of AI in healthcare will be discussed covering both the applications that are directly associated with healthcare and those in the healthcare value chain such as drug development and ambient assisted living.","output":"The rise of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an interesting case of ureteric stent encrustation in a 35-year-old male who was lost to follow up for 8 months during the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, during the COVID pandemic, obtaining oral swabs by clinical staff was deemed an unacceptable COVID transmission risk and was discontinued in our clinic. To circumvent this obstacle to diagnosis, clinic staff developed a workaround of obtaining patient collected pharyngeal swabs for STI testing. This abstract reviews the results of this pilot intervention. METHODS: Patients presenting to an urban youth family planning/STI clinic who desired STI testing and ever engaged in oral sex were offered pharyngeal testing for chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (GC). Patients were instructed on how to obtain an oral sample, and subsequently sent outside of the clinic to obtain their individual sample. Chart review was conducted by clinic staff of a two month period during which this protocol was in place, and the following variables were collected: gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and STD testing results by anatomic site. Simple descriptive statistical analysis were used. RESULTS: 146 patients received a GC/CT test from > 1 anatomical site, with 34 patients having > 1 positive result. All pharyngeal samples were self-collected. Four patients were positive for GC/CT from throat samples only (12% of positive tests). All were biologically female, including one transgender FTM. Sexual orientation was split evenly between bisexual and heterosexual. Reported race/ethnicity included two African-American, one white, and one Filipino. For comparison, of the overall subsample of patients with positive GC/CT results, patients identified as 53% female, 44% male, and 3% FTM; 74% straight, 15% bisexual, 9% gay, and 3% did not disclose; 29% white, 50% African-American, 21% unknown as other; and 11% Hispanic. Twelve patients were positive for GC/CT from the throat and either rectum and/or urine/vagina/endocervix (35% of positive tests). CONCLUSION: Our experience demonstrates that obstacles created by the COVID crisis can be circumvented with creative strategies. We were able to pick up 12% and 35% of total infections by self-collected pharyngeal swabs in throat only and throat plus other sites, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual RE approach that does not require any human annotation in a target language or any cross-lingual resources. Building upon unsupervised cross-lingual representation learning frameworks, we develop several deep Transformer based RE models with a novel encoding scheme that can effectively encode both entity location and entity type information. Our RE models, when trained with English data, outperform several deep neural network based English RE models. More importantly, our models can be applied to perform zero-shot cross-lingual RE, achieving the state-of-the-art cross-lingual RE performance on two datasets (68-89% of the accuracy of the supervised target-language RE model). The high cross-lingual transfer efficiency without requiring additional training data or cross-lingual resources shows that our RE models are especially useful for low-resource languages.","output":"Cross-Lingual Relation Extraction with Transformers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Involving the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the assessment of their disease may increase their adherence to treatment, improve the disease outcomes and facilitate the application of telehealth. We previously reported an excellent concordance between the Disease Activity Score (DAS-28) performed by physicians and patients at the baseline visit of this prospective study (1). Objectives: To evaluate the persistence of the concordance between the physician' and the patient's assessment of disease activity in RA using DAS-28 after one year. Methods: At the baseline visit, patients with RA from 7 Middle Eastern Arab Countries (MEAC) were briefed about DAS-28 by their rheumatologist during a routine consultation and given smartphone access to a video in Arabic language explaining the performance of DAS-28. At 3, 6 and 12 months ( 3 months), the patients were asked to self-report DAS-28, blinded to the physician's assessment. Concordance between the continuous DAS-28 at each visit was calculated using paired t-test numerically and the Bland-Altman method graphically. Agreement between physician-and patient-DAS categories (remission, low-, moderate-and high disease activity) was calculated at each visit using weighted kappa for category comparison. Weighted kappa of the different agreements were compared over time using their respective confidence intervals (CIs). Predictive factors of positive concordance between physician and patient-DAS were identified using binary logistic regression. Results: The study included 428 patients over a period of three years (2018 to 2020). The mean age of participants was 49.8 years, 82.5% were females, 44.3% had a university degree and the mean disease duration was 11.4 years. At baseline, the average patient-DAS was higher (4.06 (1.52)) than the physician-DAS (3.97 (1.52)). The mean difference was -0.09 [95%CI -0.14;-0.04] and most of the pairs were within the limit of agreement in the Bland-Altman graph, indicating a good concordance, particularly in cases of remission. During the study follow-up, 299 patients consulted for visit 2 (69.9% of the total population), 232 for visit 3 (54.2%) and 199 for visit 4 (46.5%). The weighted kappa was 0.80 [95%CI 0.76;0.85] at visit 1 and 0.79 [95%CI 0.72;0.88] at visit 4 (Figure 1 showing kappa for DAS-28, CDAI and SDAI as well). A minor numerical decrease in kappa was observed over time;however, the CIs were overlapping over the four visits and the agreement was considered stable, remaining in the excellent range. At visit 4, a positive concordance between the physician-and the patient-DAS was associated with the profession (lower in blue collar, p=0.001), the educational level (higher in high school and university, p=0.034) and the baseline physician's DAS (higher in high disease activity, p=0.46). Conclusion: The agreement between the DAS-28 performed by the physician and by the patient was excellent at baseline and remained stable over one year. A positive concordance was associated with the profession, the educational level and the level of disease activity. The present study can help the rheumatologist make informed decisions about the patients who may be suitable for a remote evaluation of their disease activity, that can be of particular interest in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Concordance between the physician's and the patient's assessment of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis: Results of the autodas-meac study at one year"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the use of saliva sampling has become an issue of real importance.

About a quarter of contact centre staff regularly experience musculoskeletal health problems due to high levels of sedentary behaviour, including lower back pain. There have been no previous randomised studies specifically aiming to reduce sedentary behaviour in contact centre staff. To address this gap, the Stand Up for Health (SUH) study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a complex theory-based intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in contact centres. METHODS: The Stand Up for Health study has a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial design, which is a pragmatic design whereby clusters (contact centres) are randomised to time points at which they will begin to receive the intervention. All contact centre staff have the opportunity to experience the intervention. To minimise the resource burden in this feasibility study, data collection is not continuous, but undertaken on a selective number of occasions, so the stepped wedge design is incomplete. Eleven contact centres in England and Scotland have been recruited, and the sample size is approximately 27 per centre (270 in total). The statistical analysis will predominantly focus on assessing feasibility, including the calculation of recruitment rates and rates of attrition. Exploratory analysis will be performed to compare objectively measured sedentary time in the workplace (measured using an activPAL? device) between intervention and control conditions using a linear mixed effects regression model. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first stepped wedge feasibility study conducted in call centres. The rationale and justification of our novel staircase stepped wedge design has been presented, and we hope that by presenting our study design and statistical analysis plan, it will contribute to the literature on stepped wedge trials, and in particular feasibility stepped wedge trials. The findings of the study will also help inform whether this is a suitable design for other settings where data collection is challenging.

Extra staff drafted in were unfamiliar with the ICU environment and needed to focus on direct patient care. The increased ICU footprint meant calls might be misdirected. Personal protective equipment (PPE) hampered hearing, speaking and phone use. Staff were unable to hold face-to-face family meetings and families were unable to be at the bedside which would, in normal times, enable them to be part of the patients hospital journey. Inevitably, this all led to an increased volume of phone calls.To try to solve some of these issues, it was decided that a dedicated team was needed to establish open lines of communication between patient, family and staff. A group of senior nurses from across the hospital were brought together to form the Critical Care Family Liaison Team (FLT).FLT now give coordinated information and are the first point of contact for families. Interventions include using technology such as FaceTime and Zoom to allow virtual visiting, conference calling for family updates, bedside photographs, voice recordings sent in by families and music playlists.The role for the FLT has evolved;the team was set up rapidly at the start of lockdown and members were in their new roles within a week. Daily verbal feedback was gathered from the medical team and interventions changed as necessary.It is difficult to assess what the situation would have been without this innovation. Formal feedback was requested from all staff members working in Critical Care and from patients and their families. Qualitative and 5 point likert scale responses have been positive.

Several types of paper questionnaires have been developed to assess these conditions in early childhood; however, the psychometric equivalence between the web-based and the paper versions of these questionnaires is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the interformat reliability of the web-based parent-rated version of the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire 2007 (DCDQ), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) among Japanese preschoolers in a community developmental health check-up setting. METHODS: A set of paper-based questionnaires were distributed for voluntary completion to parents of children aged 5 years. The package of the paper format questionnaires included the ASSQ, ADHD-RS, DCDQ, parent-reported SDQ (P-SDQ), and several additional demographic questions. Responses were received from 508 parents of children who agreed to participate in the study. After 3 months, 300 parents, who were among the initial responders, were randomly selected and asked to complete the web-based versions of these questionnaires. A total of 140 parents replied to the web-based format and were included as a final sample in this study. RESULTS: We obtained the McDonald  coefficients for both the web-based and paper formats of the ASSQ (web-based: =.90; paper: =.86), ADHD-RS total and subscales (web-based: =.88-.94; paper: =.87-.93), DCDQ total and subscales (web-based: =.82-.94; paper: =.74-.92), and P-SDQ total and subscales (web-based: =.55-.81; paper: =.52-.80). The intraclass correlation coefficients between the web-based and paper formats were all significant at the 99.9% confidence level: ASSQ (r=0.66, P<.001); ADHD-RS total and subscales (r=0.66-0.74, P<.001); DCDQ total and subscales (r=0.66-0.71, P<.001); P-SDQ Total Difficulties and subscales (r=0.55-0.73, P<.001). There were no significant differences between the web-based and paper formats for total mean score of the ASSQ (P=.76), total (P=.12) and subscale (P=.11-.47) mean scores of DCDQ, and the P-SDQ Total Difficulties mean score (P=.20) and mean subscale scores (P=.28-.79).

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the web-based versions of the ASSQ, ADHD-RS, DCDQ, and P-SDQ were equivalent, with the same level of internal consistency and intrarater reliability as the paper versions, indicating the applicability of the web-based versions of these questionnaires for assessing neurodevelopmental disorders.","output":"Interformat Reliability of Web-Based Parent-Rated Questionnaires for Assessing Neurodevelopmental Disorders Among Preschoolers: Cross-sectional Community Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Pandemic is a major global health threat in the present and the future as in the past. As Pre-Hospital Emergency Healthcare Workers (PHE-HCW) are at the front-line of pandemic, they should be well-equipped. The study was aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and skills of PHE-HCW about pandemic preparedness. Methods This cross-sectional study conducted on 202 PHE-HCW selected by random sampling in Eskisehir. Of 40.6% the study group consisted of paramedic graduates of associate degree and 59.4% of emergency medical technicians (EMT) graduated from vocational high schools. A total of 111 cases were developed using the template of events for applied and critical healthcare simulation. The green (minor injuries), yellow (non-life-threatening injuries) and red (life-threatening injuries) coded COVID-19 positive cases were used to evaluate the simulated case scores of each participant. Each scenario consists of 6 steps (infection control measures, patient history-examination, medical treatment, diagnosis, communication, and delivering the patient to the healthcare institution) and 20 questions (min:0, max:40 points). The score that could be obtained according to the number of questions in the steps was standardized. Results Of 62.4% the study group was female and the mean age (SD) was 29.2 (5.5). The mean score (SD) that the study group had from the cases was 28.5 (5.6) in a green cases, 28.9 (5.6) in yellow cases, and 25.7 (6.5) in red cases.The mean score was lower in the red cases. Male than female (p = 0.001), paramedics than EMTs (p = 0.009) and those with 2-3 years of working time than those with one year of working time scored higher (p = 0.023). None of the participants obtained a full score in any of the steps, the highest score step was infection control measures (1.56), while the lowest score was medical treatment (1.27). Conclusions PHE-HCW have deficiencies at all steps, most notably at the medical treatment step. Key messages Pre-hospital healthcare workers pre-graduate education and professional experiences have an positive impact on their knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding the pandemic.

Data were compared with the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period group). RESULTS: 195 patients were analyzed; 83 in the COVID-19 period group, resulting in a 26% decline of acute strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) admitted to our center compared with the previous year (p = 0.038). Ten patients (12%) tested positive for PCR SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of patients aged 65 years and over was lower in the COVID-19 period group (53 vs. 68.8%, p = 0.025). During the pandemic period, analyzed patients were more frequently smokers (27.7 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.002) and had less frequently history of prior stroke (13.3 vs. 25%, p = 0.043) or atrial fibrillation (9.6 vs. 25%, p = 0.006). ASPECTS score was lower (9 [7C10] vs. 10 [8C10], p = 0.032), NIHSS score was slightly higher (5 [2C14] vs. 4 [2C8], p = 0.122), onset-to-door time was higher (304 [93C760] vs. 197 [91.25C645] min, p = 0.104), and a lower proportion arrived within 4.5 h from onset of symptoms (43.4 vs. 58%, p = 0.043) during the CO-VID-19 period. There were no differences between proportion of patients receiving recanalization treatment (intravenous thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy) and in-hospital delays.

Its symptoms cause a long-term decline in patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL). Inconsistencies often occur between the clinical findings and the subjective symptoms of DED. Therefore, a holistic, balanced, and quantitative evaluation of the subjective symptoms and HRQL using patient-reported outcome questionnaires, in addition to clinical findings, is crucial for accurate DED assessment in patients. This paper reviewed the characteristics of current dry eye questionnaires, including their objectives, number of questions, inclusion of HRQL-related items, and whether they were properly evaluated for psychometric properties. Twenty-four questionnaires were identified; among them, the following six questionnaires that included items assessing HRQL and were properly evaluated for psychometric properties are recommended: the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Impact of Dry Eye in Everyday Life, Dry Eye-Related Quality-of-life Score, University of North Carolina Dry Eye Management Scale, Chinese version of Dry Eye-Related Quality of Life, and 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire.

Information on the differences between laboratory-confirmed and clinically-diagnosed COVID-19 in real-life settings is lacking. METHODS: We extracted data from the medical records of adult patients who were consecutively admitted for suspected COVID-19 infection in Moscow, between April 8 and May 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 4261 patients hospitalised for suspected COVID-19, outcomes were available for 3480 patients (median age 56 years (interquartile range 45-66). The commonest comorbidities were hypertension, obesity, chronic cardiac disease and diabetes. Half of the patients (n=1728) had a positive RT-PCR while 1748 were negative on RT-PCR but had clinical symptoms and characteristic CT signs suggestive of COVID-19 infection.No significant differences in frequency of symptoms, laboratory test results and risk factors for in-hospital mortality were found between those exclusively clinically diagnosed or with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.In a multivariable logistic regression model the following were associated with in-hospital mortality; older age (per 1 year increase) odds ratio [OR] 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 - 1.06); male sex (OR 1.71, 1.24 - 2.37); chronic kidney disease (OR 2.99, 1.89 - 4.64); diabetes (OR 2.1, 1.46 - 2.99); chronic cardiac disease (OR 1.78, 1.24 - 2.57) and dementia (OR 2.73, 1.34 - 5.47).

Data source and selection: For this, a search was made in Medline, Scopus and WOS, where descriptive studies of each of the functions of sirtuins were included, adjusted to recent scientific research. SIRT1 inhibition reduces CD8 T cell cytotoxicity in patients with systemic erythematosus lupus, being susceptible to SARS Cov-2 infections. SIRT2 is regulated by the secretion of IL-4 by eosinophils and the increase in SIRT2 increases hyperplasia, in contrast, SIRT3 promotes angiogenesis, inducing cardiac remodeling. SIRT4 is a tumor suppressor, in contrastto SIRT5 that promotes cell proliferation causing colorectal cancer; SIRT6 attenuates herpes virus associated with Kaposi's Sarcoma (KSHV) in immune compromised patients. Suppression of SIRT7 inhibits the growth of endometrial cancer cells. Conclusions: It is concluded that SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT4 are involved in the development of cancer, the suppression of SIRT5 and SIRT7 promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells and SIRT6 attenuates the replication of KSHV, in addition to the molecular pathology pathway of COVID-19 is associated with the inhibition of SIRT1 activity that may be related to inflammatory processes.","output":"Enfermedad del coronavirus (covid-19) y las sirtuinas./ [Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and sirtuins]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction & Objectives: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care access and delivery in the US has been reported for hospital admissions and in the outpatient setting for a few selected health conditions. However, the impact on specialty care has not been adequately characterized. We therefore aimed to determine trends in outpatient urologic care visit and procedural volume in 2020, using a specialty-wide, community-based registry. Materials & Methods: The American Urological Association Quality (AQUA) Registry collects data via automated extraction from electronic health record systems at 157 urology practices representing 3,165 providers (roughly one-quarter of US urologists) across 48 US states and territories. We analyzed trends in care delivery from February 2020 to July 2020 based on patient, practice, and local/regional demographic and pandemic response features. The primary outcomes were mean visit volume and procedure volume per practice per week, and we compared each week to the corresponding week in 2019. Results: There were 2,750,001 patients in our cohort, accounting for 8,953,832 outpatient visits and 1,570,161 procedures. We found large (>40%) declines in outpatient visits from March to April 2020 across all demographic groups and US states, regardless of timing of stay-at-home orders. Visits recovered through May and early June, but began falling again by early July (see Figure). Non-urgent visits and procedures decreased more (39C47%) than visits for urgent diagnoses (29C43%);surgical procedures for non-urgent conditions also decreased more (37C53%) than those for potentially urgent conditions (13C21%). African American and Hispanic patients had smaller decreases in visits compared with Asian and Caucasian patients, but also slower recoveries back to baseline. Medicare-insured patients (mostly over 65 years old) had the steepest declines (50%) while those on Medicaid (generally low-income) had among the lowest percentage of recovery to baseline (84.4%). Practices in zip codes with lower median incomes, higher poverty levels, and lower urologist to population ratios had smaller decreases in outpatient visits. (Figure Presented) Conclusions: This study provides timely, real-world evidence on the magnitude of decline in the provision of urological care across demographic groups and practice settings, and demonstrates a differential impact on the utilization of urologic health services by sociodemographic strata and specific diagnoses.","output":"P0183 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urologic care delivery in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to assess the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil and how it has been dealt with by both the government and in civil society To this end, we examine the Brazilian public health system and the measures taken by the Bolsonaro Government that led to Brazil being ranked second in overall Covid-19 infections in the world through August 2020 In the absence of national leadership facing the Covid-19 health crisis, we list a set of science-based initiatives promoted by Brazilian public universities in connection with local governments, NGOs and communities as a means of mitigating the consequences and spread of the pandemic This study is based on the consultation of institutional material published by universities summarizing their research and outreach initiatives Results reveal that university initiatives included: 1) Alerts to society on the risks of the pandemic, with an emphasis on establishing observatories that assisted local governments and civil society in understanding the evolution of the disease, as well as in implementing measures for its prevention;2) Direct assistance to local communities, with emphases on the addition of beds in university hospitals for treating patients with Covid-19 and on the manufacturing of personal protective equipment and;3) Research to find solutions to prevent and treat the disease, with emphases on the development of tests for Covid-19, as well as on carrying out phase 3 vaccine trials Through these measures, Brazilian public Federal Universities played a key role in supporting both civil society and local governments in mitigating the impacts of the pandemic","output":"The Role Played by Public Universities in Mitigating the Coronavirus Catastrophe in Brazil: Solidarity, Research and Support to Local Governments Facing the Health Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A rapid diagnostic method based on the melting curve SYBR Green I real-time PCR analysis was developed to detect and differentiate Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains.

Here we describe a novel isothermal detection technology based on target-cyclized rolling circle amplification combined with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (tRCA-lamp). By avoiding unexpected ligation, a short dynamic adapter is employed to increase the sensitivity of target cyclization in the presence of the background genome. At the amplification step, highly specific detection is obtained by linear RCA and simplified LAMP (only two primers are used). Furthermore, visual detection is easily realized with hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB). In the oyster samples, the tRCA-lamp approach can detect V. parahaemolyticus with a detection limit of 22 cfu/g with none necessary to enrich the bacteria and remove the host DNA.

Transiting through CBs, snRNAs are apparently modified by scaRNPs. Indeed, Nopp140 knockdown-mediated release of scaRNPs from CBs severely compromises 2-O-methylation of spliceosomal snRNAs, identifying CBs as the site of scaRNP catalysis. Additionally, alternative splicing patterns change indicating that these modifications in U1, U2, U5, and U12 snRNAs safeguard splicing fidelity.

Graphene is an extremely strong, electrically and thermally conductive two-dimensional hexagonal array of carbon atoms with the potential to transform applications such as supercapacitors, composites, biosensors, ultra-thin touchscreens, and solar cells. However, many of these applications require the use of exfoliated graphene, and the current cost of this material can be prohibitive. The most cost-effective source of graphene is exfoliated graphite, and numerous approaches have been proposed for exfoliating graphite to graphene. Solution approaches are the most common, with graphite often exfoliated by extended sonication treatment followed by separation of graphene from graphite using centrifugation. This time-consuming approach results in low concentrations of small lateral dimension graphene, often in high-boiling-point organic solvents or containing stabilizers. In this study, a chromatographic approach is used in combination with a solvent interface trapping method of graphite exfoliation to isolate graphene. The interface trapping exfoliation approach uses a hydrophobic/hydrophilic solvent interface to spontaneously exfoliate graphite and form a graphene-stabilized water-in-oil emulsion. This emulsion contains both graphene and graphite, and when added to water-wet glass beads, graphene adsorbs onto the glass surface, leaving graphite in the hydrophobic mobile phase, where it is removed by washing with an additional oil phase. The efficiency of this scalable approach to separation is demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Tyndall effect scattering.","output":"Chromatographic Approach to Isolate Exfoliated Graphene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of antibiotic resistance is a major challenge for antibiotics as an effective treatment approach of infectious diseases and pathogenic microbes with resistance to antibiotics will become difficult to be treated.

Our goal was to determine whether the proportion of ED visits for specific psychiatric conditions, namely anxiety disorders, depression, self-harm/suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders, changed after the arrival of COVID-19. Methods: Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: EDs of 28 hospitals within 150 miles of New York City. Hospitals were teaching and non-teaching in rural, suburban and urban areas. Total annual ED volumes were 12,000 to 122,000. Population: Consecutive ED patients  21 years old from March 1 to November 30 in 2019 and 2020. Data analysis: We tallied the number of patients in 2019 and 2020 with anxiety disorders, depression, self-harm/suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders, identified using International Classification of Disease codes (version 10). We calculated the proportion of these visits to total ED visits in 2019 and 2020. We report the changes in these proportions from 2019 to 2020, along with 95% CIs.

METHODS: A randomized and triple-blind (patient, surgeon, and examiner) clinical trial was designed. The individuals were randomly allocated to 2 groups: test and placebo. In the test group, 2 capsules of 4 mg dexamethasone were administered orally. In the placebo group, subjects received 2 capsules with the same characteristics. In both groups, the administration took place 1 hour before the procedure. OHRQoL was assessed by the Brazilian version of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The OHIP-14 questionnaire and the assessment methods for clinical parameters were collected preoperatively and postoperatively. Multilevel linear regression models fitted the associations between preoperative use of corticosteroids and overall and domain-specific OHIP-14 scores over time. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen patients were selected for study; however, 21 were excluded for not returning to postoperative control on the seventh day, resulting in 93 patients assessed (test = 44 and placebo = 49).

Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76).

This is facilitated by the increased expression of the urokinase plasminogen activation system (uPAS); a feature of the majority of GOCs. There is increasing appreciation of the importance of uPAS expression in a range of cell types within the tumour microenvironment. Abundant clinical evidence indicates that altered expression of uPAS proteins is associated with worse outcomes, including time to tumour recurrence and patient survival. Emerging technologies, including liquid biopsy, suggest a role of uPAS for the detection of circulating tumour cells, which are responsible for the dissemination of cancers. We review and summarise pre-clinical and clinical data that supports the use of uPAS as a biomarker in GOC. ABSTRACT: Gastric and oesophageal cancers (GOCs) are lethal cancers which metastasise early and recur frequently, even after definitive surgery. The urokinase plasminogen activator system (uPAS) is strongly implicated in the invasion and metastasis of many aggressive tumours including GOCs. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) interaction with its receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), leads to proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin, a broad-spectrum protease which enables tumour cell invasion and dissemination to distant sites. uPA, uPAR and the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) are overexpressed in some GOCs. Accumulating evidence points to a causal role of activated receptor tyrosine kinase pathways enhancing uPAS expression in GOCs. Expression of these components are associated with poorer clinicopathological features and patient survival. Stromal cells, including tumour-associated macrophages and myofibroblasts, also express the key uPAS proteins, supporting the argument of stromal involvement in GOC progression and adverse effect on patient survival. uPAS proteins can be detected on circulating leucocytes, circulating tumour cells and within the serum; all have the potential to be developed into circulating biomarkers of GOC. Herein, we review the experimental and clinical evidence supporting uPAS expression as clinical biomarker in GOC, with the goal of developing targeted therapeutics against the uPAS.","output":"Experimental and Clinical Evidence Supports the Use of Urokinase Plasminogen Activation System Components as Clinically Relevant Biomarkers in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To survey the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its influencing factors among patients with COVID-19 in their first medical follow up. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were discharged from 12 hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang from Jan 17, 2020 to Mar 20, 2020. Prospectively collected and analyzed data included demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidity, and chest CT imaging features at the first follow up, 1 month after discharge. All patients underwent the HRQoL evaluation with the Chinese version of Short-Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) as well as a general condition questionnaire. Factors associated with SF-36 were constructed using linear regression. Predictors of impaired physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS) were identified by logistic regression. RESULTS: SF-36 demonstrated a significant difference in HRQoL in patients with COVID-19, except in physical function (PF), when compared to the general Chinese population (p<0.05). The multiple linear regressions demonstrated that age was negatively associated with PF, role physical (RP), but positively associated with vitality (VT) (p<0.05). PF, bodily pain (BP), and role-emotional (RE) were negatively associated with the female sex (p<0.05). For mental health, the clinical subtypes were significant associated factors (p < 0.05). Length of stay (LOS) was strongly negatively associated with RE and RP, and positively associated with VT (p< 0.05). Logistical regression revealed that non-obese overweight (OR 3.71) and obesity (OR 3.94) were risk factors for a low PCS and female sex (OR 2.22) was a risk factor for a low MCS. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related quality of life was poor among COVID-19 patients at the 1 month follow-up. Patients suffered from significant physical and psychological impairment. Therefore, prospective monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is needed in order to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, as well as to inform prompt and efficient interventions to alleviate suffering.","output":"Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life and Influencing Factors for COVID-19 Patients, a Follow-Up at One Month"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are derivatives of the heterocyclic aromatic compound quinoline These economical compounds have been used as antimalarial agents for many years Currently, they are used as monotherapy or in conjunction with other therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) Based on its effects on the modulation of the autophagy process, various clinical studies suggest that CQ and HCQ could be used in combination with other chemotherapeutics for the treatment of various types of cancer Furthermore, the antiviral effects showed against Zika, Chikungunya, and HIV are due to the annulation of endosomal/lysosomal acidification Recently, CQ and HCQ were approved for the U S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of infected patients with the coronavirus SARSCoV- 2, causing the disease originated in December 2019, namely COVID-2019 Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pharmacological effects of these drugs: (1) disruption of lysosomal and endosomal pH, (2) inhibition of protein secretion/expression, (3) inhibition of antigen presentation, (4) decrease of proinflammatory cytokines, (5) inhibition of autophagy, (6) induction of apoptosis and (7) inhibition of ion channels activation Thus, evidence has shown that these structures are leading molecules that can be modified or combined with other therapeutic agents In this review, we will discuss the most recent findings in the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ in the immune system, and the use of these antimalarial drugs on diseases","output":"The role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in immune regulation and diseases.

Mean length of hospital stay for NO AKI group was 7.22 days vs 15.08 days for total AKI group divided in 13.67 for stage 1, 15.83 for stage 2 and 21.82 for stage 3. Of note, all different therapies administered to COVID-19 patients did not correlate with AKI incidence. Mean eGFR at discharge was 76 ml/min for NO AKI group vs 66 ml/min for total AKI group divided in 68.7 ml/min for stage 1, 59.3 ml/min for stage 2 and 59.3 ml/min for stage 3. Mean serum creatinine at discharge was 1.14 mg/dl for NO AKI group vs 1.45 mg/dl for total AKI group divided in 1.28 mg/dl for stage 1, 1.58 mg/dl for stage 2 and 2.05 mg/dl for stage 3. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic is associated with an increased AKI prevalence in hospitalized patients (2-fold increase in all KDIGO stages). AKI associated with an increased risk of mortality: of note, AKI stage2-3 had a strong impact on mortality in comparison to NO AKI group (OR 2.59 and 2.11, respectively). The presence of eGFR >60 ml/min and serum creatinine < 1.2 mg/dl at admission were associated with a lower risk of AKI development: reduced eGFR levels were observed at discharge particularly in AKI stage 2-3. The length of hospital stay and risk of ICU admission depended on AKI incidence and severity. COVID-19 lead to an increased burden for Nephrologists due to increased AKI prevalence: a nephrological follow-up is needed to avoid progression from AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD).","output":"MO380 INCREASED PREVALENCE OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY AND MORTALITY IN COVID-19 HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in intensive care units (ICUs) are among the avoidable morbidity and mortality causes. This study aimed at investigating the rate of ICU-acquired infections (ICU-AIs) in Iran. METHODS: For the purpose of this multi-center study, the rate of ICU-AIs calculated based on the data collected through Iranian nosocomial infections surveillance system and hospital information system. The data expanded based on 12 months of the year (13,632 records in terms of hospital-ward-month), and then, the last observation carried forward method was used to replace the missing data. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) age of 52,276 patients with HAIs in the ICUs was 47.37 (30.78) years. The overall rate of ICU-AIs was 96.61 per 1000 patients and 16.82 per 1000 patient-days in Irans hospitals. The three main HAIs in the general ICUs were ventilator-associated events (VAE), urinary tract infection (UTI), and pneumonia events & lower respiratory tract infection (PNEU & LRI) infections. The three main HAIs in the internal and surgical ICUs were VAE, UTI, and bloodstream infections/surgical site infections (BSI/SSI). The most prevalent HAIs were BSI, PNEU & LRI and eye, ear, nose, throat, or mouth (EENT) infections in the neonatal ICU and PNEU & LRI, VAE, and BSI in the PICU. Device, catheter, and ventilator-associated infections accounted for 60.96, 18.56, and 39.83% of ICU-AIs, respectively. The ventilator-associated infection rate was 26.29 per 1000 ventilator-days. Based on the Pabon Lasso model, the lowest rates of ICU-AIs (66.95 per 1000 patients and 15.19 patient-days) observed in zone III, the efficient area. CONCLUSIONS: HAIs are common in the internal ICU wards. In fact, VAE and ventilator-related infections are more prevalent in Iran. HAIs in the ICUs leads to an increased risk of ICU-related mortality. Therefore, to reduce ICU-AIs, the specific and trained personnel must be responsible for the use of the devices (catheter use and ventilators), avoid over use of catheterization when possible, and remove catheters earlier.

However, little research on the effectiveness of psychological techniques implemented within these mHealth solutions was carried out, and even less with the elderly population where technological barriers might exist. Reliable evidence generated through a comprehensive evaluation of mHealth interventions may accelerate its growth for successful long-term implementation and to help to experience mHealth benefits in an enhanced way in all ages. Objective: this study aimed to review mHealth solutions for diabetes self-management in older adults (adherence to treatments and glycemic control) by analyzing the effectiveness of specific psychological techniques implemented. Methods: a narrative review was conducted following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed (Medline) and American Psychological Association (APA) PsycInfo databases were searched for published papers that addressed eHealth solutions effectiveness for diabetes self-management. Studies in English, Spanish, and/or German of any design were screened, with no time constraints regarding the year of publication. A qualitative analysis of the selected papers was conducted in several steps. Results: this review found 38 studies setting up and analyzing mHealth solutions for older adults. Most research showed improvements in HbA1c, self-management behaviors, and medication adherence in T2DM patients post intervention. However, different mid-to-long term effects were found across studies, specifically concerning the maintenance and adherence to healthy behaviors. The most employed psychological framework was CBT, including techniques such as self-monitoring of outcome behaviors (mostly targeting glycemia measurements and healthy habits as physical activity and/or diet), tailored motivational feedback from medical staff, and psychoeducation or health coaches. The most successful mHealth intervention combined the feature of tailored feedback messages, interactive communication with healthcare professionals, and multifaceted functions. Conclusions: there is a lack of elaborate and detailed information in the literature regarding the factors considered in the design and development of mHealth solutions used as interventions for T2DM self-management in the elderly. Documentation and inclusion of such vital information will foster a transparent and shared decision-making process that will ultimately lead to the development of useful and user-friendly self-management apps that can enhance the quality of life for diabetes patients.

The complexes were studied in solution as paramagnetic CEST (paraCEST) agents and after loading into Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells as cell-based CEST (cellCEST) agents. The fluorophores attached to the complexes through an amide linkage imparted an unusual pH dependence to the paraCEST properties of all four complexes through of ionization of a group that was attributed to the amide NH linker. The furthest shifted CEST peak for the hydroxypropyl-based complexes changed by a90 ppm upon increasing the pH from 5 to 7.5. At acidic pH, the Co(II) complexes exhibited three to four CEST peaks with the most highly shifted CEST peak at 200 ppm. The complexes demonstrated substantial paramagnetic water proton shifts which is a requirement for the development of cellCEST agents. The large shift in the proton resonance was attributed to an inner-sphere water at neutral pH, as shown by variable temperature 17O NMR spectroscopy studies. Labeling of yeast with one of these paraCEST agents was optimized with fluorescence microscopy and validated by using ICP mass spectrometry quantitation of cobalt. A weak asymmetry in the Z-spectra was observed in the yeast labeled with a Co(II) complex, toward a cellCEST effect, although the Co(II) complexes were toxic to the cells at the concentrations necessary for observation of cellCEST.","output":"Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes Appended with Fluorophores as paraCEST and cellCEST Agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This communication provides a compilation on aspects of COVID-19 infection control measures, describes the potential role of therapeutic plasma exchange to reduce fatality rates, addresses precautions concerning dexamethasone pharmacotherapy and updates the current status on the availability of vaccines.

Such critical course of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is thought to associate with cytokine storm as in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), although these specific data are still lacking. In this study we aimed to directly address the question, whether immune activation in COVID-19 does indeed mimic conditions as in these classical cytokine storm syndromes. METHODS: We quantified levels of 22 biomarkers in serum samples of COVID-19 (n=30, n=83 longitudinal samples in total), sHLH/MAS patients (n=50) as well as healthy controls (n=9) using bead array assay as well as single-marker ELISA and correlated results with disease outcome. RESULTS: In sHLH/MAS we observed dramatic activation of the interleukin(IL)-18-interferon (IFN)-?3 axis, while increased serum levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and IL-8, as well as strongly reduced levels of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in course of SARS-CoV-2 infection discriminate immune dysregulation in critical COVID-19 from the investigated well-recognized cytokine storm conditions.

Methods: Primers showing optimal in-silico features were subjected to analytical sensitivity and specificity to assess the limit of detection (LOD) and cross-reaction with closely- and distantly-related viral species, and clinically prominent bacterial and fungal species. In order to evaluate the clinical utility, our RT-LAMP was subjected to a large number of clinical samples, including 213 negative and 47 positive patients, relative to two commercial quantitative RT-PCR assays.

The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring serum neutralizing antibodies but requires high level biosafety, live viral cultures and days to complete. We hypothesized that competitive enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs) based on SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment to its host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2r), would correlate with PRNT, given the central role of RBD-ACE2r interactions in infection and published studies to date, and enable evaluation of vaccine responses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Configuration and development of a competitive ELISA with plate-bound RBD and soluble biotinylated ACE2r was accomplished using pairs of pre/post vaccine serum. When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N = 32 samples from COVID-19 patients previously tested by PRNT, excellent correlation in IC(50) results were observed (r(s) = .83, p < 0.0001). When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N = 42 vaccinated individuals and an additional N = 13 unvaccinated recovered COVID-19 patients, significant differences in RBD-ACE2r inhibitory activity were associated with prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. In longitudinal analyses pre and up to 200 days post vaccine, surrogate neutralizing activity increased markedly after primary and booster vaccine doses, but fell substantially, up to <12% maximal levels within 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: A competitive ELISA based on inhibition of RBD-ACE2r attachment correlates well with PRNT, quantifies significantly higher activity among vaccine recipients with prior COVID (vs. those without), and highlights marked declines in surrogate neutralizing activity over a 6 month period post vaccination.

For 2060, projected AAMF are, on average, 5.1% among men and 1.4% among women, whereas in 2016 these levels were 10.1% and 3.3%, respectively. For men, AAMF is projected to be higher in Eastern and South-western Europe than in North-western Europe. All in all, the share of mortality due to alcohol is projected to eventually decline in all 26 European countries. Achieving these projected declines will, however, require strong ongoing public health action, particularly for selected Eastern and North-western European countries.","output":"Past and Future Alcohol-Attributable Mortality in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015 and provide related information for the public health professionals in China. METHODS The incidence data of MERS were collected from the websites of the Korean government, WHO and authoritative media in Korea for this epidemiological analysis. RESULTS Between May 20 and July 13, 2015, a total of 186 confirmed MERS cases (1 index case, 29 secondary cases, 125 third generation cases, 25 fourth generation cases and 6 cases without clear generation data), including 36 deaths (case fatality rate: 19%), were reported in Korea. All cases were associated with nosocomial transmission except the index case and two possible family infections. Sixteen hospitals in 11 districts in 5 provinces/municipalities in Korea reported confirmed MERS cases, involving 39 medical professionals or staff. For the confirmed cases and death cases, the median ages were 55 years and 70 years respectively, and the cases and deaths in males accounted for 60% and 67% respectively. Up to 78% of the deaths were with underlying medical conditions. Besides the index case, other 12 patients were reported to cause secondary cases, in which 1 caused 84 infections. One imported MERS case from Korea was confirmed in China on May 29, no secondary cases occurred. The viruses strains isolated from the cases in Korea and the imported case in China show no significant variation compared with the strains isolated in the Middle East.

In a large multi-center cohort of COVID-19-infected patients, we aim to analyze (1) the outcomes of patients with underlying CLD [with and without cirrhosis] and (2) the development and impact of ACLF on in-hospital mortality. DESIGN: We identified 192 adults with CLD from among 10,859 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (admitted to any of 12 hospitals in a New York health care system between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020). ACLF was defined using the EASL-CLIF Consortium definition. Patient follow-up was through April 30, 2020, or until the date of discharge, transfer, or death. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients with cirrhosis, 32 [38%] developed ACLF, with respiratory failure [39%] and renal failure [26%] being the most common. Hispanic/Latino ethnicity was particularly at higher risk of in-hospital mortality [adjusted HR 4.92, 95% 1.27C19.09, p < 0.02] in cirrhosis despite having lower risk of development of ACLF [HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08C0.89, p = 0.03]. Hypertension on admission predicted development of ACLF [HR 3.46, 95% CI 1.12C10.75, p = 0.03]. In-hospital mortality was not different between CLD patients with or without cirrhosis [p = 0.24] but was higher in those with cirrhosis who developed ACLF [adjusted HR 9.06, 95% CI 2.63C31.12, p < 0.001] with a trend for increased mortality by grade of ACLF [p = 0.002]. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between the CLD cohort compared to matched control without CLD (log rank, p = 0.98) and between the cirrhosis cohort compared to matched control without cirrhosis (log rank, p = 0.51). CONCLUSION: Development of ACLF is the main driver of increased in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and cirrhosis.

However, we discontinued routine palpation from July 13, 2018, owing to a peculiarly high incidence of PICC-related phlebitis. The aim of this study was to prove that routine palpation was the cause of PICC-related phlebitis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records of infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and underwent PICC placement from January 2018 to January 2019. The infants were classified into palpating (before July 13, 2018) and non-palpating (after or on July 13, 2018) groups. We analyzed and compared the incidence of PICC-related phlebitis in the two groups. RESULTS PICC-related phlebitis was more frequently observed in the palpating group (10/29 infants, 34.5%) than in the non-palpating group (1/31, 3.2%) (p = 0.002). After discontinuation of routine palpating in PICC management, the frequency of non-scheduled removal of the PICC due to phlebitis decreased. The indwelling period was significantly longer in the non-palpating group than in the palpating group.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of >2.4 million adults in a large healthcare system to evaluate whether smoking is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of 2,427,293 adults in KPNC from 3/5/2020 (baseline) to 12/31/2020 (pre-vaccine) included smoking status (current, former, never), socio-demographics, and comorbidities from the electronic health record. SARS-CoV-2 infection (identified by a positive PCR test) and COVID-19 severity (hospitalization, ICU admission or death 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis) were estimated in time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusting for covariates. Secondary analyses examined COVID-19 severity among patients with COVID-19 using logistic regression. RESULTS: During the study, 44,270 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current smoking was associated with lower adjusted rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR=0.64 95%CI:0.61-0.67), COVID-19-related hospitalization (aHR=0.48 95%CI:0.40-0.58), ICU admission (aHR=0.62 95%CI:0.42-0.87), and death (aHR=0.52 95%CI:0.27-0.89) than never-smoking. Former smoking was associated with a lower adjusted rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR=0.96 95%CI:0.94-0.99) and higher rates of hospitalization (aHR=1.10 95%CI:1.03-1.08) and death (aHR=1.32 95%CI:1.11-1.56) than never-smoking. Logistic regression analyses among patients with COVID-19 found lower odds of hospitalization for current versus never-smoking and higher odds of hospitalization and death for former versus never-smoking. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest US study to date on smoking and COVID-19, current and former smoking showed lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than never-smoking, while a history of smoking was associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS: In this cohort study of 2.4 million adults, adjusting for socio-demographics and medical comorbidities, current cigarette smoking was associated with a lower risk of both COVID-19 infection and severe COVID-19 illness compared to never-smoking. A history of smoking was associated with a slightly lower risk of COVID-19 infection and a modestly higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness compared to never-smoking. The lower observed COVID-19 risk for current versus never-smoking deserves further investigation.

However, within an African population, it is not clear how the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic may be particularly important for formulating public health policies and their consequent implementation. As a first step, it is important to validate a psychometrically sound instrument to assess the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic using an African population. This study presents a preliminary validation of the fear of the COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) using a sub-Saharan African population from Nigeria. Methods Three hundred and ninety-eight people responded from a total of 1000 invitees. The participants were requested to fill a web-based (Google forms) FCV-19S questionnaire. The responses, together with their socio-demographic data, were analysed using descriptive statistics and a confirmatory factor analysis. Results The age of the participants ranged between 21 and 30 years (mean 25.84 years). The study participants comprised 220 males (56.6%) and 169 females (43.4%). The factor loadings of all seven items of the FCV-19S questionnaire reached statistical significance and, therefore, were retained. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the two-factor structure of the FCV-19S questionnaire was a better fit for the Nigerian subpopulation under consideration.

The guidelines also identify subpopulations of Americans deemed to be at high risk for severe disease should they contract COVID-19. These guidelines were based on population level demographics, rather than individual-level risk factors. As such, they may misidentify individuals at high risk for severe illness, and may therefore be of limited use in decisions surrounding resource allocation to vulnerable populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate a machine learning algorithm for prediction of serious illness due to COVID-19 using inpatient data collected from electronic health records. Methods: The algorithm was trained to identify patients for whom a diagnosis of COVID-19 was likely to result in hospitalization, and compared against four U.S. policy-based criteria: age over 65, having a serious underlying health condition, age over 65 or having a serious underlying health condition, and age over 65 and having a serious underlying health condition. Results: This algorithm identified 80% of patients at risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19, versus at most 62% as identified by government guidelines. The algorithm also achieved a high specificity of 95%, outperforming government guidelines.

Paucity of reliable information, with insights largely derived from limited RT-PCR testing in high-risk and urban populations, has been one of the biggest barriers to understanding the course of the pandemic and informed policy-making. Here we estimate seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Ethiopia during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: We undertook a population-based household seroprevalence serosurvey based on 1856 participants in Ethiopia, in the capital city Addis Ababa, and in Jimma, a middle-sized town in the Oromia region, and its rural surroundings (districts of Seka and Mana), between 22 July and 02 September 2020. We tested one random participant per household for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a high specificity rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and evaluated population seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance as well as age and sex of the participants. FINDINGS: In total, 2304 random households were visited, with 1856 individuals consenting to participate. This produced a sample of 956 participants in Addis Ababa and 900 participants in Jimma. IgG prevalence was estimated at 1.9% (95% CI 0.4C3.7%), and combined IgM/IgG prevalence at 3.5% (95% CI 1.7C5.4%) for Addis Ababa in early August 2020, with higher prevalence in central sub-cities. Prevalence in Jimma town was lower at 0.5% (95% CI 0C1.8%) for IgG and 1.6% (95%CI 0C4.1%) for IgM/IgG, while in rural Jimma IgG prevalence was 0.2% and IgM/IgG 0.4% in early September. INTERPRETATION: More than four months after the first cases were detected in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa displayed a prevalence under 5% and likely as low as 2%, while rural Jimma displayed a prevalence of 0.2%. A 2% seroprevalence figure for the capital translated to a number of cases at least five times larger than those reported for the country as a whole. At the same time, it contrasts with significantly higher seroprevalence figures in large cities in Europe and America only two to three months after the first cases. This population-based seroepidemiological study thus provides evidence of a slower spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Ethiopian population during the first wave of the pandemic and does not appear to support the notion that lower case numbers were simply a reflection of limited testing and surveillance.

The genitourinary tract is the most common site of involvement, however, cases have also been described in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that it is the second most common site of involvement. This study investigates the clinical and histologic features of malakoplakia in the gastrointestinal tract. CASE PRESENTATION For 23 gastrointestinal specimens (biopsies and resections) from patients with a pathologic diagnosis of malakoplakia, we recorded the gender, age, location, primary diagnosis, endoscopic or surgical indication, endoscopic/gross impression and immune status (immunocompromised vs. immunocompetent). CONCLUSION Malakoplakia occurred throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract with most of the cases located in the sigmoid colon and rectum (n = 10); other sites included the transverse and descending colon (n = 4), stomach/gastroesophageal junction (n = 4), appendix (n = 2), cecum (n = 1), small bowel (n = 1), and the peri-anal area (n = 1). Endoscopically, these lesions most commonly appeared as polyps (n = 10) or masses (n = 5), other clinical endoscopic impressions varied from a thickened area/fibrosis to mucosal erythema. Most patients were immunocompromised due to a disease state (e.g. organ transplantation, cancer diagnosis, autoimmune condition) and/or medication effect. Eight patients with malakoplakia were on immunosuppressive medications (8/23, 35%). Common immunosuppressed disease states included cancer (n = 9), autoimmune disease (n = 5), status post organ transplantation (n = 4), diabetes (n = 5), infection/sepsis (n = 3), and HIV/AIDS (n = 1). Some patients had multiple co-morbidities (i.e. diabetes and organ transplant). Twenty-one patients with malakoplakia were in an immunosuppressive state (21/23, 91%).","output":"Malakoplakia of the gastrointestinal tract: clinicopathologic analysis of 23 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Dynamic variables are accurate predictors of fluid responsiveness in adults undergoing mechanical ventilation. They can be determined using respiratory variation in aortic flow peak velocity (?Vpeak), arterial pulse pressure [?PP and pulse pressure variation (PPV)], or plethysmographic waveform amplitude [?POP and pleth variability index (PVI)]. These indices have not been validated in children. We studied the ability of these variables to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children. METHODS All results are expressed as median [median absolute deviation (MAD)]. Thirty mechanically ventilated children were studied after undergoing general anaesthesia. Mechanical ventilation was maintained with a tidal volume of 10 ml kg(-1) of body weight. ?PP, PPV, ?POP, PVI, ?Vpeak, and aortic velocity-time integral were recorded before and after volume expansion (VE). Patients were considered to be responders to VE when the aortic velocity-time integral increased more than 15% after VE. RESULTS VE induced significant changes in ?PP [13 (MAD 4) to 9 (5)%], PPV [15 (5) to 9 (5)%], ?POP [15 (10) to 10 (6)%], PVI [13 (6) to 8 (5)%], and ?Vpeak [16 (9) to 8 (3)%] (P<0.05 for all). Differences in ?PP, ?POP, PPV, and PVI did not reach statistical significance. Only ?Vpeak was significantly different between responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to VE [22 (3) vs 7 (1)%, respectively; P<0.001]. The threshold ?Vpeak value of 10% allowed discrimination between R and NR.

The series systematically analysed every step of the funding lifecycle in five major stages and made recommendations to various actors including research funders. Prompted by its participation in the Ensuring Value in Research Funders' Forum, between June and October 2019 the HRB undertook a self-audit against the 17 recommendations identified in the Lancet series. Key HRB staff collated relevant policies and practices regarding each recommendation and sub-recommendation and assessed the HRB's performance under each heading. The self-assessment reflects the state of HRB policies and practices in October 2019. Of the 17 recommendations, five were found to be areas of strength and six were found to be areas of partial strength. Areas of strength reflect work over many years such as support for evidence synthesis, strong processes around award selection, driving research integrity and open data including an HRB-funded open publishing platform. Four recommendations were found to be areas for growth. These mostly revolve around real time reporting of study protocols and of ongoing funded research outside of clinical trials.

Phosphorylation of Akt occurs early during JUNV infection of Vero cells and is blocked by the PI3K inhibitor, Ly294002. Infection of cells with UV-irradiated JUNV redeemed the pattern of stimulation observed for infectious virus indicating that an early stage of multiplication cycle would be enough to trigger activation. Treatment of cells with chlorpromazine abrogated phosphorylation of Akt upon JUNV infection suggesting virus internalization as responsible for activation. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by Ly294002 impaired viral protein synthesis and expression leading to a reduced infectious virus yield without blocking the onset of persistent stage of infection. This impairment is linked to a reduced amount of virus bound to cells probably due to a blockage on the recycling of transferrin cell-receptor, employed by the virus to adsorb to the cell surface. Early Akt activation was also observed in BHK-21 and A549 JUNV infected cells suggesting an important role of PI3K/Akt signalling in JUNV multiplication in vitro.","output":"Participation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in Junn virus replication in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: COVID\\\\19 is associated with an exacerbated inflammatory response that can result in fatal outcomes. Systemic inflammation is also a main characteristic of periodontitis. Therefore, we investigated the association of periodontitis with COVID\\\\19 complications.

Cases were defined as patients who suffered COVID\\\\19 complications (death, ICU admissions or assisted ventilation), and controls were COVID\\\\19 patients discharged without major complications. Periodontal conditions were assessed using dental radiographs from the same database. Associations between periodontitis and COVID 19 complications were analysed using logistic regression models adjusted for demographic, medical and behaviour factors. RESULTS: In total, 568 patients were included. After adjusting for potential confounders, periodontitis was associated with COVID\\\\19 complication including death (OR = 8.81, 95% CI 1.00C77.7), ICU admission (OR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.39C9.05) and need for assisted ventilation (OR = 4.57, 95% CI 1.19C17.4). Similarly, blood levels of white blood cells, D\\\\dimer and C Reactive Protein were significantly higher in COVID\\\\19 patients with periodontitis.

Heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analyses comparing comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs) to non-CSCs. RESULTS: 38 included studies reported on 6109 patients during COVID-19 and 14 637 patients during the pre-COVID period. Pooled increases of 20.9% (95% CI 5.8% to 36.1%) in last-known-well (LKW) to arrival times, 1.2% (-2.9% to 5.3%) in door-to-imaging (DTI), 0.8% (-2.9% to 4.5%) in door-to-needle (DTN), 2.8% (-5.0% to 10.6%) in door-to-groin (DTG), and 19.7% (11.1% to 28.2%) in door-to-reperfusion (DTR) times were observed during COVID-19. At CSCs, LKW increased by 24.0% (-0.3% to 48.2%), DTI increased by 1.6% (-3.0% to 6.1%), DTN increased by 3.6% (1.2% to 6.0%), DTG increased by 4.6% (-5.9% to 15.1%), and DTR increased by 21.2% (12.3% to 30.1%). At non-CSCs, LKW increased by 12.4% (-1.0% to 25.7%), DTI increased by 0.2% (-2.0% to 2.4%), DTN decreased by -4.6% (-11.9% to 2.7%), DTG decreased by -0.6% (-8.3% to 7.1%), and DTR increased by 0.5% (-31.0% to 32.0%).

Participants were asked about demographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptoms and adherence to preventive measures. Sero-prevalence was determined using SARS-CoV-2 IgG test. Result: The estimated SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 3.2% (95 % CI: 2.0 - 4.8) in the study region with no differences by age and sex but considerable differences were observed by adherence to COVID-19 preventive recommendations. For instance, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among participants who reported not to have practiced social distancing measures was 8.5 times the prevalence in their counterparts who reported of practicing social distancing. The corresponding estimates were 12.8 (95%CI, 7.0, 19) and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.5, 2.5) with statistically significant difference( p <0.01). Similarly, we observed 4.5 times higher prevalence among people who reported of not wearing face masks and who mentioned of not avoiding social gatherings. More than 80 percent of study participants reported of adherence to infection prevention measures (face masks and physical distancing recommendations).

A voluntary and anonymous survey was administered from February to May 2021 to 495 participants aged 60 and older. Respondents completed three questionnaires: WHOQOL-BREF, Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised (CIQ-R), and Perceived Accessibility of Living Environment (PALE). The main finding was that participation in activities in the community had a direct positive impact on QoL. Perceived accessibility of the living environment also had indirect positive effects on QoL through participation in activities in the community, for those without disabilities but, interestingly, not for those with disabilities. Hierarchal linear regressions revealed that participation in activities explained 53.3% of the variance for both groups while perceived accessibility added 1.1% for the nondisabled.

METHODS Our data were collected by the Obervatoire Rgional de la Sant (ORS) using a self-administered online questionnaire. This was completed by a sample of 2,022 people stratified to match French official census statistics for gender, age, occupation, and area of housing. We conducted statistical analysis using Python (Pandas - Scipy - Statsmodels) with chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to control for statistical significance. RESULTS A small majority of respondents used TousAntiCovid (55.5%), while 41.0% had never downloaded it. Only one-quarter of the respondents (23.3%) used it for contact tracing with Bluetooth, while a third (32.2%) used it only for storing their health pass. The app's use increased with education level, income, and younger age. A large majority (85%) of non-vaccinated respondents had never downloaded TousAntiCovid. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that the role and use of France's official COVID-19 app TousAntiCovid has evolved in line with the government's strategy; while initially focusing on contact tracing, its development has led to the possibility to store test and vaccination documentation. The survey also confirmed previous results pointing to the lasting differences in socio-economic status in terms of adoption of the app. This is problematic because the long-term nature of the pandemic could require the government to keep a range of strategies open, including contact tracing.

Because of this, effective HRM interventions should be taken in order to attract and retain medical personnel. Employer branding is one such intervention because it not only results in improving the organization's reputation as an employer but also improving HRM practices. However, to create an effective employer branding strategy, a contextual approach should be taken. Because of this, the aim of the study is to assess the importance of various factors influencing medical personnels perception of a hospitals attractiveness as an employer. METHODS: The study was performed among 285 hospitals in Poland assuming a confidence level of 0.95. In each hospital, five respondents took part in the survey. The first cohort of respondents named Directors consisted of hospital directors or employees authorized by them, mostly HR specialists. The other four groups were: Hybrid Doctors Managers (individuals who had the roles of both doctor and manager); Hybrid Nurses Managers (having the roles of both manager and nurse); Physicians; Nurses. Due to the ordinal nature of the data, the chi-square test of independence was used and the V-Cramer coefficient was determined. To indicate significant discrepancies between the responses of the respondents cohorts, the KruskalCWallis rank test was conducted. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Various groups of respondents perceive hospital attractiveness as an employer differently. While the opinions of medical personnel are more or less homogeneous, the cohort of employees responsible for HRM are less consistent with regard to their perception of hospital attractiveness. Additionally, Directors highlight tangible factors determining hospital desirability. Moreover, their hierarchy of the top five factors influencing EB clearly exposes their quantitative orientation towards hospital performance management. Medical personnel hierarchies of the determinants expose qualitative orientation. Excluding country-dependent factors, such as regularity of remuneration payment, the professionals value such determinants as a nice work atmosphere, cooperation with colleagues (specialists), good working conditions and, most importantly, employment stability. The last determinant results from generational and gender tendencies (feminization), and yet it stands in contradiction with a tendency of flexible employment implemented in most developed countries due to a lack of medical personnel. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed the importance of adapting employer branding strategies to the medical professional groups (doctors and nurses). This is because their perception of employers attractiveness differ. In addition, elements of the profession genotypes play an important role in how the physicians and nurses value various factors creating the employers attractiveness. The research also revealed the fact that top managers or HR specialists can wrongly identify the hospitals attractiveness since they are more quantitatively than qualitatively oriented. For this reason, they may implement inefficient EB strategies.","output":"The enhancement of the employer branding strategies of Polish hospitals through the detection of features which determine employer attractiveness: a multidimensional perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causes uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in severe cases. Given the antioxidative effect of molecular hydrogen, some recent studies suggest the potential use of molecular hydrogen as a biomedicine for the treatment of ARDS. In this study, we aimed to explore the protective effects of magnesium hydride (MgH(2)) on two types of ARDS models and its underlying mechanism in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS model of the A549 cell line. The results showed that LPS successfully induced oxidative stress, inflammatory reaction, apoptosis, and barrier breakdown in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). MgH(2) can exert an anti-inflammatory effect by down-regulating the expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-). In addition, MgH(2) decreased oxidative stress by eliminating intracellular ROS, inhibited apoptosis by regulating the expressions of cytochrome c, Bax, and Bcl-2, and suppressed barrier breakdown by up-regulating the expression of ZO-1 and occludin. Mechanistically, the expressions of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-P65, NLRP3, and cleaved-caspase-1 were decreased after MgH(2) treatment, indicating that AKT/mTOR and NF-B/NLRP3/IL-1 pathways participated in the protective effects of MgH(2). Furthermore, the in vivo study also demonstrated that MgH(2)-treated mice had a better survival rate and weaker pathological damage. All these findings demonstrated that MgH(2) could exert an ARDS-protective effect by regulating the AKT/mTOR and NF-B/NLRP3/IL-1 pathways to suppress LPS-induced inflammatory reaction, oxidative stress injury, apoptosis, and barrier breakdown, which may provide a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of ARDS.","output":"Magnesium Hydride Ameliorates Endotoxin-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by Inhibiting Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Cell Apoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As our understanding of the complications of coronavirus diseaseC2019 (COVID-19) evolve, sub-clinical cardiac pathology such as myocarditis, pericarditis and right ventricular dysfunction in the absence of significant clinical symptoms represents a concern. The potential implications of these findings in athletes are significant given the concern that exercise, during the acute phase of viral myocarditis, may exacerbate myocardial injury and precipitate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Such concerns have led to the development and publication of expert consensus documents aimed at providing guidance for the evaluation of athletes after contracting COVID-19 in order to permit safe return-to-play. Cardiac imaging is at the center of these evaluations. This review seeks to evaluate the current evidence regarding COVID-19associated cardiovascular disease and how multi-modality imaging may be useful in the screening and clinical evaluation of athletes with suspected cardiovascular complications of infection. Guidance is provided with diagnostic red flags that raise the suspicion of pathology. Specific emphasis is placed on the unique challenges posed in distinguishing athletic cardiac remodeling from sub-clinical cardiac disease. The strengths and limitations of different imaging modalities are discussed and an approach to return-to-play decision making for athletes post COVID-19, as informed by multi-modality imaging, is provided.","output":"Screening of Potential Cardiac Involvement in Competitive Athletes Recovering from COVID-19: An Expert Consensus Statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanism of our NN is in line with the results of the latest MIT brain plasticity study, in which researchers found that as a synapse strengthens, neighboring synapses automatically weaken themselves to compensate. Regarding this mechanism, Dr. Luo's team at Stanford University has put forward that competition regarding synapse formation for dendritic morphogenesis is crucial. The astrocyte impacts on Brain Plasticity and Synapse Formation is an important mechanism of our NN at critical period and closure of critical period. We try to conduct research of failure in brain plasticity by model at the closure of critical period by contrasting with studies before. Cutting edge imaging and genetic tools are combined in their studies, whereas our research lays more emphasis on a new NN. In tests, possible explanations of dendrite morphogenesis are derived, which demonstrate that dendrite generation, to a certain extent, is curbed by synapse formation. Current and mnemonic brain plasticity as well as synaptic action range are also taken into account in the study. Furthermore, the frame of NN is based on current and mnemonic dynamic gradient informational synapse formation. The mnemonic gradient information needs to take into account the forgotten memory-astrocytic synapse formation memory factor. Mnemonic brain plasticity involves the plus or minus disturbance-astrocytic brain plasticity phagocytose factor. The influence of astrocyte made local synaptic action range remain in an appropriate length at critical period. Through the tabular data of the PNN test, we found that the memory factor of astrocytes, like the phagocytose factor, produces the effect of reducing the local accumulation of synapses.

CHIKV re-emerged in 2004 with multiple outbreaks worldwide and recently reached the Americas where it has infected over a million individuals in a rapidly expanding epidemic. While alphavirus replication is well understood in general, the specific function (s) of non-structural protein nsP3 remain elusive. CHIKV nsP3 modulates the mammalian stress response by preventing stress granule formation through sequestration of G3BP. In mosquitoes, nsP3 is a determinant of vector specificity, but its functional interaction with mosquito proteins is unclear. METHODS: In this research we studied the domains required for localization of CHIKV nsP3 in insect cells and demonstrated its molecular interaction with Rasputin (Rin), the mosquito homologue of G3BP. The biological involvement of Rin in CHIKV infection was investigated in live Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. RESULTS: In insect cells, nsP3 localized as cytoplasmic granules, which was dependent on the central domain and the C-terminal variable region but independent of the N-terminal macrodomain. Ae. albopictus Rin displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization, but was effectively sequestered into nsP3-granules upon nsP3 co-expression. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the Rin-nsP3 interaction involved the NTF2-like domain of Rin and two conserved TFGD repeats in the C-terminal variable domain of nsP3. Although in vitro silencing of Rin did not impact nsP3 localization or CHIKV replication in cell culture, Rin depletion in vivo significantly decreased the CHIKV infection rate and transmissibility in Ae.albopictus. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the nsP3 hypervariable C-terminal domain as a critical factor for granular localization and sequestration of mosquito Rin. Our study offers novel insight into a conserved virus-mosquito interaction at the molecular level, and reveals a strong proviral role for G3BP homologue Rin in live mosquitoes, making the nsP3-Rin interaction a putative target to interfere with the CHIKV transmission cycle.","output":"Mosquito Rasputin interacts with chikungunya virus nsP3 and determines the infection rate in Aedes albopictus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which is based on the dual mechanisms of restriction and mal-absorption, is considered to be one of the gold standard surgeries for treatment of morbid obesity.

Here, we described the first case of a patient receiving laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass through a single transumbilical incision. The operative time was 170 min. There were no intra-operative complications; the patient did very well postoperatively and was discharged 2 days later.

As per alcohol consumption, an upward trend was observed in a significant part (10.4-51.0%) of the participants examined. The increased snacking and alcohol consumption observed for almost a third of the examined population could be alarming because long-term health problems could arise in cases of repeated lockdowns in the future.

Vaccination programs are limited by availability of doses, the number of people already infected is still too low to have a disease preventing impact and new emerging variants of the virus seem to partially neglect developed antibodies from previous infections. Nevertheless, after one year of COVID-19 observing high numbers of reported cases in most European countries, we might expect that the immunization level should have an impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We used an agent-based simulation model to reproduce the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria to estimate the immunization level of the population as of February 2021. We ran several simulations of an uncontrolled epidemic wave with varying initial immunization scenarios to assess the effect on the effective reproduction number. We also used a classic differential equation SIR-model to cross-validate the simulation model. As of February 2021, 14.7% of the Austrian population has been affected by a SARS-CoV-2 infection which causes a 9% reduction of the effective reproduction number and a 24.7% reduction of the prevalence peak compared to a fully susceptible population.

One method for obtaining community input is crowdsourcing, which involves having a group of individuals work to solve a problem and then publicly share solutions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a crowdsourcing open call as an approach to COVID-19 university community engagement and strategic planning. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study assessed a crowdsourcing open call offered from June 16 to July 16, 2020, that sought ideas to inform safety in the fall 2020 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Digital methods (email and social media) were used for promotion, and submissions were collected online for 4 weeks. Participation was open to UNC students, staff, faculty, and others. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Submissions were evaluated for innovation, feasibility, inclusivity, and potential to improve safety and well-being. Demographic data were collected from submitting individuals, and submissions were qualitatively analyzed for emergent themes on challenges with and solutions for addressing safety and well-being in the fall semester. Data were shared with UNC leadership to inform decision-making. RESULTS: The open call received 82 submissions from 110 participants, including current UNC students (56 submissions [68%]), people younger than 30 years (67 [82%]), women (55 [67%]), and individuals identifying as a racial/ethnic minority or as multiracial/ethnic (49 [60%]). Seven submissions were identified as finalists and received cash prizes with the encouragement to use these funds toward idea development and implementation. Seventeen runner-up teams were linked to university resources for further development. Thematic analysis of submissions regarding challenges with the fall semester revealed not only physical health concerns and the limitations of remote learning but also challenges that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, such as a lack of mental health support, structural racism and inequality, and insufficient public transportation. Solutions included novel ideas to support mental health among specific populations (eg, graduate students and racial/ethnic minorities), improve health equity, and increase transit access. All 24 finalists and runners-up indicated interest in implementation after being notified of the open call results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that open calls are a feasible strategy for university community engagement on COVID-19, providing a stakeholder-driven approach to identifying promising ideas for enhancing safety and well-being. Open calls could be formally incorporated into university planning processes to develop COVID-19 safety strategies that are responsive to diverse community members concerns.","output":"Assessment of a Crowdsourcing Open Call for Approaches to University Community Engagement and Strategic Planning During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are considered as potential obesogens that may affect adipose tissue development and functioning, thus promoting obesity. However, various POPs may have different mechanisms of action. The objective of the present review is to discuss the key mechanisms linking exposure to POPs to adipose tissue dysfunction and obesity. Laboratory data clearly demonstrate that the mechanisms associated with the interference of exposure to POPs with obesity include: (a) dysregulation of adipogenesis regulators (PPAR and C/EBP); (b) affinity and binding to nuclear receptors; (c) epigenetic effects; and/or (d) proinflammatory activity. Although in vivo data are generally corroborative of the in vitro results, studies in living organisms have shown that the impact of POPs on adipogenesis is affected by biological factors such as sex, age, and period of exposure. Epidemiological data demonstrate a significant association between exposure to POPs and obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disturbances (e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome), although the existing data are considered insufficient. In conclusion, both laboratory and epidemiological data underline the significant role of POPs as environmental obesogens. However, further studies are required to better characterize both the mechanisms and the dose/concentration-response effects of exposure to POPs in the development of obesity and other metabolic diseases.","output":"The Role of Persistent Organic Pollutants in Obesity: A Review of Laboratory and Epidemiological Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Groninger Veenkoloni?n, a former peat region in the northeast of the Netherlands, persistent poverty is more prevalent compared to other rural regions in the country. Grounded in participant observations and supplemented by in-depth interviews capturing the social life history of 21 participants, this paper paints a detailed picture of the social networks and class practices of those experiencing persisting poverty in the examined town and surrounding region. In addition, we explore the relations between the rural context and lived experiences of class and poverty. Our findings highlight the complex experience as well as spatial embeddedness of persisting poverty. We find that, although the specific circumstances to which the participants are exposed vary greatly, the repercussions in terms of the characteristics of their social networks and practices are very similar. In general, the social networks of participants are fragmented and small, tightly knit, and characterized by clear power imbalances. The most formative experiences that result in the isolation of networks of poor are found to occur in the home and family situation during childhood years. We argue that poverty and the region's history are intricately interwoven resulting in a socio-spatial stigma which in turn contributes to the persistent and intergenerational character of poverty in the rural context of our study.

The S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity was recently attributed to nsp14, whereas nsp16 has been predicted to be the AdoMet-dependent (nucleoside-2O)-methyltransferase. Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation in vitro. We show that mRNA cap methylation requires a third viral protein, nsp10, which acts as an essential trigger to complete RNA cap-1 formation. The obligate sequence of methylation events is initiated by nsp14, which first methylates capped RNA transcripts to generate cap-0 (7Me)GpppA-RNAs. The latter are then selectively 2O-methylated by the 2O-MTase nsp16 in complex with its activator nsp10 to give rise to cap-1 (7Me)GpppA(2OMe)-RNAs.

A total of 101 pieces of false information made available online were diagnosed, of which every fourth news item (25.74%) appeared in opinion-forming media (three most popular news portals and all traditional media were taken into account). The qualitative analysis shows that publishing false information in the opinion-forming media is the result of changes in the journalistic work environment (especially declining standards of work, a desire to attract the attention of the media audience and the pursuit of the media organisations' own interests).

Patients with COVID-19 experience a variety of psychological problems during the disease. Understanding patients mental condition and their distress during the disease is the first step to help these patients. So, the aim of this study was to explain COVID-19 patients experiences of psychological distress during the disease course. METHODS: The present qualitative research was conducted in Iran from April 2020 to April 2021 using the conventional content analysis method. The participants included patients with COVID-19, selected by the purposeful sampling method. Data was collected through 34 telephone and in-person interviews and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. RESULTS: Qualitative data analysis led to the emergence of sources of psychological distress as the main theme as well as seven categories and seven sub-categories. The categories were the diseases nature (the subcategories of diseases unknown dimensions, and disease severity), the anxiety caused by preventive behaviors (the subcategories of quarantine, worry about transmitting the infection to others and obsessive thoughts related to disinfection measures), the inefficient management by the health system (the subcategories of poor health care condition and lack of spiritual care), death anxiety, stigma, anxiety after recovery, and sleep pattern disturbance. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 experience great psychological distress during the acute phase of the disease or even long after recovery. It is suggested that psychological and spiritual counseling, as a key element of treatment and support for these patients, is provided to patients in the acute phase of the disease, as well as after recovery.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical characteristics of 175 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected and analyzed. Univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select variables. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in COVID-19 progression. We established a nomogram to evaluate the probability of progression of the condition of a patient with COVID-19 to severe within three weeks of disease onset. The nomogram was verified using calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: A total of 18 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the laboratory parameters (P<.05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out 10 risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were age (OR 1.035, 95% CI 1.017-1.054; P<.001), CK level (OR 1.002, 95% CI 1.0003-1.0039; P=.02), CD4 count (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.998; P=.002), CD8 % (OR 1.007, 95% CI 1.004-1.012, P<.001), CD8 count (OR 0.881, 95% CI 0.835-0.931; P<.001), and C3 count (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.945-24.691; P=.003).

At day 0, 8 weeks after the last treatment, the microarray profiles revealed significant prechallenge differences between treatment groups; data from the best-protected animals led to identification of a network of genes related to B cell development and lymphocyte survival. At peak viremia, expression profiles of the immunized groups were extremely similar, and comparisons to control animals reflected immunological differences other than effector T cell functions. Suggested protective mechanisms for vaccinated animals included upregulation of interleukin-27, a cytokine known to inhibit lentivirus replication, and increased expression of complement components, which may synergize with vaccine-induced antibodies.

In this context, we study whether and how health workers can be leveraged to promote the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. METHODS: We employed an information experiment with health workers in Germany to quantify how access to information related to (i) AstraZenecas vaccine safety, (ii) misinformation, (iii) individual health risks, and (iv) public health risks can sway health workers recommendations for any of the following vaccines: AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm, and Sputnik-V. The information experiment was conducted as a randomized controlled trial with four treatment arms and was embedded in an online survey. RESULTS: Health workers reduce their willingness to recommend four out of six vaccines once they learn about different statements of European and German health authorities with respect to the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Consistent with the discussion on AstraZenecas safety focusing on possible side effects among younger women, we find that especially female health workers become less likely to recommend the majority of COVID-19 vaccines. Lastly, we show that health workers vaccine recommendations are not affected by misinformation and appeals to individual or public health. CONCLUSION: In order to mobilize health workers in the fight against vaccine hesitancy, information campaigns need to be tailor-made for the target audience. In particular, health workers react to different types of information than the general public. As with the general public, we provide suggestive evidence that health workers require unambigious messages from drug authorities in order to support vaccination efforts. We believe that a more coordinated and coherent approach of public authorities can reduce the amount of mixed signals that health workers receive and therefore contribute to health workers engagement in the outroll of mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.

Method Twenty-five patients with 40 liver lesions of different histological origin were retrospectively analysed. Lesions were ablated following standard protocol, using 1) conventional US-guidance, 2) manual registered volume navigation (mVNav), 3) automatic registered (aVNav) or 4) CT-guidance. In case of ultrasonographically inconspicuous lesions, conventional US-guidance was abandoned and mVNav was used. If mVNav was also unsuccessful, the procedure was either continued with aVNav or CT-guidance. The number, size and location of the lesions targeted using the different approaches were documented. Results Of the 40 lesions, sixteen (40.0 %) could be targeted with conventional US-guidance only, sixteen (40.0 %) with mVNav, three (7.5 %) with aVNav and five (12.5 %) only through the use of CT-guidance. Of the three alternatives (mVNav, aVNav and CT only) the mean size of the lesions targeted using mVNav (9.1  4.6 mm) was significantly smaller from those targeted using US-guidance only (20.4  9.4 mm; p < 0.001). The location of the lesions did not influence the selection of the modality used to guide the ablation. Conclusions In our cohort, mVNav allowed the ablation procedure to become less dependent on the use of CT. mVNav supported the ablation of lesions smaller than those that could be ablated with US only and doubled the application of minimally-invasive US-guided ablations.","output":"Assessing the value of volume navigation during ultrasound-guided radiofrequency- and microwave-ablations of liver lesions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO(2) cannot presently be predicted due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms and metabolic signals that regulate photosynthetic gene expression. We have examined acclimation by comparing changes in the leaf content of RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) with changes in the transcripts of Rubisco subunit genes and with leaf carbohydrate metabolism. When grown at 1000 mm(3) dm(C3) CO(2), 12 of 16 crop species at peak vegetative growth had a 15C44% decrease in leaf Rubisco protein, but with no specific association with changes in transcript levels measured at midday. Species with only modest reductions in Rubisco content (10C20%) often had a large reduction in Rubisco small subunit gene mRNAs (> 30%), with no reduction in large subunit gene mRNAs. However, species with a very large reduction in Rubisco content generally had only small reductions in transcript mRNAs. Photosynthetic acclimation also was not specifically associated with a change in the level of any particular carbohydrate measured at midday. However, a threshold relationship was found between the reduction in Rubisco content at high CO(2) and absolute levels of soluble acid invertase activity measured in plants grown at ambient or high CO(2). This relationship was valid for 15 of the 16 species examined. There also occurred a similar, albeit less robust, threshold relationship between the leaf hexose/sucrose ratio at high CO(2) and a reduced photosynthetic capacity  20%.

The 2013C2016 outbreak in Western Africa caused unfathomable morbidity and mortality (over 11,000 deaths), and the second largest outbreak is on-going in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first stage of an Ebolavirus infection is entry, culminating in delivery of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. Among enveloped viruses, Ebolaviruses use a complex entry pathway: they bind to attachment factors on cell surfaces, are engulfed by macropinocytosis, and traffic through the endosomal system. En route, the receptor binding subunit of the glycoprotein (GP) is reduced from ~130 to ~19 kDa by cathepsins. This event allows cleaved GP (GP(cl)) to bind to Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), its endosomal receptor. The virus then fuses with a late endosomal membrane, but how this occurs remains a subject of debate. An early, but standing, observation is that entry of particles bearing GP(cl) is inhibited by agents that raise endosomal pH or inhibit cysteine proteases, suggesting the need for an additional factor(s). Yet, some have concluded that NPC1 is sufficient to trigger the fusion activity of GP(cl). Here, we re-examined this question using sensitive cell-cell and pseudovirus-cell fusion assays. We did not observe detectable GP(cl)-mediated fusion with NPC1 or its GP(cl) binding domain at any pH tested, while robust fusion was consistently observed with GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus at low pH. Addition of proposed fusion-enhancing factorscations (Ca(++) and K(+)), a reducing agent, the anionic lipid Bis(Monoacylglycero)Phosphate, and a mixture of cathepsins B and Ldid not induce detectable fusion. Our findings are in line with the earlier proposal that an additional factor is required to trigger the full fusion activity of GP(cl) after binding to NPC1.

Besides this, there are no simple but still reliable tools to predict C(p) data on buildings with arbitrary shapes and surrounding conditions, which means a significant limitation to NV modeling in real applications. For this reason, the present contribution proposes a novel cloud-based platform to predict wind pressure coefficients on buildings. The platform comprises a set of tools for performing fully unattended computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer and getting reliable C(p) data for actual scenarios. CFD-expert decisions throughout the entire workflow are implemented to automatize the generation of the computational domain, the meshing procedure, the solution stage, and the post-processing of the results. To evaluate the performance of the platform, an exhaustive validation against wind tunnel experimental data is carried out for a wide range of case studies. These include buildings with openings, balconies, irregular floor-plans, and surrounding urban environments. The C(p) results are in close agreement with experimental data, reducing 60%C77% the prediction error on the openings regarding the EnergyPlus software.

MIS-C is common in Hispanic and black children in Europe and North America, with few reports in East Asians. A significant portion of patients with MIS-C develop Kawasaki disease (KD)-like symptoms. Therefore, differential diagnosis is challenging, especially in East Asia, where KD is most prevalent. No Japanese cases have been reported in the literatures so far. We report a case of MIS-C in Japan with KD-like symptoms. A 9-year-old Japanese boy, who was infected with SARS-CoV2 1 month previously along with his family, was admitted to our hospital owing to fever for 6 d and erythema mainly in the groyne and pubic area. He also had conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue and diarrhoea. His laboratory findings were as follows: WBC, 12,840/L (lymphocytes, 4%); CRP, 22.6 mg/dL, pro-calcitonin, 1.8 ng/mL (normal, <0.50 ng/mL); NT pro-BNP, 7627 pg/mL (<125 pg/mL); and troponin T, 0.14 ng/mL (<0.01 ng/mL). His cardiac function was normal. We initially diagnosed him with KD. His fever rapidly resolved with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and there were no coronary artery lesions. Desquamation of the fingers was observed later. Finally, a history of SARS-COV2 infection, his age, atypical skin rash, elevation of markers of inflammation and heart failure and lymphopenia suggested the diagnosis of MIS-C rather than KD. Differentiation between KD and MIS-C is necessary even in Japan, especially in patients with atypical features of KD.","output":"A case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in a Japanese boy: with discussion of cytokine profile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the article is to study the mental states factors of primary school pupils' anxiety during the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The psychological factors of school anxiety and fears are theoretically substantiated. The methodological starting points of the empirical study are distinguished. The combination of psychological and physiological semantic parameters of the phenomenon is taken into account. Valid psychodiagnostic methods were used. The structure of mental states of pupils' anxiety, which consisted of five main factors F1-F5 (D = 76.371;V = 20.005), was studied by factor analysis of ANOVA. It is established that the principal is the mental state F1 \\"School anxiety\\" (D = 38.029;V = 9.962), which is interrelated with the mental state F4 \\"Self-realization anxiety\\" (D = 9.711;V = 2.544) (rs=-.443;p.01) and the mental state F2 \\"Emotional-expressive anxiety\\" (D=16.057;V=4.206) (rs=.373;p.01). It was established and grounded that the mental state F5 \\"Isolation-physiological anxiety\\" (D=4.529;V=1.186) is suicidal.

The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled gene analysis at a reasonable cost. AIM Describe a collaboration between Cuban and Spanish researchers to identify candidate variants and investigate the molecular epidemiology of 106 Cuban haemophilia patients using NGS. PATIENTS/METHODS The molecular analysis protocol included well-established LR-PCR procedures to detect F8 inversions, NGS with a 30-gene panel to sequence F8 and F9, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to identify large structural variants. RESULTS One-hundred and thirty-one candidate variants were identified along F8, F9, and VWF; 72 were unique and 28 (39%) had not been previously recorded. Putative variants were identified in 105/106 patients. Molecular characterization enabled confirmation and reclassification of: 90 HA (85%), 15 HB (14%), and one type 2N VWD (1%). Null variants leading to non-production of FVIII or FIX were common in severe HA (64%), moderate HA (74%), and severe HB (60%), whereas missense variants were frequent in mild HA (57%) and moderate or mild HB (83%). Additional variants in VWF were identified in 16 patients. CONCLUSION This is the first description of the molecular epidemiology of HA and HB in Cuba. Variants identified in index cases will be of value for local implementation of familial studies and prenatal diagnosis using the molecular approaches available in Cuba. The results of this protocolled genetic study improved the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and will facilitate management of these patients.","output":"Molecular study of a large cohort of 109 haemophilia patients from Cuba using a gene panel with next generation sequencing-based technology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel member of the family Coronaviridae, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies revealed the emergence of virus variants with substitutions in the spike and/or nucleocapsid and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins that are partly responsible for enhanced transmission and reduced or escaped anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that may reduce the efficacy of antibodies and vaccines against the first identified SARS-CoV-2 strains. In order to gain insight into the emergence and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the South American region, a comprehensive phylogenetic study of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in this region was performed. The results of these studies revealed sharp increase in virus effective population size from March to April of 2020. At least 62 different genotypes were found to circulate in this region. Variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta co-circulate in the region, together with variants of interest (VOIs) Lambda, Mu and Zeta. Most of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the South American region belongs to B.1 genotypes and have substitutions in the spike and/or nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins that confer high transmissibility and/or immune resistance. 148 amino acid positions of the spike protein and 70 positions of the nucleocapsid were found to have substitutions in different variants isolated in the region by comparison with reference strain Wuhan-Hu-1. Significant differences in codon usage among spike genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in South America was found, which can be linked to SARS-CoV-2 genotypes.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the South American region: Genetic relations and vaccine strain match"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports to date have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have a negative impact on individuals mental health.

Yet, poorer segments of the population cannot afford to stay at home and must continue to work. In this paper, we test whether work-related mobility is effectively influenced by the local intensity of poverty. To do so, we exploit poverty data and Google mobility data for 242 regions of nine Latin American and African countries. We find that the drop in work-related mobility during the first lockdown period was indeed significantly lower in high-poverty regions compared to other regions. We also illustrate how higher poverty has induced a faster spread of the virus. The policy implication is that social protection measures in the form of food or cash transfers must be complementary to physical distancing measures. Further research must evaluate how such transfers, when implemented, have attenuated the difference between poor and non-poor regions in terms of exposure to the virus.","output":"Poverty and COVID-19 in Africa and Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Social distancing is crucial in order to flatten the curve of COVID-19 virus spreading. Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. RESULTS: The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. CONCLUSIONS: The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid. This change in individual basic needs has triggered a relevant transformation in individual emotional status and a shift towards negative emotions.","output":"A nation-wide survey on emotional and psychological impacts of COVID-19 social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Infants after cardiopulmonary bypass are exposed to increasing inflammatory mediator release and are at risk of developing fluid overload. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of passive peritoneal drainage on achieving negative fluid balance and its ability to dispose of inflammatory cytokines. METHODS From September 2014 to November 2016, infants undergoing STAT category 3, 4, and 5 operations were randomized to receive or not receive intraoperative prophylactic peritoneal drain. We analyzed time to negative fluid balance and perioperative variables for each group. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured from serum and peritoneal fluid in the passive peritoneal drainage group and serum in the control group postoperatively. RESULTS Infants were randomized to prophylactic passive peritoneal drain group (n = 13) and control (n = 12). The groups were not significantly different in pre- and postoperative peak lactate levels, postoperative length of stay, and mortality. Peritoneal drain patients reached time to negative fluid balance at a median of 1.42 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.00-2.91), whereas the control at 3.08 (IQR: 1.67-3.88; P = .043). Peritoneal drain patients had lower diuretic index at 72 hours, median of 2.86 (IQR: 1.21-4.94) versus 6.27 (IQR: 4.75-11.11; P = .006). Consistently, tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and interferon- were present at higher levels in peritoneal fluid than serum at 24 and 72 hours. However, serum cytokine levels in peritoneal drain and control group, at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively, did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS The prophylactic passive peritoneal drain patients reached negative fluid balance earlier and used less diuretic in early postoperative period. The serum cytokine levels did not differ significantly between groups at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively. However, there was no significant difference in mortality and postoperative length of stay.","output":"Passive Peritoneal Drainage Impact on Fluid Balance and Inflammatory Mediators: A Randomized Pilot Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Dexamethasone was the first intervention proven to reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19 being treated in hospital. We aimed to evaluate the adoption of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 in the UK after the RECOVERY trial publication on June 16, 2020, and to identify discrepancies in care. Methods We did an audit of clinical implementation of corticosteroids in a prospective, observational, cohort study in 237 UK acute care hospitals between March 16, 2020, and April 14, 2021, restricted to patients aged 18 years or older with proven or high likelihood of COVID-19, who received supplementary oxygen. The primary outcome was administration of dexamethasone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone. This study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN66726260. Findings Between June 17, 2020, and April 14, 2021, 47 795 (752%) of 63 525 of patients on supplementary oxygen received corticosteroids, higher among patients requiring critical care than in those who received ward care (11 185 [866%] of 12 909 vs 36 415 [724%] of 50 278). Patients 50 years or older were significantly less likely to receive corticosteroids than those younger than 50 years (adjusted odds ratio 079 [95% CI 070C089], p=00001, for 70C79 years;052 [046C058], p<00001, for >80 years), independent of patient demographics and illness severity. 84 (542%) of 155 pregnant women received corticosteroids. Rates of corticosteroid administration increased from 275% in the week before June 16, 2020, to 75C80% in January, 2021. Interpretation Implementation of corticosteroids into clinical practice in the UK for patients with COVID-19 has been successful, but not universal. Patients older than 70 years, independent of illness severity, chronic neurological disease, and dementia, were less likely to receive corticosteroids than those who were younger, as were pregnant women. This could reflect appropriate clinical decision making, but the possibility of inequitable access to life-saving care should be considered.

As vaccine eligibility and availability continue to expand, assuring equitable coverage for disproportionately affected communities remains a priority. CDC examined COVID-19 vaccine administration and 2018 CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) data to ascertain whether inequities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage with respect to county-level SVI have persisted, overall and by urbanicity. Vaccination coverage was defined as the number of persons aged &#8805;18 years (adults) who had received &#8805;1 dose of any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 vaccine divided by the total adult population in a specified SVI category.? SVI was examined overall and by its four themes (socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial/ethnic minority status and language, and housing type and transportation). Counties were categorized into SVI quartiles, in which quartile 1 (Q1) represented the lowest level of vulnerability and quartile 4 (Q4), the highest. Trends in vaccination coverage were assessed by SVI quartile and urbanicity, which was categorized as large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan (areas surrounding large cities, e.g., suburban), medium and small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan counties. During December 14, 2020-May 1, 2021, disparities in vaccination coverage by SVI increased, especially in large fringe metropolitan (e.g., suburban) and nonmetropolitan counties. By May 1, 2021, vaccination coverage was lower among adults living in counties with the highest overall SVI; differences were most pronounced in large fringe metropolitan (Q4 coverage = 45.0% versus Q1 coverage = 61.7%) and nonmetropolitan (Q4 = 40.6% versus Q1 = 52.9%) counties. Vaccination coverage disparities were largest for two SVI themes: socioeconomic status (Q4 = 44.3% versus Q1 = 61.0%) and household composition and disability (Q4 = 42.0% versus Q1 = 60.1%). Outreach efforts, including expanding public health messaging tailored to local populations and increasing vaccination access, could help increase vaccination coverage in high-SVI counties.","output":"Patterns in COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage, by Social Vulnerability and Urbanicity - United States, December 14, 2020-May 1, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory infections caused by viruses such as influenza and coronavirus are a serious global problem due to their high infection rates and potential to spark pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Although preventing these infections by using vaccines has been the most successful strategy to date, effective vaccines are not always available. Therefore, developing broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs to treat such infections is essential, especially in the case of immunocompromised patients, or for outbreaks of novel virus strains. Sialic acids have been highlighted as a key molecule in the viral infection cycle, with terminally sialylated glycans acting as a target for several viral proteins involved in infection, particularly respiratory infection. Inhibitors of one such protein, neuraminidase, are the only anti-influenza drugs currently on the market. Problems with neuraminidase inhibitors, including development of resistance and a relatively narrow spectrum of activity, drive the need for an improved understanding of the viral infection cycle and the development of more resilient, broader-spectrum anti-viral treatments. Hence, this review outlines the various roles played by sialic acids in respiratory viral infection and provides examples of drugs that exploit sialic acids to inhibit viral infections. It has been concluded that drugs targeting host cell expression of sialic acid could be especially well suited to inhibiting a broad spectrum of respiratory infections. This warrants the continued design and improvement of such drugs in an attempt to lessen the burden of respiratory infections.","output":"The Role of Sialylation in Respiratory Viral Infection and Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that is highly associated with several comorbidities. Given the complex and multifaceted nature of TS, the condition is managed by a wide variety of practitioners in different disciplines. The goal of this study was to investigate health service delivery and care practices by clinicians who see TS patients across different geographic settings internationally. Methods: A comprehensive questionnaire was developed to assess clinical care resources for patients with TS and was sent to clinicians in Canada (CA), the United States (US), Europe (EU), and the United Kingdom (UK). Responses were compared quantitatively between geographic regions. Results: The majority of respondents, regardless of region, reported that fewer than 40% of their case-load are patients with tics. The accessibility of TS services varied among regions, as indicated by differences in wait times, telemedicine offerings, comorbidity management and the availability of behavioral therapies. First-line pharmacotherapy preferences varied among physicians in different geographical regions with CA respondents preferring alpha-2-adrenergic agonists and respondents from the UK and EU preferring dopamine receptor antagonists. Discussion: The results suggest that there is a scarcity of specialized TS clinics, potentially making access to services challenging, especially for patients newly diagnosed with TS. Differences in regional pharmacotherapeutic preferences are reflected in various published treatment guidelines in EU and North America. The lack of dedicated specialists and telemedicine availability, coupled with differences in comorbidity management, highlight the need for interprofessional care and holistic management to improve health care delivery to patients with TS.","output":"An International Survey of Health Care Services Available to Patients With Tourette Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread the world resulting in detrimental effects on human health, lives, societies, and economies The state authorities mostly take non-pharmacological actions against the outbreak since there are no confirmed vaccines or treatments yet In this paper, we developed Suspicious-Infected-Death with Non-Pharmacological policies (SpID-N) model to analyze the properties of the COVID-19 casualties and also estimate the future behavior of the outbreak We can state the key contributions of the paper with three folds Firstly, we propose the SpID-N model covering the higher-order internal dynamics which cause the peaks in the casualties Secondly, we parametrize the non-pharmacological policies such as the curfews on people with chronic disease, people age over 65, people age under 20, restrictions on the weekends and holidays, and closure of the schools and universities Thirdly, we explicitly incorporate the internal and coupled dynamics of the model with these multi-dimensional non-pharmacological policies The corresponding higher-order and strongly coupled model has utterly unknown parameters and we construct a batch type Least Square (LS) based optimization algorithm to learn these unknown parameters from the available data The parametric model and the predicted future casualties are analyzed extensively CCBY","output":"Development of a Multi-Dimensional Parametric Model with Non-Pharmacological Policies for Predicting the COVID-19 Pandemic Casualties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It rapidly spread due to strong evidence of human-to-human transmission, resulting in a pandemic throughout the world. Almost all countries around the world, including Qatar, have established guidelines and regulations to limit the spread of the virus and to preserve the health of societies. Unfortunately, these procedures were often associated with some negative effects on individuals' psychological and intellectual well-being, including children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to screen the psychological influence of home isolation and social distancing on children and adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic, and the strategies used to cope with it. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that was undertaken using an online questionnaire administered through SMS. All home-isolated children and adolescents registered in Primary Health Care Corporation aged 7-18 years old were invited to participate in the study. Children and adolescents with intellectual disadvantages were excluded. A P value .05 (two tailed) was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Data were collected from 6608 participants through the period of June 23rd to July 18th, 2020. Almost all the participants followed the official regulations during the period of home isolation and social distancing, however 69.1% of parents expressed their children or adolescents were vulnerable to the virus compared to 25% who expressed they were not vulnerable at all. Higher levels of anger, depression and general anxiety were prevalent amongst 1.3%, 3.9% and 1.6% of participants respectively. The mean score of the emotional constructs anger and depression decreased with the increase of following official instructions, with P value of .04 and .11 respectively. The difference in mean score of all psychological and coping strategies used among participants across the three levels of vulnerability to coronavirus, were statistically significant. The mean score trend varied little with the escalation of the level of vulnerability to the virus. This mild variation can make a difference when sample size is large as in case of this study. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for psychological and social disruptions is of importance to develop strategies by schools and healthcare providers to assess and monitor behavioral changes and negative psychologically during reintegration post-COVID-19. Participants experiencing higher levels of anxieties should be given extra attention during reintegration and transitional phases in schools. Although electronic devices and social media platforms may have lowered the level of anxiety in some cases, it is important to address how electronic devices and social media platforms are used and how content is tailored for children and adolescents. It is also important to maintain an active lifestyle for children and young adults, and encourage them not to neglect their physical health, as it promotes better psychological state of mind.","output":"Psychological and coping strategies of home isolation and social distancing parameters in children and adolescents during COVID 19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/68.md","filePath":"doctor/68.md"}'),V={name:"doctor/68.md"},E=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
