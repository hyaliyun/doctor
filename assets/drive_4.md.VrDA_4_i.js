Case Report: A 33-year-old female patient with a long history of ulcerative colitis, poorly controlled, was admitted with COVID-19 a few days after being discharged from the hospital for treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis. High-risk factors for COVID-19 complications, i.e., high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisone) and severe active disease, were present at admission. Despite the development of extensive pulmonary involvement, the patient had a favorable outcome. Discussion: Management of IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging. Measures to minimize the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including strict social distancing and self-isolation, in the IBD population have been recommended, especially for high-risk patients. Although steroid tapering and persistence of biologics are advised by professional groups, the best treatment strategy for IBD patients presenting a flare during the outbreak has yet to be defined.","output":"Recovery from COVID-19 Pneumonia in a Patient with Acute Severe Colitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les manifestations cutanes lies au SARS-coV-2 sont  ce jour peu connues et souvent sans gravit.

AIM: To test the efficacy of an ultrasonically activated stream for the removal of tissue proteins, including prion-associated amyloid, from surgical stainless steel (SS) surfaces. METHODS: Test surfaces were contaminated with 22L, ME7 or 263K prion infected brain homogenates. The surfaces were treated with the ultrasonically activated water stream for contact times of 5 and 10 seconds. Residual proteinaceous and amyloid contamination were quantified using sensitive microscopic analysis, and immunoblotting was used to characterize the eluted prion residues before and after treatment with the ultrasonically activated stream. FINDINGS: Efficient removal of the different prion strains from the surgical SS surfaces was observed, and reduced levels of protease sensitive and resistant prion protein was detected in recovered supernatant.

METHODS: COVID\\\\19 data of Hubei Province and the next five most affected provinces were collected from daily case reports of COVID\\\\19 on the Health Committee official website of these provinces. The number of current cases, defined as the number of confirmed cases minus the number of cured cases and those who have died, was examined in this study. A modified Susceptible\\\\Exposed\\\\Infectious\\\\ Removed (SEIR) model was used to assess the effects of interventional policies on the epidemic. In this study, January 28 was day zero of the model. RESULTS: The results of the modified SEIR model showed that the number of current cases in Hubei and Zhejiang provinces tended to be stabilized after 70 days and after 60 days in the four other provinces. The predicted number of current cases without policy intervention was shown to far exceed that with policy intervention. The estimated number of COVID\\\\19 cases in Hubei Province with policy intervention was predicted to peak at 51,222, whereas that without policy intervention was predicted to reach 157,721.

A gold diagnostic standard does not exist. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in a cohort of revision for AF, using an experimental diagnostic algorithm. METHODS The surgeons' suspicion of AF was based primarily on patient history and clinical evaluation. X-ray imaging was used to reveal mechanical problems. To rule out an infectious aetiology standard blood biochemical tests were ordered in most patients. Evaluation followed the existing practice in the institute. Cases were included if revision surgery was planned for suspected AF. Intraoperatively, five synovial tissue biopsies were obtained routinely. PJI was defined as 3 positive cultures with the same microorganism(s). Patients were followed for 1 year postoperatively. Protocol samples included joint fluid, additional synovial tissue biopsies, bone biopsy, swabs from the implant surface, and sonication of retrieved components. Routine and protocol samples were cultured with extended incubation (14 days) and preserved for batchwise 16S rRNA gene amplification. Patients were stratified based on culture results and a clinical status was obtained at study end. RESULTS A total of 72 revisions were performed on 71 patients (35 THA and 37 TKA). We found five of 72 cases of unrecognized PJI. Extended culture and protocol samples accounted for two of these. One patient diagnosed with AF was treated for a PJI during follow-up. The remaining patients did not change status from AF during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We found a low prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections in patients with an AF diagnosis.

METHODS A 38-item electronic questionnaire was disseminated through local team email lists between May 22 and June 7, 2020, to HCWs in a university neurosciences center. Burnout was measured using the single-item Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization scales, and wellbeing and QoL assessed using the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment Scale and the EuroQol-5 Dimension instrument. RESULTS The response rate was 57.4% (n=234); 58.2% of respondents were nurses, 69.4% were women and 40.1% were aged 25 to 34 years. Overall, 21.4% of respondents reported burnout assessed by the Emotional Exhaustion scale; burnout was higher for nurses (23.5%) and allied health care professionals (22.5%) compared with doctors (16.4%). HCWs from ethnic minority groups reported a higher rate of burnout (24.5%) compared with white HCWs (15.0%).

Literally millions of premature deaths have been prevented, and countless more children have been saved from disfiguring illness. While vaccinations carry unavoidable risks, the medical, social and economic benefits they confer have led all fifty states to enact compulsory childhood vaccination laws to stop the spread of preventable diseases. Today, however, vaccines are becoming a victim of their success--many individuals have never witnessed the debilitating diseases that vaccines protect against, allowing complacency toward immunization requirements to build. Antivaccination sentiment is growing fast in the United States, in large part due to the controversial and hotly disputed link between immunizations and autism. The internet worsens fears regarding vaccination safety, as at least a dozen websites publish alarming information about the risks of vaccines. Increasing numbers of parents are refusing immunizations for their children and seeking legally sanctioned exemptions instead, apparently fearing vaccines more than the underlying diseases that they protect against. A variety of factors are at play: religious and philosophical beliefs, freedom and individualism, misinformation about risk, and overperception of risk. State legislatures and health departments now face a difficult challenge: respecting individual rights and freedoms while also safeguarding the public welfare. Nearly all states allow vaccination exemptions for religious reasons and a growing number provide \\"philosophical\\" opt-outs as well. However, in all but a handful of jurisdictions, neither objection is seriously documented or verified. Often, the law requires a parent to do no more than simply check a box indicating she does not wish her child to receive immunizations. The problem is exacerbated by financial incentives schools have to encourage students to opt out of vaccinations. The rise in parents opting out has caused the AMA grave concern, with many experts decrying the rise of so-called \\"exemptions of convenience.\\" In some areas, nearly one out of five children have not received their recommended vaccines. The consequences are serious not only for those unprotected children, but for the rest of society as well. \\"Herd immunity\\" is threatened as more and more parents free ride off of the community's dwindling immunity, and outbreaks of diseases thought to have been conquered have already occurred. Lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers threaten them with bankruptcy, costs are being externalized onto the healthcare and legal systems, and vulnerable populations are suffering harm or even death. In the interests of social welfare, state legislatures and health departments should consider methods to ensure that the exemption process is carefully tailored to prevent check-the-box opt-outs of convenience, while still allowing exemptions for those with earnest and informed convictions or medical reasons.","output":"Vanishing vaccinations: why are so many Americans opting out of vaccinating their children?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across multiple experiments, we found that Americans misestimated the growth of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and that these estimates were in turn related to peoples forecasts of the duration of social distancing orders, and their own future adherence to these orders.

Secondary aims were to assess whether length of time on the waiting list influenced quality of life and rate of deferral of surgery. METHODS: During the study period (August and September 2020) 843 patients (THA n = 394, KA n = 449) from ten centres in the UK reported their EuroQol five dimension (EQ-5D) scores and completed a waiting list questionnaire (2020 group). Patient demographic details, procedure, and date when listed were recorded. Patients scoring less than zero for their EQ-5D score were defined to be in a health state \\"worse than death\\" (WTD). Data from a retrospective cohort (January 2014 to September 2017) were used as the control group. RESULTS: The 2020 group had a significantly worse EQ-5D score compared to the control group for both THA (p < 0.001) and KA (p < 0.001). Over one-third (35.0%, n = 138/394) of patients waiting for a THA and nearly a quarter (22.3%, n = 100/449) for KA were in a health state WTD, which was significantly greater than the control group (odds ratio 2.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.93) and 2.08 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.70), respectively; p < 0.001). Over 80% (n = 680/843) of the 2020 group felt that their quality of life had deteriorated while waiting. Each additional month spent on the waiting list was independently associated with a decrease in quality of life (EQ-5D: -0.0135, p = 0.004). There were 117 (13.9%) patients who wished to defer their surgery and the main reason for this was health concerns for themselves and or their family (99.1%, n = 116/117). CONCLUSION: Over one-third of patients waiting for THA and nearly one-quarter waiting for a KA were in a state WTD, which was approaching double that observed prior to the pandemic.

However, our understanding of the causes and consequences of individual variation in RMR in the wild is hampered by a lack of data, as well as analytical challenges. RMR measurements in the wild are generally characterized by large measurement errors and a strong dependency on mass. The latter is problematic when assessing the ability of RMR to evolve independently of mass. Mixed models provide a powerful and flexible tool to tackle these challenges, but they have rarely been used to estimate repeatability of mass-independent RMR from field data. We used respirometry to obtain repeated measurements of RMR in a long-term study population of snow voles (Chionomys nivalis) inhabiting an environment subject to large circadian and seasonal fluctuations in temperature. Using both uni- and bivariate mixed models, we quantify individual repeatability in RMR and decompose repeatability into mass-dependent and mass-independent components, while accounting for measurement error. RMR varies among individuals, i.e. is repeatable (R=0.46), and strongly co-varies with BM. Indeed, much of the repeatability of RMR is attributable to individual variation in BM, and the repeatability of mass-independent RMR is reduced by 41% to R=0.27. These empirical results suggest that the evolutionary potential of RMR independent of mass may be severely constrained. This study illustrates how to leverage bivariate mixed models to model field data for metabolic traits, correct for measurement error, and decompose the relative importance of mass-dependent and mass-independent physiological variation.","output":"Limited mass-independent individual variation in resting metabolic rate in a wild population of snow voles (Chionomys nivalis)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) disruption, rheumatic disease flare/activity, and prolonged COVID-19 symptom duration among COVID-19 survivors with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs).

This effect is often enhanced when the gazing face bears an emotional expression, though this finding is modulated by a number of factors. Here, we tested whether the type of task performed might be one such modulating factor. Target localization and target discrimination tasks are the two most commonly used gaze cueing tasks, and they arguably differ in cognitive resources, which could impact how emotional expression and gaze cues are integrated to orient attention. In a within-subjects design, participants performed both target localization and discrimination gaze cueing tasks with neutral, happy, and fearful faces. The gaze cueing effect for neutral faces was greatly reduced in the discrimination task relative to the localization task, and the emotional enhancement of the gaze cueing effect was only present in the localization task and only when this task was performed first. These results suggest that cognitive resources are needed for gaze cueing and for the integration of emotional expressions and gaze cues. We propose that a shift toward local processing may be the mechanism by which the discrimination task interferes with the emotional modulation of gaze cueing. The results support the idea that gaze cueing can be greatly modulated by top-down influences and cognitive resources and thus taps into endogenous attention.

The results showed that the infection risk perception of self and others were both associated with the preventive behaviors, but the social pressure was not. The results were unclear in regard to optimistic/pessimistic views for infection risk perception and prospect for the end of coronavirus outbreak. Surprisingly, information spreading via SNS was negatively associated with knowledge of COVID-19, which calls attention to the credibility of information on SNS. In addition, subjective evaluation of achievement in regard to preventive behaviors was higher for self than for other people.

The molecular mechanisms that govern enhanced susceptibility of elderly populations are not known, and robust animal models are needed that recapitulate the increased pathogenic phenotype noted with increasing age. Using synthetic biology and reverse genetics, we describe the construction of a panel of isogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains bearing variant spike glycoproteins that are representative of zoonotic strains found in palm civets and raccoon dogs, as well as isolates spanning the early, middle, and late phases of the SARS-CoV epidemic. The recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in cell culture and demonstrated variable sensitivities to neutralization with antibodies. The human but not the zoonotic variants replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cultures, supporting earlier hypotheses that zoonotic isolates are less pathogenic in humans but can evolve into highly pathogenic strains. All viruses replicated efficiently, but none produced clinical disease or death in young animals. In contrast, severe clinical disease, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, alveolitis, and death were noted in 12-month-old mice inoculated with the palm civet HC/SZ/61/03 strain or early-human-phase GZ02 variants but not with related middle- and late-phase epidemic or raccoon dog strains. This panel of SARS-CoV recombinants bearing zoonotic and human epidemic spike glycoproteins will provide heterologous challenge models for testing vaccine efficacy against zoonotic reintroductions as well as provide the appropriate model system for elucidating the complex virus-host interactions that contribute to more-severe and fatal SARS-CoV disease and acute respiratory distress in the elderly.","output":"Synthetic reconstruction of zoonotic and early human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolates that produce fatal disease in aged mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : Olfactory (OD) and gustatory (GD) dysfunction have been proven to be a typical symptom of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.

Methods: Fifty-two patients with IgAV aged 1C6 years and 54 healthy children were included. Cases age, sex, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), RNFL thicknesses, and choroidal thickness values were recorded. Results: Median foveal center choroidal thickness was 374.0 m (315.0 to 452.0 m) in the IgAV group and 349.5 m (285.0 to 442.0 m) in the control group (p = 0.001).

Choroidal and RNFL thicknesses were significantly greater in all quadrants in the IgAV group than in the control group. No correlation was determined between ESR or CRP and foveal center choroidal and average RNFL thicknesses. Conclusions: Our findings show that choroidal and RNFL thicknesses increased significantly in children undergoing childhood IgA vasculitis compared to the healthy control group.

Since the proportion of snakes in bushmeat gradually increases, human pentastomiasis is an emerging zoonotic disease. To substantiate the significance of this threat, we surveyed snakes offered for human consumption at bushmeat markets in the Kole district, Democratic Republic of the Congo, for the presence of adult pentastomids. In Bitis vipers (n = 40), Armillifer spp. infestations exhibited an 87.5% prevalence and 6.0 median intensity. Parasite abundance covaried positively with viper length, but not with body mass. In pythons (n = 13), Armillifer spp. exhibited a 92.3% prevalence and 3.5 median intensity. The positive correlations between parasite abundance and python length or mass were statistically nonsignificant. Ninety-one percent of A. grandis were discovered in vipers and 97% of infected vipers hosted A. grandis, whereas 81% of A. armillatus specimens were found in pythons and 63% of infected pythons hosted A. armillatus. Thus, challenging the widespread notion of strict host specificity, we found reversed infections and even a case of coinfection.

In addition, over the last two years the predominant pharmaceutical public health response to COVID-19 has been vaccination momentum (i.e. mass and rapid inoculation campaigns). This paper aims to compare vaccination momentum throughout 2021 and measures of population wellness to estimate the relative impact of each on deaths attributed to COVID-19 across the 50 States of America, plus Washington DC, during 2020 (i.e. the pre-vaccination period) and 2021 (i.e. the vaccination period). Our analysis shows that: (a) COVID-19 rates of death in 2020 are more important, and statistically more significant, at predicting rates of death in 2021 than vaccination momentum during 2021; (b) vaccination momentum does not predict the magnitude of change in COVID-19 rates of death between 2020 and 2021; and (c) for several underlying heath and risk factors vaccination momentum is significantly less important than population wellness at predicting COVID-19 rates of death. Of particular interest are our observations that exercise and fruit consumption are 10.1 times more significant at predicting COVID-19 deaths than vaccination momentum, obesity (BMI 30+) is 9.6 times more significant at predicting COVID-19 deaths than vaccination momentum, heart attacks are 4.37 times more significant at predicting COVID-19 deaths than vaccination momentum and smoking is 3.2 times more significant at predicting COVID-19 deaths than vaccination momentum. If medical and health regulators are to deliver a quantum decrease in COVID-19 deaths they must move beyond the overwhelming focus on COVID-19 vaccination.

Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins, namely Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and Nucleoprotein N proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interplays during the assembly process of this new virus are poorly-defined and are likely {beta}-coronavirus-type different. Therefore, we sought to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 behaves for its assembly by expression assays of S, in combination with E, M and/or N. By combining biochemical and imaging assays, we showed that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S and hence its furin-mediated processing. Indeed, our imaging data revealed that S remains at ERGIC or Golgi compartments upon expression of E or M, like for SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. By studying a mutant of S, we showed that its cytoplasmic tail, and more specifically, its C-terminal retrieval motif, is required for the M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlighted that E and M induce a specific maturation of S N-glycosylation, which is observed on particles and lysates from infected cells independently of its mechanisms of intracellular retention. Finally, we showed that both M, E and N are required for optimal production of virus-like-proteins. Altogether, our results indicated that E and M proteins influence the properties of S proteins to promote assembly of viral particles. Our results therefore highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other {beta}-coronaviruses.

Its viral particles are composed of four structural proteins, namely Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and Nucleoprotein N proteins, though their involvement in the virion assembly remain unknown for this particular coronavirus. Here we showed that presence of E and M influence the localization and maturation of S protein, in term of cleavage and N-glycosylation maturation. Indeed, E protein is able to slow down the cell secretory pathway whereas M-induced retention of S requires the retrieval motif in S C-terminus. We also highlighted that E and M might regulate the N glycosylation maturation of S independently of its intracellular retention mechanism. Finally, we showed that the four structural proteins are required for optimal formation of virus-like particles, highlighting the involvement of N, E and M in assembly of infectious particles.

The fusion peptide (FP), a short peptide segment in the spike protein, plays a central role in the initial penetration of the virus into the host cell membrane, followed by the fusion of the two membranes. Here, we use an array of molecular dynamics simulations that take advantage of the highly mobile membrane mimetic model to investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV2 FP with a lipid bilayer representing mammalian cellular membranes at an atomic level and to characterize the membrane-bound form of the peptide. Six independent systems were generated by changing the initial positioning and orientation of the FP with respect to the membrane, and each system was simulated in five independent replicas, each for 300 ns. In 73% of the simulations, the FP reaches a stable, membrane-bound configuration, in which the peptide deeply penetrated into the membrane. Clustering of the results reveals three major membrane-binding modes (binding modes 1-3), in which binding mode 1 populates over half of the data points. Taking into account the sequence conservation among the viral FPs and the results of mutagenesis studies establishing the role of specific residues in the helical portion of the FP in membrane association, the significant depth of penetration of the whole peptide, and the dense population of the respective cluster, we propose that the most deeply inserted membrane-bound form (binding mode 1) represents more closely the biologically relevant form.

Overall, 1,000 clinical samples (600 samples SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 200 samples from influenza infected patients and 200 negative samples) were analyzed. RESULTS: The assay developed was able to detect and discriminate each virus target, and to intercept co-infections. The limit of quantification of each assay ranged between 5 and 10 genomic copy numbers, with a cutoff value of 37.7 and 37.8 for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, respectively.

In addition, the Polish immigrants also answered questions about acculturation to Norway. The results showed that the Polish immigrants in Norway had less positive attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination than the Norwegians, while they did not differ from Polish living in Poland. The Polish immigrants also indicated lower trust in the Norwegian health care system than the Norwegians. In regression analysis, the trust in the values of the health care system was the most important predictor of COVID-19 vaccination attitudes in all three samples. A path model showed that trust in the values of the health care system mediated the effects of acculturation to Norway on COVID-19 vaccination attitudes among Polish immigrants.

The most significant merits for this protocol were smooth and clean catalysis at room temperature with excellent productivity, sustainable conditions, ease of separation of catalyst from the reaction mixture by using a magnetic bar and most importantly reusability of the catalyst at least 8 times without any pre-activation, minimum loss of activity and considerable leaching.","output":"In situ decoration of Au NPs over polydopamine encapsulated GO/Fe3O4 nanoparticles as a recyclable nanocatalyst for the reduction of nitroarenes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (R(0)) is a term that describes the expected number of infections generated by 1 case in a susceptible population. At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, R(0) was frequently referenced by the public health community and the wider public. However, this metric is often misused or misinterpreted. Moreover, the complexity of the process of estimating R(0) has caused difficulties for a substantial number of researchers. In this article, in order to increase the accessibility of this concept, we address several misconceptions related to the threshold characteristics of R(0) and the effective reproduction number (R(t)). Moreover, the appropriate interpretation of the metrics is discussed. R(0) should be considered as a population-averaged value that pools the contact structure according to a stochastic transmission process. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand the unavoidable time lag for R(t) due to the incubation period of the disease.","output":"Interpretation of the Basic and Effective Reproduction Number"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Swine influenza virus (SIV) has a strong tropism for pig respiratory mucosa, which consists of a mucus layer, epithelium, basement membrane and lamina propria. Sialic acids present on the epithelial surface have long been considered to be determinants of influenza virus tropism. However, mucus which is also rich in sialic acids may serve as the first barrier of selection. It was investigated how influenza virus interacts with the mucus to infect epithelial cells. Two techniques were applied to track SIV H1N1 in porcine mucus. The microscopic diffusion of SIV particles in the mucus was analyzed by single particle tracking (SPT), and the macroscopic penetration of SIV through mucus was studied by a virus in-capsule-mucus penetration system, followed by visualizing the translocation of the virions with time by immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, the effects of neuraminidase on SIV getting through or binding to the mucus were studied by using zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI), and Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase. The distribution of the diffusion coefficient shows that 70% of SIV particles were entrapped, while the rest diffused freely in the mucus. Additionally, SIV penetrated the porcine mucus with time, reaching a depth of 65 m at 30 min post virus addition, 2 fold of that at 2 min. Both the microscopic diffusion and macroscopic penetration were largely diminished by NAI, while were clearly increased by the effect of exogenous neuraminidase. Moreover, the exogenous neuraminidase sufficiently prevented the binding of SIV to mucus which was reversely enhanced by effect of NAI. These findings clearly show that the neuraminidase helps SIV move through the mucus, which is important for the virus to reach and infect epithelial cells and eventually become shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract.","output":"A Beneficiary Role for Neuraminidase in Influenza Virus Penetration through the Respiratory Mucus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To study clinical features of myocarditis and its possible mechanisms (including persistence of SARS-Cov-2 in the myocardium) in the long-term period after acute COVID-19. Methods: Fifteen patients (8 male and 7 female, mean age 47.813.4, 24-65 years) diagnosed with postcovid myocarditis were included in the study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by positive PCR results in 40%, and seroconversion in all patients. The average time of admission after COVID-19 was 4 [3;7] months, from 2 to 9 months. The diagnosis of myocarditis was confirmed by cardiac MRI in 10 patients and by right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) in 6 patients. The PCR for cardiotropic viruses and PCR with immunohistochemical study for SARSCov2 detection were used. All patients had study for anti-heart antibodies (AHA), EchoCG, and Holter ECG. Coronary atherosclerosis was excluded in all patients over 40 years (7 coronary angiography, 4 cardiac CT). Results: A clear association of the cardiac symptoms with a previous new coronavirus infection was noted in all patients. The symptoms started 1-5 months following COVID-19. MRI showed subepicardial and intramyocardial LGE, signs of hyperemia, increased T1 relaxation time, edema. AHA levels were increased 3-4-fold in 73%. Two variants of postcovid myocarditis were observed. 1. Arrhythmic variant (n=6) - newly developed frequent supraventricular or ventricular extrasystole, recurrent atrial fibrillation in the absence of systolic dysfunction. 2. Decompensated variant with biventricular heart failure (n=9): the mean LV EF was 34.17.8% (23 to 46%), LV EDD 5.80.7 cm, EDV 153.846.1 ml, pulmonary artery systolic pressure 40.711.2 mmHg. In one case, myocarditis was accompanied by IgG4- and ANCA-negative aortitis. SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected in 4 of 5 myocardial biopsies (in one case the material in the study). The longest period of virus persistence after COVID-19 was 9 months. By using spike and nucleocapsid antibodies, coronavirus was detected in cardiomycytes and macrophages. Data of patients with morphologically proved myocarditis are presented in Table 1. Lymphocytic myocarditis was diagnosed and confirmed immunohistochemically (n=5);giant cell myocarditis with atrial standstill was detected in one more case (Fig. 1). Three patients had also signs of endocarditis, in two cases with parietal thrombosis. Conclusions: COVID-19 can lead to the subacute and chronic myocarditis of varying severity. Post-COVID myocarditis manifests itself in two main clinical forms - isolated arrhythmias and systolic dysfunction with heart failure. Post-COVID myocarditis is characterized by prolonged persistence of coronavirus (up to 9 months in this study, in most patients with decompensated variant) in combination with high immune activity (high titers of AHA), which should be considered as the main mechanisms of its longterm course. Treatment approaches for such myocarditis require investigation.

A protocol for the identification of novel coronaviruses by viral metagenomic sequencing in diagnostic laboratories may contribute to pandemic preparedness. AIM: The aim of this study is to validate a metagenomic virus discovery protocol as a tool for coronavirus pandemic preparedness. METHODS: The performance of a viral metagenomic protocol in a clinical setting for the identification of novel coronaviruses was tested using clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, in combination with databases generated to contain only viruses of before the discovery dates of these coronaviruses, to mimic virus discovery. RESULTS: Classification of NGS reads using Centrifuge and Genome Detective resulted in assignment of the reads to the closest relatives of the emerging coronaviruses. Low nucleotide and amino acid identity (81% and 84%, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2) in combination with up to 98% genome coverage were indicative for a related, novel coronavirus. Capture probes targeting vertebrate viruses, designed in 2015, enhanced both sequencing depth and coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the latter increasing from 71 to 98%. CONCLUSION: The model used for simulation of virus discovery enabled validation of the metagenomic sequencing protocol. The metagenomic protocol with virus probes designed before the pandemic, can assist the detection and identification of novel coronaviruses directly in clinical samples.","output":"Coronavirus discovery by metagenomic sequencing: a tool for pandemic preparedness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Growing evidence suggests that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with neurological sequelae.

For their widespread adoption in publicly financed health care systems, it is important to understand how their benefits translate into improved patient outcomes, which is essential for demonstrating their value. OBJECTIVE: The paper presents the protocol for a systematic review that aims to assess the quality and strength of the evidence reported in systematic reviews regarding the impact of digital biomarkers on clinical outcomes compared to interventions without digital biomarkers. METHODS: A comprehensive search for reviews from 2019 to 2020 will be conducted in PubMed and the Cochrane Library using keywords related to digital biomarkers and a filter for systematic reviews. Original full-text English publications of systematic reviews comparing clinical outcomes of interventions with and without digital biomarkers via meta-analysis will be included. The AMSTAR-2 tool will be used to assess the methodological quality of these reviews. To assess the quality of evidence, we will evaluate the systematic reviews using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. To detect the possible presence of reporting bias, we will determine whether a protocol was published prior to the start of the studies. A qualitative summary of the results by digital biomarker technology and outcomes will be provided. RESULTS: This protocol was submitted before data collection. Search, screening, and data extraction will commence in December 2021 in accordance with the published protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Our study will provide a comprehensive summary of the highest level of evidence available on digital biomarker interventions, providing practical guidance for health care providers. Our results will help identify clinical areas in which the use of digital biomarkers has led to favorable clinical outcomes. In addition, our findings will highlight areas of evidence gaps where the clinical benefits of digital biomarkers have not yet been demonstrated.

The frequent lack of a microbiological diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) impairs pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy. This study assessed the use of comprehensive multibacterial, multiviral molecular testing, including quantification, in adults hospitalized with CAP. Methods. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for 323 adults with radiologically-confirmed CAP admitted to 2 UK tertiary care hospitals. Sputum (96%) or endotracheal aspirate (4%) specimens were cultured as per routine practice and also tested with fast multiplex real-time polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assays for 26 respiratory bacteria and viruses. Bacterial loads were also calculated for 8 bacterial pathogens. Appropriate pathogen-directed therapy was retrospectively assessed using national guidelines adapted for local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Results. Comprehensive molecular testing of single lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens achieved pathogen detection in 87% of CAP patients compared with 39% with culture-based methods. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the main agents detected, along with a wide variety of typical and atypical pathogens. Viruses were present in 30% of cases; 82% of these were codetections with bacteria. Most (85%) patients had received antimicrobials in the 72 hours before admission. Of these, 78% had a bacterial pathogen detected by PCR but only 32% were culture-positive (P < .0001). Molecular testing had the potential to enable de-escalation in number and/or spectrum of antimicrobials in 77% of patients. Conclusions. Comprehensive molecular testing significantly improves pathogen detection in CAP, particularly in antimicrobial-exposed patients, and requires only a single LRT specimen. It also has the potential to enable early de-escalation from broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials to pathogen-directed therapy.","output":"Comprehensive Molecular Testing for Respiratory Pathogens in Community-Acquired Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge Sharing and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has attracted the attention of researchers during the COVID 19 pandemic and there were two factors considered as essential elements for universities during the COVID 19 situation This is because most of the universities postponed the physical attendance at universities and used technology tools to keep the communication among the academic staff and students ICT allows for the rapid search, access, and retrieval of information and collaboration between employees, while ICT infrastructure refers to the equipment, software, communication systems, and the human component such as experience, skills, command, principles The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of ICT and ICT infrastructure on Knowledge Sharing among academic staff The study was conducted at nine Iraqi public universities located in Baghdad and the sample was the academic staff at these universities The study employed the stratified sample method to ensure equal distribution among the nine universities, and the data was collected using the questionnaire Structural equation modelling was utilized to analyze 267 valid questionnaires After testing the measurement model and ensuring the model fit, the study examined the structural model to find the results The result showed that ICT and ICT infrastructure had positive and significant impact on Knowledge Sharing among the academic staff at Iraqi public universities However, the result indicated the Knowledge Sharing was highly impacted by ICT infrastructure The government and universities should enhance and improve the ICT infrastructure that would provide a great benefit to the Iraqi universities' reputation as well as the universities' rank ? 2020 IEEE","output":"The Role of Information and Communication Technology on Knowledge Sharing among the Academic Staff during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In the context of diminutive COVID-19 screening and testing, syndromic surveillance can be used to identify areas with higher-than-expected SARS-CoV-2 symptoms for targeted public health interventions. We used syndromic surveillance to monitor potential SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in 14 health facilities in the Neno district of rural Malawi. Methods We monitored three indicators identified as potential symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection: the proportion of outpatient visits for fast-breathing cases in children under 5 years (FBC<5);the proportion of suspected malaria cases confirmed as non-malaria in children under 5 years (NMC<5);and the same indicator in individuals aged 5 years and older (NMC5). We extracted data aggregated by month and at the health facility-level from the District Health Information System. With data from January, 2016, to February, 2020, as a baseline, we used a linear model with a negative binomial distribution to estimate expected proportions for the indicators in absence of the COVID-19 pandemic with 95% prediction intervals (PI) for March, 2020, to July, 2021. We compared the observed proportions to the expected rates, focusing on the first two waves of infections (June to July, 2020, and January to March, 2021). Findings The proportion of FBC<5 was consistently higher than expected, with a peak in May, 2020, when 25% of outpatient visits were fast breathing cases in children younger than 5 years of age (compared with the expected rate of 08% [95% PI 04C15]). NMC<5 was as expected throughout the study period. The NMC5 indicator remained as expected, except for increases in suspected cases tested negative for malaria, to 313% (from the expected 186% [95% PI 123C287]) in November, 2020, and to 325% (from the expected 217% [95% PI 142C322]) in July, 2021. Interpretation An increase in FBC<5 and NMC5 before observed COVID-19 waves might indicate SARS-CoV-2 infections that were missed before robust testing. This tendency was not seen in NMC<5, which can represent differences in symptomatology leading to decreased health-seeking behaviours for this age group. Syndromic surveillance can allow for real-time responses at facilities, including increased and focused testing and screening to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 infections.

The cost of unmitigated polarization would be extremely high for the society; therefore, it is desirable to identify the polarizing issues before they become serious. With this in mind, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the polarized subtopics of COVID-19 to obtain insights for future policymaking. To this end, we first propose a framework to comprehensively search for controversial subtopics. We then retrospectively analyze subtopics on COVID-19 using the proposed framework, with data obtained via Twitter in Japan. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively detect controversial subtopics that reflect current reality. Controversial subtopics tend to be about the government, medical matters, economy, and education; moreover, the controversy score had a low correlation with the traditional indicators--scale and sentiment of the subtopics--which suggests that the controversy score is a potentially important indicator to be obtained.

However, the characteristics of some devices may limit the freedom of individuals to be as physically active as they desire. Limited mobility may negatively affect the perceived quality of life of individuals with COPD. The aim of this study was to understand perceived limitations that patients with COPD experience in using long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) devices. METHODS We performed a qualitative analysis of 311 responses to an open-ended question from a previously deployed electronic survey designed to investigate how LTOT devices affect oxygen-dependent patients with COPD. Our thematic analysis was facilitated by NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software package. This involved identifying patterns and themes within the robust, text-rich data from the open-ended survey question regarding the survey subjects' experiences with their LTOT devices. Cluster analysis was also performed to highlight relationships between various concepts. RESULTS Themes generated revealed that subjects experienced decreased mobility, which resulted in feelings of decreased autonomy and isolation. We also found that subjects perceived a decrease in quality of life due to their described experience of portable oxygen cylinders being heavy and cumbersome. Subjects described feelings of fear and anxiety due to insufficient support for breathing provided by pulse-dose portable oxygen concentrators, as well as portable oxygen cylinders that run out before they are able to complete errands and other activities of daily living. Some subjects also reported that they willingly pay for liquid oxygen systems out-of-pocket because of the mobility it affords, which in their perception improves their quality of life.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools have exhibited desirable potential; for example, chest computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to play a major role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19. However, developing a CT-based AI diagnostic system for the disease detection has faced considerable challenges, which is mainly due to the lack of adequate manually-delineated samples for training, as well as the requirement of sufficient sensitivity to subtle lesions in the early infection stages. In this study, we developed a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for COVID-19 diagnosis that can simultaneously achieve individual-level classification and lesion segmentation. To focus the classification branch more intensively on the lesion areas, a novel lesion attention module was developed to integrate the intermediate segmentation results. Furthermore, to manage the potential influence of different imaging parameters from individual facilities, a slice probability mapping method was proposed to learn the transformation from slice-level to individual-level classification. We conducted experiments on a large dataset of 1,202 subjects from ten institutes in China. The results demonstrated that 1) the proposed DCN attained a classification accuracy of 96.74% on the internal dataset and 92.87% on the external validation dataset, thereby outperforming other models; 2) DCN obtained comparable performance with fewer samples and exhibited higher sensitivity, especially in subtle lesion detection; and 3) DCN provided good interpretability on the loci of infection compared to other deep models due to its classification guided by high-level semantic information.

After recognizing these challenges, two pre-doctoral dental students developed Penntorship, a program at University of Pennsylvania, School of Dental Medicine, where dental students' mentor students at West Philadelphia High School (WPHS) utilizing online technology. PURPOSE: This survey study explored the benefits of a newly developed mentoring program, Penntorship, for mentors and mentees. METHODS: Seventy dental students volunteered to mentor WPHS students throughout the 2020-2021 school year. After receiving training by Mentor Independence Region, mentors coordinated weekly meetings with mentees on Zoom to assist with homework assignments, discuss interests, and assess mentee's career goals. Over six months, 185 mentor meetings were held by 56 dental students with 28 different high-school students participating in the program. Surveys were distributed and analyzed to determine outcomes of the program. RESULTS: Survey results revealed that both dental students and high-school students gained new friendships, improved communication skills, and developed a positive perspective during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: With online learning formats and social distancing during the pandemic, dental students expressed a need for more social interaction.

The aim of the study was to study the effect of myocardial injury assessment on risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Seven hundred seven consecutive adult patients admitted to a large tertiary hospital with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory results and clinical outcomes were recorded. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated in order to quantify the degree of comorbidities. Independent association of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) increase with outcomes was evaluated by multivariate regression analyses and area under curve. In addition, propensity-score matching was performed to assemble a cohort of patients with similar baseline characteristics. RESULTS: In the matched cohort (mean age 66.76  15.7 years, 37.3% females), cTnI increase above the upper limit was present in 20.9% of the population and was associated with worse clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality within 30 days (45.1% vs. 23.2%; p = 0.005). The addition of cTnI to a multivariate prediction model showed a significant improvement in the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (0.775 vs. 0.756, DC-statistic = 0.019; 95% confidence interval 0.001-0.037). Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors was not associated with mortality after adjusting by baseline risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury is independently associated with adverse outcomes irrespective of baseline comorbidities and its addition to multivariate regression models significantly improves their performance in predicting mortality.

Samples from the two groups were paired based on demographics and comorbidities. RNA was extracted from isolated neutrophils and subjected to next-generation RNA sequencing to obtain differential expressions for identification of an IA-associated signature. Bioinformatics analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, were used to investigate the biological function of all differentially expressed transcripts. RESULTS Transcriptome profiling identified 258 differentially expressed transcripts in patients with and without IAs. Expression differences were consistent with peripheral neutrophil activation. An IA-associated RNA expression signature was identified in 82 transcripts (p<0.05, fold-change 2). This signature was able to separate patients with and without IAs on hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, in an independent, unpaired, replication cohort of patients with IAs (n = 5) and controls (n = 5), the 82 transcripts separated 9 of 10 patients into their respective groups.

We retrospectively assessed 635 patients who received robotic thyroid surgery under TIVA to evaluate the risk of remifentanil-associated pain. Postoperative pain was evaluated using 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS).

Tissue oxygen saturation, thromboelastography, oncotic pressure, urine volume and specific gravity, complete blood count, serum chemistry, body temperature, hematocrit, total solids, arterial and mixed venous blood gas, bispectral index, SAP, MAP, DAP, cardiac index, total blood volume (TBV) removed and returned, rate of hemorrhage and transfusion, spleen weight, heart rate (HR), arterial pH, lactate, PaO2, PaCO2, respiratory rate, cranial mesenteric and renal artery blood flow were recorded. Groups were compared using two-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni (P < 0.05) for repeated measures or t test for non-repeated measures. RESULTS Compared with the SSP swine, SP swine had higher HR post-splenectomy for the duration of the experiment (P < 0.03), and higher hematocrits at 15 and 60 min post splenectomy (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). SSP swine had greater TBV removed during hemorrhage (P < 0.01); however, when blood loss based on splenic weight was considered, TBV removed was similar between groups. CONCLUSION Splenectomy likely accounts for the transient increase in hematocrit and the higher HR in SP swine prior to hemorrhage, and the differences in TBV removed between the two groups during hemorrhage. With a fixed end point model using a moderate rate of acute hemorrhage and an MAP of 40 mm Hg, splenectomy is not necessary and may confound results.","output":"Splenectomy Versus Sham Splenectomy in a Swine Model of Controlled Hemorrhagic Shock."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Last few decades, viruses are a real menace to human safety. Therefore, the rapid identification of viruses should be one of the best ways to prevent an outbreak and important implications for medical healthcare. The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which belongs to the single-stranded, positive-strand RNA viruses. The pandemic dimension spread of COVID-19 poses a severe threat to the health and lives of seven billion people worldwide. There is a growing urgency worldwide to establish a point-of-care device for the rapid detection of COVID-19 to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Therefore, the need for sensitive, selective, and rapid diagnostic devices plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments and to prevent the epidemics. During the last decade, electrochemical biosensors have emerged as reliable analytical devices and represent a new promising tool for the detection of different pathogenic viruses. This review summarizes the state of the art of different virus detection with currently available electrochemical detection methods.

Examining the opposing epistemologies often underlying these two approaches, we posit that they can be brought together through a transdisciplinary lens for sustainable rural development. We illustrate these potentials in Newfoundland and Labrador, a highly resource-based region in which rural communities are often characterized by deficiencies based narratives. In such contexts, storytelling can allow rural stakeholders to interpret SD while potentially enlisting SIs in telling their own sustainability stories.","output":"Storytelling for sustainable development in rural communities: An alternative approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Older adults living with HIV may be at increased risk of experiencing distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We took advantage of a cohort study in older adults living with HIV in Canada (+BHN) to study the psychological impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal study was conducted in which participants in the +BHN study who had access to the internet and agreed to be contacted were queried on symptoms of psychological distress and its predictors each week between mid-April and the end of June 2020. Evolution of distress, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), was modelled using Group Based Trajectory Analysis and logistic regression was used to identify factors predictive of psychological distress in the clinical range. Results The 77 +BHN participants who took part in the current study were mostly men (92%) and on average 57.3 years of age. Over the study period, 32.5% experienced psychological distress in the clinical range at one or more weekly surveys. In the transition between the pre-COVID-19 and the COVID-19 periods, the HADS scores followed 5 distinct trajectories: (i) 39.5 % of the sample, with normal HADS scores in the several months preceding the pandemic, experienced an increase in HADS scores; (ii) 30.6% of the sample had normal pre-pandemic HADS scores, remained stable; and (iii) 29.9%, with pre-pandemic presence of distress, had a decrease in HADS scores. During the first wave of COVID-19, some attenuation in distress was seen over time. Feeling lonely and financial insecurity were associated with distress. Conclusion Presence of psychological distress during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was not universal among older adults with HIV, with as many as one third of the participants reporting an improvement in mental health.

Virus-specific immunity controls infection, transmission, and disease severity. With respect to disease severity, a spectrum of clinical outcomes can occur on the basis of the age, genetics, comorbidities, and immune responses in an infected person. Dysfunctions in innate and adaptive immunity commonly follow viral infection. These are heralded by altered mononuclear phagocyte differentiation, activation, intracellular killing and memory, effector, and regulatory T cell responses. All of such affect viral clearance and the progression of end-organ disease. Failures to produce effective controlled antiviral immunity leads to life-threatening end-organ disease that is typified by the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

We present an unusual case of pulmonary embolism (PE) with atypical symptoms in a COVID-19 survivor.Case Report:A 47-year-old African-American, non-smoker female with a history of hypertension and morbid obesity presented with sudden onset of dizziness associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient was in her usual state of health prior to the onset of symptoms. She described her dizziness as a sensation of room spinning. Review of systems was otherwise normal. She was in no acute distress, vital signs were within normal limits and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Physical examination including the Dix-Hallpike maneuver was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations and EKG were normal. A CT angiography of the head and neck did not reveal any cerebral ischemia, however, it disclosed findings concerning PE. A CT angiography of the chest demonstrated bilateral emboli with filling defects confirming PE. Echocardiogram was normal. The patient did not have any risk factors for PE like recent immobilization, travel, surgery, use of oral contraceptives or hormonal therapy, malignancy and personal or family history of thromboembolic disorders. Of note, six months ago she was tested positive for COVID-19 with mild symptoms which did not require hospitalization. COVID-19 test during this admission was negative, but D-dimer was not obtained. In the absence of any other plausible etiology of dizziness, her symptoms were attributed to atypical presentation of PE. She was treated with heparin and discharged on oral anticoagulation therapy with apixaban for one year. Discussion:Although there are several proposed hypotheses, the exact pathogenesis of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 infection is unclear. Thus far, the reported cases of PE as a complication of COVID-19 infection presented within six weeks of disease onset. Our patient developed bilateral PE six months post infection, which was not severe enough to require hospitalization, in the absence of any other risk factors for PE. More recent studies suggest that patients with a BMI greater than 30 kg per meter square, like our patient, have a greater propensity to develop PE but in the setting of severe disease. Physicians should be cognizant of this clinical entity and have a high index of suspicion for PE in patients with prior COVID-19 infection irrespective of the timeline and disease severity especially in those with atypical presentation like our patient.","output":"Post COVID-19 complication: A near miss case of pulmonary embolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African swine fever is a lethal hemorrhagic disease of pigs caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), which greatly threatens the pig industry in many countries. Deletion of virulence-associated genes to develop live attenuated ASF vaccines is considered to be a promising strategy. A recent study has revealed that the A137R gene deletion results in ASFV attenuation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To elucidate the mechanism of the A137R gene regulating ASFV virulence, an ASFV mutant with the A137R gene deleted (ASFV-A137R) was generated based on the wild-type ASFV HLJ/2018 strain (ASFV-WT). Using transcriptome sequencing analysis, we found that ASFV-A137R induced higher type I interferon (IFN) production in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) than did ASFV-WT. Overexpression of the A137R protein (pA137R) inhibited the activation of IFN- or IFN-stimulated response element. Mechanistically, pA137R interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and promotes the autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation of TBK1, which blocks the nuclear translocation of interferon regulator factor 3, leading to decreased type I IFN production. Taken together, our findings clarify that pA137R negatively regulates the cGAS-STING-mediated IFN- signaling pathway via the autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation of TBK1, which highlights the involvement of pA137R regulating ASFV virulence. IMPORTANCE African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal viral disease of pigs caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). No commercial vaccines and antiviral treatments are available for the prevention and control of the disease. Several virulence-associated genes of ASFV have been identified, but the underlying attenuation mechanisms are not clear. Compared with the virulent parental ASFV, the A137R gene-deleted ASFV mutant promoted the expression of type I interferon (IFN) in primary porcine alveolar macrophages. Further analysis indicated that the A137R protein negatively regulated the cGAS-STING-mediated IFN- signaling pathway through targeting TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) for autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation. This study not only facilitates the understanding of ASFV immunoevasion strategies, but also provides new clues to the development of live attenuated ASF vaccines.","output":"The A137R Protein of African Swine Fever Virus Inhibits Type I Interferon Production via the Autophagy-Mediated Lysosomal Degradation of TBK1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a disease caused by the coronavirus and has infected the world population not only in developing countries like Indonesia but also in developed countries like the United States of America The spread of the disease originating from Wuhan in China is evenly distributed throughout the world Surabaya, as one of the major cities in Indonesia was also affected by Covid-19 The aim of this study was to map the relative risk of the spread of positive Covid-19 patients in Surabaya using the Bayesian Hierarchical Model with spatial analysis to deal with regional dependencies The object used was spatial object as many as 154 villages in Surabaya Meanwhile, a number of positive patients Covid-19 as of May 10th, 2020 was as many as 708 patients The method used to estimate the relative risk was the Bayesian method with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach It was used after several studies have shown that the INLA approach is more accurate in providing estimated values compared to the Maximum-Likelihood estimation The mapping results showed that there is a spatial dependence on the spread of Covid-19 disease in Surabaya ? 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc All rights reserved","output":"Bayesian hierarchical model for mapping positive patient COVID-19 in Surabaya, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The design of new protein folds represents a grand challenge for synthetic, chemical and structural biology. Due to the good understanding of the principles governing its pairing specificity, coiled coil (CC) peptide secondary structure elements can be exploited for the construction of modular protein assemblies acting as a proxy for the straightforward complementarity of DNA modules. The prerequisite for the successful translation of the modular assembly strategy pioneered by DNA nanotechnology to protein design is the availability of orthogonal building modules: a collection of peptides that assemble into CCs only with their predetermined partners. Modular CC-based protein structures can self-assemble from multiple polypeptide chains whose pairing is determined by the interaction pattern of the constituent building blocks. Orthogonal CC sets can however also be used for the design of more complex coiled coil protein origami (CCPO) structures. CCPOs are based on multiple CC modules concatenated into a single polypeptide chain that folds into a polyhedral protein cage as the peptide segments assemble into CC dimers. The CCPO strategy has hitherto led to successful de novo design of protein cages in the shape of a tetrahedron, square pyramid and triangular prism. Recent advances in the design of CC modules and design principles have enabled the construction of CCPOs that self-assemble in vivo without any apparent toxicity to human cells or animals, opening the path towards therapeutic applications.

Here, we examined the mechanism underlying complement activation in ARVC, revealing a potential new therapeutic target. Methods: First, immunostaining, RT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the expression levels of complement and coagulation factors. Second, we knocked out the central complement component C3 in Des(-/-) mice (ARVC model) by crossing Des(-/-) mice with C3(-/-) mice to explore whether complement system activation occurs independently of the conventional pathway. Then, we evaluated whether a targeted intervention to coagulation system is effective to reduce myocardium injury. Finally, the plasma sC5b9 level was assessed to investigate the role in predicting adverse cardiac events in the ARVC cohort. Results: The complement system is activated in the myocardium in ARVC. Autoantibodies against myocardial proteins provided a possible mechanism underlying. Moreover, we found increased levels of myocardial C5 and the serum C5a in Des(-/-)C3(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice, indicating that C5 is activated independently from the conventional pathway, presumably via the coagulation system. Crosstalk between the complement and coagulation systems exacerbated the myocardial injury in ARVC mice, and this injury was reduced by using the thrombin inhibitor lepirudin. In addition, we found significantly elevated plasma levels of sC5b9 and thrombin in patients, and this increase was correlated with all-cause mortality.

However, the retroperitoneal approach represents an alternative approach given potential advantages. OBJECTIVE: To provide an updated analysis of the comparative outcomes of retroperitoneal RAPN (R-RAPN) versus transperitoneal RAPN (T-RAPN). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of the literature was performed up to September 2021 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. A sensitivity analysis was performed considering only matched-pair studies. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Seventeen studies, which were published between 2013 and 2021, were retrieved. None of them was a randomized clinical trial. Among the 6,266 patients included in the meta-analysis, 2261 (36.1%) and 4,005 (63.9%) underwent R-RAPN and T-RAPN, respectively. No significant difference was found in terms of baseline features. The T-RAPN group presented a higher rate of male patients (odds ratio [OR]: 0.86, p = 0.03) and larger tumor size (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.2 cm; p = 0.003). The R-RAPN group reported more frequent posterior renal masses (OR: 0.23; p < 0.0001). The retroperitoneal approach presented lower estimated blood loss (WMD: 30.41 ml; p = 0.001), shorter operative time (OT; WMD: 20.36 min; p = 0.0001), and shorter length of stay (LOS; WMD: 0.35 d; p = 0.002). Overall complication rates were 13.7% and 16.05% in the R-RAPN and T-RAPN groups, respectively (OR: 1.32; p = 0.008). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding major (Clavien-Dindo classification 3 grade) complication rate, pentafecta achievement, as well as positive margin rates. When considering only matched-pair studies, no difference between groups was found in terms of baseline characteristics. Posterior renal masses were more frequent in the R-RAPN group (OR: 0.6; p = 0.03). Similar to the analysis of the entire cohort, R-RAPN reported lower EBL (WMD: 35.56 ml; p < 0.0001) and a shorter OT (WMD: 18.31 min; p = 0.03). Overall and major complication rates were similar between the two groups. The LOS was significantly lower for R-RAPN (WMD: 0.46 d; p = 0.02). No statistically significant difference was found between groups in terms of overall PSM rates. CONCLUSIONS: R-RAPN offers similar surgical outcomes to T-RAPN, and it carries potential advantages in terms of shorter OT and LOS. Available evidence remains limited by the lack of randomized clinical trials.

It was originally associated with hepatitis, but is now believed to be a relatively non-pathogenic lymphotropic virus. Fifty frozen specimens from the brains of deceased persons affected by MS were obtained along with 15 normal control brain specimens. RNA was extracted and ribosomal RNAs were depleted before sequencing on the Illumina GAII. These 36 bp reads were compared with a non-redundant database derived from the 600,000+ viral sequences in GenBank organized into 4080 taxa. An individual read successfully aligned to the viral database was considered to be a hit. Normalized MS specimen hit rates for each viral taxon were compared to the distribution of hits in the normal controls. Seventeen MS and 11 control brain extracts were sequenced, yielding 4C10 million sequences (reads) each. Over-representation of sequence from at least one of 12 viral taxa was observed in 7 of the 17 MS samples. Sequences resembling other viruses previously implicated in the pathogenesis of MS were not significantly enriched in any of the diseased brain specimens. Sequences from GB virus C (GBV-C), a flavivirus not previously isolated from brain, were enriched in one of the MS samples.

We describe SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and associated symptoms and review shelter infection prevention and control (IPC) policies. METHODS: PEH and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during April 7-May 6, 2020. A subset of PEH and staff was screened for symptoms. Shelter assessments were conducted concurrently at a convenience sample of shelters using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 2,875 individuals at 24 shelters and nine unsheltered outreach events underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and 2,860 (99.5%) had conclusive test results. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 2.1% (36/1,684) among PEH living sheltered, 0.5% (3/628) among PEH living unsheltered, and 1.3% (7/548) among staff. Reporting fever, cough, or shortness of breath in the last week during symptom screening was 14% sensitive and 89% specific for identifying COVID-19 cases compared with RT-PCR. Prevalence by shelter ranged 0%-27.6%. Repeat testing 3-4 weeks later at four shelters documented decreased SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (0%-3.9%). Nine of 24 shelters completed shelter assessments and implemented IPC measures as part of the COVID-19 response.

Obtaining QALY values for COVID-19 presents a challenge owing to the availability of two US EQ-5D-5L value sets and the potentially asymptomatic presentation of the disease. The first value set was completed allowing for the discounting of future health outcomes while the second value set is undiscounted. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the distribution of QALY values using a national survey and the two published value sets; and to estimate the association between COVID-19 outcomes and QALY losses. METHODS: Between 9 and 11 November, 2020, 1153 US adults completed the EQ-5D-5L instrument (five items and a visual analog scale) as well as self-reported their demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, and memberships to populations that are at risk of COVID-19 infection. The two US value sets were applied to the EQ-5D-5L responses to produce QALY values. We estimated the mean QALYs by visual analog scale decile and a generalized linear model of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: The discounted values are higher than the undiscounted values for each visual analog scale decile owing to methodological differences. Persons at increased risk, with a fever in the past day, and with one or more other symptoms have significantly greater QALY losses (p < 0.01). Overall, non-institutionalized individuals at risk of symptomatic clinical COVID-19 equal 0.68 for the 2016 value set (95% confidence interval 0.49C0.87) and 0.10 for the 2017 value set (95% confidence interval ? 0.31 to 0.51) QALYs.

Despite the successful implementation of subregional initiatives to control vectorial and transfusional Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in Latin American settings where the disease is endemic, congenital CD (cCD) remains a significant challenge. In countries where the disease is not endemic, vertical transmission plays a key role in CD expansion and is the main focus of its control. Although several health organizations provide general protocols for cCD control, its management in each geopolitical region depends on local authorities, which has resulted in a multitude of approaches. The aims of this review are to (i) describe the current global situation in CD management, with emphasis on congenital infection, and (ii) summarize the spectrum of available strategies, both official and unofficial, for cCD prevention and control in countries of endemicity and nonendemicity. From an economic point of view, the early detection and treatment of cCD are cost-effective. However, in countries where the disease is not endemic, national health policies for cCD control are nonexistent, and official regional protocols are scarce and restricted to Europe. Countries of endemicity have more protocols in place, but the implementation of diagnostic methods is hampered by economic constraints. Moreover, most protocols in both countries where the disease is endemic and those where it is not endemic have yet to incorporate recently developed technologies. The wide methodological diversity in cCD diagnostic algorithms reflects the lack of a consensus. This review may represent a first step toward the development of a common strategy, which will require the collaboration of health organizations, governments, and experts in the field.","output":"Worldwide Control and Management of Chagas Disease in a New Era of Globalization: a Close Look at Congenital Trypanosoma cruzi Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Infrared (IR) lasers are being explored as an alternative to radiofrequency (RF) and ultrasonic (US) devices for rapid hemostasis with minimal collateral zones of thermal damage and tissue necrosis.

This preliminary study describes in vivo testing of a handheld laser probe in a porcine model. METHODS A handheld prototype with vessel/tissue clasping mechanism was tested on 73 blood vessels less than 6 mm diameter using 1,470 nm laser power of 35 W for 1-5 seconds. Device power settings, irradiation time, tissue type, vessel diameter, and histology sample number were recorded for each procedure. The probe was evaluated for hemostasis after sealing isolated and bundled arteriole/venous (A/V) vasculature of porcine abdomen and hind leg. Sealed vessel samples were collected for histological analysis of lateral thermal damage. RESULTS Hemostasis was achieved in 57 of 73 seals (78%). The probe consistently sealed vasculature in small bowel mesentery, mesometrium, and gastrosplenic and epiploic regions.

The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be an important class of RNA molecules that regulate many biological processes, including host-pathogen interactions. However, the role of host lncRNAs in the response to T. gondii infection remains largely unknown. METHODS: We applied a microarray approach to determine the differential expression profiles of both lncRNAs and mRNAs in the human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells after T. gondii infection. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to reveal the potential functions of T. gondii-induced genes. Based on the co-expression networks of lncRNAs and immune-related genes, the role of NONSHAT022487 on the regulation of UNC93B1 related immune signaling was investigated by the knockdown and over-expression of lncRNA in human macrophage derived from the PMA-induced promonocytic cell line THP-1. RESULTS: Our data showed that 996 lncRNAs and 109 mRNAs in HFF cells were significantly and differentially expressed following T. gondii infection (fold change  5, P < 0.05). The results from the GO and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that the mRNAs with differential expression were mainly involved in the host immune response. Remarkably, we identified a novel lncRNA, NONSHAT022487, which suppresses the expression of the immune-related molecule UNC93B1. After T. gondii infection, NONSHAT022487 impaired the secretion of the cytokines IL-12, TNF-, IL-1 and IFN- by downregulating UNC93B1 expression in human macrophage cells.

Through multivariable logistic regression, we developed a prediction model (probability score) for ICU transfer. Then, we validated the model by estimating its performance accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) using data from the remaining 25% of patients (admitted July 11 to July 31). RESULTS: We included 2,014 and 671 patients in the training and validation datasets, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, serum C-reactive protein, and serum lactate dehydrogenase were identified as significant risk factors for ICU transfer, and a prediction model was developed. The AUC was 0.752 for the training dataset and 0.769 for the validation dataset. We developed a free, web-based calculator to facilitate use of the prediction model (https://icucovid19.shinyapps.io/ICUCOVID19/). CONCLUSION: Our validated, simple, and accessible prediction model and web-based calculator for ICU transfer may be useful in assisting healthcare providers in identifying hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for clinical deterioration. Triage of such patients for early aggressive treatment can impact clinical outcomes for this potentially deadly disease.","output":"Development and validation of a predictive model for critical illness in adult patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The focus of this paper is to trace how mass media, particularly newspapers, have addressed the issues about the containment of contagion or the explanation of epidemiological evolution.

Serious respiratory complications aside, the heart is also frequently involved. The mechanisms and the extent of the myocardial injury, along with the short and long-term cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in COVID-19 survivors remain unclear. Areas covered: myocardial injury has been found in a considerable proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is associated with a worse prognosis. The late onset of CV complications with myocarditis-like changes revealed by CMR has been reported in COVID-19 survivors. Previous observational studies on viral myocarditis provide evidence of a significant incomplete recovery with residual dysfunction and remodeling of left ventricle. Incomplete recovery is thought to be the result of persistent myocardial inflammation due to a post-viral autoimmune response. Considering the significant inflammatory nature of COVID-19, COVID-19 survivors may be at risk of developing persistent residual myocardial injury, the sequelae of which are unclear. Expert commentary: COVID-19 is an emerging threat for the heart. The extent of CV injury, along with the short and long-term sequelae, requires further investigation. The early detection of residual myocardial changes in COVID-19 survivors is of utmost importance in order to identify those patients at risk of CV complication development.","output":"COVID-19 myocarditis and prospective heart failure burden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We sought to examine the strategies promoting and countering state preemption of local sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes in the United States.

DESIGN: We collected and sequenced 392 tongue-coating samples, 172 faecal samples and 155 serum samples from Central China and East China. We characterised microbiome and lipid molecules, constructed microbial classifiers in discovery cohort and verified their diagnostic potential in 74 confirmed patients (CPs) from East China and 37 suspected patients (SPs) with IgG positivity. RESULTS: Oral and faecal microbial diversity was significantly decreased in CPs versus healthy controls (HCs). Compared with HCs, butyric acid-producing bacteria were decreased and lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria were increased in CPs in oral cavity. The classifiers based on 8 optimal oral microbial markers (7 faecal microbial markers) achieved good diagnostic efficiency in different cohorts. Importantly, diagnostic efficacy reached 87.24% in the cross-regional cohort. Moreover, the classifiers successfully diagnosed SPs with IgG antibody positivity as CPs, and diagnostic efficacy reached 92.11% (98.01% of faecal microbiome). Compared with CPs, 47 lipid molecules, including sphingomyelin (SM)(d40:4), SM(d38:5) and monoglyceride(33:5), were depleted, and 122 lipid molecules, including phosphatidylcholine(36:4p), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(16:0p/20:5) and diglyceride(20:1/18:2), were enriched in confirmed patients recovery.

While rapidly emerging evidence indicates a deterioration of mental health in general, it remains unknown whether the pandemic will have an impact on GD in mental health. To this end, we investigate the association of the pandemic and its countermeasures affecting everyday life, labor, and households with changes in GD in aggression, anxiety, depression, and the somatic symptom burden. We analyze cross-sectional data from 10,979 individuals who live in Germany and who responded to the online survey Life with Corona between October 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. We estimate interaction effects from generalized linear models. The analyses reveal no pre-existing GD in aggression but exposure to COVID-19 and COVID-19 countermeasures is associated with sharper increases in aggression in men than in women. GD in anxiety decreased among participants with children in the household (with men becoming more anxious). We also observe pre-existing and increasing GD with regards to the severity of depression, with women presenting a larger increase in symptoms during the hard lockdown or with increasing stringency. In contrast to anxiety, GD in depression increased among participants who lived without children (women > men), but decreased for individuals who lived with children; here, men converged to the levels of depression presented by women. Finally, GD in somatic symptoms decreased during the hard lockdown (but not with higher stringency), with men showing a sharper increase in symptoms, especially when they lived with children or alone. Taken together, the findings indicate an increase in GD in mental health as the pandemic unfolded in Germany, with rising female vulnerability to depression and increasing male aggression. The combination of these two trends further suggests a worrying mental health situation for singles and families. Our results have important policy implications for the German health system and public health policy. This public health challenge requires addressing the rising burden of pandemic-related mental health challenges and the distribution of this burden between women and men, within families and for individuals who live alone.","output":"Life With Corona: Increased Gender Differences in Aggression and Depression Symptoms Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic Burden in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Observational studies of the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are needed to inform real-world use. Such studies are now underway amid the ongoing rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally.

Here we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under traditional case-control and test-negative design frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs. Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, non-specific indicators of COVID-19. When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes. The traditional case-control design may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection. The test-negative design reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe illness. These circumstances indicate the two study designs cannot be applied naively to datasets gathered through public health surveillance or administrative sources.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient department of Gastroenterology, Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi from March 2020 to July 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown phase to explore patient experiences. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire. All patients of either gender were included after informed consent. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using SPSS 21.0. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients were included who visited the hospital to seek medical services during the COVID-19 lockdown phase. The mean age of the population was 42.7 years (16.13). Of these, n=94 (51.1%) were males All patients had gastrointestinal issues with different comorbid conditions. One forty-seven n=147 (79.9%) presented with active complaints whereas, n=37 (20.1%) patients visited the hospital for their follow-up checkup. Out of 184 patients, n=33 (17.9%) patients reported of having fear of visiting hospital due to COVID-19 outbreak. A statistically significant difference p<0.001 was noted between the history of comorbidities and patient delaying a visit to the healthcare due to the fear of COVID-19. Additionally, 61 (73.5%) patients with co-morbidity faced difficulty in finding public transport (p=0.01). Nevertheless, n=171 (93.0%) patients expressed satisfaction with the services provided by the hospital during the lockdown phase. CONCLUSION: Patients with gastrointestinal conditions were largely affected by lockdown largely due to fear of contacting COVID-19 disease and inaccessibility to the public transportation.

We then adjust the weight matrices to reflect two counterfactual scenarios of border closures and draw counterfactual predictions based on these, to retrospectively assess the usefulness of border closures. We observed that predictions based on a scenario where no closure of the Swiss-Italian border occurred, yielded double the number of cumulative cases over the study period. Conversely, a closure of the Swiss-Italian border two weeks earlier than implemented, would have only marginally reduced the number of cases and merely delayed the epidemic spread by a couple weeks.

Therefore, this study aimed: (1) to assess emotional-behavioral symptoms, binge eating, problematic social media usage, and attachment representations of adolescents during the pandemic, comparing them with prepandemic similar samples;(2) to investigate relationships among variables, exploring the role of problematic social media usage and insecure attachment as risk factors for more psychopathological symptoms. Participants were 62 community adolescents aged 12-17 years, enrolled through schools, and assessed online through the following measures: Youth Self-Report for emotional-behavioral problems, Binge-Eating Scale for binge eating, Social Media Disorder Scale for problematic social media usage, and the Friends and Family Interview for attachment. The main results were: (1) 9.4% of adolescents showed clinical rates of emotional-behavioral symptoms and 4.8% of binge eating attitudes. The comparison with pre-pandemic samples revealed that pandemic teenagers showed lower internalizing, but higher other problems (e.g., binge drinking, self-destructive behaviors) and more problematic social media usage than pre-pandemic peers. No differences in binge-eating attitudes and attachment were revealed (76% secure classifications). (2) Problematic social media usage was related to more binge eating and emotional-behavioral problems, predicting 5.4% of both delinquent and attention problems. Attachment disorganization predicted 16.5% of internalizing problems, somatic complaints, and social and identity-related problems. In conclusion, confinement did not increase adolescents' internalizing symptoms -i.e., vulnerability to mood disorders of an anxious-depressive type- which even decreased.

METHODS: We assessed 849 consecutive ppCOVID-19 patients, 418 through the pcHRRS (home-confined ppCOVID-19 with negativegroup 1- and positivegroup 2-X-rays) and 431 arriving with respiratory symptoms to the ED by themselves (group 3). The pcHRRS provided X-rays and oximetry in an only-one-patient agenda. Radiologists made next-step decisions (group 1: pneumonia negative, home-confinement follow-up; group 2: pneumonia positive, ED assessment) according to X-ray results. We used ANOVA and Bonferroni correction, Student T, Chi(2) tests to analyse changes in the ED workload, time-to-decision differences between groups, potential delays in patients acceding through the ED, and pcHRRS performance for deciding admission. RESULTS: The pcHRRS halved ED respiratory patients (49.2%), allowed faster decisions (group 1 vs. home-discharged group 2 and group 3 patients: 0:41  1:05 h; 3:36  2:58 h; 3:50  3:16 h; group 1 vs. all group 2 and group 3 patients: 0:41  1:05 h; 5.25  3.08; 5:36  4:36 h; group 2 vs. group 3 admitted patients: 5:27  3:08 h vs. 7:42  5:02 h; all p < 0.001) and prompted admission (84/93, 90.3%) while maintaining time response for ED patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our pcHRRS may be a more efficient entry-door for ppCOVID-19 by decreasing ED patients and making expedited decisions while guaranteeing social distance.","output":"Radiology departments as COVID-19 entry-door might improve healthcare efficacy and efficiency, and emergency department safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is frequently said that funding is essential to ensure optimal results from a malaria intervention control. However, in recent years, the capacity of the government of Mozambique to sustain the operational cost of indoor residual spraying (IRS) is facing numerous challenges due to restrictions of the Official Development Assistance. The purpose of the study was to estimate the cost of IRS operationalization in two districts of Maputo Province (Matutune and Namaacha) in Mozambique. The evidence produced in this study intends to provide decision-makers with insight into where they need to pay close attention in future planning in order to operationalize IRS with the existent budget in the actual context of budget restrictions. METHODS: Cost information was collected retrospectively from the provider perspective, and both economic and financial costs were calculated. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: The average economic costs totaled US$117,351.34, with an average economic cost per household sprayed of US$16.35, and an average economic cost per person protected of US$4.09. The average financial cost totaled US$69,174.83, with an average financial cost per household sprayed and per person protected of US$9.84 and US$2.46, respectively. Vehicle, salary, and insecticide costs were the greatest contributors to overall cost in the economic and financial analysis, corresponding to 52%, 17%, and 13% in the economic analysis and 21%, 27%, and 22% in the financial analysis, respectively. The sensitivity analysis was adapted to a range of  (above and under) 25% change. There was an approximate change of 14% in the average economic cost when vehicle costs were decreased by 25%. In the financial analysis, the average financial cost was lowered by 7% when salary costs were decreased by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the current cost analysis provides an impetus for the consideration of targeted IRS operationalization within the available governmental budget, by using locally-available human resources as spray operators to decrease costs and having IRS rounds be correctly timed to coincide with the build-up of vector populations.","output":"A cost analysis to address issues of budget constraints on the implementation of the indoor residual spray programme in two districts of Maputo Province, Mozambique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important causative agent of respiratory infection in childhood.

Analysing learning curves allows us to objectively quantify performance. The aim was to evaluate if the rate of learning and ultimate proficiency level reached in SILS when using straight or articulating instruments is different to conventional laparoscopy and if training in laparoscopy influences learning or proficiency for SILS. DESIGN AND SETTING Thirty-six surgically naive medical students were randomised to complete the validated peg transfer task over 50 repetitions using a conventional laparoscopic set-up, SILS set-up with straight instruments or articulated instruments or SILS set-up after having reached proficiency using a conventional laparoscopy. RESULTS There was a significant increased overall proficiency between the group trained in conventional laparoscopy and all other groups (p < 0.01), with no difference between the other groups. There was no difference in the rate of learning between the groups. There was no difference in the ultimate proficiency level (p = 0.671) or rate of learning (p = 0.63) when using straight or articulating instruments. There was no difference in ultimate proficiency level (p = 0.59) or learning rate (p = 0.219) seen in the SILS group that had prior training on the task with a conventional laparoscopic set-up.

This paper examines the ways an educational provider taps elements of its social capital such as closure and reputation, to establish enforceable trust from clients and their network to enroll in online learning;in addition, it explores the factors that clients consider in deciding to enroll their children in online distance learning. This study is informed by James Coleman's and Ronald Burt's conceptions of closure, trust, and reputation. It employs a case study approach, focusing on a Philippine Catholic parochial high school. Results show that closure is demonstrated through the school's dense social network with parents, students, and the community through the Catholic church. Closure and the school's intergenerational and social reputation facilitate the creation of trust, which increased senior high school enrolment, contrary to the pattern of private schools closing down due to insufficient enrolment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the patient census & details of department of surgical oncology, Royapettah cancer hospital, from month of March 2020 to July 2020, who were subjected to COVID protocol were compared to patient census of similar duration in immediate past five months of October 2019 to February 2020. The data from out-patient department, ward in-patient census and healthcare personnel data was analyzed. RESULTS: There was a drop to 63.5% in OP census and 61.6% in IP census. There was a drop to 64.5% in number of major cases operated during initial phases of COVID pandemic. Health care workers were also infected with the COVID but cross infectivity can be checked if proper steps to adhere to an institutional protocol based on general measures of cleanliness are taken.

Here, we demonstrated that sequence alterations in the coat protein (CP)-binding cis-acting RNA motifs, the Bbox region (in the intercistronic RNA3 sequence) and the RNA3 packaging element (PE, in the movement protein ORF), reduced crossover frequencies in protoplasts. Additionally, the modification of Bbox-like element in the 5 UTR region strongly debilitated crossovers. Along the lines of these observations, RNA3 mutants not expressing CP or expressing mutated CPs also reduced recombination. A series of reciprocal transfections demonstrated a functional crosstalk between the Bbox and PE elements. Altogether, our data imply the role of CP in sgRNA3a-directed recombination by either facilitating the interaction of the RNA substrates and/or by creating roadblocks for the viral replicase.","output":"Mutations in the coat protein-binding cis-acting RNA motifs debilitate RNA recombination of Brome mosaic virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acid biomarkers have been widely used to detect various viral-associated diseases, including the recent pandemic COVID-19. The CRISPR-Cas-based trans-activating phenomenon has shown excellent potential for developing sensitive and selective detection of nucleic acids. However, the nucleic acid amplification steps are typically required when sensitive and selective monitoring of the target nucleic acid is needed. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we developed a CRISPR-Cas12a-based nucleic acid amplification-free biosensor by a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-assisted ultrasensitive detection system. We integrated the activated CRISPR-Cas12a by viral DNA with a Raman-sensitive system composed of ssDNA-immobilized Raman probe-functionalized Au nanoparticles (RAuNPs) on the graphene oxide (GO)/triangle Au nanoflower array. Using this CRISPR-based Raman-sensitive system improved the detection sensitivity of the multiviral DNAs such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16), and HPV-18 with an extremely low detection limit and vast detection range from 1 aM to 100 pM without the amplification steps.

Patients with COVID-19 face a high fatality risk once symptoms worsen; therefore, early identification of severely ill patients can enable early intervention, prevent disease progression, and help reduce mortality. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence-assisted tool using computed tomography (CT) imaging to predict disease severity and further estimate the risk of developing severe disease in patients suffering from COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initial CT images of 408 confirmed COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected between January 1, 2020 and March 18, 2020 from hospitals in Honghu and Nanchang. The data of 303 patients in the Peoples Hospital of Honghu were assigned as the training data, and those of 105 patients in The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were assigned as the test dataset. A deep learning based-model using multiple instance learning and residual convolutional neural network (ResNet34) was developed and validated. The discrimination ability and prediction accuracy of the model were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve and confusion matrix, respectively. RESULTS: The deep learning-based model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.987 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.968C1.00) and an accuracy of 97.4% in the training set, whereas it had an AUC of 0.892 (0.828C0.955) and an accuracy of 81.9% in the test set.

The research employed a quasi-experiment method, and the sample was taken using a randomized sampling technique. Two classes with the same initial knowledge value were used as experimental and control groups. The instrument used was a cognitive test and a Self-Directed Learning (SDL) questionnaire. Results: The results of this research show that there is a significant difference in learning outcomes and SDL in the experiment and control group. Students that apply discovery learning with a combination of face-to-face and digital classes get better results on both variables than in conventional discovery class. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the application of discovery learning through the digital classroom has a positive effect on learning outcomes and students level of independence.

Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 ? resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the 'up' and 'down' conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale.

In Aim 1, we examined associations between COVID-19-related stressors and indices of mental health and well-being in the initial phase of the pandemic (April/May 2020) while accounting for participants' pre-pandemic levels of these outcomes in January of 2020 (N = 519; Mage = 25.4; 62.8% women). Social/relational stressors were most strongly associated with increased symptoms of anxiety/depression, and financial stressors were most strongly associated with decreased satisfaction with life. Extending this research longitudinally (Aim 2), we sampled young adults bi-monthly across a year-long period (September 2020 to August 2021). Multilevel models revealed within-person associations between each stressor domain and mental health/well-being; young adults reported more symptoms of depression/anxiety and lower satisfaction with life in months that stressors were relatively more salient. Interactions between stressors and time revealed associations were generally stronger in earlier months and decreased linearly across the pandemic.

Adsorption of a poly(acrylic acid)-containing film in membrane pores and activation of the ?COOH groups in the film enable covalent-linking of affinity peptides or proteins to the membrane. Passage of mAb-containing serum through the affinity membrane results in mAb capture within 1 min. Subsequent rinsing, binding of a secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore, and a second rinse yield mAb-concentration-dependent fluorescence intensities in the wells. Calibration curves established from analyses on different days have low variability and allow determination of mAb levels in separately prepared samples with an average error <10%, although errors in single-replicate measurements may reach 40%. The assays can occur in diluted serum with physiologically relevant mAb concentrations, as well as in undiluted serum. Thus, the combination of 96-well plates containing affinity membranes, a microplate reader, and a simple vacuum manifold affords convenient mAb quantitation in <5 min.","output":"Quantitation of Trastuzumab and an Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in Minutes Using Affinity Membranes in 96-Well Plates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We examined guidewire and microcatheter utilization during chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The model consists of two layers with one layer representing the railway network and the other representing the local-area transportation subnetworks. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we also study a simplified model that focuses on how a major railway affects an epidemic. We assume that the individuals, when they travel, take on the shortest path to the destination and become non-travelers upon arrival. When an infection process co-evolves with the traveling dynamics, the railway serves to gather a crowd, transmit the disease, and spread infected agents to local area subnetworks. The railway leads to a faster initial increase in infected agents and a higher steady state infection, and thus poses risks; and frequent traveling leads to a more severe infection. These features revealed in simulations are in agreement with analytic results of a simplified version of the model.","output":"Risks of an epidemic in a two-layered railway-local area traveling network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health workers (HWs) run an increased risk of infection.

Most recently CoVID-19 has infected over 2,360,000 humans and killed more than 165,000. Susceptibility to this disease appears to differ markedly across different societies but the factors underlying this variability are not known. Given that toxoplasmosis exerts both direct and immune-mediated antiviral effects, we hypothesize a negative covariation between toxoplasmosis and measures of the Covid-19 pandemic across countries. We obtained aged-adjusted toxoplasmosis prevalence of pregnant women from the literature. Since the differences in the CoVID-19 morbidity and mortality may depend on the different timing of the epidemics in each country, we applied a standard measure, i.e. the date of first documented CoVID-19 in each country as a proxy of susceptibility, with a statistical control for population size effects. Using these two indices, we show a highly significant negative co-variation between the two pandemics across 86 countries. Then, considering that the wealth of nations often co-varies with the prevalence of diseases, we introduced Gross Domestic Product per capita into our model. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis co-varies negatively, while the date of first CoVID-19 cases co-varies positively with GDP across countries. Further, to control for the strong spatial autocorrelation among countries, we carried out a Spatial Structure Analyses of the relationships between the date of first COVID-19, prevalence of toxoplasmosis, and GDP. Results of this analysis did not confirm a direct causal relationship between toxoplasmosis and susceptibility to the CoVID-19 pandemics. As far as an analysis of observational data let us to suggest, it appears that the interaction between CoVID-19 and toxoplasmosis is mediated by GDP and spatial effects.

METHODS: Hospitalized patients receiving RDV for COVID-19 between 5/1/2020-10/31/2020 were analyzed in a retrospective chart review. We compared incident adverse events (AEs) following RDV in patients with and without SRI, including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, any reported AE, mortality and length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 135 patients received RDV, 20 patients had SRI. Patients with SRI were significantly older (70 vs. 54 years, p=0.0001). The incidence of possible AEs following RDV was 20% among those with SRI versus 11% without (p=0.26). LFT elevations occurred in 10% vs. 4% (p=0.28), and SCr elevations occurred in 20% vs. 6% (p=0.06) of patients with SRI versus those without, respectively. The LFT and SCr elevations were not attributed to RDV in either group. Mortality and length of stay were comparable and consistent with historical controls. CONCLUSION: RDV AEs occurred infrequently with low severity and were not significantly different between those with and without SRI. While a higher percentage of patients with SRI experienced SCr elevations, 3 (75%) patients were in AKI prior to RDV. Overall, the use of RDV in this small series of patients with SRI appeared to be relatively safe, and the potential benefit outweighed the theoretical risk of liver or renal toxicity; however, additional studies are needed to confirm this finding.","output":"Remdesivir Use in the Setting of Severe Renal Impairment: A Theoretical Concern or Real Risk?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(Rathore et al., 2020) With the advancement of Internet of Thingsbased smart healthcare systems and cloud computing, inexpensive health services and associated support, coherent regulation of the centralized administration (L?z?roiu et al., 2021), and public health monitoring can be carried out.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the effect of South Korean public health measures on behavioral changes with respect to social distancing without a nationwide lockdown. The results of this study may provide insights to countries who are planning to relax their aggressive restrictions though still having an unflattened curve of infections. METHODS: To estimate how the closure of educational and social welfare facilities and the disclosure of confirmed patients contact history affected social distancing behaviors, we analyzed public transportation data in Seoul, Korea. For the modeling analysis, we used linear mixed-effects estimation. RESULTS: Our estimation showed that the average daily number of bus passengers decreased by 21.8% in February 2020 as compared to the previous year with an additional decrease observed in the areas around educational and social welfare facilities. The highest drop in the daily number of passengers was observed in areas with religious facilities. We also found that individuals avoided areas that were proximate to or within the locations that constituted the confirmed patients contact history. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that public health measures can lead people to practice social distancing. Among them, the measures that strongly encourage voluntary social distancing behaviors would play a critical role in suppressing the infections as it becomes increasingly difficult to continue imposing aggressive restrictions due to practical and economic reasons.","output":"COVID-19: Were Public Health Interventions and the Disclosure of Patients Contact History Effective in Upholding Social Distancing?

Nevertheless, the disproportionate representation of people of low socioeconomic status among those infected resembles discrimination. This population-based retrospective cohort study examined COVID-19 case counts and publicly funded healthcare costs in Ontario, Canada, with a focus on marginalization. Methods Individuals with their first positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, were linked to administrative databases and matched to negative/untested controls. Mean net (COVID-19Cattributable) costs were estimated for 30 days before and after diagnosis, and differences among strata of age, sex, comorbidity, and measures of marginalization were assessed using analysis of variance tests. Results We included 28 893 COVID-19 cases (mean age 54 years, 56% female). Most cases remained in the community (20 545, 71.1%) or in long-term care facilities (4478, 15.5%), whereas 944 (3.3%) and 2926 (10.1%) were hospitalized, with and without intensive care unit, respectively. Case counts were skewed across marginalization strata with 2 to 7 times more cases in neighborhoods with low income, high material deprivation, and highest ethnic concentration. Mean net costs after diagnosis were higher for males ($4752 vs $2520 for females) and for cases with higher comorbidity ($1394-$7751) (both P < .001) but were similar across levels of most marginalization dimensions (range $3232-$3737, all P  .19). Conclusions This study suggests that allocating resources unequally to marginalized individuals may improve equality in outcomes. It highlights the importance of reducing risk of COVID-19 infection among marginalized individuals to reduce overall costs and increase system capacity.","output":"Bring the Hoses to Where the Fire Is!: Differential Impacts of Marginalization and Socioeconomic Status on COVID-19 Case Counts and Healthcare Costs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To characterize the breadth of neurologic findings associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a diverse group of inpatients at an urban, safety-net US medical center Methods: Patients were identified through an electronic medical record review from April 15, 2020, until July 1, 2020, at a large safety-net hospital in Boston, MA, caring primarily for underserved, low-income, and elderly patients All hospitalized adult patients with positive nasopharyngeal swab or respiratory PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 during their hospitalization or in the 30 days before admission who received an inpatient neurologic or neurocritical care consultation or admission during the study period were enrolled Results: Seventy-four patients were identified (42/57% male, median age 64 years) The majority of patients self-identified as Black or African American (38, 51%) The most common neurologic symptoms at presentation to the hospital included altered mental status (39, 53%), fatigue (18, 24%), and headache (18, 18%) Fifteen patients had ischemic strokes (20%) There were 10 in-hospital mortalities, with moderately severe disability among survivors at discharge (14%, median modified Rankin Scale score of 4) Conclusions: Neurologic findings spanned inflammatory, vascular pathologies, sequelae of critical illness and metabolic derangements, possible direct involvement of the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2, and exacerbation of underlying neurologic conditions, highlighting a broad range of possible etiologies of neurologic complications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Further studies are needed to characterize the infectious and postinfectious neurologic complications of COVID-19 in diverse patient populations","output":"Neurologic Findings Among Inpatients With COVID-19 at a Safety-net US Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a common respiratory virus that causes moderately severe infections. We have previously shown that the virus uses heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as the initial attachment factors, facilitating viral entry into the cell. In the present study, we show that the membrane protein (M) of HCoV-NL63 mediates this attachment. Using viruslike particles lacking the spike (S) protein, we demonstrate that binding to the cell is not S protein dependent. Furthermore, we mapped the M protein site responsible for the interaction with HSPG and confirmed its relevance using a viable virus. Importantly, in silico analysis of the region responsible for HSPG binding in different clinical isolates and the Amsterdam I strain did not exhibit any signs of cell culture adaptation. IMPORTANCE It is generally accepted that the coronaviral S protein is responsible for viral interaction with a cellular receptor. Here we show that the M protein is also an important player during early stages of HCoV-NL63 infection and that the concerted action of the two proteins (M and S) is a prerequisite for effective infection. We believe that this study broadens the understanding of HCoV-NL63 biology and may also alter the way in which we perceive the first steps of cell infection with the virus.

This research explored gestational, perinatal, and postpartum outcomes, including gestational diabetes, anemia, preeclampsia, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and postpartum hemorrhage. Participants were divided into underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 kg/m2  BMI  23.9 kg/m2), overweight (24 kg/m2  BMI  27.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI  28 kg/m2) groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between prepregnancy BMI and pregnancy outcomes, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated. After adjusting potential confounders, the risk of PPROM was higher in the underweight group than the normal weight group (OR = 1.864, 95% CI: 1.269-2.737, P < 0.01). Prepregnancy obesity was associated with higher odds of gestational diabetes (OR = 2.649, 95% CI: 1.701-4.126, P < 0.001) and preeclampsia (OR = 3.654, 95% CI: 1.420-9.404, P < 0.01) than the normal weight group, whereas it correlated with the lower risk of anemia (OR = 0.300, 95% CI: 0.128-0.704, P < 0.01).

The predicted epitopes induced robust T-cell activation in unexposed donors demonstrating pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The T-cell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools in the unexposed donors. A key finding of our study is that pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple published studies in which pre-existing T-cell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and other common cold-causing coronaviruses. However, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells are likely to be present in many individuals because of prior exposure to flu and CMV viruses.","output":"Immunodominant T-cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen reveal robust pre-existing T-cell immunity in unexposed individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To evaluate the readability and quality of online patient information regarding treatment for constipation in the English language.

The currently accepted method to eradicate inhibitors is immune tolerance induction (ITI), and frequent intensive administration of FVIII until inhibitor titers drop. Current ITI protocols are extremely costly and not effective in all patients. During the last decade, many types of research have been accomplished to clarify the mechanisms that mediate immune tolerance induction.

Visualizing such data in an interactive form is essential for public sharing and geographic information systems (GIS) analysis. The Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi) framework offers a visual analytic integrating data that is compatible with geographic data. ArcGIS is a predominant geospatial software available for presenting and communicating geographic data, yet to our knowledge there is no methodology for integrating ToxPi profiles into ArcGIS maps. OBJECTIVE: We introduce an actively developed suite of software, the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit, for creating, viewing, sharing, and analyzing interactive ToxPi profiles in ArcGIS to allow for new GIS analysis and an avenue for providing geospatial results to the public. METHODS: The ToxPi*GIS Toolkit is a collection of methods for creating interactive feature layers that contain ToxPi profiles. It currently includes an ArcGIS Toolbox (ToxPiToolbox.tbx) for drawing location-specific ToxPi profiles in a single feature layer, a collection of modular Python scripts that create predesigned layer files containing ToxPi feature layers from the command line, and a collection of Python routines for useful data manipulation and preprocessing. We present workflows documenting ToxPi feature layer creation, sharing, and embedding for both novice and advanced users looking for additional customizability. RESULTS: Map visualizations created with the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit can be made freely available on public URLs, allowing users without ArcGIS Pro access or expertise to view and interact with them. Novice users with ArcGIS Pro access can create de novo custom maps, and advanced users can exploit additional customization options. The ArcGIS Toolbox provides a simple means for generating ToxPi feature layers. We illustrate its usage with current COVID-19 data to compare drivers of pandemic vulnerability in counties across the United States. SIGNIFICANCE: The integration of ToxPi profiles with ArcGIS provides new avenues for geospatial analysis, visualization, and public sharing of multi-factor data. This allows for comparison of data across a region, which can support decisions that help address issues such as disease prevention, environmental health, natural disaster prevention, chemical risk, and many others. Development of new features, which will advance the interests of the scientific community in many fields, is ongoing for the ToxPi*GIS Toolkit, which can be accessed from www.toxpi.org.","output":"ToxPi*GIS Toolkit: creating, viewing, and sharing integrative visualizations for geospatial data using ArcGIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family are widely implicated in tissue remodeling events manifested in cancer development. ADAMTS1, the most fully characterized ADAMTS, plays conflicting roles in different cancer types; however, the role of ADAMTS1 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. Herein, we found that ADAMTS1 is highly expressed in RCC tissues compared to normal renal tissues, and its expression was correlated with an advanced stage and a poor prognosis of RCC patients. In vitro, we observed higher expression of ADAMTS1 in metastatic (m)RCC cells compared to primary cells, and manipulation of ADAMTS1 expression affected cell invasion and clonogenicity. Results from protease array showed that ADAMTS1 is modulated by melatonin through mechanisms independent of the MT1 receptor in mRCC cells, and overexpression of ADAMTS1 relieved the invasion/clonogenicity and growth/metastasis inhibition imposed by melatonin treatment in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model. The human microRNA (miR) OneArray showed that miR-181d and miR-let-7f were induced by melatonin and respectively targeted the 3'-UTR and non-3'UTR of ADAMTS1 to suppress its expression and mRCC invasive ability. Clinically, RCC patients with high levels of miR-181d or miR-let-7f and a low level of ADAMTS1 had the most favorable prognoses. In addition, ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of ADAMTS1 can also be triggered by melatonin. Together, our study indicates that ADAMTS1 may be a useful biomarker for predicting RCC progression. The novel convergence between melatonin and ADAMTS1 post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation provides new insights into the role of melatonin-induced molecular regulation in suppressing RCC progression.","output":"Melatonin-triggered post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications of ADAMTS1 coordinately retard tumorigenesis and metastasis of renal cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A scientific interest has emerged to identify pharmaceutical and nutritional strategies in the clinical management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Oral medicinal doses of vitamin C (1C3 g/d) and zinc (80 mg/d elemental zinc) could be promising at the first signs and symptoms of COVID-19 as well as for general colds. In critical care situations requiring parenteral nutrition, vitamin C (3C10 g/d) and glutamine (0.3C0.5 g/kg/d) administration could be considered, whereas vitamin D3 administration (100,000 IU administered intramuscularly as a one-time dose) could possess benefits for patients with severe deficiency. Considering the presence of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and arginine in immune-enhancing diets, their co-administration may also occur in clinical conditions where these formulations are recommended. However, despite the use of the aforementioned strategies in prior contexts, there is currently no evidence of the utility of any nutritional strategies in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of DJBL at inducing weight loss. We assessed the effect of DJBL on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through 1 July 2017. Included were published studies that assessed DJBL outcomes in obese T2D patients. RESULTS Primary outcomes were change in HbA1c and HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes were change in weight and gut hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and ghrelin. Seventeen studies were included. At explant, HbA1c decreased by 1.3% [95% CI 1.0, 1.6] and HOMA-IR decreased by 4.6 [2.9, 6.3]. Compared with control subjects, DJBL subjects had greater HbA1c reduction by 0.9% [0.5, 1.3]. Six months after explant, HbA1c remained lower than baseline by 0.9% [0.6, 1.2]. At explant, patients lost 11.3 kg [10.3, 12.2], corresponding to a BMI reduction of 4.1 kg/m2 [3.4, 4.9], total weight loss of 18.9% [7.2, 30.6], and excess weight loss of 36.9% [29.2, 44.6]. The amount of weight loss remained significant at 1 year postexplantation. After DJBL, GIP decreased, whereas GLP-1, PYY, and ghrelin increased. CONCLUSIONS DJBL improves glycemic control and insulin resistance in T2D patients with obesity. DJBL also appears to induce significant weight loss in this population. Additionally, changes in gut hormones suggest mechanisms similar to RYGB.

Objective: Assess the psychometric characteristics of a new 22-item transdiagnostic screening measure, the Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS). Method: An internet survey was administered with English speaking participants recruited passively via the website of the Global Collaboration on Traumatic Stress (GC-TS) (n(GC-TS) = 1,268) and actively via Amazons MTurk (n(MTurk) = 1,378). Exploratory factor analysis, correlational analysis, sensitivity and specificity analysis, and comparisons in response between the two samples and between male and female respondents were conducted. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a single factor underlying symptom endorsements in both samples, suggesting that such problems may form a unitary transdiagnostic, posttraumatic outcome. Convergent validity of the GPS symptom and risk factors was established with measures of PTSD and dissociative symptoms in the MTurk sample. Gender differences were seen primarily at the item level with women more often endorsing several symptoms and specific risk factors in the MTurk sample, and the GC-TS recruited sample endorsed more symptoms and risk factors than the MTurk sample, suggesting that the GPS may be sensitive to group differences. A GPS symptom cut-off score of 8 identified optimized sensitivity and specificity relative to probable PTSD based on PCL-5 scores. Conclusions: The current results provide preliminary support for the validity of the GPS as a screener for the concurrent measurement of several transdiagnostic outcomes of potentially traumatic stressors and the apparent unifactorial structure of such symptoms is suggestive of a single or unitary posttraumatic outcome.

RESULTS: Of 42,002 patients who underwent hip fracture surgery, 678 (1.61%) were identified to be positive for COVID-19 infection. No significant differences in age, sex, and procedure type were found between COVID-19Cpositive and COVID-19Cnegative groups, but the COVID-19Cpositive patients demonstrated a higher incidence of several comorbidities. These differences were no longer significant after matching. After matching, the COVID-19Cpositive group had a higher incidence of any, serious, and minor adverse events (P < 0.001 for all). Controlling for preoperative variables, COVID-19 positivity was associated with an increased risk of experiencing any adverse events (odds ratio [OR] = 1.62, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = [1.37 to 1.92], P < 0.001), serious adverse events (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = [1.31 to 2.07], P < 0.001), and minor adverse events (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = [1.34 to 1.89], P < 0.001). DISCUSSION: After matching and controlling for confounding variables, COVID-19Cpositive hip fracture patients had increased odds of multiple postoperative events. Clinicians caring for this vulnerable geriatric population should be mindful of this risk to improve the care for these patients during the ongoing global pandemic.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Perioperative Complication Profiles of COVID-19CPositive Patients Undergoing Hip Fracture Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A great effort to discover new therapeutic ingredients is often initiated through the discovery of the existence of novel marine natural products.

We are constantly threatened by the danger of i) being infected, ii) infecting other people, and (iii) by the loss of social relation.

First, we discuss about recent psychological and neuronal findings on fear and its disorders, related to an unbalanced intero-exteroceptive processing and emotional regulation. Secondly we move to the psychological and neuronal dynamics of self and others characterized by a temporo-spatial alignment with the world. Due to the neural overlap of emotion and self and the deep-reaching neuro-ecological layers of self, emotional feelings like fear and anxiety cannot be detached and dissociated from the world; they signify the worldCbrain relation, and, more specifically, our self-other relation. The deepest neuro-ecological and neuro-social layers of self are threatened by the loss of subjectivity, which is manifest in our loss of body and thus the fear of dying, and the loss of intersubjectivity that surfaces in our fear of infecting others, which reflect the intimate anchorage of the self with the world.

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) is a bacterial defense system that inactivates the invading phage genome by introducing double-strand breaks at targeted sequences. While the mechanisms of CRISPR defense have been extensively investigated, the counterdefense mechanisms employed by phages are poorly understood. Here, we report a novel counterdefense mechanism by which phage T4 restores the genomes broken by CRISPR cleavages. Catalyzed by the phage-encoded recombinase UvsX, this mechanism pairs very short stretches of sequence identity (minihomology sites), as few as 3 or 4 nucleotides in the flanking regions of the cleaved site, allowing replication, repair, and stitching of genomic fragments. Consequently, a series of deletions are created at the targeted site, making the progeny genomes completely resistant to CRISPR attack. Our results demonstrate that this is a general mechanism operating against both type II (Cas9) and type V (Cas12a) CRISPR-Cas systems. These studies uncovered a new type of counterdefense mechanism evolved by T4 phage where subtle functional tuning of preexisting DNA metabolism leads to profound impact on phage survival.","output":"Bacteriophage T4 Escapes CRISPR Attack by Minihomology Recombination and Repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Approval of novel vaccines for COVID-19 has brought hope and expectations, but not without additional challenges. One central challenge is how to appropriately prioritize the use of limited supply of vaccines. This study evaluates various prioritization strategies and the efficacy of the vaccination campaign underway in the U.S. Methods The study develops a granular agent-based simulation model for mimicking community spread of COVID-19 under various social interventions including full and partial closures, isolation and quarantine, use of face mask and contact tracing, and vaccination. The model is populated with demographic and societal data for an urban community in the U.S. with 2.8 million residents as well as viral parameters. The model tracks daily numbers of infected, hospitalized, and deaths for all census age-groups. Model is calibrated using parameters for viral transmission and level of community circulation of individuals. Published data from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard is used to validate the model. Vaccination strategies are compared using hypothesis test for pairwise comparisons. Results Three prioritization strategies examined are: a close variant of the CDC recommendation, an age-stratified strategy, and a random strategy. The impact of vaccination is also contrasted with a no vaccination scenario. The comparison shows that the ongoing campaign in the U.S. using vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna is expected to 1) reduce the cumulative number of infection by 10% and 2) help the pandemic to subside below a small threshold of 100 daily new reported cases sooner by approximately a month. The prioritization strategies when compared with each other showed no significant difference in their impacts on pandemic mitigation. Conclusions Recent explosive growth of the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to shrink the susceptible population. This, we believe, will likely limit the expected number of people that could be prevented from getting infected due to vaccination. A shrinking susceptible pool may also be an attributable reason for the observed lack of statistical difference among the outcomes of the prioritization strategies. However, the invariance of the strategies should give more latitude for decision makers in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.","output":"Impact of Vaccine Prioritization Strategies on Mitigating COVID-19: An Agent-Based Simulation Study using an Urban Region in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to describe the chest CT findings in sixty-seven patients infected by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The regression coefficients of those factors remaining significant in the multivariable logistic regression were utilised for risk score formulation and validated in 1000 bootstrap datasets. Among 746 COVID-19 patients hospitalised [487 survivors and 259 non-survivors (deaths)], there was a slight male predilection [62.5%, (466/746)], with a higher mortality rate observed among 40C70 years age group [59.1%, (441/746)] and highest among diabetic patients with elevated urea levels [65.4% (68/104)].

However, concerns surrounding viral particle aerosolization, nosocomial spread, and patient self-induced lung injury have likely influenced choice of respiratory support strategies. To date, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) practice patterns have not been characterized for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection who received supplemental oxygen, using the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery VIRUS Registry. The primary outcome was hospital-level variation in use of HFNC and NIPPV, summarized using the intraclass correlation coefficient and median odds ratio. Hierarchical random effects models were used to estimate patient and hospital factors associated with HFNC and NIPPV use. Risk-adjusted estimation of the association between hospital HFNC/NIPPV use and patient risk of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was assessed as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Among 8,532 patients with COVID-19 receiving oxygen support across 73 hospitals, the majority were treated in the US (92.3%) and were older (median age 63 years, IQR 52-74), white (49.1%), men (56.8%) with median SOFA score of 4 (IQR 1-6) and admission PaO2:FiO2 below 300 (49.4%). Of these, 5,298 (62.1%) received low flow oxygen (nasal cannula or face mask), while 1,768 (20.7%) received HFNC, 773 (9.1%) received NIPPV and 693 (8.1%) received both HFNC/NIPPV. Patient SOFA score (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90, 0.95), treatment for COVID-19 after July versus March-June (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0, 1.6) and ICU versus floor admission (OR 10.3, 95% CI 8.2, 12.8) were associated with HFNC/NIPPV use. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, the hospital of admission contributed to 27% of the variation in use of HFNC and/or NIPPV. Odds of receiving either modality at a randomly selected high vs. low HFNC/NIPPV utilization hospital was 2.9. Hospital rates of HFNC/NIPPV use were not associated with patient receipt of IMV (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.7, 1.1). CONCLUSION: Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, use of HFNC and NIPPV varied widely across hospitals, though use of non-invasive respiratory support modalities was not associated with patient risk for invasive mechanical ventilation. Further evaluation of HFNC and NIPPV exposure, progression to IMV and subsequent mortality within these subgroups may provide additional insights regarding optimal oxygenation and ventilation strategies of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Variation in high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation practice patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the international viral infection and respiratory illness universal study (virus)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To provide recommendations for the management of patients with cancer in the COVID-19 era.

METHODS: In study 1, women were recruited from outpatient breast clinics across England and Wales. Eligible women were asked to complete a questionnaire pack to assess their access to devices and their e-health literacy. Multiple regression analyses were run to assess the relationship between technology access and e-health literacy with sociodemographic variables such as age, social deprivation, and education. Study 2 presents a smaller sample recruited through social media who answered a questionnaire relating to use of mobile devices and e-health, and apps. RESULTS: Two thousand nine women participated in the study. Seventy-one percent had access to a smartphone, 54% had access to a tablet, and 20% did not have access to either device. Multiple logistic regressions showed that women who were younger, had higher levels of education, and who were from less deprived areas were more likely to have access to either device. Poorer e-health literacy was associated with being older, having less education, and not having access to a mobile device.

RESULTS: The major lessons learned for organizing were: (1) the pandemic created a need to rapidly pivot to new scientific priorities; (2) necessary health and safety precautions disrupted the flow of normal science and put programs at risk of missing milestones; (3) relationships with partners and allies facilitated medical diplomacy and advancement of U.S. national military and economic goals; and (4) a successful response required interoperability within and across multiple organizations. For equipping: (1) existing infrastructure lacked sufficient capacity and technical capability to allow immediate countermeasure development; (2) critical supply chains were strained; and (3) critical information system function and capacity were suddenly insufficient under maximum remote work. For staffing and training: (1) successful telework required rapid shifts in management, engagement, and accountability methods; and (2) organizational policies and processes had to adapt quickly to support remote staffing. For leading and leadership development (1) engaged, hopeful, and empathetic leadership made a difference; and (2) the workforce benefitted from concerted leadership communication that created a shared understanding of shifting priorities as well as new processes and procedures. CONCLUSIONS: An effective pandemic response requires comprehensive institutional preparedness that facilitates flexibility and surge capacity. The single most important action leaders of medical research organizations can take to prepare for the next pandemic is to develop a quick-reaction force that would activate under prespecified criteria to manage reprioritization of all science and support activities to address pandemic response priorities at the velocity of relevance.","output":"Cross-Cutting Lessons Learned During the COVID-19 Pandemicthe Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: The e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) outbreak peaked in September 2019, yet hospitalization of adolescents for EVALI has continued. We describe the clinical features and short-term pulmonary function outcomes of 36 adolescents hospitalized for EVALI at a large, tertiary-care, university-affiliated children's hospital, including 17 who were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: An electronic health record review of adolescents hospitalized at our institution with confirmed or suspected EVALI from December 2018 to December 2020 was conducted. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize sociodemographic data, clinical course, imaging, laboratory results and response to treatment. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare pulmonary function test (PFT) results pre- to post- glucocorticoid administration, and also postglucocorticoid to post-discharge.Results: The mean age was 16.3 years;33% were female and 56% were Hispanic. All patients had constitutional symptoms;fever (92%) was the most common. All patients had respiratory (83%) or gastrointestinal (89%) symptoms upon presentation;72% had both. Vaping tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was reported in 97% and nicotine in 53%. Patients underwent workup or treatment for asthma, typical and atypical pneumonia, appendicitis, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 before EVALI diagnosis. Urinary THC metabolite was present in 100% of patients tested. Bilateral ground-glass opacities were noted on chest computed tomography (CT) in 97%. Maximal respiratory support of nasal cannula, bi-level positive airway pressure, intubation with mechanical ventilation, or veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation characterized 18, 4, 4 and 1 patients respectively. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive in 1 out of 17 patients tested;this patient required intensive care and was treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. Intravenous antibiotics were administered to 69% of patients without subsequent clinical improvement. In contrast, 94% of patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids improved within 24 hours. Median length of hospital stay was 7 days. No patients died. Follow-up CT scan done 1-4 months post-discharge in 5 patients showed complete resolution of ground-glass opacities. A statistically significant improvement (P&lt;0.05) in all pulmonary function measures was observed post-glucocorticoid to post discharge while spirometry and six-minute walk distance also improved pre-and post-glucocorticoid (figure1). Conclusions: Although COVID-19 infection was suspected in many adolescents with EVALI owing to symptom profile overlap, positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR was rare. Imaging findings, clinical symptoms and PFTs improved after glucocorticoid treatment for EVALI.","output":"Clinical presentation, management and short-term outcomes in adolescents hospitalized with electronic cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (evali)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunosenescence and comorbidities increase the susceptibility of older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) to vaccine-preventable diseases, hospitalization, disability, or death.

However, it is unclear whether the interplay among corresponding genes also plays a role in human health and lifespan. Methods: Literature about roles of cellular stressors have been reviewed, such as amino acid deprivation, and the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway in health and aging. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two candidate genes (GCN2/EIF2AK4 and CHOP/DDIT3) that are closely involved in the cellular stress response to amino acid starvation, have been selected using information from experimental studies. Associations of these SNPs and their interactions with human survival in the Health and Retirement Study data have been estimated. The impact of collective associations of multiple interacting SNP pairs on survival has been evaluated, using a recently developed composite index: the SNP-specific Interaction Polygenic Risk Score (SIPRS). Results: Significant interactions have been found between SNPs from GCN2/EIF2AK4 and CHOP/DDI3T genes that were associated with survival 85+ compared to survival between ages 75 and 85 in the total sample (males and females combined) and in females only. This may reflect sex differences in genetic regulation of the human lifespan. Highly statistically significant associations of SIPRS [constructed for the rs16970024 (GCN2/EIF2AK4) and rs697221 (CHOP/DDIT3)] with survival in both sexes also been found in this study. Conclusion: Identifying associations of the genetic interactions with human survival is an important step in translating the knowledge from experimental to human aging research. Significant associations of multiple SNPxSNP interactions in ISR genes with survival to the oldest old age that have been found in this study, can help uncover mechanisms of multifactorial regulation of human lifespan and its heterogeneity.","output":"Roles of interacting stress-related genes in lifespan regulation: insights for translating experimental findings to humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies in blood supply chain network design often follow a commonly used approach in protecting the chain against disruptions, considering the effects of disruptions on the designing phase However, in many real-world situations, disruptions cannot be adequately measured in advance Moreover, using disruptions in the designing phase through the common two-stage stochastic programming models impose high costs on the network, since they cannot be updated based on unpredicted disruptions This paper proposes an updatable two-phase approach which deals with disruptions in the operational phase, not in the strategic design phase In the first step, called the proactive phase, a nominal platelet supply chain network is designed under operational uncertainty, using the whole-blood collection method In the event of disruptions, the second step, called the reactive phase, is applied, and the tailored network is updated based on the realized data, using apheresis as the collection mechanism The operational risks are captured using a fuzzy programming approach in the model Based on the real data from Fars province of Iran, we compare the performance of the two-phase approach with the commonly used approaches in the literature, resulting in more flexible decisions, and consequently, less conservatism degree rather than the existing approaches","output":"A reactive phase against disruptions for designing a proactive platelet supply network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019), which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients.","output":"Automated detection of COVID-19 cases using deep neural networks with X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

However, studies on the seroepidemeology of hMPV are very limited in China. To assess the seroprevalence of hMPV infection in China, we tested a total of 1,156 serum specimens for the presence of anti-hMPV IgG antibody in children and adults free of acute respiratory illness in Beijing, China by using hMPV nucleocapsid (N) protein as an antigen. As a control, we used the human serum antibody against the N protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the most important viral agent responsible for ARIs in children. RESULTS: The seropositive rate for hMPV increased steadily with age from 67% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20. However, the rate dropped slightly between 6 mo and 1 yr of age. The seropositive rate for hRSV also increased steadily with age from 71% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20. In children aged six months to six years, the seropositive rates for the anti-hRSV IgG antibody were significantly higher than those for hMPV. Additionally, IgG antibody titers to hMPV and hRSV were significantly higher in adults than in young children. Consistent with the seropositive rates, the geometric mean titer of anti-hMPV IgG antibody was lower than that of anti-hRSV IgG antibody in children aged six months to six years. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that similar to hRSV, exposure to hMPV is ubiquitous in the Beijing population. However, the seroprevalence of anti-hMPV IgG antibody is lower than that of hRSV in children between six months and six years old, which suggests a different number of repeat infections or a different response to infections.","output":"Large-scale seroprevalence analysis of human metapneumovirus and human respiratory syncytial virus infections in Beijing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose: Due to the vast spread of coronavirus, the lockdown has been announced in many countries, and hence many people are facing psychological, physical, economic and social issues It has targeted all the population but this study focuses on the increased amount of perceived stress on women who are undergoing work from home pattern of occupation Methodology: Sample comprised of 110 working women The structured questionnaire, Perceived Stress Questionnaire, was circulated through online google forms Along with stress, demographic sheet was used to study stress in working women due to lock down Result: The outcome, view of the respondents based on feeling of anxiety of working ladies was classified into 3 categories (Mild, Moderate, Severe) and range 7 persons of respondents are in 0 01-0 40 range i e 6 36%, 101 persons of respondents are in 0 40 C 0 70 range i e 91 81%, 2 persons of respondents are in 0 70 C 1 00 range i e 1 81% Conclusion: In this investigation we found that a large population of the females are under moderate pressure and are overstressed while carrying out work from home","output":"Stress in working women due to lockdown: A cross sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD), are vulnerable to the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively.

The aim of this rapid-response research is to glimpse the possible presence of psychological stress in online searches that relate to debilitation in the four foundational strata of Maslow's Hierarchy of Human needs (basic and psychological needs). To search basic needs related to COVID-19 the following categories were utilized in online search phrases in Google (US): precarity and insecurity. To search basic and psychological needs related to suicide the following categories were utilized in online search phrases in Google (US): despondency and helplessness. Finally, to search basic and psychological needs related to femicide the following categories were utilized in online search phrases in Google (US): indicative male violence and intentional male violence.

However, the identification of EEG diagnostic biomarkers has been complicated by the disorder's heterogeneity. The objective of this review was to synthesize the literature investigating EEG variation in patients diagnosed with ADHD, addressing the following questions: 1) Are the diagnostic ADHD subtypes associated with different EEG characteristics? 2) Are EEG measures correlated with ADHD traits and/or symptom severity? and 3) Do classification techniques using EEG measures reveal different clinical presentations of ADHD? Outcomes highlight the potential for electrophysiological measures to provide meaningful insights into the heterogeneity of ADHD, although direct translation of EEG biomarkers for diagnostic purposes is not yet supported. Key measures that show promise for the discrimination of existing ADHD subtypes and symptomatology include: resting state and task-related modulation of alpha, beta and theta power, and the event-related N2 and P3 components.

The pandemic has exacerbated existing racial inequalities in the United States in terms of public health and economic outcomes, and it is well-established that individuals higher in racial bias are less likely to support social safety net programs such as those meant to improve public health and reduce poverty. This is particularly true among individuals who perceive racial minorities as overbenefitting from safety net programs. Accordingly, the primary focus of the current studies was to examine whether framing the pandemic in terms of its disproportionate impact on minorities would reduce support for pandemic mitigation policies. In addition, we examine whether such effects were mediated through psychological mechanisms of moral outrage and perceptions of realistic and symbolic threat, and moderated by participants? racial bias. Participants? belief in a just world was included as a covariate given its established role in predicting many related social outcomes. Results suggested that racial framing interacts with participants? racial bias to affect policy support indirectly through multiple mechanisms.

A retrospective multicenter study of gastroschisis patients born between 1993 and 2015 in four Finnish university hospitals was undertaken, collecting perinatal, surgical, and clinical data of neonates for uni- and multifactorial modeling analysis. The aim of the present study was to identify risk factors for mortality and the composite adverse outcome (death and/or short bowel syndrome or hospital stay > 60 days). Of the 154 infants with gastroschisis, the overall survival rate was 90.9%. In Cox regression analysis, independent risk factors for mortality included liver herniation, pulmonary hypoplasia, relaparotomy for perforation or necrosis, abdominal compartment syndrome, and central line sepsis. Furthermore, a logistic regression analysis identified central line sepsis, abdominal compartment syndrome, complex gastroschisis, and a younger gestational age as independent predictors of the composite adverse outcome. Conclusion: The risk of death is increased in newborns with gastroschisis who have liver herniation, pulmonary hypoplasia, abdominal compartment syndrome, relaparotomy for perforation or necrosis, or central lineCassociated sepsis.

Web-based interventions demonstrate good efficacy in addressing these concerns and are more accessible than face-to-face interventions. Finding My Way (FMW) is a web-based, psycho-educational, and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for cancer survivors developed in Australia. Previous trials have demonstrated that FMW is acceptable, highly adhered to, and effective in reducing the impact of distress on quality of life while leading to cost savings through health resource use reduction. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt the Australian FMW website for a UK cancer care context and then undertake a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial of FMW UK against a treatment-as-usual waitlist control. METHODS: To an extent, our trial design replicates the existing Australian randomized controlled trial of FMW. Following a comprehensive adaptation of the web resource, we will recruit 294 participants (147 per study arm) from across clinical sites in North West England and North Wales. Participants will have been diagnosed with cancer of any type in the last 6 months, have received anticancer treatment with curative intent, be aged 16 years, be proficient in English, and have access to the internet and an active email address. Participants will be identified and recruited through the National Institute for Health Research clinical research network. Measures of distress, quality of life, and health economic outcomes will be collected using a self-report web-based questionnaire at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and both 3- and 6-month follow-up. Quantitative data will be analyzed using intention-to-treat mixed model repeated measures analysis. Embedded semistructured qualitative interviews will probe engagement with, and experiences of using, FMW UK and suggestions for future improvements. RESULTS: The website adaptation work was completed in January 2021. A panel of cancer survivors and health care professionals provided feedback on the test version of FMW UK. Feedback was positive overall, although minor updates were made to website navigation, inclusivity, terminology, and the wording of the Improving Communication and Sexuality and Intimacy content. Recruitment for the clinical trial commenced in April 2021. We aim to report on findings from mid-2023. CONCLUSIONS: Replication studies are an important aspect of the scientific process, particularly in psychological and clinical trial literature, especially in different geographical settings. Before replicating the FMW trial in the UK setting, content updating was required. If FMW UK now replicates Australian findings, we will have identified a novel and cost-effective method of psychosocial care delivery for cancer survivors in the United Kingdom.

The possible impairment of the diaphragm could be related to the systemic inflammatory response that typifies this infection. We aimed to assess the diaphragmatic function in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We recruited patients admitted with pneumonia and positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, differentiating two groups according to their respiratory symptoms. The cases group consisted of 9 inpatients with moderate-severe dyspnea, pain with diaphragmatic origin or hiccup. The control group consisted of 10 inpatients who suffered from mild dyspnea. We performed phrenic nerve electroneurogram and diaphragmatic ultrasound to assess the diaphragmatic function. Results: We observed differences in the amplitude of evoked potentials, being 25.92% (SEM:7.22) in the cases group vs 19.81% (SEM:5.27) in the control group (p = 0.711). The right diaphragm thickness mean was 46.67% (SEM:8.86) in the cases group vs 62.15% (SEM:5.58) in the control group (p = 0.432), the left diaphragm thickness mean was 57.89% (SEM:15.36) in the cases group vs 73.34% (SEM:6.74) in the control group (p = 0.730), the right expiratory fraction mean was 0.53 (SEM:0.11) in the cases group vs 0.59 (SEM:0.05) in the control group (p = 0.674), and the left expiratory fraction mean was 0.58 (SEM:0.15) in the cases group vs 0.73 (SEM:0.07) in the control group (p = 0.195).

However, for this to become a reality, both n-MOS and p-MOS should be realized, ideally with the same (standard) material. In the specific case of MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs), ambipolar transport is seldom reported, primarily due to the phenomenon of Fermi level pinning (FLP). In this study we identify the possible sources of FLP in MoS2 FETs and resolve them individually. A novel contact transfer technique is used to transfer contacts on top of MoS2 flake devices that results in a significant increase in the hole branch of the transfer characteristics as compared to conventionally fabricated contacts. We hypothesize that the pinning not only comes from the contact-MoS2 interface, but also from the MoS2-substrate interface. We confirm this by shifting to an hBN substrate which leads to a 10 fold increase in the hole current compared to the SiO2 substrate. Furthermore, we analyse MoS2 FETs of different channel thickness on three different substrates, SiO2, hBN and Al2O3, by correlating the p-branch I ON/I OFF to the position of oxide defect band in these substrates. FLP from the oxide is reduced in the case of Al2O3 which enables us to observe ambipolar transport in a bilayer MoS2 FET. These results highlight that MoS2 is indeed an ambipolar material, and the absence of ambipolar transport in MoS2 FETs is strongly correlated to its dielectric environment and processing conditions.","output":"Understanding ambipolar transport in MoS2 field effect transistors: the substrate is the key."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diet processing impacts on starch properties, such as the degree of starch gelatinization.

The starch granules appeared more compact in the pelleted diet, showing first signs of degradation only in the small intestine. The caecum content of both diets group was intensively stained, particles as well as fluid phase, indicating that it contained mainly starch. The SEM pictures of caecum content showed abundant bacteria near starch particles.

The impact of obesity has always been evaluated in terms of body mass index (BMI), without studying the effects of skin-to-liver distance (SLD) on LSM. We studied the impact of SLD on LSM in a cohort of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery and intra-operatory liver biopsy. Materials and Methods: 299 patients underwent LSM by point-shear wave elastography (ElastPQ protocol), with two different ultrasound machines. SLD was measured as the distance between the skin and the liver capsule, perpendicular to where the region of interest (ROI) was positioned. We used the following arbitrary cut-offs: <5.7 kPa, F0C1; 5.7C7.99 kPa, F2; 8 kPa, F3C4. Results: We developed two logistic regression models using elastographyChistology agreement (EHA) as the dependent variable and SLD as the independent variable. The model based on the second machine showed strongly more performant discriminative and calibration metrics (AIC 38.5, BIC 44.2, Nagelkerke Pseudo-R2 0.894, AUROC 0.90).

New studies investigating the tenacity of SARS-CoV-2 have highlighted its ability to persist on a myriad of surfaces for several days, including gowns and shoes. As a result, there is a global need for sterilization of a variety of potentially-contaminated items, ranging from clothing to personal protective equipment like face coverings. To this end, we have designed and constructed a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable sterilization system that uses ozone gas to inactivate viral particles. We sought to determine the efficacy of the system in the sterilization of viral particles as well as its ability to sterilize N95 respirators for reuse. N95 respirators inoculated with P22 bacteriophage and sterilized in the ozone system showed a 6-log10 reduction in viral load when treated at 25 ppm for 150 minutes. Further, N95 respirators treated with five 150-minute cycles at 35 ppm for a total concentration-time product (CT) of 26,250 ppm*min in the ozone system showed comparable filtration efficiency to untreated N95 respirators in a 50 to 200 nmr particulate challenge filtration test. Interestingly, the surgical N95 respirators tested showed complete inactivation of fluid resistance and degradation of the elasticity of polyisoprene straps after five cycles in the sterilization system. Taken together, these data suggest that while our ozone system may negatively affect certain protective aspects of surgical N95 respirators, it does effectively sterilize viral particles and can be utilized for a multitude of other use cases, including sterilizing polypropylene face coverings after potential SARS-CoV-2 contamination. In addition to providing long-term environmental benefits, deployment of this system during the ongoing pandemic reduces the risk of COVID-19 community transmission while conserving monetary resources otherwise spent on the continuous purchase of disposable face coverings.","output":"Characterization of a novel, low-cost, scalable ozone gas system for sterilization of N95 respirators and other COVID-19 related use cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug repurposing offers a more efficient route to medicinal innovation than conventional new molecular entity research, and proposals for repurposing projects can come from in silico algorithms, pharmacological experimentation, clinical serendipity or retrospective analysis of human data.

The most shared classification of droplets size distribution of sneezes was used. Droplets were modeled through additive heating/evaporation/boiling laws and their impact on the continuous phase was examined. Larger droplets move behind the droplet nuclei front and exhibit greater vertical drop due to the effect of gravity. CFD simulations provided the iso-risk curves extension (i.e., the maximum distance as well as the angle) enclosed by the incident outcome effect zone. To calculate the risk indexes, a fault tree was developed and the probability of transmission assuming as of the top event COVID-19 infection was calculated starting from the virus spread curve, as main base case. Four phases of virus spread evolution were identified: initiation, propagation, generalised propagation and termination. For each phase, the maximum allowable close contact was computed, being fixed the values of the acceptable risk index. In particular, it was found that during the propagation case, the maximum allowable close contacts is two, suggesting that at this point lockdown should be activated.

However, people without experience in analysis have difficulty understanding its conditions and methods, and as a result it takes longer to establish countermeasures. It must be noted that understanding conditions by simply aligning occurrences in the accident in a chronological order is difficult. PURPOSE: A workflow chart that considers time was proposed so that individuals without adequate experience in analysis could easily carry out root cause analysis. METHODS: In the workflow chart (WFC), the time sequence was described horizontally. On the vertical axis, the business manual, the occurrence of the accident, and the time of the occurrence are displayed. In the bottom column of patient event, information regarding damage to patients was written in accordance with time axis. Regarding the degree of damage, the time of error until the accident was identified was connected using a straight line (when the patient was not affected, a dotted line was used) in order to show the overall picture of the accident. RESULTS: According to the time flow chart, hints to identify potential risks were proposed. Focus was placed not only on the error event, but also on keywords such as manual inadequacy, time gap, degree of error and so on to easily lead to the question why? To visualise this, I proposed an operation flow chart. By using time-WFC, even beginners can easily develop accident countermeasure strategies.

As of now, COVID-19 has affected more than 6 million confirmed cases and took 0.39 million human lives. SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), but has low fatality rates. Our analyses speculate that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2) within the spike protein. Given the high genomic similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, it is likely that bats serve as a reservoir host for its progenitor. Women and children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the elderly and people with comorbidities are more prone to serious clinical outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. The cohesive approach amongst researchers across the globe has delivered high-end viral diagnostics.

This paper believes that the existing qualitative assessments of this field can be experimentally verified and visualized.Design/methodology/approachFirst, the key conceptual dilemmas of research perspectives in urban tourism are highlighted. Based on the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection and the VOSviewer (computer program for visualizing bibliometric networks), the data will be analyzed. Clustering is used to evaluate information retrieval (inclusivity or selectivity of the search query), publication patterns (journal articles), author keywords, terminology and to identify the respective cities and author collaborations between countries.FindingsTerminological specificities and their contextuality (authors preferences) are elaborated, as the topic is studied by authors from different disciplinary fields. Compared to other specific tourisms, urban tourism includes geographic terms (variations of city names) and terms with different connotations (travelers, visitors). Recent Spanish (also Portuguese) linguistic/geographic contexts are noticeable and a strong presence of WOS Emerging Sources Citation Index papers. Research perspectives are represented in the network of clusters of connected terms. If the search is based on a narrower sense of strict urban tourism, then tourism-business topics predominate. If tourism and cities are less closely linked, socio-cultural and environmental-spatial perspectives emerge, as does tourism/cities vulnerability (climate change and health issues).Research limitations/implicationsThe construction of a search syntax for the purpose of retrieval is always marked by compromises, given different terminological usages. A narrow search query will miss many relevant documents. On the other hand, if the query is too general, it returns less relevant documents. To this end, this paper tested queries on three different levels of inclusivity or selectivity. More consistent use of terms would benefit authors in the field of urban tourism when searching for references (information retrieval) and, as a consequence, would allow better integration of the field.Practical implicationsThis study provides a practical method for evaluating cities and tourism in combining the expertise of an information scientist and a sociologist. It points out numerous caveats in information retrieval. It offers an overview of publishing just prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, thus providing an opportunity for further comparative studies.Originality/valueThis study is the first to examine urban tourism using such a method and can serve as a complement to the existing systematization of qualitative approaches. The findings are consistent with numerous qualitative assessments of weak the research interconnection between the specifics of cities and tourism in terms of broader socio-spatial processes. However, the study suggests that such research linkage is increasing, which is noticeable in relation to issues of social sustainability (e.g. overtourism, Airbnb and touristification).","output":"Mapping urban tourism issues: analysis of research perspectives through the lens of network visualization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The endemic and pandemic caused by respiratory virus infection are a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Thus, broadly effective antiviral drugs are needed to treat respiratory viral diseases. Small extracellular vesicles derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (U-exo) have recently gained attention as a cell-free therapeutic strategy due to their potential for safety and efficacy. Anti-viral activities of U-exo to countermeasure respiratory virus-associated diseases are currently unknown. Here, we tested the antiviral activities of U-exo following influenza A/B virus (IFV) and human seasonal coronavirus (HCoV) infections in vitro. Cells were subject to IFV or HCoV infection followed by U-exo treatment. U-exo treatment significantly reduced IFV or HCoV replication and combined treatment with recombinant human interferon-alpha protein (IFN-) exerted synergistically enhanced antiviral effects against IFV or HCoV. Interestingly, microRNA (miR)-125b, which is one of the most abundantly expressed small RNAs in U-exo, was found to suppress IFV replication possibly via the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Furthermore, U-exo markedly enhanced RNA virus-triggered IFN signaling and ISGs production. Similarly, human nasal epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) studies broadly effective anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities of U-exo against IFV and HCoV, suggesting the potential role of U-exo as a promising intervention for respiratory virus-associated diseases.","output":"Anti-Viral Activities of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Against Human Respiratory Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investigating the role of religiosity in coping with health anxiety during the outbreak of COVID-19 assumes significance given the continued onslaught of the pandemic and the importance of religion in many societies of the world.

Methods: We report the case of a high transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 linked to an indoor choir rehearsal in France in March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 27 participants, including 25 male singers, a conductor and an accompanist attended a choir practice on March 12, 2020. The practice was indoor and took place in a non-ventilated space of 45 m2. The mean age of the participants was 66.9 (range 35-86) years. 70% of the participants (19 of 27) were diagnosed with COVID-19 from 1 to 12 days after the rehearsal with a median of 5.1 days. 36% of the cases needed a hospitalization (7/19), and 21% (4/19) were admitted to an ICU. The index cases were possibly multiple. Discussion: The choir practice was planned in March 2020 at a period when the number of new cases of COVID-19 began to grow exponentially in France because SARS-CoV-2 was actively circulating. The secondary rate attack (70%) was much higher than it is described within households (10-20%) and among close contacts made outside households (0-5%). Singing might have contributed to enhance SARS-CoV-2 person-to-person transmission through emission of droplets and aerosolization in a closed non ventilated space with a relative high number of individuals. Conclusions: Indoor choir practice should be suspended during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Further studies are necessary to test the spread of the virus by the act of singing. As the benefits of the barrier measures and social distancing are known to be effective in terms of a reduction in the incidence of the COVID-19, experts recommendations concerning the resuming of choir practice are necessary.","output":"High Rate of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission due to Choir Practice in France at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas contain a subpopulation of cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and can grow independently of EGFR.

We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB) photochemical treatment, which has various clinical applications, could decontaminate PPE contaminated with coronavirus. DESIGN: The 2 arms of the study included (1) PPE inoculation with coronaviruses followed by MB with light (MBL) decontamination treatment and (2) PPE treatment with MBL for 5 cycles of decontamination to determine maintenance of PPE performance. METHODS: MBL treatment was used to inactivate coronaviruses on 3 N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) and 2 medical mask models. We inoculated FFR and medical mask materials with 3 coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and we treated them with 10 M MB and exposed them to 50,000 lux of white light or 12,500 lux of red light for 30 minutes. In parallel, integrity was assessed after 5 cycles of decontamination using multiple US and international test methods, and the process was compared with the FDA-authorized vaporized hydrogen peroxide plus ozone (VHP+O3) decontamination method. RESULTS: Overall, MBL robustly and consistently inactivated all 3 coronaviruses with 99.8% to >99.9% virus inactivation across all FFRs and medical masks tested. FFR and medical mask integrity was maintained after 5 cycles of MBL treatment, whereas 1 FFR model failed after 5 cycles of VHP+O3. CONCLUSIONS: MBL treatment decontaminated respirators and masks by inactivating 3 tested coronaviruses without compromising integrity through 5 cycles of decontamination.

The most promising strategy to fight against this deadly virus is to develop an effective vaccine. Internalization of SARS-CoV-2 into the human host cell mainly occurs through the binding of the coronavirus spike protein (a trimeric surface glycoprotein) to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The spike-ACE2 proteinCprotein interaction is mediated through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Mutations in the spike RBD can significantly alter interactions with the ACE2 host receptor. Due to its important role in virus transmission, the spike RBD is considered to be one of the key molecular targets for vaccine development. In this study, a spike RBD-based subunit vaccine was designed by utilizing a ferritin protein nanocage as a scaffold. Several fusion protein constructs were designed in silico by connecting the spike RBD via a synthetic linker (different sizes) to different ferritin subunits (H-ferritin and L-ferritin). The stability and the dynamics of the engineered nanocage constructs were tested by extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Based on our MDS analysis, a five amino acid-based short linker (S-Linker) was the most effective for displaying the spike RBD over the surface of ferritin. The behavior of the spike RBD binding regions from the designed chimeric nanocages with the ACE2 receptor was highlighted.

Food industry interference with policies aimed at reducing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is widely documented at the national level but remains under-researched at the global level. Thus, this study explores how ultra-processed food industry actors have attempted to influence NCD policy at WHO. METHODS: A combination of inductive and deductive thematic coding of internal industry documents, academic literature and interviews with key informants from international organisations and global civil society was used to identify action-based strategies ultra-processed food industry actors employ to influence global-level policy. RESULTS: Ultra-processed food industry actors have attempted to influence WHO and its policies through three main action-based strategies: coalition management, involvement in policy formulation, and information management. Coalition management includes the creation and use of overt alliances between corporationsbusiness associationsand more covert science-focused and policy-focused intermediaries, the hiring of former WHO staff and attempted co-option of civil society organisations. Industry involvement in policy formulation is operationalised largely through the lobbying of Member States to support industry positions, and business associations gaining access to WHO through formal consultations and hearings. Information management involves funding and disseminating research favourable to commercial interests, and challenging unfavourable evidence. CONCLUSION: We provide novel insights into how ultra-processed food industry actors shape global-level NCD policy and identify a clear need to guard against commercial interference to advance NCD policy. In their approach, the political behaviour of multinational food corporations bears similarities to that of the tobacco industry. Increased awareness of, and safeguarding against, commercial interference at the national as well as the global level have the potential to strengthen the crucial work of WHO.","output":"Big food and the World Health Organization: a qualitative study of industry attempts to influence global-level non-communicable disease policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this work was to determine the ruminal degradability of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) of maize grain (MG), oat grain (OG), wheat meal (WM) and rice meal (RM).

To facilitate automated screening, free-text eligibility criteria must be structured and coded into a computable format using controlled vocabularies.

The re-entrainment of micrometer particles to airflow when detached from a surface by aerodynamic forces is modeled using the similitude of the problem with the desorption process from heterogeneous surfaces. Depending on the relative role of the intervening forces, three main mechanisms for movement initiation can be present: rolling, sliding and lifting-off. Three different transition probabilities are defined for each mechanism and the corresponding transition rates calculated for the kinetic process to be simulated. The decisive factor for the development of the model is to set an appropriate dynamical hierarchy to simulate correctly the evolution of the transition rates as the airflow velocity increases, reflecting the stochastic nature of the process, not always fully captured by other Monte Carlo approaches. The model is applied to spherical and elongated particles on a flat surface, reproducing qualitatively well the experimental trends found by other authors for the case of particles with different shapes. It is also demonstrated that, for elongated particles, the main mechanism assisting the detachment is not rolling but sliding, underscoring the need for an adequate choice of the particles shape and detachment mechanism when looking for the critical conditions for particle removal from surfaces.","output":"Kinetic Monte Carlo method applied to micrometric particle detachment mechanisms by aerodynamic forces."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and aging is the most common risk factor for developing the disease. The etiology of AD is not known but AD may be considered as a clinical syndrome with multiple causal pathways contributing to it. The amyloid cascade hypothesis, claiming that excess production or reduced clearance of amyloid-beta (A) and its aggregation into amyloid plaques, was accepted for a long time as the main cause of AD. However, many studies showed that A is a frequent consequence of many challenges/pathologic processes occurring in the brain for decades. A key factor, sustained by experimental data, is that low-grade infection leading to production and deposition of A, which has antimicrobial activity, precedes the development of clinically apparent AD. This infection is chronic, low grade, largely clinically silent for decades because of a nearly efficient antimicrobial immune response in the brain. A chronic inflammatory state is induced that results in neurodegeneration. Interventions that appear to prevent, retard or mitigate the development of AD also appear to modify the disease. In this review, we conceptualize further that the changes in the brain antimicrobial immune response during aging and especially in AD sufferers serve as a foundation that could lead to improved treatment strategies for preventing or decreasing the progression of AD in a disease-modifying treatment.","output":"Targeting Impaired Antimicrobial Immunity in the Brain for the Treatment of Alzheimers Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter considers the many contending definitions of co-production and highlights that they have a common core, containing elements of both citizen action and citizen voice and covering some or all of the Four Cosco-commissioning, co-design, co-delivery and co-assessment.

While much of the focus has been on the cardiac and pulmonary complications, there are several important dermatologic components that clinicians must be aware of. OBJECTIVE: This brief report summarizes the dermatologic manifestations and complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on Emergency Medicine clinicians. DISCUSSION: Dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly recognized within the literature. The primary etiologies include vasculitis versus direct viral involvement. There are several types of skin findings described in association with COVID-19. These include maculopapular rashes, urticaria, vesicles, petechiae, purpura, chilblains, livedo racemosa, and distal limb ischemia. While most of these dermatologic findings are self-resolving, they can help increase one's suspicion for COVID-19.

Knowledge of the components is important to help identify potential COVID-19 patients and properly treat complications.","output":"Dermatologic manifestations and complications of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory rate (RR) is routinely used to monitor patients with infectious, cardiac and respiratory diseases and is a component of early warning scores used to predict patient deterioration. However, it is often measured visually with considerable bias and inaccuracy.Objectives. Firstly, to compare distribution and accuracy of electronically measured RR (EMRR) and visually measured RR (VMRR). Secondly, to determine whether, and how far in advance, continuous electronic RR monitoring can predict oncoming hypoxic and pyrexic episodes in infectious respiratory disease.Approach.A retrospective cohort study analysing the difference between EMRR and VMRR was conducted using patient data from a large tertiary hospital. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether continuous, EMRR measurements could predict oncoming hypoxic (SpO2 < 92%) and pyrexic (temperature >38 C) episodes.Main results.Data were gathered from 34 COVID-19 patients, from which a total of 3445 observations of VMRR (independent of Hawthorne effect), peripheral oxygen saturation and temperature and 729 117 observations of EMRR were collected. VMRR had peaks in distribution at 18 and 20 breaths per minute. 70.9% of patients would have had a change of treatment during their admission based on the UK's National Early Warning System if EMRR was used in place of VMRR. An elevated EMRR was predictive of hypoxic (hazard ratio: 1.8 (1.05-3.07)) and pyrexic (hazard ratio: 9.7 (3.8-25)) episodes over the following 12 h.Significance.Continuous EMRR values are systematically different to VMRR values, and results suggest it is a better indicator of true RR as it has lower kurtosis, higher variance, a lack of peaks at expected values (18 and 20) and it measures a physiological component of breathing directly (abdominal movement). Results suggest EMRR is a strong marker of oncoming hypoxia and is highly predictive of oncoming pyrexic events in the following 12 h. In many diseases, this could provide an early window to escalate care prior to deterioration, potentially preventing morbidity and mortality.","output":"The effectiveness of continuous respiratory rate monitoring in predicting hypoxic and pyrexic events: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a systematic review on extrusion additive manufacturing (EAM), with focus on the technological development of screw-assisted systems that can be fed directly with granulated materials. Screw-assisted EAM has gained importance as an enabling technology to expand the range of 3D printing materials, reduce costs associated with feedstock fabrication, and increase the material deposition rate compared to traditional fused filament fabrication (FFF). Many experimental printheads and commercial systems that use some screw-processing mechanism can be found in the literature, but the design diversity and lack of standard terminology make it difficult to determine the most suitable solutions for a given material or application field. Besides, the few previous reviews have offered only a glimpse into the topic, without an in-depth analysis about the design of the extruders and associated capabilities. A systematic procedure was devised to identify the screw-assisted EAM systems that can print directly from granulated materials, resulting in 61 articles describing different pieces of equipment that were categorized as experimental printheads and commercial systems, for small- and large-scale applications. After describing their main characteristics, the most significant extruder modifications were discussed with reference to the materials processed and performance requirements. In the end, a general workflow for the development of 3D printers based on screw extrusion was proposed. This review intends to provide information about the state-of-the-art screw-assisted EAM and help the academy to identify further research opportunities in the field.","output":"Screw-assisted 3D printing with granulated materials: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In spite of decades of efforts to digitalize trade, it remains labor- and paper-intensive.

The federally funded Australian MindSpot Clinic provides online and telephone psychological assessment and treatment services to Australian adults. We aimed to summarise demographic characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients registered with MindSpot over the first 7 years of clinic operation. METHODS: We used an observational design to review all patients who registered for assessment with the MindSpot Clinic between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2019. We descriptively analysed the demographics, service preferences, and baseline symptoms of patients. Among patients enrolled in a digital treatment course, we evaluated scales of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale [GAD-7]), as primary measures of treatment outcome, from the screening assessment to post-treatment and a 3 month follow-up. The Kessler Psychological Distress 10-Item Plus Scale was also used to assess changes in general distress and disability, and course satisfaction was measured post-treatment. OUTCOMES: A total of 121 652 screening assessments were started, of which 96 018 (789%) were completed. The mean age of patients was 357 years (SD 138) and 88 702 (729%) were women. Based on available assessment data, 36 866 (345%) of 106 811 participants had never previously spoken to a health professional about their symptoms, and most people self-reported symptoms of anxiety (88 879 [819%] of 108 494) or depression (78 803 [726%] of 108 494), either alone or in combination, at baseline. 21 745 patients started treatment in a therapist-guided online course, of whom 14 503 (667%) completed treatment (four of five lessons). Key trends in service use included an increase in the proportion of people using MindSpot primarily for assessment and information, from 526% in 2013 to 667% in 2019, while the proportion primarily seeking online treatment decreased, from 426% in 2013 to 267% in 2019. Effect sizes and percentage changes were large for estimated mean scores on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 from assessment to post-treatment (PHQ-9, Cohen's d effect size 140 [95% CI 137C143]; and GAD-7, 145 [142C147]) and the 3 month follow-up (PHQ-9, 136 [134C138]; and GAD-7, 142 [140C144]); proportions of patients with reliable symptom deterioration (score increase of 6 points [PHQ-9] or 5 points [GAD-7]) were low post-treatment (of 13 058 respondents, 184 [14%] had symptom deterioration on the PHQ-9 and 282 [22%] on the GAD-7); and patient satisfaction rates were high (12 452 [966%] of 12 895 respondents would recommend the course and 12 433 [967%] of 12 860 reported the course worthwhile). We also observed small improvements in disability following treatment as measured by days out of role.

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the probable effect of the PBM therapy on the lung inflammation or ARDS and accelerate the regeneration of the damaged tissue. We systematically searched major indexing databases, including PubMed/Medline, ISI web of science (WOS), Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane central, using standard terms without any language, study region, or type restrictions. Of the 438 studies found through initial searches, 13 met the inclusion criteria. After applying the exclusion criteria, the main properties of 13 articles on 384 animals included in this meta-analysis with a wide range of species include rat (n = 10) and rabbit (n = 3). The analysis revealed that PBM therapy reduced TNF (SMD:-3.75, 95% CI: -4.49, -3.02, P < 0.00001, I2 = 10%), IL-1 (SMD:-4.65, 95% CI: -6.15, -3.16, P < 0.00001, I2 = 62%), and IL-6 (SMD:-4.20, 95% CI: -6.42, -1.97, P = 0.0002, I2 = 88%) significantly compared with the model controls. Hence, PBM therapy increased IL-10 significantly compared with the model controls (SMD:-4.65, 95% CI: -6.15, -3.16, P < 0.00001, I2 = 62%). PBM therapy also reduced MPO activity (SMD:-2.13, 95% CI: -3.38, -0.87, P = 0.0009, I2 = 64%) and vascular permeability (SMD:-2.59, 95% CI: -4.40, -0.77, P = 0.0052, I2 = 71%) in the lung using the Evans blue extravasation technique significantly compared with the model controls. This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the PBM therapy does utilize beneficial anti-inflammatory effect, modulation of the immune system, lung permeability, or bronchoalveolar lavage on lung damage in both animal models and clinical studies.

Despite this, and the fact that it is a lower-middle-income nation the number of deaths is almost 1/3rd of the USA and ? of Brazil. There has, however, been no experience published from non-COVID designated hospitals where the aim is to manage non-infected cases with neurosurgical ailments while keeping the number of infected cases to a minimum. Methods We analyzed the number of neurosurgical cases (non-trauma) done in the past 5 months (March- July 2020) in our institute which is the largest neurosurgical center by volume in southern India and compared the same to the concurrent 5 months in 2019 and 5 months preceding the pandemic. We also reviewed the total number of cases infected with COVID-19 managed during this time. Results We operated a total of 630 cases(non-trauma) in these 5 months and had 9 COVID-19 infected cases operated during this time. There was a 57% (p=0.002) reduction in the number of cases operated as compared to the same 5 months in the preceding year. We employed a dual strategy of Rapid Antigen testing and surgery for cases needing emergency intervention and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction test for elective cases. The hospital was divided into three zones (red, orange, and green) depending on infectivity level with minimal interaction. Separate teams were designated for each zone and thus we were able to effectively manage even infected cases despite the absence of pulmonology/medical specialists. Conclusion We present a patient management protocol for non-COVID designated hospitals in high volume centers with the constraints of a lower-middle-income nation and demonstrate its effectiveness.

Unexpectedly, lower dose prime and longer prime-boost intervals have yielded higher efficacies in clinical trials. To elucidate the origins of these effects, we developed a stochastic simulation model of the germinal centre (GC) reaction and predicted the antibody responses elicited by different vaccination protocols. The simulations predicted that a lower dose prime could increase the selection stringency in GCs due to reduced antigen availability, resulting in the selection of GC B cells with higher affinities for the target antigen. The boost could relax this selection stringency and allow the expansion of the higher affinity GC B cells selected, improving the overall response. With a longer dosing interval, the decay in the antigen with time following the prime could further increase the selection stringency, amplifying this effect. The effect remained in our simulations even when new GCs following the boost had to be seeded by memory B cells formed following the prime. These predictions offer a plausible explanation of the observed paradoxical effects of dosage and dosing interval on vaccine efficacy. Tuning the selection stringency in the GCs using prime-boost dosages and dosing intervals as handles may help improve vaccine efficacies.","output":"Low dose prime and delayed boost can improve COVID-19 vaccine efficacies by increasing B cell selection stringency in germinal centres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Total laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy represents one of the most performed gynecological procedures nowadays. Minimally invasive procedures seem to increase the risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence (VCD). Barbed suture is a new class of suture introduced to aid surgeons during laparoscopic suturing, with the aim to reduce operative time, blood loss, and vaginal dehiscence. METHODS We identified all articles that report a series of laparoscopic or robotic-assisted hysterectomy using barbed suture compared to conventional suture for vaginal cuff closure. The main outcome measures were vaginal cuff suturing time, vaginal bleeding, and vaginal dehiscence with or without small bowel evisceration. Suturing time was meta-analyzed as the standardized mean difference, which is the difference in means of two arms divided by pooled standard deviation with 95 % confidence intervals. For vaginal bleeding and dehiscence risk difference were calculated for each study and then meta-analyzed. Fixed models were considered if heterogeneity was low (I (2) < 50 %), otherwise random models were preferred. RESULTS We show that minor bleeding (RD = 0, 95 % CI 0.03-0.03; p value = 0.907) and VCD (RD = -0.01, 95 % CI 0.02-0.00; p value = 0.119) are comparable in minimally invasive hysterectomy with or without the use of barbed suture. The major bleeding (RD = -0.03; 95 % CI 0.05-0.00; p value = 0.047) appears borderline significant, but the difference between the two types of sutures is not high and the upper limit of 95 % IC is equal to 0 so they were considered comparable. Instead, meta-analysis on vaginal cuff suturing time demonstrates that suturing time is reduced with the use of barbed suture (SMD = -0.96, 95 % CI 1.26-0.70; p value <0.001).

The WHO declared it as a pandemic in March 2020. The pandemic severely affected public health and the global economy. Many studies conducted on the coronavirus have helped us to elucidate its pathogenicity and pathophysiology. However, it is important to study the behavior of the pathogen in the environment to develop effective control measures. While studying the persistence and transmission of viruses in drinking water and wastewater systems, a low concentration of coronavirus and its nucleic acids have been detected in municipal wastewaters. This could be due to their high susceptibilities to degradation in aqueous environments. Epidemiological study on coronaviruses in wastewater will serve two purposes, i.e., in early detection of outbreak and in identifying asymptomatic carriers. In such cases, the epidemiological study will help in early detection of the presence of the virus in the community. Secondly, it will help in knowing if there are asymptomatic carriers, as such people do not show any signs of symptoms but shed the viruses in feces.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study design mixed with a qualitative approach was conducted from May 1 to June 30, 2020. A total of four prison institutions and 17 detention centers were included in the study. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select the institutions. The data were entered into the EpiData and exported to SPSS Windows version 22 for data management and analysis. Descriptive statistics was employed for the quantitative section and content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. RESULTS: Five out of 17 detention centers and three out of four prison facilities did not fulfill the standards related to human rights. Almost all detention centers and prison facilities did not implement recommended activities of risk assessment and management of COVID-19. In addition, none of the prison facilities and detention centers had quick access to laboratory tests for suspected cases. Neither the prison facilities nor the detention centers had a contingency plan for the COVID-19 pandemic.

One component of these activities has been the development and conduct of exercise programs to assess capabilities, train staff and build relationships. This paper summarizes lessons learned from tabletop exercises about public health emergency preparedness and about the process of developing, conducting, and evaluating them. METHODS: We developed, conducted, and evaluated 31 tabletop exercises in partnership with state and local health departments throughout the US from 2003 to 2006. Participant self evaluations, after action reports, and tabletop exercise evaluation forms were used to identify aspects of the exercises themselves, as well as public health emergency responses that participants found more or less challenging, and to highlight lessons learned about tabletop exercise design. RESULTS: Designing the exercises involved substantial collaboration with representatives from participating health departments to assure that the scenarios were credible, focused attention on local preparedness needs and priorities, and were logistically feasible to implement. During execution of the exercises, nearly all health departments struggled with a common set of challenges relating to disease surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, communications, command and control, and health care surge capacity. In contrast, performance strengths were more varied across participating sites, reflecting specific attributes of individual health departments or communities, experience with actual public health emergencies, or the emphasis of prior preparedness efforts. CONCLUSION: The design, conduct, and evaluation of the tabletop exercises described in this report benefited from collaborative planning that involved stakeholders from participating health departments and exercise developers and facilitators from outside the participating agencies. While these exercises identified both strengths and vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, additional work is needed to develop reliable metrics to gauge exercise performance, inform follow-up action steps, and to develop re-evaluation exercise designs that assess the impact of post-exercise interventions.","output":"Designing and conducting tabletop exercises to assess public health preparedness for manmade and naturally occurring biological threats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic (COVID-19) has caused 2.25 million deaths worldwide by February 3, 2021 (JHU, 2021) and still causing severe health and economic disruptions with increasing rates.

Applying preventive measures is very important in tackling the spread of the disease since there is no curative antiviral drug. The pandemic of the virus has impacted different institutions including the university. To overcome the impact, students are resuming face to face education by applying preventive measures of Covid-19. This study is undertaken to assess KAP in Mizan Tepi University, 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 402 randomly selected participants. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from December 1C10/2020. Data were entered into Epidata 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used for analyses. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to identify significant variables in multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In this study, 47%, 54%, and 42.8% of the students had good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice towards Covid-19, respectively. Being from health sciences (AOR= 2.983, 95% CI (1.869, 4.763)) was significantly associated with good knowledge.

Vaccine efficacy (VE) of a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 caused by one of finitely many genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 may vary by strain. The problem of assessing differential VE by viral genetics can be formulated under a competing risks model where the endpoint is virologically confirmed COVID-19 and the cause-of-failure is the infecting SARS-CoV-2 genotype. Strain-specific VE is defined as one minus the cause-specific hazard ratio (vaccine/placebo). For the COVID-19 VE trials, the time to COVID-19 is right-censored, and a substantial percentage of failure cases are missing the infecting virus genotype. We develop estimation and hypothesis testing procedures for strain-specific VE when the failure time is subject to right censoring and the cause-of-failure is subject to missingness, focusing on $J \\\\ge 2$ discrete categorical unordered or ordered virus genotypes. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model is used to relate the cause-specific outcomes to explanatory variables. The inverse probability weighted complete-case (IPW) estimator and the augmented inverse probability weighted complete-case (AIPW) estimator are investigated. Hypothesis tests are developed to assess whether the vaccine provides at least a specified level of efficacy against some viral genotypes and whether VE varies across genotypes, adjusting for covariates.

METHODS: Between March 29 and May, 2020, the words COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, COVID-19 and pregnancy, SARS-CoV2 and pregnancy, and SARS and pregnancy were searched in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases; the guidelines from well-known societies and institutions (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG], American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology [ISUOG], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO]) were also included. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in a pandemic with > 3.3 million cases and 230 thousand deaths until May 2nd. It is caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus and may lead to severe pulmonary infection and multi-organ failure. Past experiences show that unique characteristics in pregnancy make pregnant women more susceptible to complications from viral infections. Yet, this has not been reported with this new virus. There are risk factors that seem to increase morbidity in pregnancy, such as obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 35), asthma and cardiovascular disease. Current reports describe an increased rate of preterm birth and C-section. Vertical transmission is still a possibility, due to a few reported cases of neonatal positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasal swab, amniotic fluid, and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) in neonatal blood. Treatments must be weighed in with caution due to the lack of quality trials that prove their effectiveness and safety during pregnancy.

The Air Transportation System plays a critical role in such transmissions because it is responsible for fast and long-range human travel, while its building components-the airports-are crowded, confined areas with usually poor hygiene. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) consider hand hygiene as the most efficient and cost-effective way to limit disease propagation. Results from clinical studies reveal the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of infectious diseases. However, its potential as a mitigation strategy against the global risk for a pandemic has not been fully explored. Here, we use epidemiological modeling and data-driven simulations to elucidate the role of individual engagement with hand hygiene inside airports in conjunction with human travel on the global spread of epidemics. We find that, by increasing travelers engagement with hand hygiene at all airports, a potential pandemic can be inhibited by 24% to 69%. In addition, we identify 10 airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing mitigation strategy. Increasing hand-washing rate at only those 10 influential locations, the risk of a pandemic could potentially drop by up to 37%. Our results provide evidence for the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infections that could shape the way public-health policy is implemented with respect to the overall objective of mitigating potential population health crises.","output":"Hand-Hygiene Mitigation Strategies Against Global Disease Spreading through the Air Transportation Network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Effectiveness of hospital management of disasters requires a well-defined and rehearsed system. The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS), as a standardized method for command and control, was established in Iranian hospitals, but it has performed fairly during disaster exercises. This paper describes the process for, and modifications to HICS undertaken to optimize disaster management in hospitals in Iran. METHODS In 2013, a group of 11 subject matter experts participated in an expert consensus modified Delphi to develop modifications to the 2006 version of HICS. RESULTS The following changes were recommended by the expert panel and subsequently implemented: 1) A Quality Control Officer was added to the Command group; 2) Security was defined as a new section; 3) Infrastructure and Business Continuity Branches were moved from the Operations Section to the Logistics and the Administration Sections, respectively; and 4) the Planning Section was merged within the Finance/Administration Section. CONCLUSION An expert consensus group developed a modified HICS that is more feasible to implement given the managerial organization of hospitals in Iran.

Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquineazithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. METHODS: Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquineazithromycin from March 1 to the 23 at 3 hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in Torsade de pointes. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation, and arrhythmogenic death. RESULTS: Two hundred one patients were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine, and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was not observed in the entire population. Baseline corrected QT interval intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) versus those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; 440.624.9 versus 439.924.7 ms, P=0.834). The maximum corrected QT interval during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group versus the monotherapy group (470.445.0 ms versus 453.337.0 ms, P=0.004). Seven patients (3.5%) required discontinuation of these medications due to corrected QT interval prolongation. No arrhythmogenic deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest reported cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquineazithromycin, no instances of Torsade de pointes, or arrhythmogenic death were reported.

[Formula: see text] delivered by the ventilator in APRV is not directly measurable in dynamic conditions, and there is no gold standard method for its estimation. METHODS: We used a computational simulator matched to data from 90 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to evaluate the accuracy of three at-the-bedside methods for estimating ventilator [Formula: see text] during APRV. RESULTS: Levels of [Formula: see text] delivered by the ventilator in APRV were generally within safe limits, but in some cases exceeded levels specified by protective ventilation strategies. A formula based on estimating the intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure present at the end of the APRV release provided the most accurate estimates of [Formula: see text] .

METHODS Using survey research methodology, data from a survey of FD leaders at Canadian medical schools were analyzed using Bolman and Deal's four frames: Symbolic, Political, Structural, and Human Resource (HR). RESULTS In the Symbolic frame, FD leaders reported lack of identity as a FD unit, which was seen as a constraining factor. Within the Political frame, developing visibility was seen as an enhancing factor, though it did not always ensure being valued. In the Structural frame, expanding scope of practice was seen as an enhancing factor, though it could also be a constraining factor if not accompanied by increased resources. In the HR frame, a sense of instability due to changing leadership and uncertainty about human resources was seen as a constraining factor.

Whether hospitalization rates and in-hospital mortality were affected by the pandemic in patients with acute symptomatic heart failure (HF) was investigated in this study. METHODS Administrative data provided by 67 German Helios hospitals were examined for patients with main discharge diagnosis of HF using ICD-codes. Urgent hospital admissions per day were compared for a study period (March 13th-May 21th, 2020) with control intervals in 2020 (January 1st-March 12th) and 2019 (March 13th-May 21th), resulting in a total of 13 484 patients excluding all patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 infection. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using Poisson regression. Generalized linear mixed models were used for univariable and multivariable analysis to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The number of admissions per day was lower in the study period compared to the same year (IRR 0.69, 95%CI 0.67-0.73, p < 0.01) and the previous year control group (IRR 0.73, 95%CI 0.70-0.76, p < 0.01). Age was similar throughout the intervals, but case-severity increased in terms of distribution within NYHA classes and comorbidities. Within the study period, 30-day rates for urgent hospital readmissions were higher compared to the same year but not the previous year control group. In-hospital mortality was 7.3% in the study period, 6.1% in the same year (p = 0.03) and 6.0% in the previous year control group (p = 0.02).

We estimate the infection fatality rate, the case fatality rate, and the basic reproduction number, modeled as a time-varying function, by calibrating on the cumulative daily number of observed deaths and notified infected, after fixing to plausible values the other model parameters to assure identifiability. The confidence intervals are estimated by a parametric bootstrap procedure and a Global Sensitivity Analysis is performed to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in the values of the fixed parameters. According to our results, the basic reproduction number drops from an initial value of 6.055 to 0 at the end of the national lockdown, then it grows again, but remaining under 1. At the beginning of the epidemic, the case and the infection fatality rates are estimated to be 13.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Among the parameters considered as fixed, the average time from infection to recovery for the not notified infected appears to be the most impacting one on the model estimates. The probability for an infected to be notified has a relevant impact on the infection fatality rate and on the shape of the epidemic curve.

Medical preparedness and community education are the most valuable preventive tools for combatting this pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the role of media public health awareness campaigns on the knowledge of the general population about COVID-19 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Methods: : A quantitative study using a pre-post design among 384 respondents was conducted. To recruit study participants, a systematic random sampling technique was used. A structured questionnaire was administered to the participants twice: The first response (t 1 ) from participants was filled in during the first week in February 2020 before any confirmed cases were reported in the country, and the second response (t 2 ) was completed one month after the first case detection in Pakistan (March 2020). Media health awareness campaigns were launched just after the detection of the first case in Pakistan. Data was analysed by computing descriptive statistics and paired t-tests to measure the level of association between variables. Results: : Exposure to the media and knowledge relating to COVID-19, particularly its symptoms and frequent handwashing as a preventive measure, increased over time. Whereas only a quarter of respondents judged the isolation of suspected cases in quarantine to be important to prevent the spread of infection in society at t 1 , more than half did so at t 2 . The same increase was visible in relation to the statement that a lockdown helps to follow social distancing. Socio-demographic characteristics were not significantly associated with knowledge (gains). However, more frequent use of electronic media is associated with greater knowledge gains from t 1 to t 2 . Conclusions: : The findings of this study provide evidence that awareness and knowledge related to COVID-19 symptoms and preventive measures increased significantly over time.

To clarify the origin of this pollution, we studied air concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), NO(2), O(3), PM(10), SO(2), and CO in Beijing, Hengshui and Baoding during the lockdown period from January 24 to 29, 2020. Variations of PM(2.5) composition in inorganic ions, elemental carbon and organic matter were also investigated. The HYSPLIT model was used to calculate backward trajectories and concentration weighted trajectories. Results of the cluster trajectory analysis and model simulations show that the severe haze was caused mainly by the emissions of northeastern non-stopping industries located in Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Hebei, and Tianjin. In Beijing, Hengshui and Baoding, the mixing layer heights were about 30% lower and the maximum relative humidity was 83% higher than the annual averages, and the average wind speeds were lower than 1.5 m s(?1).

Randomized controlled trials and observational studies reporting RTW times after CTR were included. Study risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias assessment tools. Time to RTW was summarized using median and range. Results A total of 56 relevant studies were identified: 18 randomized controlled trials and 38 observational studies. Only 4 studies were rated as having a low risk of bias. Reported RTW times ranged from 4-168 days. Few studies reported occupational information. Among 6 studies, median time to return to non-manual work was 21 days (range 7-41), compared with 39 days for manual work (range 18-101). Median time to return to modified or full duties was 23 days (ranges 12-50 and 17-64, respectively), as reported by 3 studies. There was no common method of defining, collecting or reporting RTW data. Conclusions This review highlights wide variation in reported RTW times after CTR. Whilst occupational factors may play a role, these were poorly reported, and there is currently limited evidence to inform individual patients of their expected duration of work absence after CTR.

More than 50 different transcripts can be generated from a single HIV-1 unspliced pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and a balanced proportion of unspliced and spliced transcripts is critical for the production of infectious virions. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of viral RNA is therefore of potential therapeutic interest. However, monitoring the regulation of alternative splicing events at a transcriptome-wide level during cell infection is challenging. Here we used the long-read cDNA sequencing developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to explore in a quantitative manner the complexity of the HIV-1 transcriptome regulation in infected primary CD4+ T cells. RESULTS ONT reads mapping to the viral genome proved sufficiently long to span all possible splice junctions, even distant ones, and to be assigned to a total of 150 exon combinations. Fifty-three viral RNA isoforms, including 14 new ones were further considered for quantification. Relative levels of viral RNAs determined by ONT sequencing showed a high degree of reproducibility, compared favourably to those produced in previous reports and highly correlated with quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. To get further insights into alternative splicing regulation, we then compiled quantifications of splice site (SS) usage and transcript levels to build \\"splice trees\\", a quantitative representation of the cascade of events leading to the different viral isoforms. This approach allowed visualizing the complete rewiring of SS usages upon perturbation of SS D2 and its impact on viral isoform levels. Furthermore, we produced the first dynamic picture of the cascade of events occurring between 12 and 24 h of viral infection. In particular, our data highlighted the importance of non-coding exons in viral RNA transcriptome regulation. CONCLUSION ONT sequencing is a convenient and reliable strategy that enabled us to grasp the dynamic of the early splicing events modulating the viral RNA landscape in HIV-1 infected cells.","output":"Dynamic nanopore long-read sequencing analysis of HIV-1 splicing events during the early steps of infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitric oxide (NO) has attracted significant attention as a stellar molecule.

The population pharmacokinetics of lopinavir was described using non-linear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM version 7.4). After determination of the base model that better described the data set, the influence of covariates (age, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), gender, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), C reactive protein (CRP), and trough ritonavir concentrations) was tested on the model. RESULTS: From 13 hospitalized patients (4 females, 9 males, age = 64  16 years), 70 lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations were available for analysis. The data were best described by a one-compartment model with a first-order input (KA).

Information is accumulating on rational approaches to population-based short-term chemotherapeutic control measures. These are: widely available modern diagnostic tools and taenicides, treatment of any case of taeniasis, confirmed or probable, focus-oriented chemotherapy, irrespective of Taenia species implicated, improved sanitation, cooperation of veterinary and medical services, linkage with programs against epilepsy and cooperation of better educated communities.

Most of the compounds showed weak to moderate activity against ChEs. Among the most active BuChE and 15-LOX inhibitors, 8l and 8n exhibited an excellent neuroprotective effect, higher than the standard drug (quercetin) on the PC12 cell model injured by H2O2 and significantly reduced aggregation of amyloid A1-42, with potencies of 1.44 and 1.79 times higher than donepezil, respectively. Compound 8l also showed more activity than butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as the reference antioxidant agent in reducing the levels of H2O2 activated by amyloid  in BV2 microglial cells. Kinetic and ligand-enzyme docking studies were also performed for better understanding of the mode of interaction between the best BuChE inhibitor and the enzyme.

The third variable region (V3) is a crucial target on gp120, primarily due to its involvement in co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) binding and presence of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: Thirty-three HIV-1 seropositive drug naive patients (18 males and 15 females) within the age range of 20C57 years (median = 33 years) were recruited in this study for mAb production. The mAbs were selected from EBV transformed cultures with conformationally constrained Cholera-toxin-B containing V3C (V3C-CTB) fusion protein. We tested the mAbs for their binding with HIV-1 derived proteins and peptides by ELISA and for neutralization against HIV-1 viruses by TZM-bl assays. RESULTS: We isolated three anti-V3 mAbs, 277, 903 and 904 from the cells of different individuals. The ELISA binding revealed a subtype-C and subtype-A specific binding of antibody 277 and 903 while mAb 904 exhibited cross reactivity also with subtype-B V3. Epitope mapping of mAbs with overlapping V3 peptides showed exclusive binding to V3 crown. The antibodies displayed high and low neutralizing activity against 2/5 tier 1 and 1/6 tier 2 viruses respectively. Overall, we observed a resistance of the tier 2 viruses to neutralization by the anti-V3 mAbs, despite the exposure of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies on two representative native viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL), suggesting that the affinity of mAb might equally be crucial for neutralization, as the epitope recognition. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the anti-V3 antibodies derived from subtype-C infected Indian patients display neutralization potential against tier 1 viruses while such activity may be limited against more resistant tier 2 viruses. Defining the fine epitope specificities of these mAbs and further experimental manipulations will be helpful in identification of epitopes, unique to clade C or shared with non-clade C viruses, in context of V3 region.","output":"Production and characterization of human anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies from the cells of HIV-1 infected Indian donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative neurocognitive disorder (NCD) are frequently seen in the elderly. Development of biomarkers for preoperative risk prediction is of major relevance. As inflammation present before surgery might predispose to POD and postoperative NCD development, we aim to determine associations between preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and the incidence of POD and postoperative NCD. METHODS In this observational study, we analyzed 314 patients enrolled in the SuDoCo trial, who had a preoperative CRP measurement the day before surgery. Primary outcomes were POD assessed according DSM-4 from day 1 until day 7 after surgery and postoperative NCD assessed 3 months after surgery. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, randomization, body mass index, MMSE, ASA status, infection/autoimmune disease/malignoma and types of surgery to determine associations between CRP with POD and postoperative NCD, respectively. RESULTS Preoperative CRP was independently associated with POD [OR 1.158 (95%CI 1.040, 1.291); p=0.008]. Patients with CRP values  5 mg/L had a 4.8-fold increased POD risk [OR 5.771 (95%CI 1.765, 12.899; p=0.002)] compared to patients with lower CRP values. However, no association was seen between preoperative CRP and postoperative NCD [OR 0.552 (95%CI 0.193, 1.581); p=0.269]. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative CRP levels were independently associated with POD but not postoperative NCD after three months. Moreover, higher preoperative CRP levels showed higher risk for POD. This strengthens the role of inflammation in the development of POD. Assessment of CRP before surgery might allow risk stratification of POD. This article is protected by copyright.

Despite bariatric surgery being one of the most effective obesity treatments, utilization remains low. In this context, we explored public perceptions of bariatric surgery, centering voices of Black individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with individuals who have never considered bariatric surgery with purposive sampling to ensure the majority of participants were Black. Transcripts were iteratively analyzed. We employed an Interpretive Description framework to arrive at a collective description of perceptions of bariatric surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-two participants self-identified as 88% female, 72% Black, 3% Hispanic, 3% Pacific Islander, 3% Mixed Race, and 19% White. Participants reported a complex interplay of deeply held, stigmatized beliefs about identity. According to the stigma, persons with obesity lacked willpower and thus were considered devalued. Participants internalized this stigma, describing themselves with words like glutton, lazy, and slack off. Because stigma caused participants to view obesity as resulting from personal failings alone, socially acceptable ways to lose weight were discipline through diet and exercise. Working for weight loss was self-love, self-discipline, and determination. Thus, bariatric surgery was illegitimate, a shortcut to weight loss or easy way out, since it was outside acceptable methods of effort. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study of community members who qualify for bariatric surgery shows obesity stigma was the main reason individuals rejected bariatric surgery. Obesity was stigmatizing, but undergoing bariatric surgery would further stigmatize individuals. Thus, healthcare providers may be instrumental in increasing bariatric surgery uptake by shifting social discourse from stigmatized notions of obesity towards one focusing on health.

Herein, we describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated mandatory home lockdown on patients with LSDs in Israel. RESULTS: We present a prospective multi-center questionnaire study including 48 LSD patients from four medical centers in Israel. The study objective was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on individuals with LSDs in Israel, as reported by their caregivers. Secondary objectives were to assess the morbidity from SARS CoV-2 in LSD patients and the impact of changes in mood and behavior on compliance to treatment and to assess the relationship between changes in mood to changes in cognition and behavior.

OBJECTIVES We developed a mathematical analysis of ventilatory tracings recorded under noninvasive pressure ventilation in order to identify ineffective triggering efforts and their consequences without recording esophageal pressure. METHODS We assessed 2,183 cycles from 44 pressure support tracings in 14 children with cystic fibrosis treated by noninvasive home ventilation. Airway pressure, flow and esophageal pressure time series were visually analyzed and manually counted. Airway pressure versus time and flow versus time were then analyzed using a dedicated algorithm written by us. Esophageal pressure was only used for validation. RESULTS A mathematical treatment of flow time series allowed us to draw phase portraits that had specific periodic trajectories for triggered ventilatory cycles and ineffective triggering efforts. From flow and pressure tracings, our algorithm correctly identified 100% of triggered cycles and 53/56 (94.6%) of ineffective triggering efforts. Ineffective triggering was associated with a significant reduction in minute ventilation, inspiratory flows and a significant increase in inspiratory efforts.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of the TIE index as a predictor of weaning success. A multivariate Cox regression model was developed to test the association of TIE index values of 1.0 cm H2O/s with a failure of weaning. RESULTS Seventy subjects were selected. Their median (IQR) age was 72 (62-78) y, the median (IQR) duration of mechanical ventilation was 17.5 (14-28) d, and the median (IQR) APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score was 28 (24-31).

We evaluated the technical and clinical success of MT in relation to the location of the occlusion (internal carotid artery, M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery). METHODS We prospectively reviewed 130 patients of whom 105 met the inclusion criteria. Baseline clinical, procedural and imaging variables, technical outcome (TICI, thrombolysis in cerebral infarction), 24 h imaging outcome and three-month clinical outcome (mRS, modified Rankin Scale) were recorded. Differences between the groups were studied with statistical tests according to the type of the variable. RESULTS There were 37, 46 and 22 patients in the internal carotid artery (ICA), M1 and M2 groups, respectively. TICI 2b or 3 was achieved in 92 cases (88 %) with a non-significant trend towards a better recanalization outcome in the ICA and M1 groups. Overall, 57 of the 105 patients (55 %) experienced favorable clinical outcome (mRS  2) with no significant differences between the groups. Excellent outcome (mRS  1) was seen in 40 patients (39 %) and there proportionally more patients with excellent outcome in the ICA and M1 groups (ICA: 44 %, M1: 41 %, M2: 23 % of patients, p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS There were no statistically significant differences in the technical or clinical outcomes between the different sites of occlusion (ICA, M1 or M2). There was a non-significant trend towards achieving excellent clinical outcome (3-month mRS  1) more often and better recanalization results in the two more proximal locations.","output":"Stent Retriever Thrombectomy in Different Thrombus Locations of Anterior Cerebral Circulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by one of two recently discovered coronaviruses. The virus is emergent from South East (SE) Asian mammals: either the civet cat, a related species or a rat species. The virus has a long incubation period and low reproduction number (R0 value) and hence the first outbreak in 2004 was controlled by hygiene and quarantine. However, the healthcare system was compromised and the economic cost was extremely high. Fortunately, the virus is easily cultivated in Vero E6 cells and therefore the search for new antivirals and vaccines was initiated within weeks of the discovery of the virus using classic techniques of cell culture and electron microscopy. Molecular diagnostics facilitated rapid and accurate diagnosis, a key factor in containing the outbreak. The broad-spectrum molecule ribavirin was used in SE Asia in infected patients alongside corticosteroids. In retrospect, many patients survived due to careful nursing. The only currently accepted intervention is interferon. Coronavirus replicon systems should facilitate rapid screening of new inhibitors and the complex mechanism of viral replication will ensure that drugs are developed against at least five molecular targets, in particular the viral protease.","output":"New antiviral drugs, vaccines and classic public health interventions against SARS coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Mortality associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) is high in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hydroxyurea, a medicine to effectively manage SCD, is not widely available in resource-constrained settings. We identified and synthesised the reported implementation outcomes for the therapeutic use of hydroxyurea for SCD in these settings. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science Plus, Global Health, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched February through May 2019 without any restrictions on publication date. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included empirical studies of hydroxyurea for management of SCD that were carried out in LMICs and reported on implementation outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction using Proctor et al.'s implementation and health service outcomes, and assessed the risk of bias using ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions). RESULTS Two cross-sectional surveys (n=2) and one cohort study (n=1) reported implementation of hydroxyurea for SCD management, namely regarding outcomes of adoption (n=3), cost (n=3) and acceptability (n=1). These studies were conducted exclusively among paediatric and adults populations in clinical settings in Nigeria (n=2) or Jamaica (n=1). Adoption is low, as observed through reported provider practices and patient adherence, in part shaped by misinformation and fear of side effects among patients, provider beliefs regarding affordability and organisational challenges with procuring the medicine. There was no difference in the cost of hydroxyurea therapy compared with blood transfusion in the paediatric population in urban Jamaica. Risk of bias was low or moderate across the included studies. CONCLUSIONS This review rigorously and systematically assessed the evidence on implementation of hydroxyurea in resource-constrained settings such as LMICs. Findings suggest that knowledge regarding implementation is low. To address the know-do gap and guide clinical practice, implementation research is needed. Integrating effective interventions into existing health systems to improve hydroxyurea uptake is essential to reducing SCD-associated mortality.

We recruited 353 parents with children aged two to 16 years via an online survey during the Italian second wave of COVID-19. Parents peritraumatic distress due to COVID-19, parenting stress, past trauma and resilience, and childrens psychological difficulties were assessed through self-report and report-form questionnaires. Parents past traumas significantly predicted peritraumatic distress due to COVID-19 and childrens psychological difficulties. The relationship between past traumas and childrens psychological difficulties was serial mediated by parents peritraumatic distress and parenting stress. Direct and total effects of parents resilience on parents peritraumatic distress were not significant, but there were significant indirect effects via parenting stress and via parents peritraumatic distress and parenting stress, indicating inconsistent mediation.

Currently, there are no effective vaccines and antiviral drugs against the majority of viral diseases, suggesting the need to develop novel and effective antiviral agents. Since the intracellular delivery of antiviral agents, particularly the impermeable molecules, such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids, are essential to exert their therapeutic effects, using a delivery system is highly required. Among various delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), a group of short peptides with the unique ability of crossing cell membrane, offer great potential for the intracellular delivery of various biologically active cargoes. The results of numerous in vitro and in vivo studies with CPP conjugates demonstrate their promise as therapeutic agents in various medical fields including antiviral therapy. The CPP-mediated delivery of various antiviral agents including peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, and nanocarriers have been associated with therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo.

Following the instructions is very important to achieve that. This study aimed to evaluate awareness and practices related to the COVID-19 quarantine instructions among the home quarantine COVID-19 patients, and persons who contacted them at home quarantine. METHODS: During May and June 2020, the home quarantine COVID-19 patients (mild and moderate cases who need not be admitted to hospital) and the contacting persons were asked to fill an online structured questionnaire. Data were collected to assess the awareness regarding the quarantine instructions. The questionnaire was divided into three sections, consisting of 35 questions for a total possible score of 0-35. The first section was to assess the participants' awareness [19 items]; the second was to assess the awareness of the participants' families [11 items]; the third was to assessing awareness and attitude regarding the efforts provided to face COVID-19 [5 items]. RESULTS: A total of 300 subjects participated, 96% of them were committed not to leave the house till the end of the self-isolation period; 85% cared for house cleanliness and good ventilation of rooms; 63% maintained a balanced diet without fats, oil, and sugar; 70% used vitamins D and A to strengthen the immune system. The important role of the media in informing subjects of COVID-19 was known by 90%, while 63% of the participants are not satisfied with the hospital services in the area where they live. The average score of this questionnaire was 28.18/35 (80.5%) about the awareness of COVID-19 quarantine instructions. CONCLUSION: Home quarantined COVID-19 patients and people in close contact with them in the study had a good awareness of the home quarantine instructions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed English and US-based tweets containing coronavirus between January 23-March 24, 2020 using the Twitter API. Tweets containing keywords were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions. RESULTS: A total of 259,529 unique tweets were included in the analyses. Social distancing tweets became more prevalent from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. Early facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle: the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the implementation and negative emotions facets largely dominated in combination with topics of social disruption and adaptation, albeit to lesser degree. Social disruptiveness tweets were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. DISCUSSION: Social distancing can be defined by facets that respond to and represent certain events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising case counts. For example, Miami had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March corresponding with the rise of COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: The evolution of social distancing facets on Twitter reflects actual events and may signal potential disease hotspots. Our facets can also be used to understand public discourse on social distancing which may inform future public health measures.","output":"Defining facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Twitter analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the emergency surgical strategies for patients with acute abdomen during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak Methods: The retrospective and descriptive study was conducted The clinical data of 20 patients with acute abdomen who were admitted to the Union Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology between January 18, 2020 and February 10, 2020 were collected There were 13 males and 7 females, aged from 25 to 82 years, with an average age of 57 years All the patients with emergency surgeries received pulmonary computed tomography (CT) examination before surgery, and completed nucleic acid detection in throat swab if necessary Patients excluded from COVID-19 underwent regular anesthesia, suspected and confirmed cases were selected a proper anesthesia based on their medical condition and surgical procedure Patients excluded from COVID-19 underwent emergency surgeries following the regular procedure, suspected and confirmed cases underwent emergency surgeries following the three-grade protection Observation indicators: (1) surgical situations;(2) postoperative situations Measurement data with normal distribution were represented as average (range) Count data were described as absolute numbers Results: (1) Surgical situations: of the 20 patients with acute abdomen, 16 patients were excluded from COVID-19, and 4 were not excluded All the 20 patients underwent emergency abdominal surgeries successfully, of whom 2 received surgeries under epidural anesthesia (including 1 with open appendectomy, 1 with open repair of duodenal bulbar perforation), 18 received surgeries under general anesthesia (including 9 with laparoscopic repair of duodenal bulbar perforation, 3 with open partial enterectomy, 3 with laparoscopic appendectomy, 1 with laparoscopic left hemicolectomy, 1 with laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, 1 with cholecystostomy) The operation time of patients was 32-194 minutes, with an average time of 85 minutes The volume of intraoperative blood loss was 50-400 mL, with an average volume of 68 mL (2) Postoperative situations: 16 patients excluded from COVID-19 preopratively were treated in the private general ward postoperatively One of the 16 patients had fever at the postoperative 5th day and was highly suspected of COVID-19 after an emergency follow-up of pulmonary CT showing multiple ground-glass changes in the lungs The patient was promptly transferred to the isolation ward for treatment, and results of nucleic acid detection in throat swab showed double positive Medical history described by the patient showed that the patient and family members were residents of Wuhan who were not isolated at home during the epidemic There was no way to confirm whether they had a history of exposure to patients with COVID-19 Medical staffs involved in this case did not show COVID-19 related symptoms during 14 days of medical observation The other 15 patients recovered well postoperatively The 4 patients who were not excluded from COVID-19 preoperatively based on medical history and results of pulmonary CT examination were directly transferred to the isolation ward for treatment postoperatively They were excluded from COVID-19 for two consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection in the throat swab and recovered well Two of the 20 patients with acute abdomen had postoperative complications One had surgical incision infection and recovered after secondary closure following opening incision, sterilizing and dressing, the other one had intestinal leakage and was improved after conservative treatment by abdominal drainage There was no death in the 20 patients with acute abdomen Conclusions: Patients with acute abdomen need to be screened through emergency forward Patients excluded from COVID-19 undergo emergency surgeries following the regular procedure, and patients not excluded from COVID-19 undergo emergency surgeries following the three-grade protection The temperature, blood routine test and other laborat ry examinations are performed to monitor patients after operation, and the pulmonary CT and throat nucleic acid tests should be conducted if necessary Patients excluded from COVID-19 preopratively are treated in the private general ward postoperatively, and they should be promptly transferred to the isolation ward for treatment after being confirmed Patients who are not excluded from COVID-19 preoperatively based on medical history should be directly transferred to the isolation ward for treatment postoperatively Copyright ?

Secondary aims were to determine predictors of COVID-19 status on presentation and later in the admission; the rate of hospital acquired COVID-19; and the predictive value of negative swabs on admission. METHODS: A nationwide multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted of all patients presenting with a hip fracture to 17 Scottish centres in March and April 2020. Demographics, presentation blood tests, COVID-19 status, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, management, length of stay, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: In all, 78/833 (9.4%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The 30-day survival of patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower than for those without (65.4% vs 91%; p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 within seven days of admission (likely community acquired) was independently associated with male sex (odds ratio (OR) 2.34, p = 0.040, confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 5.25) and symptoms of COVID-19 (OR 15.56, CI 6.61 to 36.60, p < 0.001).

Treatment included hydroxycholoroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Corticosteroids were included as adjunctive therapy in mid-April, 2020. We compared composite outcomes of clinical progression and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) or death between group that received treatment only (Group A) versus group that received adjunctive corticosteroids (Group B). Entropy balancing was used to generate stabilized weight for covariates between treatment groups. Unweighted Kaplan-Meir curves, weighted and adjusted Cox regression analysis were used to estimate effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on composite outcomes.

In subgroup with pneumonia, patients in Group B were significantly at lower risk of clinical progression (aHR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.39, p<0.001) and requiring invasive MV compared to Group A (aHR 0.30, 0.10-0.87, p=0.029). Conclusions: Use of adjunctive corticosteroids is associated with lower risk of clinical progression and invasive MV or death, especially in those with pneumonia. Concurrent use of antivirals and corticosteroids should be considered in the management of COVID-19 related pneumonia.","output":"Adjunctive Corticosteroids for COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak poses a public health threat and has affected people worldwide in various unprecedented ways, both personally and professionally. There is no question that the current global COVID-19 crisis, now more than ever, is underscoring the importance of leveraging digital approaches to optimize pediatric health care delivery in the era of this pandemic. In this perspective piece, we highlight some of the available digital approaches that have been and can continue to be used to streamline remote pediatric patient care in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to telemedicine. JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting is currently publishing a COVID-19 special theme issue in which investigators can share their interim and final research data related to digital approaches to remote pediatric health care delivery in different settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly transformed health care systems worldwide, with significant variations and innovations in adaptation. There has been rapid expansion of the leveraging and optimization of digital approaches to health care delivery, particularly integrated telemedicine and virtual health. Digital approaches have played and will play major roles as invaluable and reliable resources to overcome restrictions and challenges imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and to increase access to effective, accessible, and consumer-friendly care for more patients and families. However, a number of challenges remain to be addressed, and further research is needed. Optimizing digital approaches to health care delivery and integrating them into the public health response will be an ongoing process during the current COVID-19 outbreak and during other possible future pandemics. Regulatory changes are essential to support the safe and wide adoption of these approaches. Involving all relevant stakeholders in addressing current and future challenges as well as logistical, technological, and financial barriers will be key for success. Future studies should consider evaluating the following research areas related to telemedicine and other digital approaches: cost-effectiveness and return on investment; impact on quality of care; balance in use and number of visits needed for the management of both acute illness and chronic health conditions; system readiness for further adoption in other settings, such as inpatient services, subspecialist consultations, and rural areas; ongoing user-centered evaluations, with feedback from patients, families, and health care providers; strategies to optimize health equity and address disparities in access to care related to race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status, and rural communities; privacy and security concerns for protected health information with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)Csecured programs; confidentiality issues for some specific populations, especially adolescents and those in need of mental health services; early detection of exposure to violence and child neglect; and integration of training into undergraduate and graduate medical education and subspecialty fellowships. Addressing these research areas is essential to understanding the benefits, sustainability, safety, and optimization strategies of telemedicine and other digital approaches as key parts of modern health care delivery. These efforts will inform long-term adoption of these approaches with expanded dissemination and implementation efforts.","output":"Digital Approaches to Remote Pediatric Health Care Delivery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Existing Evidence and a Call for Further Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We reviewed the literature to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who had neurological symptoms and had an MRI that showed (1) central nervous system (CNS) hyperintense lesions not attributed to ischemia and/or (2) leptomeningeal enhancement. We sought to determine if these findings were associated with a positive CSF severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase from December 1, 2019 to November 18, 2020. CSF results were evaluated based on the presence/absence of (1) &#8805; 1 CNS hyperintense lesion and (2) leptomeningeal enhancement. RESULTS: In 117 publications, we identified 193 patients with COVID-19 who had an MRI of the CNS and CSF testing. There were 125 (65%) patients with CNS hyperintense lesions. Patients with CNS hyperintense lesions were significantly more likely to have a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR (10% [9/87] vs. 0% [0/43], p = 0.029). Of 75 patients who had a contrast MRI, there were 20 (27%) patients who had leptomeningeal enhancement. Patients with leptomeningeal enhancement were significantly more likely to have a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR (25% [4/16] vs. 5% [2/42], p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: The presence of CNS hyperintense lesions or leptomeningeal enhancement on neuroimaging from patients with COVID-19 is associated with increased likelihood of a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR. However, a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR is uncommon in patients with these neuroimaging findings, suggesting they are often related to other etiologies, such as inflammation, hypoxia, or ischemia.","output":"COVID-19 associated brain/spinal cord lesions and leptomeningeal enhancement: A meta-analysis of the relationship to CSF SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From a population perspective, the trajectories of both the total fertility at successive time periods and the total fertility of successive birth cohorts are derived from the same array of age-specific fertility rates. This analysis uses the assumption of constant age-specific fertility proportions to derive new explicit relationships between period and cohort fertility. In short, period total fertility is approximately equal to the total fertility of the cohort born a generation earlier, with a modest additive adjustment. A simple relationship also links both period and cohort total fertility to ACF, the average fertility of the childbearing cohorts in a given year. Assuming that fertility levels follow a cubic curve, cohort values from the derived relationships are then compared to observed cohort fertility values for the United States in 1917-2019.

The data collection instrument was a multi-sectional questionnaire, including sections on demographic characteristics, PMT constructs, self-reported health, and information sources related to COVID-19. In this study, descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and analytical statistical methods (Pearson correlation and path analysis) were used to analyze the data. The range of Cronbach's alpha of the study instrument varied from 0.71 to 0.97. RESULTS: The results of the current study revealed significant association between all PMT constructs and preventive behaviors. Knowledge from both direct and indirect paths was related to preventive behaviors (B = 0.76). Preventive behaviors had the strongest, direct relationship with age (B = 0.76). Based on the final fitted model, knowledge had the greatest impact on preventive behaviors through indirect and direct routes.

BACKGROUND: While vaccination prevents COVID-19, little is known about its impact on postoperative complications. METHODS: This is a nationwide observational cohort study of all 1,255 Veterans Affairs facilities nationwide. We compared patients undergoing surgery at least 2 weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, to contemporary propensity score matched controls. Primary endpoints were 30-day mortality and postoperative COVID-19 infection. Secondary endpoints were pulmonary or thrombotic complications, readmissions, and hospital lengths of stay. RESULTS: 30,681 patients met inclusion criteria. After matching, there were 3,104 in the vaccination group (1,903 received the Pfizer BioNTech, and 1,201 received the Moderna vaccine) and 7,438 controls. Full COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower rates of postoperative 30-day COVID-19 infection (Incidence Rate Ratio and 95% confidence intervals, 0.09 [0.01,0.44]), pulmonary complications (0.54 [0.39, 0.72]), thrombotic complications (0.68 [0.46, 0.99]) and decreased hospital lengths of stay (0.78 [0.69, 0.89]). Complications were also low in vaccinated patients who tested COVID-19 positive before surgery but events were too few to detect a significant difference compared to controls. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower rates of postoperative morbidity.

To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on EfficientNet, named ECOVNet, to detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays. To make the proposed model more robust, we have used one of the largest open-access chest X-ray data sets named COVIDx containing three classesCOVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. For feature extraction, we have applied an effective CNN structure, namely EfficientNet, with ImageNet pre-training weights. The generated features are transferred into custom fine-tuned top layers followed by a set of model snapshots. The predictions of the model snapshots (which are created during a single training) are consolidated through two ensemble strategies, i.e., hard ensemble and soft ensemble, to enhance classification performance. In addition, a visualization technique is incorporated to highlight areas that distinguish classes, thereby enhancing the understanding of primal components related to COVID-19. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed ECOVNet model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves detection performance with 100% recall for COVID-19 and overall accuracy of 96.07%.

METHODS: A population-representative sample of 4,021 respondents were recruited and assessed between February 25th and March 19th, 2020. Respondents reported current anxiety symptoms (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]), cognitive components (perceived ability to adapt to change, tendency to bounce back after adversities) and behavioral components (regularity of primary and secondary daily routines) of resilience, worry about COVID-19 infection, and sociodemographics. RESULTS: Logistic regression revealed that cognitive and behavioral components of resilience were not correlated with probable anxiety (GAD-7&#8805;10) among those reporting no worry. Among respondents who were worried, all resilient components were inversely associated with probable anxiety. Specifically, propensity to bounce back and regular primary routines were more strongly related to lower odds of probable anxiety among those reporting lower levels of worry. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design limits causal inference. Second, other resilient components and some key daily routines that could be related to better mental health were not assessed. Third, generalizability of the findings to other similar major cities is uncertain because cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in Hong Kong have been comparatively lower. CONCLUSIONS: To foster mental health, cultivation of confidence in one's ability to adapt to change and a propensity to bounce back from hardship should be coupled with sustainment of regular daily routines.

BMPs are rare in most mammalian tissues, comprising only a few percent of total cellular lipid content, but are elevated in cell types such as macrophages that rely heavily on lysosomal function. BMPs are markedly enriched in endosomal and lysosomal vesicles compared to other organelles and membranous structures, and their unique sn-1:sn-1 stereoconfiguration may confer stability within the hydrolytic lysosomal environment. BMP-enriched vesicles serve in endosomal-lysosomal trafficking and function as docking structures for the activation of lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes, notably those involved in the catabolic breakdown of sphingolipids. BMP levels are dysregulated in lysosomal storage disorders, phospholipidosis, metabolic diseases, liver and kidney diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. However, whether BMP alteration is a mediator or simply a marker of pathological states is unclear. Likewise, although BMP acyl chain composition may be altered with disease states, the functional significance of specific BMP species remains to be resolved. Newly developed tools for untargeted lipidomic analysis, together with a deeper understanding of enzymes mediating BMP synthesis and degradation, will help shed further light on the functional significance of BMPs in cellular physiology and pathology.","output":"The Emerging and Diverse Roles of Bis(monoacylglycero) Phosphate Lipids in Cellular Physiology and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in computed tomography (CT) scanner technology have made isotropic volumetric, multiplanar high-resolution lung imaging possible in a single breath-hold, a significant advance over the incremental high-resolution CT (HRCT) technique in which noncontiguous images sampled the lung, but lacked anatomic continuity.

Telehealth involving phone calls by trained volunteers is understudied and may be a low-cost, scalable, and valuable preventive tool for mental health. In this context, from patient participatory volunteer initiatives, we have adapted and developed an innovative volunteer-based telehealth intervention program for older adults (TIP-OA). Methods and analysis: To evaluate TIP-OA, we are conducting a mixed-methods longitudinal observational study. Participants: TIP-OA clients are older adults (age  60) recruited in Montreal, Quebec. Intervention: TIP-OA volunteers make weekly friendly phone calls to seniors to check in, form connections, provide information about COVID-19, and connect clients to community resources as needed. Measurements: Perceived stress, fear surrounding COVID-19, depression, and anxiety will be assessed at baseline, and at 4- and 8-weeks. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted to assess the experiences of clients, volunteers, and stakeholders. Results: As of October 15th, 2020, 150 volunteers have been trained to provide TIP-OA to 305 older clients.

This research utilized a quantitative research technique, collecting data by distributing structured questionnaires to real estate investors, followed by convenience sampling. This study used both descriptive and inferential statistics to make the data more meaningful. SPSS 25.0 was utilized to interpret the data. Cronbach's alpha was used to test for internal consistency, while validity was checked through correlation. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to confirm that the items on the questionnaire are perfectly loaded on their construct. Furthermore, process macro, model 5, was used to investigate the moderation mediation. This work addresses a gap in the literature by studying financial literacy as a moderator and risk perception as a mediating variable in regret aversion bias and information cascade bias's relationships with investment decisions in the real estate sector. The results confirmed that financial literacy weakens the negative effect of behavioral biases (regret aversion and information cascade) on investment decisions. In addition, risk perception mediates the relationships between these cognitive biases (regret aversion and information cascade) and decision making. The effects of other behavioral biases in real estate and stock market contexts should be examined in future research.","output":"Effect of Regret Aversion and Information Cascade on Investment Decisions in the Real Estate Sector: The Mediating Role of Risk Perception and the Moderating Effect of Financial Literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this book, we have seen the power of a CEOs strategic mindset to change the companys culture, strategy, and operations C which ultimately improved the companys performance and prospects.","output":"Leading Through Strategic Mindset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mixed infection with different pathogens is common in swine production systems especially under intensive production conditions. Quick and accurate detection and differentiation of different pathogens are necessary for epidemiological surveillance, disease management and import and export controls. In this study, we developed and validated a panel of multiplex real-time PCR/RT-PCR assays composed of four subpanels, each detects three common swine pathogens. The panel detects 12 viruses or viral serotypes, namely, VSV-IN, VSV-NJ, SVDV, CSFV, ASFV, FMDV, PCV2, PPV, PRV, PRRSV-NA, PRRSV-EU and SIV. Correlation coefficients (R(2)) and PCR amplification efficiencies of all singular and triplex real-time PCR reactions are within the acceptable range. Comparison between singular and triplex real-time PCR assays of each subpanel indicates that there is no significant interference on assay sensitivities caused by multiplexing. Specificity tests on 226 target clinical samples or 4 viral strains and 91 non-target clinical samples revealed that the real-time PCR panel is 100% specific, and there is no cross amplification observed. The limit of detection of each triplex real-time PCR is less than 10 copies per reaction for DNA, and less than 16 copies per reaction for RNA viruses. The newly developed multiplex real-time PCR panel also detected different combinations of co-infections as confirmed by other means of detections.","output":"A multiplex real-time PCR panel assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of 12 common swine viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many traditional vaccines have proven to be incapable of controlling newly emerging infectious diseases. They have also achieved limited success in the fight against a variety of human cancers. Thus, innovative vaccine strategies are highly needed to overcome the global burden of these diseases. Advances in molecular biology and reverse genetics have completely restructured the concept of vaccinology, leading to the emergence of state-of-the-art technologies for vaccine design, development and delivery. Among these modern vaccine technologies are the recombinant viral vectored vaccines, which are known for their incredible specificity in antigen delivery as well as the induction of robust immune responses in the vaccinated hosts. Although a number of viruses have been used as vaccine vectors, genetically engineered Newcastle disease virus (NDV) possesses some useful attributes that make it a preferable candidate for vectoring vaccine antigens. Here, we review the molecular biology of NDV and discuss the reverse genetics approaches used to engineer the virus into an efficient vaccine vector. We then discuss the prospects of the engineered virus as an efficient vehicle of vaccines against cancer and several infectious diseases of man and animals.","output":"Exploring the Prospects of Engineered Newcastle Disease Virus in Modern Vaccinology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an important strategic emerging industry to promote sustainable economic development, new energy vehicles (NEVs) play multiple vital roles in energy saving and emission reduction and promote the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry. China's government has formulated abundant policies to support the NEV industry. Existing studies do not pay enough attention to the latent information from NEV policy documents. This paper explores the latent topics of numerous NEV policy documents and their impact on promoting NEVs at the city level by combining the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and the econometric method. The results show that the latent topics of NEV policy documents can be categorized into charging infrastructure operation, promotion subsidy, and production support. The prevalence of the promotion subsidy topic is the strongest among the three types of topics. Total topic prevalences significantly promote NEV sales. The 2013 year is a turning point in policy preferences, and this change boosts NEV sales. The prevalence of promotion subsidy topic has an inverted U-shaped effect on NEV sales. The NEV sales will increase by 19% when the prevalence of production support topic increases by 1. Under the COVID-19, although the promotion subsidy policy is still dominant, the production support policy has been paid more attention. Finally, combining the development of China's NEV industry under the COVID-19 epidemic, the paper puts forward pertinent policy suggestions.","output":"Impact of the latent topics of policy documents on the promotion of new energy vehicles: empirical evidence from Chinese cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: To develop a useful score for predicting the prognosis of severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.We retrospectively analyzed patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted from February 10, 2020 to April 5, 2020. First, all patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort or a validation cohort. By univariate analysis of the training cohort, we developed combination scores and screened the superior score for predicting the prognosis. Subsequently, we identified the independent factors influencing prognosis. Finally, we demonstrated the predictive efficiency of the score in validation cohort.A total of 145 patients were enrolled. In the training cohort, nonsurvivors had higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase than survivors. Among the 7 combination scores that were developed, lactic dehydrogenase-lymphocyte ratio (LLR) had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value for predicting prognosis, and it was associated with the incidence of liver injury, renal injury, and higher disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score on admission. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein, DIC score &#8805;2 and LLR >345 were the factors associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that only LLR >345 was an independent risk factor for prognosis (odds ratio [OR] = 9.176, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.674-31.487, Pa??<a??.001).

The subjects were monitored using a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) for 2 weeks. RESULTS: Of 60 patients, 30 were selected to receive CPAP intervention while 30 without CPAP served as controls. The CPAP tolerance of the intervention group was good, with average time on CPAP therapy of 55.2  4.3 days, and average daily time on CPAP therapy of 8.3  2.8 h. The postprandial blood glucose (PBG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and HbA1c levels in the intervention group decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Significant variations in 24-h mean blood glucose and night-time mean blood glucose were significantly lower with CPAP therapy than without therapy (P < 0.05, respectively).

In this study, we report docking simulation with two Mpro enzymes and five flavonols and three dihydroflavonols, in vitro inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and in vitro inhibition of the HCoV 229E replication. The docking simulation results predicted that (+)-dihydrokaempferol, (+)-dihydroquercetin, (+)-dihydromyricetin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricentin, isoquercetin, and rutin could bind to at least two subsites (S1, S1, S2, and S4) in the binding pocket and inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Their affinity scores ranged from -8.8 to -7.4. Likewise, these compounds were predicted to bind and inhibit the HCoV-229E Mpro activity with affinity scores ranging from -7.1 to -7.8.

This sudden shift to distance learning has put the pharmacy education system through an extraordinary experience that may impact its future. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect emergency remote teaching has had on pharmacy education in Saudi Arabia, and to provide recommendations that may help set in place a contingency strategy. METHODS: Two cross-sectional Likert-scale based questionnaires targeted at students and teachers separately, designed to explore stakeholders' satisfaction in three areas of emergency distance teaching/learning: The use of virtual classrooms, completion of course learning outcomes (CLOs) and assessment via alternative methods during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Furthermore, phone interviews were conducted with teachers and students to discuss results from both questionnaires for further clarity on teacher and student views. RESULTS: Over 700 pharmacy students, from 19 different local colleges, and 74 faculty members from 10 different local colleges have participated in this study. While it was challenging for the majority of teachers (>60%) to delivery complex scientific concepts over virtual classrooms, >35% of students and 60% of teachers have expressed concerns on the lack of studentCstudent and studentCteacher interactions. A factor that has shown a significantly negative correlation with student overall satisfaction (p < 0.01). Emergency remote teaching has forced teachers to alternative assessment methods, which the majority (70%) believe had a positive effect on students' overall skills. Almost half of students (45%) were concerned by the lack of guidance accompanied by unfamiliar methods of assessments.

Log-binomial models assessed correlates of infection and clinical severity. RESULTS: Between December 2018 and December 2019, 17% of all outpatients presented with ILI and 16% of inpatients were admitted with an acute respiratory complaint. Influenza viruses and RSV were detected in 17% and 11% of outpatient participants with ILI, and 23% and 16% of inpatient participants with ILI, respectively. Influenza (JulyCSeptember) and RSV (January-April) prevalence peaks were temporally distinct. RSV (relative risk [RR]: 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51C2.11), but not influenza, infection was associated with severe disease among patients with ILI.

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8C10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein.

Historically, the role of the judiciary is to arrest, impose sanctions and protect society from harm. Adults arrested for drug abuse in Indiana can be sentenced to 1 of 17 correctional facilities. As an alternative, they may be eligible to participate in a problem-solving court (PSC) programme that refers individuals to treatment as a pretrial diversionary strategy. The aim of the study is to determine which interventions offered by PSCs and correctional facilities impact morbidity and mortality. The study began in 2019 and will end in 2023; therefore, the results in this manuscript are preliminary. METHODS: The study cohort included two populations arrested for drug misuse: (1) adults sentenced to Indianan correctional facilities (1 January 2018 to 30 June 2021) and (2) adults participating in an Indiana PSC programme (1 January 2018 to 30 June 2021). The study used a mixed-methods design that integrated qualitative interviews of deputy wardens, PSC team members and service providers with the following quantitative datasets: sentencing information, emergency department visits, inpatient hospitalization admissions, prescription drug monitoring programme data and death records. The individuals will be followed at 2-week, 4-week, 6-month and 1-year intervals post-release. Difference-in-difference and time-to-event analyses will identify impactful interventions.

METHODS We randomly assigned 362 patients with acute ischemic stroke, within 4.5 hours after onset, to endovascular therapy (intraarterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], mechanical clot disruption or retrieval, or a combination of these approaches) or intravenous t-PA. Treatments were to be given as soon as possible after randomization. The primary outcome was survival free of disability (defined as a modified Rankin score of 0 or 1 on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 no clinically significant disability despite symptoms, and 6 death) at 3 months. RESULTS A total of 181 patients were assigned to receive endovascular therapy, and 181 intravenous t-PA. The median time from stroke onset to the start of treatment was 3.75 hours for endovascular therapy and 2.75 hours for intravenous t-PA (P<0.001). At 3 months, 55 patients in the endovascular-therapy group (30.4%) and 63 in the intravenous t-PA group (34.8%) were alive without disability (odds ratio adjusted for age, sex, stroke severity, and atrial fibrillation status at baseline, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.14; P=0.16).

By applying sensitive PCR-based molecular assays, we detected the etiologic agents and delineated the epidemiologic picture of RTIs in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From December 2019 to February 2020, we screened patients presented with RTIs using multiplex PCR-based diagnostic assays. Data from pediatric and adult patients were compared with different months and units in the hospital. RESULTS: Of all 1631 patients including 1445 adult and 186 pediatric patients screened, 8 viruses and 4 bacteria were identified. Positive rates were 25% in December, 37% in January, and 20% in February, with pediatric patients having higher positive rates than adults (Ps < 0.001).

However, little is known about how the COVID-19 vaccination would affect mental health and preventive behaviors toward the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to address this issue among 4244 individuals at several COVID-19 vaccination sites in Guangzhou, China. Using univariate analysis and multiple linear regression models, we found that major demographic characteristics, such as biological sex, age, education level, and family per capita income, are the dominant influencing factors associated with health beliefs, mental health, and preventive behaviors. After propensity score matching (PSM) treatment, we further assessed the changes in the scores of health belief, mental health, and preventive behaviors between the pre-vaccination group and the post-vaccination group. When compared to individuals in the pre-vaccination group, a moderate but statistically significant lower score was observed in the post-vaccination group (p = 0.010), implying possibly improved psychological conditions after COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, there was also a moderate but statistically higher score of preventive behaviors in the post-vaccination group than in the pre-vaccination group (p < 0.001), suggesting a higher probability to take preventive measures after COVID-19 vaccination. These findings have implications for implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions combined with mass vaccination to control the rebound of COVID-19 outbreaks.","output":"Changes in Mental Health and Preventive Behaviors before and after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Propensity Score Matching (PSM) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a public health problem, which caused a major impact on morbidity and mortality around the world. Even though an effective vaccine is the most awaited resolution for the pandemic, little is known about COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess vaccine acceptance and its associated factors among pregnant and postnatal mothers. METHOD: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 527 pregnant and postnatal mothers from August 15 to September 15, 2021. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Epi-Data version 4.6 and Stata 16 software were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Participant characteristics and rate of vaccine acceptance were presented using descriptive statistics. Multi-variable logistic regression was performed to identify statistically significant variables. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to declare statistical significance based on p < 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. RESULT: The overall prevalence of intent to accept COVID-19 vaccine was 62.04% (95% CI: 57.65, 66.25). Of those 40.08% were pregnant mothers and 21.97% of them were postpartum mothers. Urban residence (AOR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.09C3.77), respondents who were worry about COVID-19 disease (AOR = 3.46, 95% CI: 2.16C5.52), and participants who had favorable attitude towards vaccine (AOR = 8.54, 95% CI: 5.18C14.08) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccination was low. Residence, worry about COVID-19 disease, and attitudes towards vaccine were factors significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Evidence-based and clear information on COVID-19 vaccines should be provided to pregnant and postnatal mothers for both rural and urban residences to improve attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine and increase vaccination rates.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and associated factors among women attending antenatal and postnatal cares in Central Gondar Zone public hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The feasibility and outcome of sphincter-saving resection for rectal cancer were assessed in patients previously treated by high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer. METHOD Between 2000 and 2012, 1066 patients underwent rectal excision for rectal cancer. Of these, 236 were treated by conventional radiotherapy (45 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group A) and 12 were treated by external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer (70 Gy) and sphincter-saving resection (Group B) of whom five had a metachronous and seven a synchronous cancer. The end-points were surgical morbidity, pelvic sepsis, reoperation and definitive stoma. RESULTS Tumour characteristics were similar in both groups. Surgical morbidity (67% vs 25%, P = 0.004), anastomotic leakage (50% vs 10%, P = 0.001, and reoperation (50% vs 17%, P = 0.011) were significantly higher in Group B. Multivariate analyses showed that EBRT for prostate cancer was the only independent factor for anastomotic leakage (OR = 5.12; 95% CI 1.45-18.08; P = 0.011) and definitive stoma (OR = 10.56; 95% CI 3.02-39.92; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION High-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases morbidity from rectal surgery and the risk of a permanent stoma. This suggests that a delayed coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure should be proposed as an alternative to low anterior resection in this population.","output":"Surgery for rectal cancer after high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer: is sphincter preservation relevant?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To gain insight into how direct care staff in Dutch nursing homes experienced work during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

However, still little information is available on which type of mental health training is important in the improvement of these capacities. METHODS: We studied web-based survey data of 495 public health workers to examine training types associated with knowledge and experience in supporting individuals with mental illness. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between a lack of knowledge and experience (outcome) and mental health training (exposure). We fitted three regression models. Model 1 evaluated unadjusted associations. Model 2 adjusted for age and sex. Model 3 adjusted for age, sex, years of experience, mental health full-time worker status, and community population. Bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) were used. RESULTS: For all training types, the association between a lack of knowledge and experience and mental health training attenuated as the model developed. In Model 3, a lack of knowledge and experience was significantly associated with training in specific illness (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32C0.93) and screening and assessment (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39C0.99). Non-significant results were produced for training in counseling, psychosocial support, collaborative work, and law and regulation in Model 3.

This paper differs from prior work and leverages two recent releases of the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data for 2009 and 2017 to develop machine learning (ML) models, specifically gradient boosting machine (GBM), for predicting household-level online shopping purchases. The NHTS data allow for not only conducting nationwide investigation but also at the level of households, which is more appropriate than at the individual level given the connected consumption and shopping needs of members in a household. We follow a systematic procedure for model development including employing Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm to select input variables (features) in order to reduce the risk of model overfitting and increase model explainability. Extensive post-modeling investigation is conducted in a comparative manner between 2009 and 2017, including quantifying the importance of each input variable in predicting online shopping demand, and characterizing value-dependent relationships between demand and the input variables. In doing so, two latest advances in machine learning techniques, namely Shapley value-based feature importance and Accumulated Local Effects plots, are adopted to overcome inherent drawbacks of the popular techniques in current ML modeling. The modeling and investigation are performed both at the national level and for three of the largest cities (New York, Los Angeles, and Houston).

Antibiotic resistance is associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Studies suggest urgent cares exceed the national average for inappropriate antibiotic use associated with maintaining patient satisfaction. LOCAL PROBLEM: Chart audits from an urgent care clinic in the southwest region of the USA revealed that antibiotics were prescribed for upper respiratory infections (URIs) routinely and without patient instruction on methods to reduce their antibiotic use. Further review, exposed that most urgent care sites do not have an Antibiotic Stewardship Plan (ASP) and little-to-no ASP training for medical staff. METHODS: A quantitative quality improvement project was implemented to determine the impact of delayed antibiotic prescribing on antibiotic usage rates for adult patients with URI symptoms at an urgent care clinic in central Arizona over 4 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions URI adult treatment guidelines for antibiotic use with follow-up phone calls 10 days post-discharge to evaluate the patients decision-making. RESULTS: Antibiotic usage rates decreased by 12% in 30 days, N=927, n=598 in the comparative and n=330 in the implementation group. A Mann-Whitney U test demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant reduction in antibiotic usage rates between groups (U=247, p=0.023).

In the beginning of the pandemic, Northern regions accounted for 40% of cases and 45% of deaths from COVID-19 in Italy. Several factors have been suggested to explain the higher incidence and excess mortality from COVID-19 in these regions. It is noticed that Northern Italian regions, and particularly the cities in Po Valley, are the areas with the highest air pollution due to commercial vehicle traffic, industry and a stagnant meteorological condition, with one of the highest levels in Italy and Europe of fine particulate matter 2.5 micron or smaller in size (PM2.5). PM2.5, the major environmental pollutant deriving mainly by factory and automobile exhaust emissions and coal combustion, increases the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the epithelial cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and thus increase the susceptibility to this virus. The epithelial barrier hypothesis proposes that many diverse diseases may rise from the disruption of epithelial barrier of skin, respiratory tract and gastrointestinal system, including allergic diseases, metabolic and autoimmune diseases, and chronic neuropsychiatric conditions. There is evidence of a close correlation between air pollution and airway epithelial barrier dysfunction. Air pollution, causing lung epithelial barrier dysfunction, may contribute to local chronic inflammation, microbiome dysbiosis and impaired antiviral immune response against SARS-CoV-2, all of which contribute to the high incidence and excess mortality from COVID-19. In addition, air pollution and epithelial barrier dysfunction contribute also to the higher prevalence of several comorbidities of COVID-19, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity, which have been identified as risk factors for mortality of COVID-19. In this article, on the basis of epidemiological and environmental monitoring data in Northern Italy, it is suggested that epithelial barrier hypothesis may help to understand the excess burden and mortality from COVID-19.","output":"Is epithelial barrier hypothesis the key to understanding the higher incidence and excess mortality during COVID-19 pandemic?

The pandemic's rapid evolution has resulted in a knowledge gap in how COVID-19 has affected MS clinical practice. Our objective was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice patterns in a nationwide cohort of MS clinicians across the United States. METHODS: In collaboration with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), we developed a 28-item SurveyMonkeyTM electronic questionnaire exploring MS specialists' perceptions of how COVID-19 has altered how they prescribe MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), provide telehealth and other services, and view issues affecting their own well-being including re-deployment to the front lines of COVID-19 care and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). NMSS staff sent a recruitment email containing the electronic survey link to 188 clinicians who serve on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US, 86 (45.7%) of whom were MS specialist physicians. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 188 potential respondents (45.7%) from 32 US states completed the survey including 45 physicians (41 neurologists, 3 physiatrists and 1 family physician), 18 rehabilitation therapists, 7 psychologists, 6 nurse practitioners, 4 social workers, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurses and 2 health professionals from other disciplines. More than 80% of all respondents working on-site in a health care setting believed they had adequate PPE. More than 41% were able to distance safely from others at work. Nearly 10% of respondents reported they had been re-deployed to the front lines of COVID-19 patient care, and an additional 16.9% anticipated being re-deployed. Among the MS specialist physician subgroup, nearly one-third reported using telemedicine to provide over 75% of their clinical care. Only 16.7% believed COVID-19 had not changed how they prescribe DMTs. Therapies prescribed more often during the pandemic included ?-IFNs (28.6% of prescribers), natalizumab (23.8%), glatiramer acetate (21.4%) and teriflunomide (19%). DMTs prescribed less often included alemtuzumab (64.3% of prescribers), cladribine (54.8%), ocrelizumab and rituximab (50%), and fingolimod and siponimod (40.5%). For at least some of their patients during the pandemic, some MS specialists reported suspending certain DMTs including alemtuzumab (21.4% of prescribers), ocrelizumab and rituximab (16.7%) and cladribine (11.9%). Others reported extending DMT dosing intervals for natalizumab (38.1%), fingolimod and siponimod (11.9%).

The escalating number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals has conferred the viral spread with the status of global pandemic. However, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic drugs available on the market to treat COVID-19, although several drugs have been approved. Recently, two articles using the comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction map revealed that the sigma-1 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Knockout and knockdown of SIGMAR1 (sigma-1 receptor, encoded by SIGMAR1) caused robust reductions in SARS-CoV-2 replication, which indicates that the sigma-1 receptor is a key therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, a recent clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with the antidepressant fluvoxamine, which has a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor, could prevent clinical deterioration in adult outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the brief history of the sigma-1 receptor and its role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells.

Inclusion criteria were controlled studies using light-emitting diode or liquid crystal display monitors with Latin-based languages. Cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors were excluded because of the user experience confounders. Results Thirty-two articles met inclusion criteria. Overall, 14-point size significantly improved legibility compared to smaller font sizes. Similarly, Verdana and Arial typefaces significantly improved legibility compared to Times New Roman typeface. Verdana also significantly decreased subjective mental workload and visibility difficulty ratings and required the least eye movement of any typefaces tested. Positive polarity (dark text on light background) significantly improved reading outcomes across many measurements over negative polarity. There was higher character identification accuracy with higher luminance. Text effects (e.g., italics), interword and interletter spacing, and page presentation are among variables with mixed or minimal evidence. Conclusion Learning experience design principles significantly impacted reading and learning outcomes in laboratory settings. No studies evaluated classroom outcomes.

Its coding region constitutes less than 50% of the complete gene length, enabling SH gene to be highly variable and the SH protein highly conserved. In standard HRSV molecular epidemiology studies, solely sequences of the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein gene (HVR2) are analyzed. To what extent do the strains identical in HVR2 differ elsewhere in genomes is rarely investigated. Our goal was to investigate whether diversity and inter-genotype differences observed for HVR2 are also present in the SH gene. METHODS: We sequenced 198 clinical samples collected within a limited area and time frame. In this HRSV collection, rapid and significant changes in HVR2 occurred. RESULTS: Over 20% of strains from this pool (containing HRSV genotypes NA1, ON1, GA5, BA9 and BA10) would be incorrectly assumed to be identical to another strain if only the HVR2 region was analysed. The majority of differences found in SH gene were located in the 5 untranslated region (UTR). Seven indels were detected, one was genotype GA5 specific. An in-frame deletion of 9 nucleotides (coding for amino acids 49C51) was observed in one of group A strains. Fifteen different SH protein sequences were detected; 68% of strains possessed the consensus sequence and most of others differed from the consensus in only one amino acid (only 4 strains differed in 2 amino acids). The majority of differing amino acids in group A viruses had the same identity as the corresponding amino acids in group B strains. When analysis was restricted to strains with identical HVR2 nucleotide sequences and differing SH protein sequences, 75% of differences observed in the SH ectodomain were located within region coding for amino acids 49C51. CONCLUSIONS: Basing HRSV molecular epidemiology studies solely on HVR2 largely underestimates the complexity of circulating virus populations. In strain identification, broadening of the genomic target sequence to SH gene would provide a more comprehensive insight into viral pool versatility and its evolutionary processes.

Enteroviral 2C is the most conserved nonstructural protein among all enteroviruses and possesses the RNA helicase activity that plays pivotal roles during enteroviral life cycles, which makes 2C an attractive target for developing the anti-enteroviral drugs. In this study, we designed a peptide, named 2CL, based on the structure of EV-A71 2C. This peptide effectively impaired the oligomerization of EV-A71 2C protein, and inhibited the RNA helicase activities of 2C proteins encoded by EV-A71 and CVA16, and both of which belong to EV-A, and showed potent antiviral efficacy against EV-A71 and CVA16 in cells. Moreover, the 2CL treatment elicited a strong in vivo protective efficacy against lethal EV-A71 challenge. Besides, the antiviral strategy of targeting the 2C helicase activity can be applied to inhibit the replication of EV-B. Either 2CL or B-2CL, the peptide redesigned based on the 2CL-corresponding sequence of EV-Bs, exerted effective antiviral activity against two important EV-Bs, Coxsackievirus B3 and Echovirus 11. Together, our findings demonstrated that targeting the helicase activity of 2C by rationally designed peptide is an efficient antiviral strategy against enteroviruses, and the 2CL and B-2CL showed promising clinical potentials to be further developed as broad-spectrum anti-enteroviral drugs.ImportanceEnteroviruses are a large group of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, and include numerous human pathogens, such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), coxsackieviruses, and echoviruses. However, no approved antiviral drug is available. Enteroviral 2C is the most conserved nonstructural protein among all enteroviruses and contains the RNA helicase activity critical for the viral life cycle. Herein, according to the structure of EV-A71 2C, we designed a peptide that effectively inhibited the RNA helicase activities of EV-A71-and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16)-encoded 2C proteins. Moreover, this peptide exerted potent antiviral effects against EV-A71 and CVA16 in cells and elicited therapeutic efficacy against lethal EV-A71 challenge in vivo Furthermore, we demonstrated that the strategy of targeting the 2C helicase activity can be used to other relevant enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B3 and echovirus 11.

Infection of mice, regardless of age, with LDV leads to the rapid cytocidal replication of the virus in these cells, resulting in the release of large amounts of LDV into the circulation. The infection then progresses into life-long, asymptomatic, low-level viremic persistence, which is maintained by LDV replication in newly generated LDV-permissive cells which escapes all antiviral immune responses. In situ hybridization studies of tissue sections of adult FVB mice revealed that by 1 day postinfection (p.i.), LDV-infected cells were present in practically all tissues but were present in the highest numbers in the lymph nodes, spleen, and skin. In the central nervous system, LDV-infected cells were restricted to the leptomeninges. Most of the infected cells had disappeared at 3 days p.i., consistent with the cytocidal nature of the LDV infection, except for small numbers in lymph node, spleen, liver, and testis tissues. These tissues harbored infected cells until at least 90 days p.i. The results suggest that the generation of LDV-permissive cells during the persistent phase is restricted to these tissues. The continued presence of LDV-infected cells in testis tissue suggests the possibility of LDV release in semen and sexual transmission. Most striking was the accumulation of large amounts of LDV RNA in newly generated germinal centers of lymph nodes and the spleen. The LDV RNA was not associated with infected cells but was probably associated with virions or debris of infected, lysed cells. The appearance of LDV RNA in germinal centers in these mice coincided in time with the polyclonal activation of B cells, which leads to the accumulation of polyclonal immunoglobulin G2a and low-molecular-weight immune complexes in the circulation.","output":"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus replication persists in liver, spleen, lymph node, and testis tissues and results in accumulation of viral RNA in germinal centers, concomitant with polyclonal activation of B cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The treatment of atypical pneumonia, subsequently termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is controversial, and the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy is unknown.

Patients were included if they underwent TTE during the hospitalization after a known positive diagnosis for COVID-19. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using chart abstraction from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Of 749 patients, 72 (9.6%) underwent TTE following positive results on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction testing. The most common clinical indications for TTE were concern for a major acute cardiovascular event (45.8%) and hemodynamic instability (29.2%). Although most patients had preserved biventricular function, 34.7% were found to have left ventricular ejection fractions &#8804; 50%, and 13.9% had at least moderately reduced right ventricular function. Four patients had wall motion abnormalities suggestive of stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: More than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India towards end of November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearson r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), literacy, NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic (0.70, 0.69) development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths with NCD risk factors (r(2) = 0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r(2) = 0.32, 0.16) and healthcare (r(2) = 0.52, 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 disease burden and mortality in India is ecologically associated with greater state-level burden of NCDs and risk factors, especially obesity and diabetes.","output":"Macrolevel association of COVID-19 with non-communicable disease risk factors in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and global spread of COVID-19 has disrupted the traditional mechanisms of education throughout the world Institutions of learning were caught unprepared and this jeopardised the face-to-face method of curriculum delivery and assessment Teaching institutions have shifted to an asynchronous mode whilst attempting to preserve the principles of integrity, equity, inclusiveness, fairness, ethics, and safety A framework of assessment that enables educators to utilise appropriate methods in measuring a student's progress is crucial for the success of teaching and learning, especially in health education that demands high standards and comprises consistent scientific content Within such a framework, this paper aims to present a narrative review of the currently utilised methods of assessment in health education and recommend selected modalities that could be administered in an asynchronous mode during the COVID-19 pandemic Assessment methods such as open-ended short answer questions, problem-based questions, oral exams, and recorded objective structured clinical exams (OSCE) would be appropriate for use in an asynchronous environment to assess the knowledge and competence of health professional students during COVID-19 Fairness and integrity can be ensured by using technological tools such as video and audio recording surveillance","output":"Asynchronous Environment Assessment: A Pertinent Option for Medical and Allied Health Profession Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care arterial blood gas (ABG) is a blood measurement test and a useful diagnostic tool that assists with treatment and therefore improves clinical outcomes. However, numerically reported test results make rapid interpretation difficult or open to interpretation. The arterial blood gas algorithm (ABG-a) is a new digital diagnostics solution that can provide clinicians with real-time interpretation of preliminary data on safety features, oxygenation, acid-base disturbances and renal profile. The main aim of this study was to clinically validate the algorithm against senior experienced clinicians, for acid-base interpretation, in a clinical context. METHODS: We conducted a prospective international multicentre observational cross-sectional study. 346 sample sets and 64 inpatients eligible for ABG met strict sampling criteria. Agreement was evaluated using Cohen's kappa index, diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, efficiency or global accuracy and positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for the prevalence in the study population. RESULTS: The concordance rates between the interpretations of the clinicians and the ABG-a for acid-base disorders were an observed global agreement of 84,3% with a Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.81; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; p < 0.001. For detecting accuracy normal acid-base status the algorithm has a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI 79.9 to 95.3), a specificity 97.2% (95% CI 94.5 to 98.6) and a global accuracy of 95.9% (95% CI 93.3 to 97.6). For the four simple acid-base disorders, respiratory alkalosis: sensitivity of 91.2 (77.0 to 97.0), a specificity 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 99.1 (97.5 to 99.7); respiratory acidosis: sensitivity of 61.1 (38.6 to 79.7), a specificity of 100.0 (98.8 to 100.0) and global accuracy of 98.0 (95.9 to 99.0); metabolic acidosis: sensitivity of 75.8 (59.0 to 87.2), a specificity of 99.7 (98.2 to 99.9) and a global accuracy of 97.4 (95.1 to 98.6); metabolic alkalosis sensitivity of 72.2 (56.0 to 84.2), a specificity of 95.5 (92.5 to 97.3) and a global accuracy of 93.0 (88.8 to 95.3); the four complex acid-base disorders, respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis, the sensitivity, specificity and global accuracy was also high. For normal acid-base status the algorithm has PPV 87.1 (95% CI 76.6 to 93.3) %, and NPV 97.9 (95% CI 95.4 to 99.0) for a prevalence of 17.4 (95% CI 13.8 to 21.8). For the four-simple acid-base disorders and the four complex acid-base disorders the PPV and NPV were also statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The ABG-a showed very high agreement and diagnostic accuracy with experienced senior clinicians in the acid-base disorders in a clinical context. The method also provides refinement and deep complex analysis at the point-of-care that a clinician could have at the bedside on a day-to-day basis. The ABG-a method could also have the potential to reduce human errors by checking for imminent life-threatening situations, analysing the internal consistency of the results, the oxygenation and renal status of the patient.","output":"Automatic real-time analysis and interpretation of arterial blood gas sample for Point-of-care testing: Clinical validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in radical changes in the delivery of healthcare worldwide. Our oncology service (at an Irish national cancer centre) rapidly transitioned to the use of telemedicine or virtual clinics (VC) to minimise potential risk of exposure to COVID-19 amongst an immunosuppressed, high-risk population. Our study aimed to evaluate the use of VC in this setting. METHODS: An 18-point questionnaire was designed to investigate the patient experience of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and compliance with guidelines developed in Ireland to conduct VC and the role of VC in the future. Questionnaires were distributed following the receipt of verbal consent from patients during the VC. Descriptive statistics were utilised for data analysis using SPSS?. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients returned completed surveys (n = 104/164, 63% response rate). Overall satisfaction levels were high with most patients (n = 58/100, 58%; no answer provided (NAP), n = 4) equally satisfied or nearly equally satisfied with VC in comparison to a usual clinic encounter. The majority of patients felt that there should be a role for VC in the future (n = 84/102, 82%; NAP, n = 2). The majority of patients (n = 61/99, 61%; NAP, n = 5) were very relieved to avoid a hospital visit due to perceived risk of potential exposure to COVID-19.

DATA SOURCES: We conducted highly sensitive searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Embase. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database until April 28, 2020. No study design, publication status or language restriction were applied. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included studies that assessed patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease and examined one or more prognostic factors for mortality or disease severity. Reviewers working in pairs independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each prognostic factor and outcome. RESULTS: We included 207 studies and found high or moderate certainty that the following 49 variables provide valuable prognostic information on mortality and/or severe disease in patients with COVID-19 infectious disease: Demographic factors (age, male sex, smoking), patient history factors (comorbidities, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, arterial hypertension, diabetes, dementia, cancer and dyslipidemia), physical examination factors (respiratory failure, low blood pressure, hypoxemia, tachycardia, dyspnea, anorexia, tachypnea, haemoptysis, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever and myalgia or arthralgia), laboratory factors (high blood procalcitonin, myocardial injury markers, high blood White Blood Cell count (WBC), high blood lactate, low blood platelet count, plasma creatinine increase, high blood D-dimer, high blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high blood C-reactive protein (CRP), decrease in lymphocyte count, high blood aspartate aminotransferase (AST), decrease in blood albumin, high blood interleukin-6 (IL-6), high blood neutrophil count, high blood B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), high blood urea nitrogen (BUN), high blood creatine kinase (CK), high blood bilirubin and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), radiological factors (consolidative infiltrate and pleural effusion) and high SOFA score (sequential organ failure assessment score). CONCLUSION: Identified prognostic factors can help clinicians and policy makers in tailoring management strategies for patients with COVID-19 infectious disease while researchers can utilise our findings to develop multivariable prognostic models that could eventually facilitate decision-making and improve patient important outcomes.

As part of this trend Alberta, Canada, has implemented Primary Care Networks (PCNs). These are decentralized organizations, mandated with supporting the delivery of PHC, funded through capitation, and operating as partnerships between the provinces healthcare administration system and family physicians. This paper provides an implementation history of the PCNs, giving a detailed account of how people, time, and culture have interacted to implement bottom up, incremental change in a predominantly Fee-For-Service (FFS) environment. METHODS: Our implementation history is built out of an analysis of policy documents and qualitative interviews. We conducted an interpretive analysis of relevant policy documents (n = 20) published since the first PCN was established. We then grounded 12 semi-structured interviews in that initial policy analysis. These interviews explored 11 key stakeholders perceptions of PHC transformation in Alberta generally, and the formation and evolution of the PCNs specifically. The data from the policy review and the interviews were coded inductively, with participants checking our emerging analyses. RESULTS: Over time, the PCNs have shifted from an initial Frontier Era that emphasized local solutions to local problems and featured few rules, to a present Era of Accountability that features central demands for standardized measures, governance, and co-planning with other elements of the health system. Across both eras, the PCNs have been first and foremost instruments and supporters of family physician authority and autonomy. A core group of people emerged to create the PCNs and, over time, to develop a long-term Quality Improvement (QI) vision and governance plan for them as organizations. The continuing willingness of both these groups to work at understanding and aligning one anothers cultures to achieve the transformation towards PHC has been central to the PCNs survival and success. CONCLUSIONS: Generalizable lessons from the implementation history of this emerging policy experiment include: The need for flexibility within a broad commitment to improving quality. The importance of time for individuals and organizations to learn about: quality improvement; one anothers cultures; and how best to support the transformation of a system while delivering care locally.

However, the consequences of lockdown on psychotic symptoms have been poorly investigated. METHODS: An online survey was run from April 13 to May 11, 2020; a total of 728 French subjects from the general population were included in the study. We assessed the perceived impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, length of isolation, diagnosis/symptoms/hospitalisation related to the COVID-19 (oneself and family). Paranoid ideations and hallucination-like experiences were assessed via the Paranoia Scale and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale, respectively. Self-reported measures of negative affect, loneliness, sleep difficulties, jumping to conclusion bias, repetitive thoughts, among others, were also included. RESULTS: Final regression model for paranoia indicated that socio-demographic variables (age, sex and education), loneliness, cognitive bias, anxiety, experiential avoidance, repetitive thoughts and hallucinations were associated with paranoia (R2 = 0.43). For hallucinations, clinical variables as well as the quality of sleep, behavioural activation, repetitive thoughts, anxiety and paranoia were associated with hallucinations in our sample (R2 = 0.27). Neither length of isolation nor the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with psychotic experiences in the final models. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found for the impact of isolation on psychotic symptoms in the general population in France one month after the lockdown. It nevertheless confirms the preeminent role of several factors previously described in the maintenance and development of psychotic symptoms in the context of a pandemic and lockdown measures.","output":"Persecutory ideation and anomalous perceptual experiences in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in France: what's left one month later?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]it predicts that distress results from the threatened loss or actual loss of ones personal resources, or from the failure of resource investment to yield anticipated resource gain.

METHODS Following the shift to virtual care, Kaiser Permanente Washington implemented a series of workflow changes to administer standard screening and monitoring questionnaires at virtual visits and to complete structured suicide risk assessments for patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation. These new workflows included automated distribution of questionnaires via the electronic health record (EHR) patient portal and automated alerts to clinicians regarding indicators of high risk. RESULTS In March 2020, in-person mental health visits were rapidly and completely replaced by video and telephone visits. The proportion of mental health visits with completed screening and monitoring questionnaires fell from approximately 80% in early 2020 to approximately 30% in late March, then gradually recovered to approximately 60% by the end of 2020. Among patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation on monitoring questionnaires, the proportion with a recorded suicide risk assessment fell from over 90% in early 2020 to approximately 40% in late March, then gradually recovered to nearly 100% by the end of 2020.

We conducted 131 semistructured phone interviews with households in rural Odisha, India, to understand behavior changes made in WASH practices as a result of the pandemic and challenges that would prevent best practices. Interviews were conducted from May through July 2020 with 73 heads of household, 37 caregivers of children < 5 years old, and 21 members of village water and sanitation committees in villages with community-level piped water and high levels of latrine ownership. The majority of respondents (86%, N = 104) reported a change in their handwashing practice due to COVID-19, typically describing an increase in handwashing frequency, more thorough washing method, and/or use of soap. These improved handwashing practices remained in place a few months after the pandemic began and were often described as a new consistent practice after additional daily actions (such as returning home), suggesting new habit formation. Few participants (13%) reported barriers to handwashing. Some respondents also detailed improvements in other WASH behaviors, including village-level cleaning of water tanks and/or treatment of piped water (48% of villages), household water treatment and storage (17% of respondents), and household cleaning (41% of respondents). However, there was minimal change in latrine use and child feces management practices as a result of the pandemic.

Methods: 149 patients with NMOSD who were under medications were monitored for confirmed cases of COVID-19. Prevalence of COVID-19 in addition to mean age, mean duration of disease, and mean age of onset of infected patients and uninfected patients were calculated via Microsoft Excel software. Results: The prevalence of COVID-19 in studied patients with NMOSD was 5.37%. Mean age, mean duration of disease, and mean age of onset of eight patients (male to female ratio: 1:3) diagnosed with COVID-19 were 33.62 +/- 5.20 years, 6.87 +/- 6.05 years, and 26.75 +/- 6.94 years, respectively, while they were 39.97 +/- 11.37 years, 7.50 +/- 3.91 years, and 32.46 +/- 11.29 years for uninfected patients with NMOSD (n = 141).

Subgroup analyses were conducted according to disease severity, and the country of residence. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effects models. Results A total of 34 eligible studies were identified. In patients with severe/fatal Covid-19, the most prevalent chronic comorbidity was obesity (42%, 95CI 34-49%) and hypertension (40%, 95%CI 35-45%), followed by diabetes (17%, 95%CI 15-20%), cardiovascular disease (13%, 95%CI 11-15%), respiratory disease (8%, 95%CI 6-10%), cerebrovascular disease (6%, 95%CI 4-8%), malignancy (4%, 95% CI 3-6%), kidney disease (3%, 95%CI 2-4%), and liver disease (2%, 95%CI 1-3%). In order of the prediction, the pooled ORs of the chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignancy, diabetes, and obesity in patients with severe or fatal Covid-19 were (OR 3.56, 95%CI 2.87-4.41), (OR 3.17, 95%CI 2.46-4.08), (OR 3.13, 95%CI 2.65-3.70), (OR 3.02, 95%CI 2.23-4.08), (OR 2.74, 95%CI 1.59-4.74), (OR 2.73, 95%CI 1.73-4.21), (OR 2.63, 95%CI 2.08-3.33), and (OR 1.72, 95%CI 1.04-2.85), respectively, compared with patients with non-severe/fatal Covid-19.

Multiple therapeutic options, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZI), were tried initially to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 and high-risk patients in LTCFs, but they were abandoned due to unfavorable reports. As a less toxic option, we initiated treatment with doxycycline (DOXY) very early in the course of illness. DOXY has antiviral, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the efficacy of early intervention with DOXY in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCFs is unknown. Objective The goal of this retrospective study is to describe the clinical outcomes of high-risk COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms in LTCFs after early intervention with DOXY. Design Case-series analysis Setting LTCFs in New York Participants This observational study examines 89 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 18 to May 13, 2020. Exposure All patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 received DOXY and regular standard of care within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. Additionally, four patients received meropenem, three patients received Zosyn, two patients received linezolid, and two patients received Bactrim DS. Four patients were on chronic ventilator support. No patients received any steroids or any other antiviral or immunomodulatory agents. The majority of the patients received zinc and calcium supplements as well. Main outcomes and measures Assessed measures were patients characteristics, fever, shortness of breath (SOB), cough, oxygen saturation/pulse oximetry (POX), radiologic improvements, laboratory tests, DOXY side effects, hospital transfers, and death. Results Eighty-nine (89) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, SOB, and hypoxia and were diagnosed with COVID-19, were treated with DOXY (100 mg PO or intravenous (IV) for seven days) and regular standard of care. Eighty-five percent (85%) of patients (n=76) demonstrated clinical recovery that is defined as resolution of fever (average 3.7 days, Coeff = -0.96, p = 0.0001), resolution of SOB (average 4.2 days), and improvement of POX: average 84% before treatment and average 95% after treatment (84.7  7% vs. 95  2.6%, p = 0.0001). Higher pre- and post-treatment POX is associated with lower mortality (oxygen saturation (Spo2) vs. Death, Coeff = -0.01, p = 0.023; post-Spo2 vs. Death, Coeff = -0.05, p = 0.0002).

Specifically, it is unclear whether anesthesia primarily disrupts thalamocortical relay or intercortical signaling. Here we recorded intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG), local field potentials (LFPs), and single-unit activity in patients during wakefulness and light anesthesia. Propofol infusion was gradually increased while auditory stimuli were presented and patients responded to a target stimulus until they became unresponsive. We found widespread iEEG responses in association cortices during wakefulness, which were attenuated and restricted to auditory regions upon LOC. Neuronal spiking and LFP responses in primary auditory cortex (PAC) persisted after LOC, while responses in higher-order auditory regions were variable, with neuronal spiking largely attenuated. Gamma power induced by word stimuli increased after LOC while its frequency profile slowed, thus differing from local spiking activity. In summary, anesthesia-induced LOC disrupts auditory processing in association cortices while relatively sparing responses in PAC, opening new avenues for future research into mechanisms of LOC and the design of anesthetic monitoring devices.","output":"Anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness disrupts auditory responses beyond primary cortex."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Research conduction in emergency settings is of paramount importance to promote knowledge and experiences related to treating acutely ill patients. However, the complexity of situations creates a considerable ethical challenge facing researchers who basically deal with emergent cases. This study aimed to determine attitudes of healthcare providers (HCPs) towards exception from informed consent (EFIC) and enrollment willingness in emergency research in Jordan. METHODS: A quantitative research with face-to-face questionnaire was conducted by an interviewer during 6-month period in 2019. Survey measures included items related to EFIC policy and overall willingness of HCPs to participate or support their family members participation in emergency research. RESULTS: A total of 151 HCPs in the emergency departments (EDs) in Jordan was recruited. Positive attitude toward emergency research dominated among participants; about 21.9% of participants reported previous experience in the conduction of emergency research and 12.3% had related publications. Regarding EFIC policy, there was a general consensus of disagreement to most of the examined items. There was a trend for little support of EFIC policy when questioned about the enrollment of family members or public in emergency research, however, the application of EFIC was accepted for self-enrollment of respondents in emergency research. No significant differences (P = 0.37), among participants from different disciplines, were reported regarding the attitudes towards EFIC items or willingness to enroll in emergency research. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, HCPs reported an overall positive support to emergency research despite a consensus of disagreement related to EFIC terms. Therefore, it is recommended to pursue future studies to compare well-informed subjects; recruited from well-developed institutions in regard to emergency research potentials; with the present basic attitudinal surveillance in order to dissipate the effect of such confounder and to get better insight of the actual attitudes related to emergency research and EFIC. In addition, efficient multidisciplinary communication channels between researchers and policy makers can lather the way to collaborative research with simultaneous innovative delivery of quality emergency care.","output":"Exception from informed consent for biomedical research in emergency settings: A study from Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Viral entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) via the spike protein enables endocytosis into host cells using the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2. The frequent upper respiratory tract symptoms of COVID-19 and the localization of the virus to the nasopharynx, the most common site of swabbing, indicate that the sinonasal mucosa may play an important role in SARS-CoV2 infection and viral replication. Methods: This paper investigates the presence of ACE2 receptor and TMPRESS2 expression in the primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) from the following: chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and control (non-CRS) patients, and maps the expression changes when exposed to Th1, Th2, Th17-associated cytokines. Results: We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was higher in control HNECs than CRSwNP HNECs, and that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were downregulated further by Th2 cytokines in CRSwNP HNECs. Conclusions: This indicates an immune dysregulated state of CRSwNP mucosa, which normally contributes to a chronic inflammatory state, and might support an altered susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection and transmission.","output":"Cytokine-Induced Modulation of SARS-CoV2 Receptor Expression in Primary Human Nasal Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 82 papers The topics discussed include: artificial neural network techniques to distinguish children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder from psychometric data;multi-domain network performance analysis for vehicle tracking in aerial video;COVID-19 transmission during a tsunami evacuation in a lockdown city;data lake architecture proposal for the analysis directorate of a regional university;heuristic function to solve the generalized covering TSP with artificial intelligence search;game-based learning for the appropriation of discrete mathematics concepts: 'hanged on the Moodle platform';fostering engagement and creativity through programming: the beauty and joy of computing in a first-year engineering class;and development effort estimation practices in small software companies: an exploratory study","output":"2020 39th International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society, SCCC 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of clinical pharmacological concepts and therapeutic standards in intensive care settings presents particularly difficult problems due to the lack of adequately controlled background information and the highly variable and rapidly evolving clinical conditions where drugs must be administered and their impact evaluated. In this review, an attempt has been made to discuss the available knowledge within the framework of a problem-oriented approach, which appears to provide a more clinically useful insight than a drug-centred review. Following a brief discussion of the scanty data and the most interesting models to which reference can be made from a pharmacokinetic point of view (the burn patient being taken as an example), the review concentrates on the main general intervention strategies in intensive care patients. These are based mainly on non-pharmacological measures (correction of fluid and electrolyte balance, total parenteral nutrition, enterai nutrition, oxygenation and ventilatory management) and are discussed with respect to the specific challenge they present in various clinical conditions and organ failure situations. In addition, 4 major selected clinical conditions where general management criteria and careful use of prophylactic and therapeutic drug treatments must interact to cope with the variety of presentations and problems are reviewed. These include: acute cerebral damage; anti-infective prophylaxis and therapy; cardiovascular emergencies; and problems of haemostasis. Each problem is analysed in such a way as to frame the pharmacological intervention in its broader context of the underlying (established or hypothesised) pathophysiology, with special attention being paid to those methodological issues which allow an appreciation of the degree of reliability of the data and the recommendations which appear to be practiced (often haphazardly) in intensive care units. The thorough review of the published literature provided (up to mid-1986) clearly shows that in this field the quality of randomised controlled and epidemiological studies is rather unsatisfactory.

It has reached wide acceptance as a tool to aid chemical safety assessment and regulatory toxicology by supporting a systematic way of predicting adverse health outcomes based on accumulated mechanistic knowledge. A major challenge for broader application of the AOP concept in regulatory toxicology, however, has been developing robust AOPs to a level where they are peer reviewed and accepted. This is because the amount of work required to substantiate the modular units of a complete AOP is considerable, to the point where it can take years from start to finish. To help alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a more pragmatic approach to AOP development whereby the focus becomes on smaller blocks. First, we argue that the key event relationship (KER) should be formally recognized as the core building block of knowledge assembly within the AOP knowledge base (AOP-KB), albeit framing them within full AOPs to ensure regulatory utility. Second, we argue that KERs should be developed using systematic review approaches, but only in cases where the underlying concept does not build on what is considered canonical knowledge. In cases where knowledge is considered canonical, rigorous systematic review approaches should not be required. It is our hope that these approaches will contribute to increasing the pace at which the AOP-KB is populated with AOPs with utility for chemical safety assessors and regulators.","output":"A Pragmatic Approach to Adverse Outcome Pathway Development and Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunotherapy, as a powerful strategy for cancer treatment, has achieved tremendous efficacy in clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present the development process and preliminary acceptability of altering in-person onboarding procedures into internet-based, remote procedures for a mobile health (mHealth) intervention in a population with limited digital literacy. METHODS: We actively recruited safety-net patients (English- and Spanish-speaking adults with diabetes and depression who were receiving care at a public health care delivery system in San Francisco, United States) into a randomized controlled trial of text messaging support for physical activity. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified the in-person recruitment and onboarding procedures to internet-based, remote processes with human support. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of how the composition of the recruited cohort might have changed from the preCCOVID-19 period to the COVID-19 enrollment period. First, we analyzed the digital profiles of patients (n=32) who had participated in previous in-person onboarding sessions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we documented all changes made to our onboarding processes to account for remote recruitment, especially those needed to support patients who were not very familiar with downloading apps onto their mobile phones on their own. Finally, we used the new study procedures to recruit patients (n=11) during the COVID-19 social distancing period. These patients were also asked about their experience enrolling into a fully digitized mHealth intervention. RESULTS: Recruitment across both preCCOVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (N=43) demonstrated relatively high rates of smartphone ownership but lower self-reported digital literacy, with 32.6% (14/43) of all patients reporting they needed help with using their smartphone and installing apps. Significant changes were made to the onboarding procedures, including facilitating app download via Zoom video call and/or a standard phone call and implementing brief, one-on-one staff-patient interactions to provide technical assistance personalized to each patients digital literacy skills. Comparing recruitment during preCCOVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, the proportion of patients with digital literacy barriers reduced from 34.4% (11/32) in the preCCOVID-19 cohort to 27.3% (3/11) in the COVID-19 cohort. Differences in digital literacy scores between both cohorts were not significant (P=.49). CONCLUSIONS: Patients of lower socioeconomic status have high interest in using digital platforms to manage their health, but they may require additional upfront human support to gain access. One-on-one staff-patient partnerships allowed us to provide unique technical assistance personalized to each patients digital literacy skills, with simple strategies to troubleshoot patient barriers upfront. These additional remote onboarding strategies can mitigate but not eliminate digital barriers for patients without extensive technology experience.

After 2 years of living with COVID\\\\19, it is important to examine the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on healthcare resources, access to HIV services and availability of support structures, to assess their impact on HIV care for ALHIV. DISCUSSION: The COVID\\\\19 response in South Africa has shifted healthcare resources towards combatting COVID\\\\19, affecting the quality and availability of HIV servicesespecially for vulnerable populations, such as ALHIV. The healthcare system's response to COVID\\\\19 has threatened to diminish fragile gains in engaging ALHIV with HIV services, especially as this group relies on overburdened public health facilities for their HIV care. Reallocation of limited health resources utilized by ALHIV disrupted healthcare workers capacity to form and maintain therapeutic relationships with ALHIV and monitor ALHIV for ART\\\\related side effects, treatment difficulties and mental health conditions, affecting their ability to retain ALHIV in HIV care. Prevailing declines in HIV surveillance meant missed opportunities to identify and manage opportunistic infections and HIV disease progression in adolescents. Lockdown restrictions have limited access to healthcare facilities and healthcare workers for ALHIV by reducing clinic appointments and limiting individual movement. ALHIV have had restricted access to social, psychological and educational support structures, including national feeding schemes. This limited access, coupled with reduced opportunities for routine maternal and sexual and reproductive health services, may place adolescent girls at greater risk of transactional sex, child marriages, unintended pregnancy and mother\\\\to\\\\child HIV transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent HIV care in South Africa is often overlooked; however, ART adherence among ALHIV in South Africa is particularly susceptible to the consequences of a world transformed by COVID\\\\19. The current structures in place to support HIV testing, ART initiation and adherence have been reshaped by disruptions to health structures, new barriers to access health services and the limited available education and psychosocial support systems. Reflecting on these limitations can drive considerations for minimizing these barriers and retaining ALHIV in HIV care.","output":"Two years after lockdown: reviewing the effects of COVID\\\\19 on health services and support for adolescents living with HIV in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionIn the early parts of the COVID-19 pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented worldwide, including in sub-Saharan Africa, to prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This mixed-methods study examines adherence to and enforcement of NPIs implemented to curb COVID-19 in Nigeria, Rwanda, and Zambia, leading up to the 10,000th case of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in each country. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the relationship between levels and changes of NPIs over time and changes in COVID-19 cases and deaths. MethodsThis mixed-methods analysis utilized semi-structured interviews and a quantitative dataset constructed using multiple open data sources, including the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. To understand potential barriers and facilitators in implementing and enforcing NPIs qualitative data were collected from those involved in the COVID-19 response and analyzed using NVivo. Quantitative results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, plots, ANOVA, and post hoc Tukey. ResultsIndividual indicator scores varied with the COVID-19 response in all three countries. Nigeria had sustained levels of strict measures for containment and closure NPIs, while in Rwanda there was substantial variation in NPI score as it transitioned through the different case windows for the same measures. Zambia implemented moderate stringency throughout the pandemic using gathering restrictions and business/school closure measures but maintained low levels of strictness for other containment and closure measures. Rwanda had far more consistent and stringent measures compared to Nigeria and Zambia. Rwandas success in implementing COVID-related measures was partly due to strong enforcement and having a population that generally obeys its government. ConclusionVarious forces either facilitated or hindered adherence and compliance to COVID-19 control measures.

These pathways rely on protein ubiquitination for their activation, and one outcome is the modification of proteins with the ubiquitin (Ub)-like modifier interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)15. CCHFV and related viruses encode a deubiquitinase (DUB) of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family, which unlike eukaryotic OTU DUBs also targets ISG15 modifications. Here we characterized the viral OTU domain of CCHFV (vOTU) biochemically and structurally, revealing that it hydrolyzes four out of six tested Ub linkages, but lacks activity against linear and K29-linked Ub chains. vOTU cleaved Ub and ISG15 with similar kinetics, and we were able to understand vOTU cross-reactivity at the molecular level from crystal structures of vOTU in complex with Ub and ISG15. An N-terminal extension in vOTU not present in eukaryotic OTU binds to the hydrophobic Ile44 patch of Ub, which results in a dramatically different Ub orientation compared to a eukaryotic OTU-Ub complex. The C-terminal Ub-like fold of ISG15 (ISG15-C) adopts an equivalent binding orientation. Interestingly, ISG15-C contains an additional second hydrophobic surface that is specifically contacted by vOTU. These subtle differences in Ub/ISG15 binding allowed the design of vOTU variants specific for either Ub or ISG15, which will be useful tools to understand the relative contribution of ubiquitination vs. ISGylation in viral infection. Furthermore, the crystal structures will allow structure-based design of antiviral agents targeting this enzyme.","output":"Molecular basis for ubiquitin and ISG15 cross-reactivity in viral ovarian tumor domains."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stochastic elasticity of variance model introduced by Kim et al.

The pipeline was also evaluated in silico for sequence coverage in comparison to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) influenza A and B diagnostic assays. The influenza FEVER probe design had a higher tolerance for mismatched bases than the CDCs probes, and the FEVER probes altogether had a higher detection rate for influenza isolate sequences from GenBank.

Methods: Clinical patient data were retrospectively analyzed at two medical centers. One center with 126 patients was used to develop the model. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was used to select the optimal variables. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify independent prognostic factors and construct a nomogram based on the selected variables.

Receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curve (1,000 bootstrap resamples) were generated for internal validation, while another center with 84 patients was used to validate the model externally. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves (CICs) were used to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. Results: Unfavorable prognosis was observed in 46 (37%) patients in the training cohort and 24 (29%) patients in the external validation cohort. The independent prognostic factors of the nomogram, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p = 0.005), World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) grade (p = 0.002), and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) (p = 0.0003), were identified using LASSO and multivariable logistic regression.

During teleconsultation, the following tests can be carried out: oculomotricity evaluation, assessment of balance, simple neurological tests, checking for positional vertigo/nystagmus and, eventually to perform canalith-repositioning procedures. In children, the following should be searched for: history of hearing or visual impairment, a context of fever or trauma, otorrhea, signs of meningeal irritation. CONCLUSION: The neurotologic telemedicine relies on the accuracy of the clinical assessment, which is based on history taking and a few simple tests, encouraging the development of a decision-making algorithm adapted for teleconsultation. However, the latter has its limitations during an emergency examination of a new patient presenting vertigo, and, at least in some cases, cannot replace a face-to-face consultation. Teleconsultation is often adapted for follow-up consultations of previously selected vertiginous patients during face-to-face assessment.","output":"Guidelines of the French Society of Otorhinolaryngology (SFORL) for teleconsultation in patients with vertigo during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus capable of causing severe disease and death. The Alinity-m has a high throughput and random-access features that are not on the Abbott m2000, both of which had been validated and brought into clinical use for high throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing. The additional features of Alinity-m would be expected to improve turnaround time; however, there are no published reports in the English literature comparing the turnaround time between the Abbott m2000 and Alinity-m. METHODS/CASE REPORT: A retrospective quality assurance search for all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed on the Abbott m2000 and Alinity-m (both Chicago IL) between February 1(st) 2021 to March 1st, 2021, to capture the turnaround time differences for the Abbott m2000 versus the Alinity-m for the month after the Alinity-m was brought into clinical service after validation. RESULTS (IF A CASE STUDY ENTER NA): There was a total of 318 tests performed on the Abbott m2000 and 1329 tests performed on the Alinity-m during this time period. The average turnaround time on the Alinity was 6 hours, compared with 11 hours on the Abbott m2000. This difference was statistically significant by the t-test (p-value = <0.01). Both the optimized throughput and random-access features of the Alinity-m contributed significantly to this improvement. The Alinity-m is capable of producing results within 115 minutes for the first specimen and then 3 minutes for each sequential specimen. On the other hand, the Abbott m2000 must be batched in limited 8-12 hour runs without random access capability. All the results were reported and communicated to the clinical teams, so the timely patient management can be administrated and surveillance of the same can be done in real time. CONCLUSION: Alinity M has a significant advantage for a random access as well as improved TAT for detection of SARS-CoV-2, leading to prompt patient care and management.","output":"Comparison of Abbott COVID-19 testing Platforms for timely results- CMCVAMC experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), which started from Wuhan, China, in late 2019, have spread worldwide. A total of 5,91,971 cases and 2,70,90 deaths were registered till 28th March, 2020. We aimed to predict the impact of duration of exposure to COVID-19 on the mortality rates increment. METHODS: In the present study, data on COVID-19 infected top seven countries viz., Germany, China, France, United Kingdom, Iran, Italy and Spain, and World as a whole, were used for modeling. The analytical procedure of generalized linear model followed by Gompertz link function was used to predict the impact lethal duration of exposure on the mortality rates. FINDINGS: Of the selected countries and World as whole, the projection based on 21st March, 2020 cases, suggest that a total (95% Cl) of 76 (65-151) days of exposure in Germany, mortality rate will increase by 5 times to 1%. In countries like France and United Kingdom, our projection suggests that additional exposure of 48 days and 7 days, respectively, will raise the mortality rates to10%. Regarding Iran, Italy and Spain, mortality rate will rise to 10% with an additional 3-10 days of exposure. World's mortality rates will continue increase by 1% in every three weeks. The predicted interval of lethal duration corresponding to each country has found to be consistent with the mortality rates observed on 28th March, 2020. CONCLUSION: The prediction of lethal duration was found to have apparently effective in predicting mortality, and shows concordance with prevailing rates.

However, hemorrhagic complications occur frequently during ECMO support, and this has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Thus, this study aimed to identify the risk factors for hemorrhage in patients receiving ECMO. Methods: Our retrospective study included 60 patients, who were admitted to the Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, China from February 2017 to October 2020. About 18 patients developed hemorrhagic complications, and 42 patients did not demonstrate such complications. Data regarding patient demography, laboratory tests, and clinical manifestations prior to ECMO were collected to analyze their clinical features. Univariable and multivariable logistic analyses were used to explore the risk factors for hemorrhage in adults on ECMO. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of the binary logistic model. The amount of blood transfusions was compared between the two groups, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet count, and hemoglobin level before the initiation of ECMO. Results: Logistic analysis showed that a longer duration of ECMO support, higher APTT, and lower platelet count prior to ECMO were independent risk factors for hemorrhage in adults on ECMO. In addition, we found that the cannula site was the most common bleeding site. Most bleeding events occurred within the first 3 days of ECMO therapy. After the ECMO initiation, APTT was prolonged while the platelet count and hemoglobin levels were decreased. The amount of blood transfusion was significantly higher in the hemorrhage group than in the non-hemorrhage group. Conclusions: Clinicians should evaluate the risk of hemorrhage based on the coagulation function of patients, underlying disease, and the duration of ECMO support. In the first 3 days during ECMO support, special attention should be given to the cannula site, mucosal, and dermal regions, and digestive tract to detect any signs of hemorrhage. Moreover, increasing the platelet count transfusion threshold and accurately determining the amount of blood transfusion required may prevent bleeding events.","output":"Clinical Features and Risk Factors Analysis for Hemorrhage in Adults on ECMO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To provide a unique global view of the relative potential for evasion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells by SARS-CoV-2 lineages as they evolve over time, we performed a comprehensive analysis of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II binding peptides in spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein sequences of all available SARS-CoV-2 genomes as provided by NIH NCBI at a bi-monthly interval between March and December of 2021. A data supplement of all B.1.1.529 (Omicron) genomes from GISAID in early December was also used to capture the rapidly spreading variant. A key finding is that throughout continued viral evolution and increasing rates of mutations occurring at T-cell epitope hotspots, protein instances with worst case binding loss did not become the most frequent for any Variant of Concern (VOC) or Variant of Interest (VOI) lineage; suggesting T-cell evasion is not likely to be a dominant evolutionary pressure on SARS-CoV-2. We also determined that throughout the course of the pandemic in 2021, there remained a relatively steady ratio of viral variants that exhibit conservation of epitopes in the N protein, despite significant potential for epitope loss in S relative to other lineages. We further localized conserved regions in N with high epitope yield potential, and illustrated HLA-I binding heterogeneity across the S protein consistent with empirical observations. Although Omicrons high volume of mutations caused it to exhibit more epitope loss potential than most frequently observed versions of proteins in almost all other VOCs, epitope candidates across its most frequent N proteins were still largely conserved. This analysis adds to the body of evidence suggesting that N may have merit as an additional antigen to elicit immune responses to vaccination with increased potential to provide sustained protection against COVID-19 disease in the face of emerging variants.","output":"Peptidome Surveillance Across Evolving SARS-CoV-2 Lineages Reveals HLA Binding Conservation in Nucleocapsid Among Variants With Most Potential for T-Cell Epitope Loss In Spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to escalate at a rapid pace inundating medical facilities and creating substantial challenges globally. The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with cancer seems to be higher, especially as they are more likely to present with an immunocompromised condition, either from cancer itself or from the treatments they receive. A major consideration in the delivery of cancer care during the pandemic is to balance the risk of patient exposure and infection with the need to provide effective cancer treatment. Many aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection currently remain poorly characterized and even less is known about the course of infection in the context of a patient with cancer. As SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, the risk of infection directly affects the cancer patient being treated, other cancer patients in close proximity, and health care providers. Infection at any level for patients or providers can cause considerable disruption to even the most effective treatment plans. Lung cancer patients, especially those with reduced lung function and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are more likely to have increased risk and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 as one of its common manifestations is as an acute respiratory illness.

However, the CD4+ T cell population critical for antibody response in COVID-19 is poorly understood.METHODSIn this study, we provided a comprehensive analysis of peripheral CD4+ T cells from 13 COVID-19 convalescent patients, defined as confirmed free of SARS-CoV-2 for 2 to 4 weeks, using flow cytometry and magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme antibody immunoassay. The data were correlated with clinical characteristics.RESULTSWe observed that, relative to healthy individuals, convalescent patients displayed an altered peripheral CD4+ T cell spectrum. Specifically, consistent with other viral infections, cTfh1 cells associated with SARS-CoV-2-targeting antibodies were found in COVID-19 covalescent patients. Individuals with severe disease showed higher frequencies of Tem and Tfh-em cells but lower frequencies of Tcm, Tfh-cm, Tfr, and Tnaive cells, compared with healthy individuals and patients with mild and moderate disease. Interestingly, a higher frequency of cTfh-em cells correlated with a lower blood oxygen level, recorded at the time of admission, in convalescent patients. These observations might constitute residual effects by which COVID-19 can impact the homeostasis of CD4+ T cells in the long-term and explain the highest ratio of class-switched virus-specific antibody producing individuals found in our severe COVID-19 cohort.CONCLUSIONOur study demonstrated a close connection between CD4+ T cells and antibody production in COVID-19 convalescent patients.FUNDINGSix Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC).","output":"Peripheral CD4+ T cell subsets and antibody response in COVID-19 convalescent individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.

Specimens were tested by RT-PCR for influenza A and RSV and viral load determined. They were also tested by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) for influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza types 1-3 and adenovirus. RESULTS Both NPA and NPFS had excellent sensitivity (100%) for detecting influenza A by RT-PCR but NPA was slightly more sensitive than NPFS for detecting RSV by both RT-PCR (100% vs. 92.3%) and DIF (87.2% vs. 84.6%) and for detecting influenza A by DIF (90.2% vs. 82.9%). Viral load for influenza A in NPA and NPFS was not significantly different but that for RSV was higher in NPA.

Although mental health problems have been reported in this population, it is important to study resilience, in order to identify its strengths. The purpose was to study resilience in Mexican nurses and the mental health and sociodemographic factors associated with it. A crosssectional study was used. Method: A sociodemographic and COVID-19 related questionnaire, the Resilience Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire-28, was sent via online. 556 nurses were included, the majority were women (80%), single (60.8%), aged between 26-35 years (38.3%). Results: Lower resilience was found among nurses who were younger (p<0.001, ?2=0.05), single (p<0.001, ?2=0.02) and with lower levels of education (p=0.001, ?2=0.02). Predictors of resilience included the search for mental health information ( =-0.152, p <0.001), higher education ( = 0.142, p<0.001), low levels of depression (=-0.307, p<0.001) and low levels of social dysfunction ( =-0.261, p<0.001).

METHODS: During the COVID-19 period, patients in need of emergency brain surgery in our institution were managed using a novel standardized pathway designed for COVID-19 screening. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who were hospitalized through the emergency room and underwent emergency brain surgery. A total of 32 patients who underwent emergency brain surgery from February 1 to June 30, 2020 were included in the COVID-19 group, and 65 patients who underwent surgery from February 1 to June 30, 2019 were included in the pre-COVID-19 group. The baseline characteristics, disease severity indicators, time intervals of emergency processes, and clinical outcomes of the two groups were compared. Subgroup analysis was performed between the immediate surgery group and the semi-elective surgery group during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and severity indicators between the pre-COVID-19 group and COVID-19 group. The time interval to skin incision was significantly increased in the COVID-19 group (P = 0.027). However, there were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the two groups. In subgroup comparison, the time interval to skin incision was shorter in the immediate surgery group during the COVID-19 period compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (P = 0.040). The screening process did not significantly increase the time interval to classification and admission for immediate surgery. The time interval to surgery initiation was longer in the COVID-19 period due to the increased time interval in the semi-elective surgery group (P < 0.001).

Although carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaques are well-acknowledged independent predictors of CVD risk, normative and cut-off values are difficult to define due to the heterogeneous measurements reported in previous studies. Plaque properties, including location, number, density, and size, become more important risk predictors for cardiovascular disease, but a better approach for clinical use needs to be further established. Three-dimensional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound are promising for promoting risk stratification with more details on plaque morphology. Moreover, inflammatory diseases and biomarkers should be evaluated for a full assessment of the inflammatory burden for atherosclerosis.

These steps need to be taken to buy the time for the pharmaceutical to make the vaccine. A diagnosis of gold standard is nucleic acid testing and RT-PCR detection from viral RNA, which becomes quite challenging because of the laboratory testing quality and its availability. To combat this disease, there is a dire need of an alternative diagnostic method. Study of radio-graphic computed tomography images of COVID-19 gives the idea that deep learning methods can be implemented to extract specific features of COVID-19 aiding the clinical diagnosis. For this matter, a major part of data scientists and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers formed methods for screening of COVID-19 by AI means. These AI solutions related to the screening of COVID-19 will be discussed in this chapter. In addition, we propose a deep neural network which is trained on the X-ray images of the COVID-19 patients and normal X-ray images for the detection of COVID-19. Our method achieved validation accuracy of 0.95 which is quite promising accuracy for the classification of COVID-19 patients from the healthy ones.","output":"Detection and screening of COVID-19 through chest computed tomography radiographs using deep neural networks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. In April 2009, an elementary school outbreak of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza was reported in a community in northern British Columbia, Canada-an area that includes both non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal residents living on or off a reserve. During the outbreak investigation, we explored the relationship between prior receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and pH1N1-related illness. Methods. A telephone survey was conducted from 15 May through 5 June 2009 among households of children attending any school in the affected community. Members of participating households where influenza-like illness (ILI) was described were then invited to submit blood samples for confirmation of pH1N1 infection by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. Circulation of pH1N1 was concentrated among households of the elementary school and elsewhere on-reserve to which analyses of TIV effect were thus restricted. Odds ratios (ORs) for the TIV effect on ILI were computed through logistic regression, with adjustment for age, comorbidity, household density, and Aboriginal status. The influence of within-household clustering was assessed through generalized-linear-mixed models. Results. Of 408 participants, 92 (23%) met ILI criteria: 29 (32%) of 92 persons with ILI, compared with 61 (19%) 316 persons without ILI, had received the 2008C2009 formulation of TIV. Fully adjusted ORs for 2008- 2009 TIV effect on ILI were 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.34C4.48) by logistic regression and 2.68 [95% confidence interval, 1.37C5.25) by generalized-linear-mixed model. Conclusions. An outbreak investigation in British Columbia during the late spring of 2009 provided the first indication of an unexpected association between receipt of TIV and pH1N1 illness. This led to 5 additional studies through the summer 2009 in Canada, each of which corroborated these initial findings.","output":"Seasonal Influenza Vaccine and Increased Risk of Pandemic A/H1N1-Related Illness: First Detection of the Association in British Columbia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness, positive affect, and compassion may protect against psychological distress but there is lack of understanding about the ways in which these factors are linked to mental health. Network analysis is a statistical method used to investigate complex associations among constructs in a single network and is particularly suitable for this purpose. The aim of this study was to explore how mindfulness facets, affect, and compassion were linked to psychological distress using network analysis. METHODS: The sample (n = 400) included equal numbers from general and student populations who completed measures of five mindfulness facets, compassion, positive and negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Network analysis was used to explore the direct associations between these variables. RESULTS: Compassion was directly related to positive affect, which in turn was strongly and inversely related to depression and positively related to the observing and describing facets of mindfulness. The non-judgment facet of mindfulness was strongly and inversely related to negative affect, anxiety, and depression, while non-reactivity and acting with awareness were inversely associated with stress and anxiety, respectively. Strong associations were found between all distress variables. CONCLUSIONS: The present network analysis highlights the strong link between compassion and positive affect and suggests that observing and describing the world through the lens of compassion may enhance resilience to depression. Taking a non-judging and non-reacting stance toward internal experience while acting with awareness may protect against psychological distress. Applicability of these findings can be examined in experimental studies aiming to prevent distress and enhance psychological well-being.","output":"Network Analysis of Mindfulness Facets, Affect, Compassion, and Distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From leadership to the front\\\\line our skilled nursing organization leveraged the expertise of all professionals in our various disciplines.

Recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of its supplementation in the metabolic profile. Food sources have also been studied for complementary therapies. However, information on the bioavailability of food sources of melatonin is still scarce. Thus, the objective of this review is to gather in the literature studies that evaluate the relationship between food consumption and improvements in circulating melatonin in humans. In total, 178 studies were found, of which 11 were included in this review. The results show increases in the excretion of the melatonin metabolite (6?sulfatoxymelatonin) or circulating melatonin for foods such as cherries, grapes, bananas, pineapples, dark green vegetables, Japanese vegetables and beer. Significant increases in melatonin were observed even after ingesting cultivars with low concentrations of this hormone. It was possible to assume that other nutrients that precede their synthesis (serotonin and tryptophan) could also have led to this increase. Although consumption of the foods found is beneficial in increasing circulating melatonin, further confirmatory studies are needed.","output":"Relationship between food consumption and improvements in circulating melatonin in humans: an integrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Panax Ginseng C.A. Meyer (PGCAM) is a well-known phytomedicine, but most of its compounds, such as ginsenoside derivatives, have poor absorption and bioavailability profile due to high molecular weight (500 Daltons), which is the major hurdle for their clinical application. Hence, this research explored the efficiency of low molecular weight compounds (LMWCs) (<500 Daltons) screened from PGCAM and their anti-COVID-19 mechanisms through network pharmacology. Molecular compounds from PGCAM were identified using public databases and filtered out by the drug-likeness evaluation. Genes interacted with these filtered compounds, and COVID-19-related genes were extracted from public databases. In addition, overlapping genes between compounds and interactive genes were identified using the Venn diagram. In parallel, the networking between compounds and overlapping genes was analyzed by RStudio. The pathway enrichment analysis of overlapping genes was determined by STRING. Finally, the key bioactive compounds were documented through virtual screening. The bubble chart suggested that the mechanisms of PGCAM against COVID-19 were related to 28 signaling pathways. The key molecular anti-COVID-19 mechanisms might be the anti-inflammation, anti-permeability, and pro-apoptosis by inactivating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The six key genes and the five compounds related to the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were RELA-paeonol, NFKB1-frutinone A, IL6-nepetin, MCL1-ramalic acid, VEGFA-trifolirhizin, and IL2-trifolirhizin. The docking between these key genes and compounds demonstrated promising binding affinity with a good binding score. Overall, our proposed LMWCs from PGCAM provide a fundamental basis with noteworthy pharmacological evidence to support the therapeutic efficacy of PGCAM in relieving the main symptoms of COVID-19.","output":"The Promising Mechanisms of Low Molecular Weight Compounds of Panax Ginseng C.A.

This pandemic has affected every segment of the population with more recent hospitalizations in the pediatric population. Vertical transmission of COVID-19 is uncommon, but reports show that there are thrombotic, vascular, and inflammatory changes in the placenta to which neonates are prenatally exposed. Individuals exposed in utero to influenza during the 1918 pandemic had increased risk for heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, stomach disease and hypertension. Early exposure of COVID-19 during fetal life may lead to altered gene expression with potential long-term consequences. Objective To determine if gene expression is altered in cord blood cells from term neonates who were exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy and to identify potential gene pathways impacted by maternal COVID-19. Methods Cord blood was collected from 16 term neonates (8 exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy and 8 controls without exposure to COVID-19). Genome-wide gene expression screening was performed using Human Clariom S gene chips on total RNA extracted from cord blood cells. Results We identified 510 differentially expressed genes (374 genes up-regulated, 136 genes down-regulated, fold change 1.5, p-value  0.05) in cord blood cells associated with exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified important canonical pathways associated with diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hematological disease, embryonic cancer and cellular development. Tox functions related to cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were also altered after exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy. Conclusions Exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy induces differential gene expression in cord blood cells. The differentially expressed genes may potentially contribute to cardiac, hepatic, renal and immunological disorders in offspring exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy.

The search was limited to the studies that reported the data on the number of COVID-19 positive healthcare workers, among the COVID-19 positive patients. Case reports, duplicate publications, reviews, and family-based studies were excluded. The methodological quality of studies was assessed by the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) tool. RESULTS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we pooled eleven studies to investigate the above factors. The overall proportion of HCW who were SARS-CoV-2 positive among all COVID-19 patients was 10.1% (95%CI: 5.3-14.9). This proportion varied according to the country of study i.e. China (7 studies) - 4.2%, 95%CI:2.4-6.0; United States (3 studies) - 17.8%, 95%CI:7.5-28.0; and Italy (1 study) - 9.0%, 95%CI:8.6-9.4. The incidence of severe or critical disease in HCW (9.9%, 95%CI:0.8-18.9) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than the incidence of severe or critical disease in all COVID-19 positive patients (29.4%, 95%CI:18.6-40.2).

No data are available regarding the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during rooming-in. Objective: To evaluate the risk of postnatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected mothers to their neonates following rooming-in and breastfeeding. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective, multicenter study enrolling mother-infant dyads from March 19 to May 2, 2020, followed up for 20 days of life (range, 18-22 days), was performed. The study was conducted at 6 coronavirus disease 2019 maternity centers in Lombardy, Northern Italy. Participants included 62 neonates born to 61 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were eligible for rooming-in practice based on the clinical condition of the mother and infants whose results of nasopharyngeal swabs were negative at birth. Exposures: Mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection were encouraged to practice rooming-in and breastfeeding under a standardized protocol to minimize the risk of viral transmission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical characteristics and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 on neonatal nasopharyngeal swabs at 0, 7, and 20 days of life. Results: Of the 62 neonates enrolled (25 boys), born to 61 mothers (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 28-36 years), only 1 infant (1.6%; 95% CI, 0%-8.7%) was diagnosed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection at postbirth checks.

We evaluate our model outputs against a reconstruction of past population size based on archaeological radiocarbon dates from the island. The resulting estimated demographic declines of the Rapa Nui people are linked to the long-term effects of climate change on the island's carrying capacity and, in turn, on the 'per-capita food supply'.","output":"Ecology of the collapse of Rapa Nui society."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a case of 5 year-old female with funnel chest, by which cardiovascular structures were displaced into the left chest cavity.

Other than antigen rapid test kit (RTK) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), an alternative method to detect COVID-19 is through the examination of patients' chest radiography (CXR). However, the results of manual inspections may be false and the misdiagnosis could lead to fatal consequences such as delayed treatment and death. The manual inspection can be inconsistent, inaccurate and may differ from different individuals due to different perspectives. Often, Covid-19 Xrays are misinterpreted as bacterial pneumonia. With the advancement of technology, this issue can be overcome by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to categorize X-ray of normal, pneumonia-affected and COVID-19 patients via deep learning. In this work, various CNN models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, Vgg-16, Vgg-19 and SqueezeNet) were trained with the public databases that contain a combination of 1345 viral pneumonia, 1200 COVID-19 in addition to 1341 regular CXR images. The transfer learning method was employed, aided by image augmentation for training and validation of ResNet-50, ResNet-101, Vgg-16 and Vgg-19 architectures. Meanwhile, SqueezeNet was trained from scratch to investigate the importance of transfer learning to the model. The highest training accuracy achieved in this study was 97.38% by the VGG-16 model using a learning rate of 0.01 whereas the highest weighted average accuracy achieved was 94% by the VGG-16 model using a learning rate of 0.01 and the VGG-19 model using a learning rate of 0.001.

DIA data mining heavily relies on a spectral library that in most cases is built on DDA analysis of the same sample. Construction of this project-specific DDA library impairs the analytical throughput, limits the proteome coverage, and increases the sample size for DIA phosphoproteomics. Herein we introduce a deep neural network, DeepPhospho, which conceptually differs from previous deep learning models to achieve accurate predictions of LC-MS/MS data for phosphopeptides. By leveraging in silico libraries generated by DeepPhospho, we establish a DIA workflow for phosphoproteome profiling which involves DIA data acquisition and data mining with DeepPhospho predicted libraries, thus circumventing the need of DDA library construction. Our DeepPhospho-empowered workflow substantially expands the phosphoproteome coverage while maintaining high quantification performance, which leads to the discovery of more signaling pathways and regulated kinases in an EGF signaling study than the DDA library-based approach.

However, whether TiO(2)(C) NPs exert antibacterial properties against Bacillus anthracis remains elusive. Here, we evaluated these VLRP NPs in the reduction of anthrax-induced pathogenesis. Bacteria-killing experiments indicated that a significantly higher proportion (40%C60%) of all tested Bacillus species, including B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis, were considerably eliminated by TiO(2)(C) NPs. Toxin inactivation analysis further suggested that the TiO(2)(C) NPs efficiently detoxify approximately 90% of tested anthrax lethal toxin, a major virulence factor of anthrax. Notably, macrophage clearance experiments further suggested that, even under suboptimal conditions without considerable bacterial killing, the TiO(2)(C) NP-mediated photocatalysis still exhibited antibacterial properties through the reduction of bacterial resistance against macrophage killing. Our results collectively suggested that TiO(2)(C) NP is a conceptually feasible anti-anthrax material, and the relevant technologies described herein may be useful in the development of new strategies against anthrax.","output":"Antibacterial Properties of Visible-Light-Responsive Carbon-Containing Titanium Dioxide Photocatalytic Nanoparticles against Anthrax"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced around 50 % of employees of Switzerland into a working from home setting during March and April 2020. Working from home appears to change the work experience of office workers considerably. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the effect of the first COVID-19 lockdown on work stress conditions. METHODS: We based this longitudinal analysis on control group data from an ongoing stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. Office workers from two Swiss organizations, aged 18-65 years, were included. Baseline data from January 2020 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) were compared with follow-up data collected during the fourth and fifth week of the first lockdown (April 2020). Work stress conditions were measured using the Job-Stress-Index (JSI). The JSI indicates the ratio of work-related resources (e.g., appreciation at work) and stressors (e.g., work organisation) on a scale from 0 (stressors < resources) to 100 (stressors > resources). Paired sample t-tests were performed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Data from 75 participants were analysed. Fifty-three participants were female (70.7 %). The mean age was 42.8 years (range from 21.8 to 62.7) at baseline. At baseline, the mean JSI was 47.6 (SD = 5.0), with 77.7 (SD = 12.4) for resources and 22.3 (SD = 10.1) for stressors. At follow-up, the mean JSI was 47.4 SD = 4.5), with 77.5 (SD = 11.7) for resources and 21.4 (SD = 9.6) for stressors. We found no evidence for a difference in JSI (estimate = 0.67, 95 % CI: -0.33 to 0.66, p-value = 0.50), its index of resources (estimate = 0.23, 95 % CI: -1.32 to 1.69, p-value = 0.82) or the index of work stressors (estimate = 1.4, 95 % CI: -0.32 to 2.02, p-value = 0.15) between measurement time points. CONCLUSIONS: The first COVID-19 lockdown did not result in a difference of work stress conditions among our sample of Swiss office workers. Improved working times and work-life balance may have contributed to this finding.

The aims of this study were to evaluate whether the plasma concentration of the above-mentioned biomarkers was different 1) in survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19-related ARDS and 2) in COVID-19-related and classical ARDS. METHODS: This prospective study was performed in two COVID-19-dedicated Intensive Care Units (ICU) and one non-COVID-19 ICU at Ferrara University Hospital. A cohort of 31 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS and a cohort of 11 patients with classical ARDS were enrolled. Ang-2, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin, E-selectin and RAGE were determined with a bead-based multiplex immunoassay at three time points: inclusion in the study (T1), after 7  2 days (T2) and 14  2 days (T3). The primary outcome was to evaluate the plasma trend of the biomarker levels in survivors and non-survivors. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the differences in respiratory mechanics variables and gas exchanges between survivors and non-survivors. Furthermore, we compared the plasma levels of the biomarkers at T1 in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS and classical ARDS. RESULTS: In COVID-19-related ARDS, the plasma levels of Ang-2 and ICAM-1 at T1 were statistically higher in non-survivors than survivors, (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively), whereas those of P-selectin, E-selectin and RAGE did not differ. Ang-2 and ICAM-1 at T1 were predictors of mortality (AUROC 0.650 and 0.717, respectively). At T1, RAGE and P-selectin levels were higher in classical ARDS than in COVID-19-related ARDS. Ang-2, ICAM-1 and E-selectin were lower in classical ARDS than in COVID-19-related ARDS (all p < 0.001).

The present study evaluated changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-5 in atopic children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We recruited a total of 72 children with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 4 groups: atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group I, n=24), non-atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group II, n=23), atopic children with viral pneumonia (group III, n=13), and non-atopic children with viral pneumonia (group IV, n=12). Serum levels of IL-5, IL-13, VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor- were measured at admission and at recovery using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were elevated in group I compared with the other groups at both admission phase and clinical recovery phase. In group I, serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were higher at recovery phase than at admission phase (VEGF: 1,102.2569.4 vs. 874.9589.9 pg/mL, respectively; IL-5: 150.563.9 vs. 120.246.7 pg/mL, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased in atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia than in the other groups. In this group, the serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased at recovery phase than at admission phase. The results of this study suggest that increases in VEGF and IL-5 may contribute to the development of hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia infection.

Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry. Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis toxin antibodies were assessed by ELISA; whole blood was stimulated with whole cell pertussis and supernatants were assessed for cytokines by xMAP. RESULTS: Both groups showed a similar frequency of adverse events. There was no evidence of disease reactivation after Tdap booster in the jSLE cohort. Both groups showed a significant increase in antibody titers for all three antigens on D14 and D28 (p < 0.001). jSLE patients had a significantly lower increase in diphtheria titers than the control group (p = 0.007). jSLE patients had a distinct titer increase of tetanus and pertussis antibodies when compared to controls (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). There was a lower frequency of pertussis seroconversion in the jSLE group on D14 (p = 0.009), D28 (p = 0.023), D12m (p = 0.015) and D24m (p = 0.004).

Methods: Hospital-admitted adult inpatients with (1) either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and (2) a completed or ordered CT within the preceding 24 hours were recruited. Twelve lung zones were scanned with a handheld POCUS machine. POCUS, CT, and X-ray (CXR) images were reviewed independently by blinded experts. A simplified POCUS algorithm was developed via machine learning. Results: Of 79 enrolled subjects, 26.6% had a positive NAT and 31.6% had a CT typical for COVID-19. The receiver operator curve (ROC) for a 12-zone POCUS protocol had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.787 for positive NAT and 0.820 for typical CT. A simplified four-zone protocol had an AUC of 0.862 for typical CT and 0.862 for positive NAT. CT had an AUC of 0.815 for positive NAT; CXR had AUCs of 0.793 for positive NAT and 0.733 for typical CT. Performance of the four-zone protocol was superior to CXR for positive NAT (p=0.0471). Using a two-point cutoff system, the four-zone POCUS protocol had a sensitivity of 0.920 and 0.904 compared to CT and NAT, respectively, at the lower cutoff; it had a specificity of 0.926 and 0.948 at the higher cutoff, respectively. Conclusion: POCUS outperformed CXR to predict positive NAT. POCUS could potentially replace other chest imaging for persons under investigation for COVID-19.","output":"A Simplified Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound Protocol to Detect Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Inpatients: A Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is the most common depigmentation disorder. This disease causes disfiguration and induces psychological burdens, leading to significantly impaired quality of life. Limited research about disease-related post-traumatic stress (PTS) has been conducted in vitiligo patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence, severity, and risk factors of post-traumatic stress in vitiligo patients. METHODS: This case-control study was performed from January 2021 to April 2021. A survey questionnaire including baseline information, post-traumatic stress symptoms evaluation, life quality evaluation was conducted. According to the severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms, patients were grouped and compared. The logistic regression model was conducted to analyze the risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: A total of 337 patients were included. A 30.3% of vitiligo patients (102/337) in present cohort had PTS and 12.5% patients (42/337) were confirmed for developing into PTSD. The multivariate logistic regression revealed educational level<university (OR=2.32, 95% CI=1.97C2.93, P=0.003), vitiligo in face and neck (OR=2.65, 95% CI=2.08C3.12, P=0.008), vitiligo in feet and hands (OR=1.86, 95% CI=1.54C2.12, P<0.001) and surgical treatment (OR=3.53, 95% CI=3.12C4.02, P<0.001) were risk factors for PTSD. PTS severity was significantly associated with vitiligo disease activity score (rho=0.54, R2=0.29, P=0.002), vitiligo area scoring index score (r=0.55, R2=0.30, P=0.012), and dermatology life quality index score (r=0.61, R2=0.37, P=0.004). CONCLUSION: Vitiligo-related PTS is prevalent in vitiligo patients and causes psychological impairment.

A novel coronavirus, leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome, also called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), seems to be a new member of neuroinvasive viruses. While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps on spreading around the world rapidly, reports about the neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2, increases day by day. It is reported that a variety of symptoms and syndromes such as headache, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain and myopathy are common especially in more severe COVID-19 patients. It is also suggested that the development of neurological complications is strongly associated with a poor outcome. On the other hand, hyposmia can be the unique symptom in COVID-19 carriers and this can serve as a marker for identifying the otherwise asymptomatically infected patients. It is thought that SARS-CoV-2 may cause neurological symptoms through direct or indirect mechanisms. Nevertheless, neuroinvasion capability of SARS-CoV2 is confirmed by the presence of the virus, in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient with encephalitis, and this is proven by gene sequencing. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to be aware of the possible neurological complications of the disease. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to report neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 and possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Due to the high homology of SARS-CoV-2 with other human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, reviewing the neurological involvement also associated with these coronaviruses will provide an idea about the long-term complications of COVID-19.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the point of view of neurologists: Observation of neurological findings and symptoms during the combat against a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend empiric antibiotics be used only for severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or in cases where there is high clinical suspicion for bacterial co-infection. Level of adherence to guideline-recommended prescribing is unknown and high rates of antimicrobial prescribing may lead to increased development of resistance. METHODS: We reviewed antimicrobial prescribing patterns for patients with COVID-19 managed at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia in 2020. Adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) guideline-based prescribing was assessed by manual review of case notes. Monthly hospital-wide antibacterial consumption April-Dec 2020 (post-pandemic period) was compared to Jan 2019-Mar 2020 (pre-pandemic period), measured as days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient-days. Rates of multi-drug resistant organisms (MRO) (including MRSA, VRE, CPE, ESBL) were compared between months in 2019 and 2020 after pandemic onset (April 2020) and expressed as isolates per 1000 patient-days. RESULTS: 147 patients were managed for COVID-19 in 2020 at our centre. 101 patients required hospital admission and 58 (39%) were classified as either severe or critical in severity. 80 (54%) patients received empiric antimicrobial treatment, including 78/101 (77%) of hospital inpatients and 24/26 (92%) of ICU-admitted patients. 59 (73%) of antimicrobial prescriptions were adherent to WHO guidelines. Monthly antibacterial consumption was significantly lower post-pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period (mean 853 vs 902 DOT/1000 patient-days, P=0.0065). Antimicrobial use patterns varied, with significant decreases in commonly used antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin but no change in vancomycin or meropenem (Figure 1). There was a mean decrease of 0.77 MRO isolates/1000 patient-days (P=0.026) when each month in 2020 was compared with the corresponding month in 2019 (Figure 2).

Consistently, structural abnormalities in the olfactory bulb (OB), a key region of the peripheral olfactory system, have also been reported in psychotic disorders. Meanwhile, air pollution and viral infections in the upper respiratory tract, including those of SARS-CoV-2, are reportedly risk factors for brain dysfunction and mental disorders. These risk factors can disturb the olfactory epithelium (OE) that is located adjacent to the OB and connected via direct neuronal projections. Nevertheless, it is unknown how a disturbance of the OE possibly affects the OB in the pathophysiological context of psychotic disorders. Methods We examined the volume of the OB in FEP patients and healthy controls from 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and molecular expression profiles of olfactory neuronal cells (ONCs) enriched from freshly biopsied OE. Results We observed a reduction of the OB volume in FEP patients compared with healthy controls. We also observed a significant alteration in gene expression profiles in the ONCs from FEP patients, supporting the pathological changes in the OE. Among such molecular changes, immune-related molecules and pathways were underscored in association with the OB volume changes in FEP patients. Conclusions Our data support the OB and OE pathologies in FEP patients. Immune-related molecular changes in the OE can biologically link adverse factors in the nasal cavity, such as air pollution and viral infection, with the OB structural change, both of which have been reported for psychotic disorders.","output":"Volumetric alteration of olfactory bulb and immune-related molecular changes in olfactory epithelium in first episode psychosis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented situation, with incalculable health, social, and economic consequences At the start of the outbreak, the financial markets collapsed, although not all sectors suffered equally The gaming and eSports industry is one of those that has suffered the least from the fall in the markets Millions of people locked up at home, bored, stressed, and anguished, gave gaming and eSports companies growing prominence throughout the first half of 2020 This prominence has elicited interest in analyzing which variables can influence the returns in an industry in better financial health than many others Using a logitCprobit model, this research aims to analyze the relationship between financial (VIX, S&P GSCI Gold Index) and social (worldwide daily variation in total deaths from COVID-19 and worldwide Google attention on coronavirus) variables and the returns offered by the video game and eSports exchange traded fund (ESPO) The results show that the influence of social variables is weaker than the influence of financial variables There is a significant inverse relationship between market volatility and ESPO returns and a highly significant relationship between ESPO returns and gold returns While the relationship of ESPO returns with worldwide Google attention on coronavirus is significant, the relationship with worldwide daily variation in total deaths from COVID-19 is not The conclusions of the study are discussed at the end of the paper","output":"All that glitters is not gold.

This lymphoma is caused by chromosomal translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK). In this study, we aimed to identify mechanisms of transformation and therapeutic targets by generating a model of ALK+ ALCL lymphomagenesis ab initio with the specific NPM-ALK fusion. METHODS: We performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of the NPM-ALK chromosomal translocation in primary human activated T lymphocytes. RESULTS: Both CD4+ and CD8+ NPM-ALK-edited T lymphocytes showed rapid and reproducible competitive advantage in culture and led to in vivo disease development with nodal and extra-nodal features. Murine tumors displayed the phenotypic diversity observed in ALK+ ALCL patients, including CD4+ and CD8+ lymphomas. Assessment of transcriptome data from models and patients revealed global activation of the WNT signaling pathway, including both canonical and non-canonical pathways, during ALK+ ALCL lymphomagenesis. Specifically, we found that the WNT signaling cell surface receptor ROR2 represented a robust and genuine marker of all ALK+ ALCL patient tumor samples. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, ab initio modeling of the ALK+ ALCL chromosomal translocation in mature T lymphocytes enabled the identification of new therapeutic targets. As ROR2 targeting approaches for other cancers are under development (including lung and ovarian tumors), our findings suggest that ALK+ ALCL cases with resistance to current therapies may also benefit from ROR2 targeting strategies.","output":"De novo generation of the NPM-ALK fusion recapitulates the pleiotropic phenotypes of ALK+ ALCL pathogenesis and reveals the ROR2 receptor as target for tumor cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older adults at a higher risk of adverse outcomes and mortality if they get infected with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2). These undesired outcomes are because ageing is associated with other conditions like multimorbidity, frailty and disability. This paper describes the impact of frailty on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management and outcomes. We also try to point out the role of inflamm-ageing, immunosenescence and reduced microbiota diversity in developing a severe form of COVID-19 and a different response to COVID-19 vaccination among older frail adults. Additionally, we attempt to highlight the impact of frailty on intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes, and hence, the rationale behind using frailty as an exclusion criterion for critical care admission. Similarly, the importance of using a time-saving, validated, sensitive, and user-friendly tool for frailty screening in an acute setting as COVID-19 triage. We performed a narrative review. Publications from 1990 to March 2021 were identified by searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and SCOPUS. Based on this search, we have found that in older frail adults, many mechanisms contribute to the severity of COVID-19, particularly cytokine storm; those mechanisms include lower immunological capacity and status of ongoing chronic inflammation and reduced gut microbiota diversity. Higher degrees of frailty were associated with poor outcomes and higher mortality rates during and after ICU admission. Also, the response to COVID-19 vaccination among frail older adults might differ from the general population regarding effectiveness and side effects. Researches also had shown that there are many tools for identifying frailty in an acute setting that could be used in COVID-19 triage, and before ICU admission, the clinical frailty scale (CFS) was the most recommended tool. CONCLUSION: Older frail adults have a pre-existing immunopathological base that puts them at a higher risk of undesired outcomes and mortality due to COVID-19 and poor response to COVID-19 vaccination. Also, their admission in ICU should depend on their degree of frailty rather than their chronological age, which is better to be screened using the CFS.

The sampling kits were mostly built from supplies available in pandemic-stressed stores. Samples were processed using reagents that were easy to access despite the recurrent supply shortage. The methods used were highly sensitive and resistant to inhibitors that are commonly present in environmental samples.

The BioSNG demonstration plant described in this paper seeks to prove the technical feasibility of the thermal gasification of waste to renewable gas, through a preliminary experimental programme to take an existing stream of syngas, methanate it and show that it can be upgraded to gas grid quality requirements. The syngas used in the project is a waste-derived syngas from a two-stage fluidised bed - plasma pilot facility, which is then converted and upgraded in a new, dedicated conversion and clean up plant. Extensive trials were undertaken on methanation and gas upgrading units for over 60 h of continuous operation. The fundamentals of a once-through methanation process train have been established on the demonstration facility and a model built to extend the analysis over different operational parameters. Over the trials, methane outputs of greater than 50 kWth output were routinely produced from three methanation reactors in series, with a total CO conversion exceeding 90% at pressures as low as atmospheric, in line with kinetic model predictions. Retention of CO2 as well as adequate partial pressure of H2O in the process stream was important for process control. The plant provided demonstration of the efficacy of a PSA system for separation of CO2 (99% removal efficiency) as well as the potential to remove a proportion of residual H2, N2 and CO, although this was associated with appreciable CH4 slip. The process can be optimized primarily by reducing inlet temperature to methanation reactors, controlling syngas composition and using adequate steam to carbon ratio, depending on the type of waste. This information can be used to inform the design and economics of subsequent planned commercial plants that could significantly increase the potential of renewable gas in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, providing a low cost route to low carbon heat and transport.","output":"Production of BioSNG from waste derived syngas: Pilot plant operation and preliminary assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China, has become a global threat The high infectivity and drastic outcomes have made this a paramount health concern Effective therapy or vaccine to arrest the progress has still not been proved Homeopathy has a long reputation and evidence of intervening in several epidemic situations, notably the recent influenza Symptoms-based personalised approach makes it more precise to treat patients The symptom complex presented by several patients suffering from the COVID-19 can help to select the genus epidemicus , one or few medicine/s to treat and prevent the epidemic A proper hygienic measure and medication are sufficient to manage a large number of cases with mild symptoms Severe cases with or without complications are an important concern and need critical management A significant body of literature justifies the consideration of homeopathy in this situation A conceptual framework may be drawn to integrate homeopathy with standard therapy to find a better treatment plan Keeping the symptoms and existing evidence in consideration, some medicines may be proposed for further trials, treatment and prevention plan","output":"Role of Homeopathy in Epidemics: Paving Way for a Plausible Solution in the Management of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT As the COVID-19 is becoming an increasing health threat, it has urged the scientists all over the world to not only research about its transmission, prevalence and causes but also to spread its awareness in the maximum possible ways Although the complete disease-causing mechanisms of COVID-19 remain to be fully elucidated, active research is being conducted continuously in the field to gather as much information about every aspect of this disease as possible Also, a clear difference is prevalent in different regions of the world about the rate of deaths and survivals Therefore, the current comprehensive review has been written in view of all these aspects so as to present a complete picture of where the world stands, how can the disease be coped, what myths have been developed along with this new pandemic, and what measures should be taken both at individual and states' levels to help fight against COVID-19","output":"Debunking Myths about COVID-19, Paranoiac Misconceptions, Recent Developments and its Current Stance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Data envelopment analysis is used to examine inter-temporal and peer group airline efficiency.

METHODS: We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in Kazakhstan between February and April 2020. We compared demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data of patients with different COVID-19 severities on admission. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with disease severity and in-hospital death. Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 analysis was performed in 53 patients. FINDINGS: Of the 1072 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in March-April 2020, the median age was 36 years (IQR 24C50) and 484 (45%) were male.

The SARS-CoV-2 isolates grouped into seven phylogenetic lineages, O/B.4.1, S/A.2, S/B.1.1, G/B.1, GH/B.1.255, GH/B.1.3 and GR/B.1.1.10; 87% of the isolates were O and S sub-types descending from early Asian lineages, while the G, GH and GR isolates were related to lineages from Europe and the Americas. INTERPRETATION: Older age, comorbidities, increased WBC count, and male sex were risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality in Kazakhstan. The broad SARS-CoV-2 diversity suggests multiple importations and community-level amplification predating travel restriction.

Convincing members of the public who are vaccine hesitant rather than anti-vaxxers should be the focus of our efforts. Our experience is that vaccine-hesitant individuals and anti-vaxxers are generally distinct cohorts, with differing reasons for their vaccine reluctance. If we are to truly address hesitancy, we must take time to understand the reasons for an individual's hesitancy. Developing a conceptual framework and skills for HCWs during encounters with unvaccinated individuals will be important not only for shifting some to get vaccinated, but also to manage the complex emotions that HCWs will undoubtedly be forced to confront during the fourth wave.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaxxers - supporting healthcare workers to navigate the unvaccinated: Reflections from clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare neurological condition among children. Its manifestations vary from mild headaches to loss of vision. Although rare, COVID-19 infection and high dose cytosine arabinoside have been reported as risk factors for this neurological disorder. In patients with acute leukemia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension diagnosis is simple, but finding its etiology can be difficult. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 9-year-old boy with an ongoing treatment for T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with persistent headaches and diplopia. A diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was retained based on clinical, imaging and laboratory findings. Due to its rarity, we describe its clinical and therapeutic features and highlight the challenging etiological dilemma between COVID-19 infection and high dose cytosine arabinoside administration. CONCLUSION: Persistent headache in a pediatric patient with leukemia can be due to many neurological disorders other than leukemic relapse. Given the improvement of the neurological symptoms after the SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativization and the successful re-introduction of high dose cytosine Arabinoside, the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension associated with Covid-19 infection was withheld.

Health care providers are overwhelmed, resulting in clinical teams spread more thinly. We aimed to assess the impact of introducing an app-based remote patient monitoring system (Huma Therapeutics) on a clinician's workload in the context of a COVID-19-specific virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: This prospective feasibility study aimed to evaluate the health economic effects (in terms of clinical workload) of a mobile app on a telephone-based virtual ward used in the monitoring of patients with COVID-19 who are clinically ready for discharge from the hospital. METHODS: A prospective feasibility study was carried out over 1 month where clinician workload was monitored, and full-time equivalents savings were determined. An NHS hospital repurposed a telephone-based respiratory virtual ward for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 in the amber zone (according to the National Health Service definition) were monitored for 14 days postdischarge to help identify deteriorating patients earlier. A smartphone-based app was introduced to monitor data points submitted by the patients via communication over telephone calls. We then comparatively evaluated the clinical workload between patients monitored by telephone only (cohort 1) with those monitored via mobile app and telephone (cohort 2). RESULTS: In all, 56 patients were enrolled in the app-based virtual ward (cohort 2). Digital remote patient monitoring resulted in a reduction in the number of phone calls from a mean total of 9 calls to 4 calls over the monitoring period. There was no change in the mean duration of phone calls (8.5 minutes) and no reports of readmission or mortality. These results equate to a mean saving of 47.60 working hours. Moreover, it translates to 3.30 fewer full-time equivalents (raw phone call data), resulting in 1.1 fewer full-time equivalents required to monitor 100 patients when adjusted for time spent reviewing app data. Individual clinicians spent an average of 10.9 minutes per day reviewing data. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based remote patient monitoring technologies may offer tangible reductions in clinician workload at a time when service is severely strained. In this small-scale pilot study, we demonstrated the economic and operational impact that digital remote patient monitoring technology can have in improving working efficiency and reducing operational costs. Although this particular RPM solution was deployed for the COVID-19 pandemic, it may set a precedent for wider utilization of digital, remote patient monitoring solutions in other clinical scenarios where increased care delivery efficiency is sought.","output":"Mobile App-Based Remote Patient Monitoring in Acute Medical Conditions: Prospective Feasibility Study Exploring Digital Health Solutions on Clinical Workload During the COVID Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleoprotein (NP) were purified from pig serum through two steps: (1) isolation of anti-NP IgG antibodies using magnetic beads with immobilized human SARS-CoV-2 NP and (2) filtration of anti-spike protein (SP) IgG antibodies using magnetic beads with immobilized human SARS-CoV SP The enhanced specificity of the purified antibodies to the NP of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated using an immunoassay with anti-NP IgG antibodies after the isolation and filtration steps The binding constants (K-d) of the purified anti-NP IgG antibodies to the NP of SARS-CoV-2 and the SP of SARS-CoV were estimated using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor (SPR) A competitive assay using the two-step purified anti-NP IgG antibodies from pig serum demonstrated (a) the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in viral fluid and (b) the discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and CoV strain 229E in viral fluids","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein Antibodies Derived from Pig Serum with a Controlled Specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Academic literature highlights blockchains potential to transform health care, particularly by seamlessly and securely integrating existing data silos while enabling patients to exercise automated, fine-grained control over access to their electronic health records. However, no serious scholarly attempt has been made to assess how these technologies have in fact been applied to real-world health care contexts. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this paper is to assess whether blockchains theoretical potential to deliver transformative benefits to health care is likely to become a reality by undertaking a critical investigation of the health care sectors actual experience of blockchain technologies to date. METHODS: This mixed methods study entailed a series of iterative, in-depth, theoretically oriented, desk-based investigations and 2 focus group investigations. It builds on the findings of a companion research study documenting real-world engagement with blockchain technologies in health care. Data were sourced from academic and gray literature from multiple disciplinary perspectives concerned with the configuration, design, and functionality of blockchain technologies. The analysis proceeded in 3 stages. First, it undertook a qualitative investigation of observed patterns of blockchain for health care engagement to identify the application domains, data-sharing problems, and the challenges encountered to date. Second, it critically compared these experiences with claims about blockchains potential benefits in health care. Third, it developed a theoretical account of challenges that arise in implementing blockchain in health care contexts, thus providing a firmer foundation for appraising its future prospects in health care. RESULTS: Health care organizations have actively experimented with blockchain technologies since 2016 and have demonstrated proof of concept for several applications (use cases) primarily concerned with administrative data and to facilitate medical research by enabling algorithmic models to be trained on multiple disparately located sets of patient data in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. However, blockchain technology is yet to be implemented at scale in health care, remaining largely in its infancy. These early experiences have demonstrated blockchains potential to generate meaningful value to health care by facilitating data sharing between organizations in circumstances where computational trust can overcome a lack of social trust that might otherwise prevent valuable cooperation. Although there are genuine prospects of using blockchain to bring about positive transformations in health care, the successful development of blockchain for health care applications faces a number of very significant, multidimensional, and highly complex challenges. Early experience suggests that blockchain is unlikely to rapidly and radically revolutionize health care. CONCLUSIONS: The successful development of blockchain for health care applications faces numerous significant, multidimensional, and complex challenges that will not be easily overcome, suggesting that blockchain technologies are unlikely to revolutionize health care in the near future.","output":"The Health Care Sectors Experience of Blockchain: A Cross-disciplinary Investigation of Its Real Transformative Potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies are widely used for the treatment of hematological malignancies or autoimmune disease but may be responsible for a secondary humoral deficiency.

Methods: Data was extracted and digitalised for all close contacts of pulmonary TB cases at the National TB Coordinating Centre from January 2009 to December 2018. Generalising estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to determine the associated factors. Manual matching against electronic health records system was done to identify contacts who had progressed to active TB disease. Results: Among 10,537 contacts, 9.9% (n= 1047) were diagnosed as LTBI, out of which 43.0% (n= 450) initiated LTBI treatment. Among those who initiated, 74.0% (n= 333) completed LTBI treatment. Contact factors associated with LTBI diagnosis include being male (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR)= 1.18 [95%CI: 1.03,1.34), local (aOR= 0.70 [95% CI: 0.56,0.88]), and a household contact. Local LTBI cases had higher odds of initiating LTBI treatment (aOR= 1.86 [95% CI: 1.26,2.73]). Also, LTBI cases detected from local (aOR= 2.32 [95% CI: 1.08,4.97]) and smear positive PTB index cases had higher odds of completing LTBI treatment. Among 1047 LTBI cases, 5 (0.5%) progressed to active PTB within 1-8 years post-LTBI diagnosis.

Methods: A sample of 71 consecutive children enrolled in the Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study were selected. Children suffering from frequently recurring respiratory infections (FRRIs) were defined as the highest quintile of the entire cohort of 329 children, as regards the number of upper respiratory infections (URIs) and/or episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) during the follow-up period from 2 to 24 months. Results: In the sample of 71 children, there were 18 children with FRRI (9 URI and/or 4 AOM). Leukocyte cultures, prepared from blood drawn from these 18 children at 6 months of age, produced lower yields of IFN than those of the remaining 53 children, when stimulated with adenovirus (P<0.001), coronavirus (P<0.001) or rhinovirus (P=0.002). The difference in IFN yields was even greater (P<0.001 with all three viruses) if the comparison was made between children with FRRI and those with no or maximally one URI during the follow-up period. When the IFN production capacity induced by rhinovirus was measured at the age of 24 months, a statistically significant difference between the children with FRRI and the others was also seen (P=0.002). Influenza A virus-induced IFN production capacity did not differ between the groups at either age (P=0.209). Conclusions: Lowered IFN responses in children suffering from recurrent URIs and/or AOM may, in a subgroup of the children, be due to a genetic property of the child. However, because of the great interindividual variations, we cannot use the IFN production capacity as such for prediction of forthcoming respiratory infections and/or otitis media.","output":"Lowered yields of virus-induced interferon production in leukocyte cultures and risk of recurrent respiratory infections in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Limited data is available about knowledge, anxiety and use of HCQ prophylaxis among health care personnels in India related to COVID-19 pandemic Methods: A cross-sectional study was done in May 2020, using a validated questionnaire comprised of 28 questions at a tertairy care health-care center in India Results: A total 957 respondents were included (10 2% nurses, 45 2% medical students, 24 3% paramedical students, 11 7% residents and 8 6% faculty) Overall knowledge score was 9 3/15;highest for preventive practices (4/5), followed by clinical knowledge (2 7/5) and use of Personal Protective Equipment (2 6/5) Overall score was higher in faculty (10 8), least in nurses (8 5) & paramedical students (8 4) [p 65 years age at home on multivariate analysis (p&lt; 001) Conclusions: The lower COVID-19 knowledge scores were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of anxiety and potentially dangerous practices towards COVID-19 epidemic","output":"Late Breaking Abstract - Knowledge, anxiety and use of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis among healthcare students and professionals regarding COVID-19 pandemic in India: An observational cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and AimsThe New South Wales (NSW) COVID-19 outbreak is at 478 daily cases on August 16, 2021.

The clinical specificity was assessed on 215 prepandemic sera (including some from patients with viral infections or autoimmune disorders). The clinical sensitivity was evaluated on 710 sera from 564 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and whose antibody response was compared to that measured by five other commercial tests. The kinetics of the antibody response were also analyzed in seven symptomatic patients. The specificity of the test (BioS) on prepandemic specimens was 98.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.2% to 99.4%). When tested on the 710 pandemic specimens, BioS showed an overall clinical sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.89), with good concordance with the Euroimmun assay (overall concordance of 0.91; Cohens kappa coefficient of 0.62).

AIM The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of non-implanted electrical stimulation to reduce the severity of post-stroke incontinence. SUMMARY OF REVIEW Clinical trials of non-implanted electrical stimulation applied for the purposes of treating post-stroke incontinence were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, and CENTRAL. From a total of 5043 manuscripts, 10 trials met the eligibility criteria (n = 894 subjects). Nine trials reported urinary incontinence severity outcomes enabling meta-analysis of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS; 5 trials) and electroacupuncture (4 trials). Studies provide good-to-fair quality evidence that TENS commenced <3 months post-stroke has a large effect on urinary continence (SMD = -3.40, 95% CI -4.46 to -2.34) and a medium effect when commenced >3 months after stroke (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.26). Electroacupuncture has a large effect when administered >5 times a week (SMD = -2.32, 95% CI -2.96 to -1.68) and a small effect when administered 5 times a week (SMD = -0.44, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.18). Only one trial reported the effect of non-implanted electrical stimulation on post-stroke fecal incontinence. CONCLUSIONS Published trials evaluating the effect of non-implanted electrical stimulation on post-stroke incontinence are few and heterogenous.

Persons with mental disorders who are both institutionalized and justice-involved in psychiatric and forensic hospitals find themselves more vulnerable to these measures and more limited in their movements and activities. AIMS: The purpose of this paper is to examine the changes in practice in response to the pandemic and their potential impact on individuals in institutional settings. RESULTS: A rapid review including 69 publications identified nine major themes in the literature, which will serve as a framework to analyze the experience of one forensic psychiatry institution in Canada. These themes are: 1) population-specific vulnerability factors; 2) staff management and training; 3) early discharge, parole, and community integration; 4) management of contagion in closed spaces; 5) sanitary measures and personal protective equipment; 6) care and service continuity; 7) use of technology to maintain social ties and services; 8) legal mechanisms and individual rights; and 9) post-pandemic realities. CONCLUSION: Although this is the first pandemic of such international magnitude, experts point to an increase in epidemics over the past decade and continued growth in the coming decades. It is thus essential to learn from this health crisis in order to be prepared and minimize their potential impact on vulnerable populations in the future.

We aimed at determining (a) the association between anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and anti\\\\apoA\\\\1 humoral response and (b) the degree of linear homology between SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, apoA\\\\1 and Toll\\\\like receptor 2 (TLR2) epitopes. DESIGN: Bioinformatics modelling coupled with mimic peptides engineering and competition experiments were used to assess epitopes sequence homologies. Anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and anti\\\\apoA\\\\1 IgG as well as cytokines were assessed by immunoassays on a case\\\\control (n = 101), an intensive care unit (ICU; n = 126) and a general population cohort (n = 663) with available samples in the pre and post\\\\pandemic period. RESULTS: Using bioinformatics modelling, linear sequence homologies between apoA\\\\1, TLR2 and Spike epitopes were identified but without experimental evidence of cross\\\\reactivity. Overall, anti\\\\apoA\\\\1 IgG levels were higher in COVID\\\\19 patients or anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 seropositive individuals than in healthy donors or anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 seronegative individuals (P < .0001).

The aim of this study was to conduct a service evaluation of CUES in Manchester. METHODS: Data were collected both prospectively and retrospectively from both primary and secondary care over an 8-week period from June to August 2020. RESULTS: In primary care CUES in Greater Manchester (GM) 2461 patients were assessed, with a majority self-referring to the service (68.7%, n = 1844). 91.7% of cases initially screened for CUES were deemed eligible and given a telemedicine appointment in GM; 53.3% of these cases required face-to-face consultation. 14.3% of cases seen within in GM CUES (351 out of 2461) were provisionally referred to secondary care. Contemporaneously the main provider emergency eyecare department (EED) attendances were reduced by 37.7% per month between April and December 2020 inclusive, compared to the same months in 2019. Patients attending a CUES face-to-face assessment were more likely to have a diagnosis in agreement with secondary care, compared to patients referred in from telemedicine assessment only (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This evaluation of CUES demonstrates a high level of primary care activity alongside a sustained reduction in EED cases. The case-mix of patients seen within EED following referral appears to be of a less benign nature than those cases seen prior to the introduction of CUES.","output":"Evaluation of the Manchester COVID-19 Urgent Eyecare Service (CUES)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has heightened human suffering, undermined the economy, turned the lives of billions of people around the globe upside down, and significantly affected the health, economic, environmental and social domains.

The case fatality rate seems higher in cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Other comorbidities do not seem to confer the same risk, therefore the understanding of the relationship between infection and cardiovascular system could be a crucial point for the fight against the virus. A great interest is currently directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE 2) which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure. All cardiovascular conditions share an imbalance of the renin angiotensin system (RAAS) in which ACE 2 plays a central role. In the last few days, much confusion has appeared about the management of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in infected patients and in those at risk of critical illness in case of infection.

METHODS Thirty-three patients with SARS referred to Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease (GIRD) between December 2002 and March 2003 were studied retrospectively. Paired t-test using statistical software SPSS 10.0 was employed to compare the respiratory frequency and pulse O(2) saturation (SpO(2)) before and after noninvasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the 33 patients. Among them, 18 patients who presented with SpO(2) of 90% - 93% at rest under O(2) inhalation 5 L/min were further recorded for their SpO(2) during slight physical movement and CPAP. The possible death-related risk factors including age, underlying diseases, leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia were analyzed by the Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test. RESULTS The respiratory frequencies were significantly decreased and SpO(2) was improved in the 33 patients after one hour of noninvasive ventilation. The SpO(2) in the latter 18 patients fell during slight physical movement and improved one hour after CPAP (p < 0.01). The RRs of the five death predictors concerning thrombocytopenia, age (> 50 yrs, underlying diseases, leucocytosis, and lymphopenia were 25.83, 8.57, 6.40, 1.64, and 1.17, respectively, with the 95% CI of 3.64 - 183.59, 1.94 - 37.83, 1.75 - 23.33, 0.38 - 7.05 and 0.16 - 8.48, respectively. Management with corticosteroids effectively ameliorated and suppressed the development of pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS Noninvasive ventilation relieves dyspnea and SpO(2) in patients with critical SARS, and should also be employed in those with SpO(2) of 90% - 93% at rest under O(2) inhalation 5 L/min. Noninvasive as an add-on management may probably cut down on the dosage and duration of corticosteriod therapy.

While these measures helped prevent the community spread of the virus, the resulting environmental benefits of lockdown remained mostly unnoticed. While many studies documented improvements in air quality index, very few have explored the reduction in black carbon (BC) aerosols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations due to lockdown. In this study, we evaluated the changes in concentrations of BC, PAHs, and PM(2.5) before and during the lockdown period. Our results show that lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in concentrations of these pollutants. The average mass concentration of BC, PAHs, and PM(2.5) before the lockdown was 11.71  3.33 gm(?3), 108.71  27.77 ngm(?3), and 147.65  41.77 gm(?3), respectively.

The diagnostic ratio analysis for source apportionment showed changes in the emission sources before and during the lockdown. The primary sources of PAHs emissions before the lockdown were biomass, coal combustion, and vehicular traffic, while during the lockdown, PAHs emissions were primarily from the combustion of biomass and coal. Similarly, before the lockdown, the BC mass concentrations came from fossil-fuel and wood-burning, while during the lockdown period, most of the BC mass concentration came from wood-burning.

Our codebook is domain-specific as it is based on tokens in a given corpus that have higher similarities with the class labels in the corpus. Our method adopts a simple yet prominent representation method for each word, called probability-based word embedding.

The onset of corona pandemic in the world has clearly depicted the harm done by man to the environment. Clear sky, fresh air, calm surroundings, cleaner rivers, reduced waste, repairing of ozone hole, early monsoons, increase in wildlife sightings, undisturbed habitat for marine life, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter, etc., were some of the most visible changes noticed during the lockdown due to coronavirus which acted as an opportunity for repairing our Mother Nature. But COVID-19 pandemic has also brought many problems like unemployment, psychological problems, economic crisis, massive cuts in agriculture and fishery exports levels, generation of unrecyclable waste, rise in clinical waste, etc. The estimation of deaths due to coronavirus is difficult but according to world health organization (WHO) due to ailments caused by air pollution about 3 million people die each year which is more than the coronavirus toll to date. No doubt that the effects of the lockdown will be short-lived and economic activities resumption will again increase emission levels and it will wipe out all gains. Industries will make up their lost time by increasing production and pollution level will return to its pre-pandemic stage. Governments will face a shortage of resources to invest in clean energy which will increase the use of fossil fuels. So, need of the hour is to maintain improvements achieved due to lockdowns permanently and develop technologies that are eco friendly which can help in environmental sustainability. Some of the methods for environmental sustainability are electrification of transport, partial lockdowns in emergency situations, work from home wherever possible, use of clean energies, forests conservation, waste management, etc. No doubt, coronavirus is life threatening disaster but it has given us an opportunity to understand and differentiate between our needs and luxuries at individual levels leading to environmental sustainability at various levels such as community, state and global levels.

The data showing the role of frailty in patients infected with COVID-19 is needed. METHODS: This was a nationwide cohort study conducted at all hospitals in Turkey. All COVID-19 hospitalized patients ( 65 years) were included. Patients who were alive and not discharged up to July 20, 2020, were excluded. The frailty was assessed by using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Patients were classified into three risk groups of frailty based on previously validated cut points as low (<5 points), intermediate (5-15 points), and high (>15 points). Additionally, patients who had the HFRS of 5 were defined as frail. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality rates by frailty group. RESULTS: Between March 11, 2020, and June 22, 2020, a total of 18,234 COVID-19 patients from all of 81 provinces of Turkey were included. Totally, 12,295 (67.4%) patients were defined as frail (HFRS of >5) of which 2,801 (15.4%) patients were categorized in the highest level of frailty (HFRS of >15). Observed in-hospital mortality rates were 697 (12.0%), 1,751 (18.2%) and 867 (31.0%) in low, intermediate and high hospital frailty risk, respectively (p<0.001). Compared with low HFRS (<5), the adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital mortality were 1.482 (1.334-1.646) for intermediate HFRS (5-15) and 2.084; 95% CI, 1.799-2.413 for high HFRS (>15). CONCLUSIONS: As a claims-based frailty model, the HFRS provides clinicians and health systems, a standardized tool for an effective detection and grading of frailty in patients in COVID-19.

We designed the Rapid Reperfusion Registry to capture the percentage of stroke patients who meet the target and its impact on outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS This is a retrospective analysis of anterior circulation patients treated with IAT within 9 hours of symptom onset. Data was collected from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 at 2 centers and from July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012 at 7 centers. Short Door-to-Puncture (D2P) time was hypothesized to be associated with good patient outcomes. A total of 478 patients with a mean age of 6814 years and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 18 (IQR 14 to 21) were analyzed. The median times for IAT delivery were 234 minutes (IQR 163 to 304) for last known normal-to-groin puncture time (LKN-to-GP) and 112 minutes (IQR 68 to 176) for D2P time. The overall good outcome rate was 39.7% for the entire cohort. In a multivariable model adjusting for age, NIHSS, hypertension, diabetes, reperfusion status, and symptomatic hemorrhage, both short LKN-to-GP (OR 0.996; 95% CI [0.993 to 0.998]; P<0.001) and short D2P times (OR 0.993, 95% CI [0.990 to 0.996]; P<0.001) were associated with good outcomes.

Past observational studies suggest that nuts improve adult and child health; however, limited randomized control trials (RCTs) have assessed the health effects of nuts in children. Using a systematic review approach, we examined the effect of nut intake on health outcomes in children aged 8-18 years. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane library to identify RCTs of interest. A total of 5783 articles were identified, 4821 were screened by title and abstract and 37 by full text resulting in four articles that met the inclusion criteria for the review. Nut consumption was between 15 and 30 g with durations of between 3 and 16 weeks. Nut consumption was shown to improve children's diet quality (increase children's intake of essential nutrients including fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats), protein and fiber), there were inconsistent effects on biomarkers of cardiometabolic health (improve lipid profiles, microvascular reactivity and inflammation) and gastrointestinal health (increase in the proportion of beneficial fecal bacteria).

To limit environmental degradation, prior literature discerns several macroeconomic, socio-economic, and institutional factors that affect environmental degradation. However, the relationship between geopolitical risk and environmental degradation is understudied in the previous literature. To fill this gap, the inquiry at hand aims to scrutinize the influence of geopolitical risk on environmental degradation for E7 countries while controlling the effect of renewable energy, non-renewable energy, and GDP. Further, we utilize both the ecological footprint and CO(2) emissions as proxies of environmental degradation and employ second-generation panel methods for robust findings. In addition to this, the present study uses augmented mean group (AMG) estimator to provide long-run relationship among the selected variables. The findings from the AMG estimator expound that there exists environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for E7 countries. Moreover, renewable energy ameliorates environmental quality because it plunges both ecological footprint and CO(2) emissions. On the contrary, non-renewable energy consumption escalates both ecological footprint and CO(2) emissions. Finally, geopolitical risk tends to decrease CO(2) emissions as well as ecological footprint. Our findings deduce a few policy implications to replenish environmental quality. For instance, the share of renewables in the energy mix should be surged to ameliorate the environmental quality. Further, to control both the geopolitical risk and environmental degradation at the same time, policymakers should put forward reforms and initiatives (e.g., policies to escalate R&D, technological innovations, and tax exemptions on imports of renewables) that can help to improve environmental quality without affecting geopolitical risk. At times of low geopolitical risk, environmental degradation will surge; therefore, the rate of environmental control taxes should be increased by the policymakers.","output":"Do geopolitical risk and energy consumption contribute to environmental degradation?

Semi-structured interviews with 14 Israeli music teachers were conducted to expose the challenges of teaching musical instruments and vocal during social distancing, focussing on struggles and technical challenges, teacher-student relations, and creative leveraging. The study explores solutions or advantages to online teaching offered by the participants' experience, while also stressing advantages of face-to-face lessons, which could have been taken for granted. Music educators who participated in the study reported that the pandemic forced them to accommodate teaching methods, demonstrations, and physical guidance, which required reshaping to online communication;latency and poor sound quality required compromise and adjustment. They shared perceptions of online learning, coping methods, creative approaches, attentiveness to students, temporary solutions to technical problems, and forward-looking insights. The role of the teacher as a source of empathy and human connection was highlighted, as was the need for face-to-face, intimate lessons. Findings indicate that online music lessons enable creative methods that may enrich future post-pandemic lessons, but that their positive effect on the learning process is of a short-term nature.

This could possibly be achieved by injecting live SARS-CoV-2 virus intradermal (ID), subcutaneous, intra-muscular (IM) or intra-peritoneal (IP), or by targeting the virus to the digestive tract. The effectiveness and innocuity of using those various routes could be tested very rapidly in animal models, such as Macaques, Hamsters, Ferrets or Cats. The hope is that these experiments will reveal a route of inoculation that can reliably lead to bona-fide infections, resulting in strong immune responses, with both cellular and serological components, but with much less viral replication in the lungs. This would not only hopefully reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications in the infected subjects, but would also probably reduce the amount of virus released by them via aerosols, and thus reduce the vector of contagiosity that is hardest to control, and that probably leads most effectively to viral replication in the lungs. If those experiments in animal models reveal that one or several routes can be used effectively to reduce pulmonary pathology, a clinical trial could be conducted in human volunteers with very low risk profiles. The ID route should probably be considered as a priority, since it could double-up as a skin test to reveal the immune status of the recipients towards the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The course of action proposed here may possibly provide a way of taking a step ahead of the virus, and if it works as hoped, could help to end the need for confinement within a matter of months, if not weeks. ? 2020 Joly E.","output":"Confronting Covid-19 by exploring the possibility of vaccinating with live SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, via a route that would reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this commentary is to expose the situation of Food and Nutrition Security (FNS) in Brazil in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing a critical analysis of this scenario and suggesting ways to move forward. When COVID-19 arrived in Brazil, a crisis scenario that incorporated economic, social and political aspects became highly visible. This scenario fostered unemployment, poverty and hunger. Besides that, it exposed multiple vulnerabilities that were getting worse over the past few years prior to the pandemic. In this context, COVID-19 found in Brazil a fertile ground for its dissemination and community transmission. The impacts of the suspension of many commercial activities and other economic sectors due to the pandemic were quickly felt socially and economically in Brazil. Some of the actions carried out by the Brazilian government included the emergency aid payment and exemption from payment of energy bills for vulnerable individuals, release of funds for programmes for the direct purchase of food from family farmers, delivery of school food kits directly to students despite the closure of schools and publication of sanitary rules for the operation of restaurants. However, these actions are still insufficient, slow and not sufficiently coordinated to contain the progress of the food and nutritional insecurity crisis in Brazil. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgency for the Brazilian government to again prioritise the FNS agenda.

Fumonisin B2 (FB2), the structural analogue of the commonly studied Fumonisin B1 (FB1), is a neglected mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species. Mycotoxins are known for inducing toxicity via mitochondrial stress alluding to mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy). These processes involve inter-related pathways that are regulated by proteins related to SIRT3 and Nrf2. This study aimed to investigate mitochondrial stress responses in human kidney (Hek293) cells exposed to FB2 for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed via the methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 317.4 mol/L) was estimated using statistical software. Reactive oxygen species (ROS; H2DCFDA), mitochondrial membrane depolarisation (JC1-mitoscreen) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP; luminometry) levels were evaluated to assess mitochondrial integrity. The relative expression of mitochondrial stress response proteins (SIRT3, pNrf2, LONP1, PINK1, p62 and HSP60) was determined by Western blot. Transcript levels of SIRT3, PINK1 and miR-27b were assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). FB2 reduced ATP production (p = 0.0040), increased mitochondrial stress marker HSP60 (p&nbsp;= 0.0140) and suppressed upregulation of mitochondrial stress response proteins SIRT3 (p&nbsp;= 0.0026) and LONP1 (p&nbsp;= 0.5934). FB2 promoted mitophagy via upregulation of pNrf2 (p = 0.0008), PINK1 (p = 0.0014) and p62 (p < 0.0001) protein expression. FB2 also suppressed miR-27b expression (p < 0.0001), further promoting the occurrence of mitophagy.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and daily new deaths due to COVID-19 in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected all the six GCC countries, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. This region has a relatively high temperature and humidity, and has homogenous Arab ethnicity with a similar socioeconomic culture. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, including daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization. The information on daily temperature and humidity was obtained from world climate web \\"Time and Date\\". The daily basis, mean temperature and humidity were recorded from the date of appearance of first case of COVID-19 in the region, Jan 29, 2020 to May 15, 2020. We also evaluated the growth factor, \\"a ratio by which a quantity multiplies itself over time; it equals daily cases divided by cases on the previous day\\". RESULTS: In GCC countries, the daily basis mean temperature from Jan 29, 2020 to May 15, 2020 was 29.200.30C and humidity was 37.954.40%. The results revealed that there was a negative correlation and decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths from COVID-19 with increase in humidity in Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The correlation coefficient between temperature with daily cases shows that an increase in temperature was associated with an increase in daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19, however, the temperature is still gradually rising in the region. The growth factor result for daily cases was 1.090.00 and daily deaths was 1.070.03 for COVID-19, and shows declining trends in GCC region. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in relative humidity was associated with a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in GCC countries. The daily growth factor for patients and deaths shows a declining trend. However, the climate is swiftly changing in the region; further studies may be conducted during the peak of summer season.

We analysed epidemiological and genetic data to assess the extent of human infection, the performance of case detection, and the transmission potential of MERS-CoV with and without control measures. METHODS: We assembled a comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases from public sources and estimated the incubation period and generation time from case cluster data. Using data of numbers of visitors to the Middle East and their duration of stay, we estimated the number of symptomatic cases in the Middle East. We did independent analyses, looking at the growth in incident clusters, the growth in viral population, the reproduction number of cluster index cases, and cluster sizes to characterise the dynamical properties of the epidemic and the transmission scenario. FINDINGS: The estimated number of symptomatic cases up to Aug 8, 2013, is 940 (95% CI 290C2200), indicating that at least 62% of human symptomatic cases have not been detected. We find that the case-fatality ratio of primary cases detected via routine surveillance (74%; 95% CI 49C91) is biased upwards because of detection bias; the case-fatality ratio of secondary cases was 20% (7C42). Detection of milder cases (or clinical management) seemed to have improved in recent months. Analysis of human clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self-sustaining when infection control was implemented, but that R in the absence of controls was in the range 08C13. Three independent data sources provide evidence that R cannot be much above 1, with an upper bound of 12C15. INTERPRETATION: By showing that a slowly growing epidemic is underway either in human beings or in an animal reservoir, quantification of uncertainty in transmissibility estimates, and provision of the first estimates of the scale of the epidemic and extent of case detection biases, we provide valuable information for more informed risk assessment.

To examine the factors relating to dietary changes among Japanese adults since the spread of COVID-19. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted via the internet in November 2020. All 6,000 participants, comprising 3,044 male and 2,956 female adults, aged 20C64 years, who registered with a research company received the questionnaire on email. The questionnaire included items on demographic characteristics;socioeconomic factors;past medical history;COVID-19 infection situation of their family and neighbors;fear of COVID-19;and lifestyle habits and healthy changes in dietary habits since the spread of COVID-19. The participants were given multiple choices in answers: changed to healthier;changed to unhealthier;and no-change. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine factors associated with dietary changes. Of the participants, 1,215 (20.3%) answered that their dietary habits became healthier, 491 (8.2%) answered as unhealthy, while a majority of them (4,294;71.6%), said their dietary habits remained unchanged. The results of the multinomial logistic regression analysis with unchanged as the reference indicated that healthier and unhealthier dietary change were negatively associated with age (OR [95% CI]: 0.89[0.84-0.95], 0.89 [0.81-0.97]) and positively associated with the past medical history of dyslipidemia (1.44 [1.11-1.86], 1.74 [1.23-2.46]) and fear of COVID-19 (1.05 [1.04-1.07], 1.02 [1.01-1.04]). Unhealthy change was positively associated with living alone, COVID-19 infection of colleagues, stress, and BMI;while annual household income, COVID-19 infection of oneself and friends, health literacy, frequency of exercise, and smoking were positively associated with healthier dietary changes. This study suggested that the factors determining healthy and unhealthy dietary change since the spread of COVID-19 were age, COVID-19 infection, and fear of COVID-19.

Here, we use deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) and deactivated Cas12a (dCas12a) to construct dynamic RNA ring oscillators that cycle continuously between states over time in bacterial cells. While our dCas9 circuits using 103-nt guide RNAs showed irregular fluctuations with a wide distribution of peak-to-peak period lengths averaging approximately nine generations, a dCas12a oscillator design with 40-nt CRISPR RNAs performed much better, having a strongly repressed off-state, distinct autocorrelation function peaks, and an average peak-to-peak period length of a??7.5 generations. Along with free-running oscillator circuits, we measure repression response times in open-loop systems with inducible RNA steps to compare with oscillator period times. We track thousands of cells for 24+ h at the single-cell level using a microfluidic device. In creating a circuit with nearly translationally independent behavior, as the RNAs control each others' transcription, we present the possibility for a synthetic oscillator generalizable across many organisms and readily linkable for transcriptional control.","output":"Toward a translationally independent RNA-based synthetic oscillator using deactivated CRISPR-Cas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Outbreaks of transmissible respiratory infection are suspected to have significant effects on the health of pediatric and geriatric patients. The objective was to assess the impact of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak on the use of emergency resources. METHODS: An ecologic analysis of emergency department (ED) records between September and December 2015, was performed. Data was obtained from the National Emergency Department Information System database for Korea. All demographic and diagnostic data from patients presenting with febrile symptoms as a main complaint were collected. The data were compared to the equivalent period in the three years preceding the MERS outbreak in Korea. RESULTS: Following the MERS outbreak, there was an increase in overall ED visits by febrile patients and the proportion of visits by febrile patients, relative to total ED attendances. This effect was more prominent in the children under five years. The duration of the chief complaint before ED arrival and the length of ED stay were significantly increased among younger pediatric patients. Decreased body temperature on arrival was observed in younger pediatric patients. CONCLUSION: MERS outbreak appears to have had a significant effects on ED use by febrile patients. The use of emergency care services by pediatric patients makes them more vulnerable to an outbreak of a transmissable disease. An effective strategy to control emergency center visits by non-urgent febrile patients and provide proper medical services is urgently needed.","output":"Impact of Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak on the use of emergency medical resources in febrile patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Over the last decades, there has been a significant increase in antimicrobial prescribing and consumption associated with the development of patients' adverse events and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to the point of becoming a global priority. This study aims at evaluating antibiotic prescribing during COVID-19 pandemic from November 2019 to December 2020. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted primarily through the NCBI database, using PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant literature for the period between November 1, 2019 and December 19, 2020, using the keywords: COVID-19 OR SARS-Cov-2 AND antibiotics restricted to the English language excluding nonclinical articles. Five hundred twenty-seven titles were identified; all articles fulfilling the study criteria were included, 133 through the NCBI, and 8 through Google Scholar with a combined total of 141 studies. The patient's spectrum included all ages from neonates to elderly with all associated comorbidities, including immune suppression. Results: Of 28,093 patients included in the combined studies, 58.7% received antibiotics (16,490/28,093), ranging from 1.3% to 100% coverage. Antibiotics coverage was less in children (57%) than in adults with comorbidities (75%). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed presumptively without pathogen identifications, which might contribute to adverse outcomes. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant and wide range of antibiotic prescribing in patients affected by the disease, particularly in adults with underlying comorbidities, despite the paucity of evidence of associated bacterial infections. The current practice might increase patients' immediate and long-term risks of adverse events, susceptibility to secondary infections as well as aggravating AMR.","output":"The Spectrum of Antibiotic Prescribing During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To prepare for future work stoppages in the medical industry, this study aimed to identify the effects of healthcare worker strikes on the mortality rate of patients visiting the emergency department (ED) at six training hospitals in Daegu, South Korea.

However, its effect on procedural and clinical outcomes remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To retrospectively evaluate the procedural and clinical outcomes after the catheter ablation of unstable VT with and without pLVAD support. METHODS Sixty-eight consecutive unstable, scar-mediated endocardial and/or epicardial VT ablation procedures performed in 63 patients were evaluated. During VT mapping and ablation, hemodynamic support was provided by intravenous inotropes with a pLVAD (n = 34) or without a pLVAD (control; n = 34). RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics were similar. VT was sustained longer with a pLVAD (27.4  18.7 minutes) than without a pLVAD (5.3  3.6 minutes) (P < .001). A higher number of VTs were terminated during ablation with a pLVAD (1.2  0.9 per procedure) than without a pLVAD (0.4  0.6 per procedure) (P < .001). Total radiofrequency ablation time was shorter with a pLVAD (53  30 minutes) than without a pLVAD (68  33 minutes) (P = .022), but with similar procedural success rates (71% for both pLVAD and control groups; P = 1.000). Although during 19  12 months of follow-up VT recurrence did not differ between pLVAD (26%) and control (41%) groups (P = .305), the composite end point of 30-day rehospitalization, redo-VT ablation, recurrent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies, and 3-month mortality was lower with a pLVAD (12%) than without a pLVAD (35%) (P = .043). CONCLUSION In this nonrandomized retrospective study, catheter ablation of unstable VT supported by a pLVAD was associated with shorter ablation times and reduced hospital length of stay. While pLVAD support did not affect VT recurrence, it was associated with a lower composite end point of 30-day rehospitalization, redo-VT ablation, recurrent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies, and 3-month mortality.","output":"Procedural and clinical outcomes after catheter ablation of unstable ventricular tachycardia supported by a percutaneous left ventricular assist device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue is an important arboviral disease in the tropics and subtropics.

METHODS The main steps of the biological risk assessment are explained with some inputs regarding the novelty posed by SARS-CoV-2 and an example of a qualitative risk assessment method is presented. Also, its application to two different activities was exemplified. RESULTS In both cases, the assessment considered that vulnerable workers were working from home or in medical leave. The results showed low or medium risk level for the assessed tasks. For medium risk level, additional controls are advised, such maintain social distancing, sanitize instruments/equipment before use, use proper and well-maintained PPE (when applicable), and promote awareness sessions to spread good practices at work.

Thirty-day outcomes were assessed, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (ARF), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and death. RESULTS: We initially identified 2,379 SARD patients with COVID-19 (mean age 58 years, 79% female) and 142,750 comparators (mean age 47 years, 54% female). In the primary matched model (2,379 SARD patients and 2,379 matched non-SARD comparators with COVID-19), SARD patients had significantly higher risks of hospitalization (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.26), ICU admission (RR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.68), ARF (RR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.07), and VTE (RR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.45) versus comparators but did not have significantly higher risks of mechanical ventilation or death.

Infection begins with uptake of particles into cellular endosomes, where the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP) catalyzes fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. This fusion event is thought to involve conformational rearrangements of the transmembrane subunit (GP2) of the envelope spike that ultimately result in formation of a six-helix bundle by the N- and C-terminal heptad repeat (NHR and CHR, respectively) regions of GP2. Infection by other viruses employing similar viral entry mechanisms (such as HIV-1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) can be inhibited with synthetic peptides corresponding to the native CHR sequence (C-peptides). However, previously reported EboV C-peptides have shown weak or insignificant antiviral activity. To determine whether the activity of a C-peptide could be improved by increasing its intracellular concentration, we prepared an EboV C-peptide conjugated to the arginine-rich sequence from HIV-1 Tat, which is known to accumulate in endosomes. We found that this peptide specifically inhibited viral entry mediated by filovirus GP proteins and infection by authentic filoviruses. We determined that antiviral activity was dependent on both the Tat sequence and the native EboV CHR sequence. Mechanistic studies suggested that the peptide acts by blocking a membrane fusion intermediate.","output":"Inhibition of Ebola Virus Entry by a C-peptide Targeted to Endosomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Less than 5 percent of Chinese cities had top-ranked officials with public health or medical backgrounds (PHMBGs).

We assessed the methodical rigor of the included studies using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Results Four RCTs and one observational study (n=1776) were included in our study. A random-effect model using RevMan (version 5.4; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen) was used for data analysis. The pooled data showed that there was a non-significant reduction in the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism in the patients taking DOACs as compared to warfarin (HR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.29, 1.67; I2 = 50%). The incidence of major bleeding was lower in the DOACs group; the difference was statistically significant (HR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26, 0.67; I2 = 7%).

These materials were characterized by wide- and small-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS and SAXS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The WAXS analysis shows Braggs peaks corresponding to the reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-like phase. Investigations by FTIR and XPS methods show the presence of carbon-oxygen functional groups such as C=C (carbon with sp(2) hybridization), CCC (carbon with sp(3) hybridization), and C=O bonds. The sp(2) bonds form a 2-dimensional (2D) network in hexagonal lattice, while carbon with sp(3) bonds tends to form a 3-dimensional (3D) tetrahedral structure. The BET analysis revealed meso- and micro-pore structures in GC. Heating process reduces the specific surface area and increases pore size of GC. Moreover, increasing the heating temperature induces a decrease in radius of gyration (R(g)) and an increase in the formation of 2D structures in GC. The fitting results of SAXS profiles, proved by TEM and XPS, yielded the structure of GC containing the mixture of 2D and 3D structures. Thus, it is suggested that the GC has a mesostructure.","output":"Mesostructural study on graphenic-based carbon prepared from coconut shells by heat treatment and liquid exfoliation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has enforced dramatic changes to daily living including economic and health impacts. Evidence for the impact of these changes on our physical and mental health and health behaviors is limited. We examined the associations between psychological distress and changes in selected health behaviors since the onset of COVID-19 in Australia. An online survey was distributed in April 2020 and included measures of depression, anxiety, stress, physical activity, sleep, alcohol intake and cigarette smoking. The survey was completed by 1491 adults (mean age 50.5  14.9 years, 67% female). Negative change was reported for physical activity (48.9%), sleep (40.7%), alcohol (26.6%) and smoking (6.9%) since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly higher scores in one or more psychological distress states were found for females, and those not in a relationship, in the lowest income category, aged 18C45 years, or with a chronic illness. Negative changes in physical activity, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake were associated with higher depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Health-promotion strategies directed at adopting or maintaining positive health-related behaviors should be utilized to address increases in psychological distress during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, conditions on the island have been largely overlooked by national media outlets and the mainland U.S. population. Thus, this research report aims to draw attention to the disparate burden multiple and compounding disasters have on older island-dwelling Puerto Rican adults' health and well-being. METHODS: We characterize the lived experiences of the older population in Puerto Rico by incorporating data from numerous sources and contextualizing the effects of compounding disasters, the fiscal pandemic, and health care challenges to provide a more nuanced portrait of existing compounding factors that negatively affect the health and well-being of older adults in the era of COVID-19. RESULTS: We highlight two main factors that exacerbate pre-pandemic inequities experienced by the older adult population amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico: 1) the impact of multiple and compounding disasters; and 2) health care challenges. DISCUSSION: The human suffering of the Puerto Rican population is compounded by the consequences of fiscal austerity, increasing levels of income and wealth inequality, the debt crisis, significant emigration, and a dysfunctional health care system. Future governmental actions are required to lessen the burden of parallel pandemics on older adults in Puerto Rico.","output":"Contextualizing the COVID-19 Era in Puerto Rico: Compounding Disasters and Parallel Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The steady growth in population has led to an enhanced water demand and immense pressure on water resources. Pharmaceutical residues (PRs) are unused or non-assimilated medicines found in water supplies that originate from the human and animal consumption of antibiotics, antipyretics, analgesics etc. These have been detected recently in sewage effluents, surface water, ground water and even in drinking water. Due to their toxicity and potential hazard to the environment, humans and aquatic life, PRs are now categorized as the emerging contaminants (ECs).

All IFIT proteins contain multiple TPR motifs which mediate protein-protein interactions. Some, but not all, members inhibit initiation of protein synthesis by binding to the translation initiation factor eIF-3 or by binding to the 5 end of the mRNA. The murine Ifit1 encodes P56, Ifit2 encodes P54 and Ifit3 encodes P49. For investigating the biological functions of the murine Ifit proteins, we have recently generated several knock-out mice. Challenging Ifit1-/- and Ifit2-/- mice with various viruses have revealed their strong, but selective, antiviral properties. Ifit1-mediated host restriction was shown to be evaded by 2-O-methylation of viral mRNAs. Flavivirus (West Nile Virus), vaccinia virus and coronavirus mutants, that lack 2-O-methylation of their mRNAs, were growth-restricted in Wt, but not in Ifit1-/-, cells and mice. Further studies revealed that the action of Ifit1 on WNV replication is highly manifested in CNS infection, a deficiency of Ifit1 causing increased neuronal death in infected mice. Ifit2, on the other hand, blocked neuro-pathogenesis caused by intranasal infection with the rhabdovirus, VSV. All Ifit proteins were induced in the CNS of the infected mice, but Ifit1-/- mice were not more susceptible than Wt mice and most of the infected mice survived. In contrast, all Ifit2-/- mice died from neuro-pathogenesis; VSV replicated efficiently in the neurons of these mice. However, there was no effect on pathogenesis by another neuro-tropic virus, EMCV. Moreover, VSV did not replicate efficiently in the liver or the lung of infected Ifit2-/- mice and in vitro, in MEF or primary fetal neurons, the sensitivity of VSV replication to IFN-treatment was similar in Wt and Ifit2-/- cells. These results demonstrated the existence of tissue-, virus- and ISG-specific antiviral actions of interferon.","output":"I19 Antiviral actions of the interferon-inducible IFIT proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endophytic fungi are a highly diverse group of fungi that intermittently colonize all plants without causing symptoms of the disease. They sense and respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids, initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field.

AREAS COVERED This review explores epidemiology; virology; pathogenesis; genomic variations; mode of transmission; clinical occurrence; diagnosis; and treatment with antiviral agents, antibiotics, and supportive therapies. It covers a nanotechnology-based treatment approach and emphasizes the importance of herbal and marine antiviral drugs. The review attempts to explain current advances in research, prevention, and control of COVID-19 spread through artificial intelligence and vaccine development status under cosmopolitan consideration. EXPERT OPINION While COVID-19 research is advancing at full capacity, the discovery of drugs or vaccines that can fight the pandemic is necessary. Human survival in such a critical situation will be possible only with the development of strong immunity by opting for exercise, yoga, and consumption of hygienic food and beverages. Therefore, education about COVID-19 lethality and its impact on livelihood is important.

SETTING: This study was conducted in six facilities, which included both government and privately run secondary and tertiary level facilities in the central and coastal regions of Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: We enrolled 787 reverse transcriptase-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV2-infected persons. Patients whose records could not be accessed were excluded. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death. We used Cox proportional hazards regressions to determine factors related to in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Data from patients with 787 COVID-19 were available. The median age was 43 years (IQR 30C53), with 505 (64%) being men. At admission, 455 (58%) were symptomatic with an additional 63 (9%) developing clinical symptoms during hospitalisation. The most common symptoms were cough (337, 43%), loss of taste or smell (279, 35%) and fever (126, 16%). Comorbidities were reported in 340 (43%), with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and HIV documented in 130 (17%), 116 (15%), 53 (7%), respectively. 90 (11%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for a mean of 11 days, 52 (7%) were ventilated with a mean of 10 days, 107 (14%) died. The risk of death increased with age (HR 1.57 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.19)) for persons >60 years compared with those <60 years old; having comorbidities (HR 2.34 (1.68 to 3.25)) and among men (HR 1.76 (1.27 to 2.44)) compared with women. Elevated white cell count and aspartate aminotransferase were associated with higher risk of death.

An online survey was performed across Pakistan (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan) and national figures from the Pakistani government. In total, N = 113 individuals were included (92 males and 21 females). The descriptive statistics, association tests, and Pie chart indicate that males are more impacted by COVID-19 as compared to females. The doctors response indicates that 81.4% of males and 18.6% females are COVID-19 effective in Pakistan. Information from Pakistani national government statistics indicates that the number of male cases are 78%. Therefore, from the entire studies, we can infer that COVID-19 attacks more on males rather than females in the South Asian nation Pakistan.

In order to reduce contact with healthcare facilities and other patients, the CDC has advocated the use of telemedicine, i.e., electronic information and telecommunication technology. While these changes may disrupt normal behaviors and routines and induce anxiety, resulting in decreased vigilance to healthy diet and physical activity and reluctance to seek medical attention, they may just as well be circumvented using modern technology. Indeed, as the beginning of the pandemic a plethora of alternatives to conventional physical interactions were introduced. In this Perspective, we portray the role of SmartPhone applications (apps) in monitoring healthy nutrition, from their basic functionality as food diaries required for simple decision-making and nutritional interventions, through more advanced purposes, such as multi-dimensional data-mining and development of machine learning algorithms. Finally, we will delineate the emerging field of personalized nutrition and introduce pioneering technologies and concepts yet to be incorporated in SmartPhone-based dietary surveillance.","output":"Harnessing SmartPhones to Personalize Nutrition in a Time of Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To report an initial clinical urologic experience using single-port surgery compared to the traditional laparoscopic technique for nephrectomy. METHODS A total of 11 patients underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy using the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) procedure, with 1 R-port used for each. A group of 10 patients who previously underwent simple nephrectomies by 1 of the 2 surgeons were selected for comparison. The intraoperative and postoperative narcotic analgesia requirements were compared between the 2 groups. The Student t test was used to compare the means. All complications, clinical data, and technical issues with performing the procedure were noted. RESULTS All LESS simple nephrectomy procedures were completed uneventfully. There were no intraoperative complications in the LESS group. Postoperative complications included pyrexia and port site bruising with 2 patients. Operative time showed no significant difference in the LESS group compared to the traditional laparoscopic group (151 vs 165 minutes). Narcotic analgesia requirements showed no significant difference in both intraoperative and postoperative usage analyses (P = .15 and P = .55, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The LESS technique can be performed safely compared to traditional laparoscopy. With no significant difference in operative time and relatively few complications, this is a feasible technique for simple nephrectomy.

Although respiratory symptoms are a key feature of the disease, many people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 also suffer acute kidney injury, a condition that exacerbates patient mortality and may have to be treated through renal replacement therapy. Much of the focus on hospital capacity during the pandemic has centered on the availability of ventilators. However, supplies for dialysis treatment, including dialysate, have also run dangerously low in hospitals at the epicenter of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop materials that can efficiently and rapidly regenerate dialysate, removing toxins and restoring electrolyte concentrations so that this vital resource remains readily available. In this work, Ti3C2Tx, a two-dimensional transition-metal carbide (MXene) that is known to efficiently adsorb urea, was used to remove creatinine and uric acid from an aqueous solution and dialysate, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 45.7 and 17.0 mg/g, respectively. We systematically analyzed and modeled the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics, thus determining the rate-limiting step and adsorption mechanism. A fixed-bed column loaded with Ti3C2Tx was designed to further evaluate the adsorption performance under continuous fluid-flow conditions, mirroring conditions of continuous renal replacement therapy modalities. The maximum capacity and 50% breakthrough volume were calculated to further approach the practical application of Ti3C2Tx for removal of uremic toxins. Our findings suggest that Ti3C2Tx has the potential to be used as an efficient sorbent for the regeneration of dialysate, allowing for accelerated dialysate regeneration by removing filtered toxins and leading to more portable dialysis devices.","output":"Adsorption of Uremic Toxins Using Ti3C2Tx MXene for Dialysate Regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To quantify coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and to explore whether quantitative computer tomography (CT) could be used to assess severity on admission. Materials and methods: From January 17 to February 9, 2020, 38 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled in our hospitals. All clinical data and the chest CT on admission were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Firstly, a quantitative method based on multi-scale convolutional neural networks was used to assess the infected lung segments and this was compared with the semi-quantitative method. Secondly, the quantitative method was tested with laboratory results and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) by correlation analyses. Thirdly, both quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters between patients with different PSI were compared. Results: Thirty cases were finally enrolled: 16 (53.33%) of them were male, and the mean age was 48 years old. The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days. The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P < 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), CRP (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = -0.42, -0.53, -0.48).

We present a survey of pathologists within a UK National Health Service cellular pathology department with access to DP, in which we ascertain the role of DP in clinical services during this current pandemic and explore challenges encountered. This survey indicates an increase in uptake of diagnostic DP during this period, with increased remote access. Half of respondents agreed that DP had facilitated maintenance of diagnostic practice. While challenges have been encountered, these are remediable, and none have impacted on the uptake of DP during this period. We conclude that in our institution, DP has demonstrated current and future potential to increase resilience in diagnostic practice and have highlighted some of the challenges that need to be considered.","output":"Role of digital pathology in diagnostic histopathology in the response to COVID-19: results from a survey of experience in a UK tertiary referral hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now of global concern due to its rapid dissemination across the globe. The rapid spread of this viral infection, along with many of its unknown aspects, has posed new challenges to the health care systems.

Furthermore, the medical staff in endemic areas are becoming exhausted and deal with a considerable level of job burnout, which can negatively affect their medical decision making. Also, due to the variable pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, some physicians may misdiagnose patients.

To initiate the infective cycle, the viral genome must therefore translocate from the viral particle to the cytoplasm. Via distinct proteins or motifs in their outermost shell, the particles attach initially to specific molecules on the host cell surface. These virus receptors thus mediate penetration of the viral genome inside the cell, where the intracellular infective cycle starts. The presence of these receptors on the cell surface is a principal determinant of virus host tropism. Viruses can use diverse types of molecules to attach to and enter into cells. In addition, virus-receptor recognition can evolve over the course of an infection, and virus variants with distinct receptor-binding specificities and tropism can appear. The identification of virus receptors and the characterization of virus-receptor interactions have been major research goals in virology for the last two decades. In this chapter, we will describe, from a structural perspective, several virus-receptor interactions and the active role of receptor molecules in virus entry.","output":"Virus-Receptor Interactions and Receptor-Mediated Virus Entry into Host Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization designated last year as the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.

Nevertheless, the home PC professionals (PCPs) faced a challenging situation due to increased number of discharged patients, reduced availability of healthcare facilities and physical/relational barriers between them and patients. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on burnout and psychological morbidity among home PCPs in Italy. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eighth PC physicians and nurses working in home assistance in Italy were invited to participate. The results obtained by the investigation conducted during the Covid-19 emergency (COVID2020) were compared with data collected in 2016 in the same setting (BURNOUT2016). The questionnaires (socio-demographics, Maslach Burnout Inventory and General Health Questionnaire-12) were the same for both the surveys. The PCPs participating in COVID2020 survey (n=145) were mostly the same (70%) who participated to the BURNOUT2016 study (n=179). RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five PCPs participated in the study (response rate 73.2%). During the Covid-19 emergency, home PCPs presented a lower burnout frequency (p<.001) and higher level of personal accomplishment than in 2016 (p=.047). Conversely, the risk for psychological morbidity was significantly higher during the pandemic (p<.001).

As a result, using the developed index of the severity of the epidemiological situation, the institutional characteristics that most affect the effectiveness of the measures applied were determined. It was figured out that of the 16 characteristics considered, only two (the level of employment and trust in the government) have a medium statistical correlation with the severity of the pandemic. Three more characteristics (prevalence of secular-rational values, degree of urbanization, GDP PPP per capita) have a correlation close to the medium. The remaining characteristics (including health care costs, government efficiency, etc.) have either a weak correlation with severity, or actually do not have it. The results obtained indicate insufficient use and reassessment of existing institutional capacities at the initial stage of the pandemic, as well as insufficient reliability of morbidity and mortality statistics in a number of countries. In conclusion, based on the analysis of statistical indicators, recommendations are given to improve the effectiveness of the use of institutional capacity to counter epidemiological threats, improve this potential, increase the effectiveness of protective and restrictive measures that reduce the severity of the epidemiological situation. ? 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

Adverse events can occur if the devices are not used appropriately. The SAGES' Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy? (FUSE) program will include a curriculum and certification examination to address this safety issue. The aim of this study was to determine the self-perceived knowledge of practicing surgeons related to energy-based devices and identify areas to emphasize in the assessment component of FUSE. METHODS Psychometric experts led the test development process. During a 2-day retreat, a multidisciplinary group defined 63 test objectives assessing the knowledge and skills required to use energy-based surgical instruments safely (job task analysis). A survey was sent to a sample of 103 SAGES leaders and others in the test target audience to determine the number of items to use for the certification examination. Participants rated each objective for frequency, relevance, and importance on a 1-7 scale with the means used to create a weighted scale. The survey also included five self-assessment questions. RESULTS Fifty surveys were completed; only 28 % of respondents considered themselves \\"experts.\\" The most common source of knowledge was \\"industry sales representative or course\\" (42 %). The highest weighted topic was \\"Prevention of Adverse Events with Electrosurgery.\\" The highest-rated objectives (>6 out of 7) were \\"Identify various mechanisms whereby electrosurgical injuries may occur,\\" \\"Identify patient protection measures for setup and settings for the electrosurgical unit,\\" and \\"Identify circumstances, mechanisms, and prevention of dispersive electrodes-related injury.\\" CONCLUSIONS Although basic and advanced energy-based devices are commonly used, training has been largely dependent upon industry representatives or industry-sponsored courses. Few surgeons consider themselves experts in the mechanisms of action and the appropriate and safe use of energy-based surgical devices.

When those measures were first implemented in March 2020 by the UK Government, it was thought that human rights obligations would limit excesses of governmental action and that the public had more to fear from unwarranted intrusion into civil liberties. However, within the first year of the pandemic's devastation in the UK, a different picture has emerged: rather than through action, it is governmental inaction that has given rise to greater human rights concerns. The UK Government has been roundly criticized for its inadequate response, including missteps in decision-making, delayed implementation and poor enforcement of lockdown measures, abandonment of testing, shortages of critical resources and inadequate test and trace methods. In this article, we analyse the UK Government's missteps and compare them with published international guidance; we also contrast the UK's decisions with those taken by several other countries (including the devolved administrations within the UK) to understand how its actions and inactions have contributed to unfavourable outcomes. Using an analytical perspective that demonstrates how human rights are both a protection from the power of the state and a requirement that governmental powers are used to protect the lives, health and wellbeing of citizens, we argue that the UK Government's failure to exercise their powers competently allowed the virus to spread without ensuring the country had the means to manage a high case load. This abject failure has led to one of the highest rates of deaths per capita worldwide.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: We analysed all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with available vaccination information captured in Brazil's national electronic respiratory infection data system between 1 January 2020 and 23 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were age-specific mortality rates of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with and without recent inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 53 752 clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed. Controlling for health facility of treatment, comorbidities as well as an extensive range of sociodemographic factors, patients who received a recent influenza vaccine experienced on average 7% lower odds of needing intensive care treatment (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98), 17% lower odds of requiring invasive respiratory support (95% CI 0.77 to 0.88) and 16% lower odds of death (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90). Protective effects were larger when the vaccine was administered after onset of symptoms as well as among younger patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 with recent inactivated influenza vaccination experience significantly better health outcomes than non-vaccinated patients in Brazil. Beneficial off-target effects of influenza vaccination through trained innate immune responses seem plausible and need to be further explored.

Thyroid hormones play multiple roles in lung function, and L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) has multiple effects on lung AT2 cells. T3 enhances AFC in normal adult rat lungs when administered intramuscularly and in normal or hypoxia-injured lungs when given intratracheally. The safety of a commercially available formulation of liothyronine sodium (synthetic T3) administered intratracheally was assessed in an IND-enabling toxicology study in healthy rats. Instillation of the commercial formulation of T3 without modification rapidly caused tracheal injury and often mortality. Intratracheal instillation of T3 that was reformulated and brought to a neutral pH at the maximum feasible dose of 2.73 g T3 in 300 L for five consecutive days had no clinically relevant T3-related adverse clinical, histopathologic or clinical pathology findings. There were no unscheduled deaths that could be attributed to the reformulated T3 or control articles, no differences in the lung weights, and no macroscopic or microscopic findings considered to be related to treatment with T3.

A better understanding of the trends of grain concentrations of mineral nutrients in wheat over the breeding period may help to assess the breeding progress to date. A 2-year field experiment using 138 Chinese wheat landraces and 154 cultivars was conducted. Grain concentrations of micronutrients (Cu and Mn) and macronutrients (N, P, and K) were measured and corrected for a yield level to elucidate the trends of these mineral nutrients over the 80 years of cultivar releasing and identify genetic variation for these mineral nutrients in cultivars and landraces. Large genetic variation exists for grain mineral nutrients concentrations among tested genotypes, indicating that selection for enhancing mineral nutrient concentrations in wheat is possible. Landraces showed a slightly wide genetic variation of grain Cu concentration and a much narrow variation of Mn concentration when compared to modern cultivars. Grain concentrations of Cu and Mn decreased slightly with increasing grain yield with a weak correlation, while N, P, and K concentrations declined obviously with increasing yield with a strong correlation, revealing that increased grain yield had a strong negative effect on grain concentration of macronutrients, but a relative weak negative effect on micronutrients concentrations. When considering the impact of the variation in yield on mineral concentrations, grain concentrations of Cu, Mn, N, P, and K in wheat cultivars released from 1933 to 2017 exhibited different trends with a year of variety release. Grain Cu, N, and P concentrations showed significant decreasing trends over a breeding period, while grain Mn and K concentrations showed no clear trend, suggesting wheat breeding in China over the past 80 years has decreased grain concentrations of Cu, N, and P, and did not alter Mn and K concentrations.

METHODS: A 17\\\\item electronic survey was sent to 496 undergraduate dental students and 53 clinical faculty members who attended clinical sessions during the outbreak period. The survey explored various aspects related to primary sources and prevention of disease exposure, dental management of suspected cases, impact of COVID\\\\19 on students clinical performance and effects of suspension of educational activities on academic performance and clinical competence. RESULTS: The response rate of the students was 60.7% (n = 301). The majority of students reported that performing clinical work during the outbreak posed significant health concerns, resulted in a significant stress and negatively affected their clinical performance. The majority of students believed that aerosols generated during dental procedures are the major source for disease exposure and universal protective equipment is not effective for prevention. The decision to suspend teaching activities was supported by 89% of the students. Opinions were divided regarding the impact of the suspension on the academic performance and clinical competence. Educational videos were the most preferred form of distance education. The response rate of faculty members was 60.4% (n = 32). Responses of faculty members were similar to students, though fewer concerns were reported regarding the risk of disease transmission.

We developed a theory-based perceived message effectiveness (PME) Scale to use when vetting messages for campaigns. METHODS Participants were a national sample of N=623 US adolescents (ages 13-17 years) recruited from a national probability-based panel. In an online experiment, we randomised adolescents to view tobacco prevention ads. All participants viewed an ad on smoking or vaping from the US Food and Drug Administration's The Real Cost campaign and a control video, in a random order. After ad exposure, we assessed PME using nine candidate items and constructs for convergent and criterion validity analyses. We used confirmatory factor analysis and examined information curves to select the scale items. RESULTS A brief PME scale with three items (=0.95) worked equally well for demographically diverse adolescents with different patterns of tobacco use. The Real Cost ads generated higher PME scores than the control videos for both vaping and smoking (convergent validity; p<0.05). Higher PME scores were associated with greater attention, fear, cognitive elaboration and anticipated social interactions (convergent validity; r=0.31-0.66), as well as more negative attitudes toward and lower susceptibility to vaping and smoking (criterion validity; r=-0.14 to -0.37). A single-item PME measure performed similarly to the three-item version.

Anova Health Institute (Anova) is the PEPFAR (US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) District Support Partner for the Johannesburg, Cape Town, Sedibeng, Capricorn and Mopani districts in South Africa, operating in public sector primary healthcare facilities. At the time of the emergence of COVID-19, Anova employed close to 4 000 people: 41% community health workers (CHWs), 23% data staff, 20% nurses and doctors, 12% management/support and 5% allied HCWs. OBJECTIVES: To describe rates of COVID-19 diagnosis in Anova-employed HCWs in five districts. METHODS: Employees exposed to, tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 were required to report the event. These reports were compiled into a database to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce. We kept a timeline of key events occurring at national and district level, including Anova's policies and their implementation, that was used to describe organisational response. We described the number of confirmed cases, cumulative incidence rates and testing rates, broken down by district and job category. We estimated expected deaths and the effect on time off work. RESULTS: Of Anova employees, 14% (n=562) were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the end of September 2020. Cumulative incidence was highest in Sedibeng (29%) and lowest in Mopani (5%). All HCWs experienced high incidences: data staff 17%, allied HCWs 16%, CHWs 14%, nurses and doctors 13%, and management/support 11%. At the peak of the epidemic, for 5 weeks, &gt;5% of employees were unable to work owing to exposure or infection, significantly disrupting service delivery. The additional administrative burden on managers was substantial. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical that all cadres of HCWs are protected in the workplace, including in primary care settings, where better structuresare needed to perform risk assessments and conduct outbreak investigations. CHWs and data staff may be at higher risk owing to poor infrastructure, limited power to negotiate working conditions, and limited experience of infection prevention and control. Their working conditions must be improved to reduce their risk.","output":"Primary healthcare workers at risk during COVID-19: An analysis of infections in HIV service providers in five districts of South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay reflects on the implementation of federal government emergency aid in Brazil in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting elements from the work of Social Workers in the context of growing demand for the supply of material provisions Economic and social conditions in Brazil have particularities that impact the operationalisation of this benefit, which is aimed at the poor, that add complexity and impose limits When considering the structural limits set, this context imposes challenges on the work of Social Workers The need to reconnect and enhance the struggle for social rights is emphasised through the different strategies of the working class","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic, emergency aid and social work in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The tools to control COVID-19 virus and this epidemic have been tested in all countries and at different levels.

We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Results: We analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235 participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female (52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as other. Multivariate analyses indicated that various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p < .001), a student (p < .001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p < .001) and having more social contacts (p < .01) were both associated with greater mental wellbeing. Interpretation: We revealed differences in mental wellbeing among the French population at the early stages of global lockdown. Authorities should consider the particular vulnerability of students, persons with disabilities, and those living in constrained housing conditions that could increase the negative impact of lockdown on mental health.","output":"Who maintains a good mental health in a locked-down country?

In response, the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network (ATN) CARES study instituted mail-based testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and substance use screening. We assessed the acceptability and feasibility of the ATN CARES mail-based testing program. Methods From September 2020- December 2020, trained study staff sent myLAB Box mail-based test kits and written instructions to gay, bisexual, and transgender study participants between the ages of 16-26 years. The test kits included a dried blood spot collection card for HIV (4th generation antigen/ antibody EIA) and syphilis (TP-EIA) testing, swabs and a urine collection kit for the detection of extragenital and genital Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, and a urine collection kit for the screening of six substances. Staff tracked shipment status, and when delivery was identified, contacted participants to assist them with selfcollection and test kit return. Results Of the 65 youth who participated to date, 49.2% (32/ 65) returned their kit and completed at least one test. Those 32 participants had a median age of 23.5 years (IQR 22-25). The median number of days from test kit ordered to results was 18.5 days (IQR 15-23.5);median number of days from collection to results was 10 days (IQR 8.5-12).

Pandemic-related restrictions and reorganization of healthcare services may affect thyroid disease management. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To analyze and discuss the relationship between COVID-19 and thyroid diseases from several perspectives. PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov were searched for this purpose by using free text words and medical subject headings as follows: \\"sars cov 2\\", \\"covid 19\\", \\"subacute thyroiditis\\", \\"atypical thyroiditis\\", \\"chronic thyroiditis\\", \\"hashimoto's thyroiditis\\", \\"graves' disease\\", \\"thyroid nodule\\", \\"differentiated thyroid cancer\\", \\"medullary thyroid cancer\\", \\"methimazole\\", \\"levothyroxine\\", \\"multikinase inhibitor\\", \\"remdesivir\\", \\"tocilizumab\\". Data were collected, analyzed, and discussed to answer the following clinical questions: \\"What evidence suggests that COVID-19 may induce detrimental consequences on thyroid function?\\"; \\"Could previous or concomitant thyroid diseases deteriorate the prognosis of COVID-19 once the infection has occurred?\\"; \\"Could medical management of thyroid diseases influence the clinical course of COVID-19?\\"; \\"Does medical management of COVID-19 interfere with thyroid function?\\"; \\"Are there defined strategies to better manage endocrine diseases despite restrictive measures and in-hospital and ambulatory activities reorganizations?\\". RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 may induce thyroid dysfunction that is usually reversible, including subclinical and atypical thyroiditis. Patients with baseline thyroid diseases are not at higher risk of contracting or transmitting SARS-CoV-2, and baseline thyroid dysfunction does not foster a worse progression of COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether low levels of free triiodothyronine, observed in seriously ill patients with COVID-19, may worsen the disease's clinical progression and, consequently, if triiodothyronine supplementation could be a tool for reducing this burden. Glucocorticoids and heparin may affect thyroid hormone secretion and measurement, respectively, leading to possible misdiagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in severe cases of COVID-19. High-risk thyroid nodules require a fine-needle aspiration without relevant delay, whereas other non-urgent diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions should be postponed. DISCUSSION: Currently, we know that SARS-CoV-2 could lead to short-term and reversible thyroid dysfunction, but thyroid diseases seem not to affect the progression of COVID-19. Adequate management of patients with thyroid diseases remains essential during the pandemic, but it could be compromised because of healthcare service restrictions. Endocrine care centers should continuously recognize and classify priority cases for in-person visits and therapeutic procedures. Telemedicine may be a useful tool for managing patients not requiring in-person visits.","output":"Thyroid and COVID-19: a review on pathophysiological, clinical and organizational aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Currently we still have limited information on how COVID-19 infection has affected lung cancer patients In our study, we analysed whether there are differences in terms of mortality from COVID-19 between patients diagnosed with lung cancer and the overall population within our hospital health area (320,000 people) We have also studied the most frequent characteristics of lung cancer patients who develop infection with COVID-19, and we have analysed possible factors of poor prognosis, as well as treatment outcome Methods: We performed a retrospective review of a total of 2216 patients admitted to Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor in Madrid between March 5 and May 13, 2020 to identify the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer and make a description of the characteristics of these patients, treatment outcome, risk factors for poor prognosis and mortality We performed uni and multivariate logistic regression Results: 22/2216 of the total number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in our hospital had lung cancer (0 99%) 12/22 lung cancer patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis died (54 5%) vs 300/2216 COVID-19 patients in our hospital (p&lt;0 0001) Lung cancer patients who died had a median age of 72 years (range of 49-84 years) Infection with COVID-19 in lung cancer patients was more frequent in men (72 73%) 18/22 (81 81%) had locally advanced or metastatic tumours We observed a trend towards higher mortality among patients with hypertension than among non-hypertensive patients (10/15 vs 2/7;P=0 095) We found higher mortality among patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) than among those who did not (4/4 vs 8/12;P=0 044) There seems to be a trend towards lower mortality among patients who received treatment with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin than among those who did not (6/14 vs 6/8;P=0 145) Conclusions: Lung cancer patients who became infected with COVID-19 have higher mortality than the general population It is more frequent among men and the development of ARDS results in a worse prognosis with higher mortality Although treatment with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine appears to be a good treatment option, we must wait until we have more data on the safety of the combination and results in larger patient series Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors Funding: Has not received any funding Disclosure: All authors have declared no conflicts of interest","output":"COVID-19 and lung cancer: What do we know?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analyzing data from a large, nationally distributed group of Japanese hospitals, we found a dramatic decline in both inpatient and outpatient volumes over the three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan from February-December 2020. We identified three key reasons for this fall in patient demand. First, COVID-19-related hygiene measures and behavioral changes significantly reduced non-COVID-19 infectious diseases. Second, consultations relating to chronic diseases fell sharply. Third, certain medical investigations and interventions were postponed or cancelled. Despite the drop in hospital attendances and admissions, COVID-19 is said to have brought the Japanese health care system to the brink of collapse. In this context, we explore longstanding systematic issues, finding that Japan's abundant supply of beds and current payment system may have introduced a perverse incentive to overprovide services, creating a mismatch between patient needs and the supply of health care resources. Poor coordination among health care providers and the highly decentralized governance of the health care system have also contributed to the crisis. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Japanese health care system beyond COVID-19, it is essential to promote specialization and differentiation of medical functions among hospitals, to strengthen governance, and to introduce appropriate payment reform.","output":"The paradox of the COVID-19 pandemic: the impact on patient demand in Japanese hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: COVID-19 has shaken views of what is normal and what is possible, raising questions about conventional norms, ways of working and our understanding of agility.

Epidemiological susceptibility to COVID-19 has been reported in patients with cancer. We aimed to systematically characterise clinical features and determine risk factors of COVID-19 disease severity for patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, we included all adult patients (aged 18 years) with any type of malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancy who were admitted to nine hospitals in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020. Enrolled patients were statistically matched (2:1) with patients admitted with COVID-19 who did not have cancer with propensity score on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, illness severity, and clinical interventions were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cancer as well as between patients with cancer with non-severe or severe COVID-19. COVID-19 disease severity was defined on admission on the basis of the WHO guidelines. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type, tumour stage, and antitumour treatments, were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR2000030807. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020, 13 077 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the nine hospitals in Wuhan and 232 patients with cancer and 519 statistically matched patients without cancer were enrolled. Median follow-up was 29 days (IQR 22C38) in patients with cancer and 27 days (20C35) in patients without cancer. Patients with cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than patients without cancer (148 [64%] of 232 vs 166 [32%] of 519; odds ratio [OR] 361 [95% CI 259C504]; p<00001). Risk factors previously reported in patients without cancer, such as older age; elevated interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and D-dimer; and reduced lymphocytes were validated in patients with cancer. We also identified advanced tumour stage (OR 260, 95% CI 105C643; p=0039), elevated tumour necrosis factor  (122, 101C147; p=0037), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (165, 103C278; p=0032), reduced CD4+ T cells (084, 071C098; p=0031), and reduced albuminCglobulin ratio (012, 002C077; p=0024) as risk factors of COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 were more likely to deteriorate into severe illness than those without cancer. The risk factors identified here could be helpful for early clinical surveillance of disease progression in patients with cancer who present with COVID-19.

Simulation is an efficient tool to provide medical education, especially in the case of incoming public health emergencies. This study investigated the role and activities of Italian simulation centres (SCs) during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The population was identified through a web search. The directors of Italian SCs were contacted via email and then enrolled. A structured interview was created, internally validated and administrated by phone to participants. RESULTS: Following the governments ordinance, 37 (88.37%) SCs had to be closed to the public. Twenty (46.51%) SCs organised in situ simulation while 7 (16.28%) of them organised simulation inside the centre. Twenty-three (53.49%) SCs resorted to telematic modalities to provide training about COVID-19 and 21 (48.84%) of them for other training. Up to date, 13 SCs are still closed to the public. CONCLUSIONS: Italy has been severely hit by COVID-19, with differences between the regions. Almost all the SCs were closed, with only a few delivering training. The SCs took advantage of emergent technologies to create new ways to train people safely. Unfortunately, nearly one-fourth of Italian SCs have not reopened yet.

If the virus in saliva in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals can be rapidly and efficiently inactivated by a beverage, the ingestion of the beverage may attenuate the spread of virus infection within a population. Recently, we reported that SARS-CoV-2 was significantly inactivated by treatment with black tea, green tea, roasted green tea and oolong tea, as well as their constituents, (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), theasinensin A (TSA), and galloylated theaflavins. However, it remains unclear to what extent tea inactivates the virus present in saliva, because saliva contains various proteins, nitrogenous products, electrolytes, and so on, which could influence the antivirus effect of tea. Here, we assessed whether tea inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 which was added in human saliva. A virus was added in healthy human saliva in vitro, and after treatment with black tea or green tea, the infectivity of the virus was evaluated by TCID(50) assays. The virus titer fell below the detectable level or less than 1/100 after treatment with black tea or green tea for 10 s. The black tea-treated virus less remarkably replicated in cells compared with the untreated virus. These findings suggest the possibility that the ingestion of tea may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in saliva in infected individuals, although clinical studies are required to determine the intensity and duration of the anti-viral effect of tea in saliva in humans.","output":"Rapid Inactivation In Vitro of SARS-CoV-2 in Saliva by Black Tea and Green Tea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the prevalence of depression and levels of physical fitness in high school students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Shuttle run for endurance capacity and standing long jump for muscle power were selected to estimate the states of type I and type II muscle fibers, respectively. This study found that the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score of MDG was significantly higher than those of other three groups. In addition, ODG and MDG showed the lowest interest in their school studies compared with other groups. Endurance capacity showed a significant difference among groups, whereas muscle power showed no significant difference among groups. In conclusion, this study suggests that higher levels of depression reflect a greater lack of interest in life and academics. Furthermore, lower endurance capacity appears to be associated with more severe levels of depression.

However, it is often difficult to estimate this risk due to the lack of accurate data on the numbers, locations, and movement patterns of these populations. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the use of three different data sources when investigating disease transmission risk between poultry populations in New Zealand including (1) cross-sectional survey data looking at the movement of goods and services within the commercial poultry industry, (2) backyard poultry sales data from the online auction site TradeMe?, and (3) citizen science data from the wild bird monitoring project eBird. The cross-sectional survey data and backyard poultry sales data were transformed into network graphs showing the connectivity of commercial and backyard poultry producers across different geographical regions. The backyard poultry network was also used to parameterise a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) simulation model to explore the behaviour of potential disease outbreaks. The citizen science data was used to create an additional map showing the spatial distribution of wild bird observations across New Zealand. To explore the potential for diseases to spread between each population, maps were combined into bivariate choropleth maps showing the overlap between movements within the commercial poultry industry, backyard poultry trades and, wild bird observations. Network analysis revealed that the commercial poultry network was highly connected with geographical clustering around the urban centres of Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch. The backyard poultry network was also a highly active trade network and displayed similar geographic clustering to the commercial network. In the disease simulation models, the high connectivity resulted in all suburbs becoming infected in 96.4 % of the SI simulations. Analysis of the eBird data included reports of over 80 species; the majority of which were identified as coastal seabirds or wading birds that showed little overlap with either backyard or commercial poultry. Overall, our study findings highlight how the spatial patterns of trading activity within the commercial poultry industry, alongside the movement of backyard poultry and wild birds, have the potential to contribute significantly to the spread of diseases between these populations. However, it is clear that in order to fully understand this risk landscape, further data integration is needed; including the use of additional datasets that have further information on critical variables such as environmental factors.","output":"Using multiple data sources to explore disease transmission risk between commercial poultry, backyard poultry, and wild birds in New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whilst preventing dehumanization of outgroups is a widely accepted goal in the field of countering violent extremism, current algorithms by social media platforms are focused on detecting individual samples through explicit language.

Collaborative game-based learning environments that can detect this off-task behavior in real-time have the potential to enhance collaboration between students by redirecting the conversation back to more productive topics.

Using classroom data collected from 13 groups of four students, we trained off-task dialogue models for text messages from a group chat feature integrated into Crystal Island: EcoJourneys, a collaborative game-based learning environment for middle school ecosystem science. We evaluate the effectiveness of the off-task dialogue models, which use different word embeddings (i.e., word2vec, ELMo, and BERT), as well as predictive off-task dialogue models that capture varying amounts of contextual information from the chat log. Results indicate that predictive off-task dialogue models that incorporate a window of recent context and represent the sequential nature of the chat messages achieve higher predictive performance compared to models that do not leverage this information. These findings suggest that off-task dialogue models for collaborative game-based learning environments can reliably recognize and predict students off-task behavior, which introduces the opportunity to adaptively scaffold collaborative dialogue.","output":"Detecting Off-Task Behavior from Student Dialogue in Game-Based Collaborative Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Poornima University, in collaboration with Jodhpur School of Public Health, hosted an insightful and interactive live global webinar on the topic of From AIDS to COVID: The Rocky road of Public Health on August 8, 2020. Findings: This report provides information about the coronavirus, the good and bad impact of COVID-19, and some of the major challenges that were faced all across the globe. Many questions are it the origin of the virus or the route of transmission of the virus remains unclear. But the good thing is that there were many innovations in the field of testing, repurposing of drugs, and rapid development of vaccines to reduce the spread of the pandemic. Conclusion: The findings show that a lot of questions are yet to be answered and that there is a need of focusing on public health. There were many learnings from this pandemic and one of the most important lessons was that the involvement of communities is a key step to face such global challenges. The pandemic is not going anywhere soon, and therefore, it becomes necessary to bring in change and sustain it for the future.

Current tools for taxonomic assignment from sequencing reads based on alignment or alignment-free k-mer approaches may not perform optimally in cases where the sequences diverge significantly from the reference sequences. Furthermore, many tools may not incorporate the genomic coverage of assigned reads as part of overall likelihood of a correct taxonomic assignment for a sample. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe the development of a pipeline that incorporates a multi-task learning model based on convolutional neural network (MT-CNN) and a Bayesian ranking approach to identify and rank the most likely human virus from sequence reads. For taxonomic assignment of reads, the MT-CNN model outperformed Kraken 2, Centrifuge, and Bowtie 2 on reads generated from simulated divergent HIV-1 genomes and was more sensitive in identifying SARS as the closest relation in four RNA sequencing datasets for SARS-CoV-2 virus. For genomic region assignment of assigned reads, the MT-CNN model performed competitively compared with Bowtie 2 and the region assignments were used for estimation of genomic coverage that was incorporated into a na?ve Bayesian network together with the proportion of taxonomic assignments to rank the likelihood of candidate human viruses from sequence data. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a pipeline that combines a novel MT-CNN model that is able to identify viruses with divergent sequences together with assignment of the genomic region, with a Bayesian approach to ranking of taxonomic assignments by taking into account both the number of assigned reads and genomic coverage. The pipeline is available at GitHub via https://github.com/MaHaoran627/CNN_Virus.

The first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 is in the upper respiratory tract, yet we know very little about whether COVID-19 vaccines induce immunity in this compartment, if at all. We analysed salivary antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) following 2 i.m. injections of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. Salivary anti-Spike/RBD IgG was detected after 1 dose and increased further after dose 2, reflecting the systemic immune response. Interestingly, salivary anti-Spike/RBD IgA associated with the secretory component (sIgA) was detected in nearly all vaccinated participants after one dose of mRNA vaccine, with anti-Spike sIgA diminishing after dose 2. Vaccination with ChAdOx1-S (Ad) followed by mRNA induced similar levels of salivary anti-Spike/RBD IgG and IgA, and both mRNA/mRNA and Ad/mRNA regimes provoked modest neutralizing capacity in this biofluid. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA/mRNA and Ad/mRNA vaccination induces antibodies in the saliva, and in response to one dose of mRNA, a compartmentalized and transient antigen-specific sIgA response is generated that does not correlate with systemic immunity.","output":"A mucosal antibody response is induced by intra-muscular SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on trauma referrals to a National Neurosurgical Centre.

Members of this viral family have the longest genome of all RNA viruses, and express up to 29 proteins establishing complex interactions with the host proteome. Deciphering these interactions is essential to identify cellular pathways hijacked by these viruses to replicate and escape innate immunity. Virus-host interactions also provide key information to select targets for antiviral drug development. Here, we have manually curated the literature to assemble a unique dataset of 1311 coronavirus-host proteinCprotein interactions. Functional enrichment and network-based analyses showed coronavirus connections to RNA processing and translation, DNA damage and pathogen sensing, interferon production, and metabolic pathways. In particular, this global analysis pinpointed overlooked interactions with translation modulators (GIGYF2-EIF4E2), components of the nuclear pore, proteins involved in mitochondria homeostasis (PHB, PHB2, STOML2), and methylation pathways (MAT2A/B). Finally, interactome data provided a rational for the antiviral activity of some drugs inhibiting coronaviruses replication.

Rotavirus vaccination was introduced into the United Kingdom childhood vaccination schedule in July 2013, with high coverage (>90%) achieved by June 2016. We used an emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance system to assess the impact of the rotavirus vaccination programme, specifically through the demonstration of any immediate and continuing impact on ED gastroenteritis visits in England. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study used syndromic surveillance data collected from 3 EDs in the two years before (July 2011June 2013) and 3 years post (July 2013June 2016) introduction of rotavirus vaccination. The weekly levels of ED visits for gastroenteritis (by age group and in total) during the period before rotavirus vaccination was first described alongside the findings of laboratory surveillance of rotavirus during the same period. An interrupted time-series analysis was then performed to demonstrate the impact of rotavirus vaccination introduction on gastroenteritis ED visit levels. RESULTS: During the two years before vaccine introduction ED visits for gastroenteritis in total and for the 0C4 years age group were seen to rise and fall in line with the seasonal rotavirus increases reported by laboratory surveillance. ED gastroenteritis visits by young children were lower in the three years following introduction of rotavirus vaccination (reduced from 8% of visits to 6% of visits). These attendance levels in young children (0-4years) remained higher than in older age groups, however the previously large seasonal increases in children were greatly reduced, from peaks of 16% to 3C10% of ED visits per week. CONCLUSIONS: ED syndromic surveillance demonstrated a reduction in gastroenteritis visits following rotavirus vaccine introduction.

METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published since January 1990 using terms combined with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). We included articles evaluating diagnostic modalities for anosmia, written in the English language, used original data, and had two or more patients. RESULTS: A total of 2065 unique titles were returned upon the initial search. Of these, 226 abstracts were examined, yielding 27 full-text articles meeting inclusion criteria (Level of evidence ranging from 1 to 4; most level 2). The studies included a total of 13,577 patients. The most utilized diagnostic tools were orthonasal smell tests (such as the Sniffin Sticks and the UPSIT, along with validated abridged smell tests). Though various imaging modalities (including MRI and CT) were frequently mentioned in the workup of olfactory dysfunction, routine imaging was not used to primarily diagnose smell loss. CONCLUSION: The literature includes several studies on validity and reliability for various smell tests in diagnosing anosmia. Along with a thorough history and physical, validated orthonasal smell tests should be part of the workup of the patient with suspected olfactory dysfunction.

Five hundred forty-seven infection control nurses from nine different hospitals participated in the study and completed questionnaires on the self-identity, cognitive emotion regulation, social support, and career success scales. The results from structural equation modeling reveal that self-identity has a positive effect on positive emotion regulation and social support and a negative impact on negative emotion regulation. Positive (negative) emotion regulation has a positive (negative) effect on social support. All antecedents have a positive impact on career success except negative emotion regulation, which has a negative one.

Patients 18 years or older were excluded. Our outcome of interest was 72-hour return ED encounter. We assessed changes in proportions of return visits over time using the Spearman rank-correlation test. We performed survey-weighted univariable and multivariable logistic regressions to identify factors associated with 72-hour return visit status. Results A total of 501 million (95% confidence interval [CI], 452-551 million) pediatric survey-weighted ED encounters occurred during the 17-year study period, of which 14,353,697 (3.2%; 95% CI, 2.7%-3.7%) represented 72-hour return visits. The proportion of pediatric ED return visits increased from 22.9 to 36.5 per 1000 pediatric encounters over the study period ([rho] = 0.68, P < 0.01). Most return visits were of lower acuity (73.0%; 95% CI, 68.6%-11.5%), and 8.1% (95% CI, 6.3%-9.9%) of return visits were admitted to the hospital or transferred to a different facility. In multivariable analyses, older age, abnormal heart rate, and abnormal temperature had lower adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 72-hour return visits compared with encounters not classified as return visit.

Results A total of 4,463 patients with available BMI and outcome data were included in this secondary analysis. A total of 790 (17.7%) and 710 (15.9%) had the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) over a median hospital stay of 13 (interquartile range: 8) days.

Significant age interaction contributed to nonuniform risks observed for IMV requirement across BMI groups. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis showed that being underweight was an independent predictor of prolonged IMV requirement regardless of BMI criteria used (P for both criteria < 0.01), whereas obesity was found to correlate with the need for intensive care unit admission using Asia-Pacific cutoffs (odds ratio [OR] 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03 C 1.59; P = 0.029).

As trusted, accessible providers, FQHCs are well\\\\positioned to help mitigate further inequities by providing access to COVID\\\\19 vaccinations in their communities. This is particularly critical given early data that suggest racial/ethnic communities most affected by COVID\\\\19 have been the least likely to access the vaccine during the first 3 months of administration. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine COVID\\\\19 vaccination rates within US FQHCs by race/ethnicity and (2) examine racial/ethnic equity within states among FQHC populations. STUDY DESIGN: Our primary data source was HRSA Health Center COVID\\\\19 Survey data (as of March 2021), which included a response rate of 69% of all FQHCs in the US. Our secondary data source was the 2019 Uniform Data System. We first generated descriptive statistics to examine vaccination rates across FQHCs by race/ethnicity. Next, for each racial/ethnic group, we calculated vaccination equity ratios within each state by calculating the number of observed vaccinations within the racial/ethnic group divided by the number of expected vaccinations within the group, where the expected is based on the percent of the FQHC population that belongs to that racial/ethnic group. Observed to expected ratios less than 1.0 suggest that the racial/ethnic group has received fewer vaccinations than they should have received if vaccinations were equitably administered by race/ethnicity.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As of March 2021, across FQHCs, 59.1% of all initiated vaccines were with racial/ethnic minority patients; this included 31.8% with Hispanic patients, 13.2% with Black patients, 8.3% with Asian patients, 3.4% with American Indian/Alaskan Native/Pacific Islander patients, and 3.2% with patients of >1 race. When accounting for the racial/ethnic composition of the FQHC patient populations, non\\\\Hispanic White (equity ratio = 1.35) and Asian (equity ratio = 1.66) patients were more likely to receive the vaccine, whereas Hispanic (equity ratio = 0.76), Black (equity ratio = 0.62), and American Indian/Alaskan Native/Pacific Islander (equity ratio = 0.29) patients were less likely to receive the vaccine. Vaccination equity varied widely by state. For instance, Black patients had the most equitable access to vaccines at FQHCs in AL, CA, NC, and PA, and the least equitable access in AZ, ID, IN, KS, MI, MN, OK, OR, and TX. CONCLUSIONS: FQHCs have played a pivotal role in providing access to COVID\\\\19 vaccinations to racial/ethnic minority patients. However, racial/ethnic equity in FQHC vaccine administration varies widely by state, which may be driven in part by state COVID\\\\19 eligibility group guidelines. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: States should leverage FQHCs as major vaccine administration sites in order to improve vaccination equity. In states with low vaccination equity within FQHC populations, additional resources dedicated to vaccine enrollment assistance and outreach in Hispanic, Black, and/or Native communities are essential, particularly as vaccine eligibility opens up to the general public.

Genetic predisposition influences the clinical course of infectious diseases. We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes ACE2, TIRAP, and factor X are associated with clinical outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study. All patients who visited the emergency department with SARS-CoV-2 infection proven by polymerase chain reaction were included. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in ACE2 (rs2285666), TIRAP (rs8177374) and factor X (rs3211783) were assessed. The outcomes were mortality, respiratory failure and venous thromboembolism. Respiratory failure was defined as the necessity of >5 litres/minute oxygen, high flow nasal oxygen suppletion or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, 116 patients (35% female, median age 65 [inter quartile range 55C75] years) were included and treated according to the then applicable guidelines. Sixteen patients (14%) died, 44 patients (38%) had respiratory failure of whom 23 required endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation, and 20 patients (17%) developed venous thromboembolism. The percentage of TIRAP polymorphism carriers in the survivor group was 28% as compared to 0% in the non-survivor group (p = 0.01, Bonferroni corrected p = 0.02). Genotype distribution of ACE2 and factor X did not differ between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSION: This study shows that carriage of TIRAP polymorphism rs8177374 could be associated with a significantly lower mortality in COVID-19. This TIRAP polymorphism may be an important predictor in the outcome of COVID-19.","output":"Association of genetic variations in ACE2, TIRAP and factor X with outcomes in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychologists have convincingly demonstrated that preferences are not always stable and, instead, are often constructed based on information available in the judgment or decision context. In 4 studies with experts (accountants and actuaries in Studies 1 and 2, respectively) and a diverse lay population (Studies 3 and 4), the evidence was consistent with the highly numerate being more likely than the less numerate to construct their preferences by rating a numerically inferior bet as superior (i.e., the bets effect). Thus, the effect generalizes beyond a college student sample, and preference construction differs by numeracy. Contrary to prior thinking about preference construction, however, high expertise and high ability (rather than low) consistently related to the paradoxical phenomenon. Results across studies including Study 3's experimental modifications of the task supported the hypothesized number comparison process (and not a lack of expertise with monetary outcomes and probabilities or numeracy\\\\related differences in attention to numbers) as the effect's underlying cause. The bets effect was not attenuated by Study 4's instructions to think about what would be purchased with bet winnings.

COVID-19 inflammation is mediated by interleukin (IL)-1 and is a disease that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, lung inflammation, thrombosis, stroke, renal failure and headache, to name a few. Strategies that inhibit IL-1 are certainly helpful in COVID-19 and can represent one of the therapeutic options. However, to date, COVID-19 therapy has been scarce and, in many cases, ineffective, since there are no specific drugs other than vaccine that can solve this serious health problem. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, which are the newest approach, are already available and will certainly meet the many expectations of the population. mRNA vaccines, coated with protected soft fatty lipids, use genetic mRNA (plus various inactive excipients) to make a piece of the coronavirus spike protein, which will instruct the immune system to produce specific antibodies. The soft fatty lipids allow the entry of mRNA into cells where it is absorbed into the cytoplasm and initiates the synthesis of the spike protein. In addition, vaccination also activates T cells that help the immune system respond to further exposure to the coronavirus. mRNA induces the synthesis of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus which stimulates the antibody response of the vaccinated person with the production of neutralizing antibodies. The new variant of the coronavirus-19 has been detected in the UK where, at present, the government has imposed a lockdown with restrictions on international movements. The virus variant had already infected 1/4 of the total cases and in December 2020, it reached 2/3 of those infected in the UK.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library was conducted for all eligible studies range from inception to February 29, 2020. Studies with control group were included. Treatment group received convalescent plasma therapy, and control group may receive any therapy other than convalescent plasma therapy. Odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for categorical and continuous outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1997 patients from 13 studies were included, and seven studies were prospectively designed. Pooled analysis indicated convalescent plasma treatment significantly reduced the mortality by 51% (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.67). Subgroup analyses by publication time, study design, and influenza A revealed similar results. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were stable. In addition, convalescent plasma therapy reduced mechanical ventilation requirement (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.59), while it was not associated with less use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.83 to 4.83) and shorter length of hospital stay (MD: ?2.20, 95% CI: ?4.98 to 0.57 days).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were admitted to a makeshift intensive care unit (ICU). All patients underwent bedside lung ultrasonography one to two times per day. The patients were either intubated, treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), or given high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after a discussion with the multidisciplinary group after their conditions worsened. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed daily after intubation, and patients received mechanical ventilation. Lung ultrasound was performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after patients were admitted to the ICU; if the patient was intubated, LUS determination was performed before intubation within 24 h (T1) and on days 1, 2, 5, and 7 after intubation (T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively).The goal of this study was to evaluate the severity of lung aeration loss in intubated and non-intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by ultrasound at different time points within one week. RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were included in this study, including nine who were intubated and mechanically ventilated and seven patients without intubation. The number of elderly individuals in the intubated group was higher than in the non-intubated group (P < 0.05). In addition, there were more male than female patients in both groups. Patient characteristics (BMI, SOFA, and PaO(2)/FiO(2) value) were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05). The 28-day mortality rate of intubated patients was higher than that of non-intubated patients; six patients in the intubated group and two patients in the non-intubated group died. Nine intubated patients showed changes in LUS within seven days (n = 9). The mean LUS within 24 h before intubation was 12.8  1.3. LUS was significantly higher on T1 than on T5 (P <0.05), and did not significantly differ from T1 to T4. Comparing LUS between intubated and non-intubated patients on T1 showed that the LUS of intubated patients was significantly higher than that of non-intubated patients (P <0.05). Between the two patient groups, oxygenation index was 140.1  7.7 vs. 137.8  5.9 on T1, and the respiratory rate of the two groups was 26  5 vs. 28  4 breaths/min. Neither oxygenation index nor RR significantly differed between the two groups.

To base the discussion on facts, the young state of Norway established Landsskogtakseringen C the worlds first National Forest Inventory (NFI). Field work started in 1919 and was carried out by county. Trees were recorded on 10 m wide strips with 1C5 km interspaces. Site quality and land cover categories were recorded along each strip. Results for the first county were published in 1920, and by 1930 most forests below the coniferous tree line were inventoried. The 2nd to 5th inventories followed in the years 1937C1986. As of 1954, temporary sample plot clusters on a 3 km  3 km grid were used as sampling units. PRESENT: The current NFI grid was implemented in the 6th NFI from 1986 to 1993, when permanent plots on a 3 km  3 km grid were established below the coniferous tree line. As of the 7th inventory in 1994, the NFI is continuous, and 1/5 of the plots are measured annually. All trees with a diameter  5 cm are recorded on circular, 250 m(2) plots. The NFI grid was expanded in 2005 to cover alpine regions with 3 km  9 km and 9 km  9 km grids. In 2012, the NFI grid within forest reserves was doubled along the cardinal directions. Clustered temporary plots are used periodically to facilitate county-level estimates. As of today, more than 120 variables are recorded in the NFI including bilberry cover, drainage status, deadwood, and forest health. Land-use changes are monitored and trees outside forests are recorded. FUTURE: Considerable research efforts towards the integration of remote sensing technologies enable the publication of the Norwegian Forest Resource Map since 2015, which is also used for small area estimation at the municipality level. On the analysis side, capacity and software for long term growth and yield prognosis are being developed. Furthermore, we foresee the inclusion of further variables for monitoring ecosystem services, and an increasing demand for mapped information. The relatively simple NFI design has proven to be a robust choice for satisfying steadily increasing information needs and concurrently providing consistent time series.","output":"A century of National Forest Inventory in Norway C informing past, present, and future decisions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) can affect patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but many questions remain open about its very variable incidence across the world, the actual link between the viral infection and the fungal superinfection, the significance of Aspergillus recovery in a respiratory sample, and the management of such cases. This review addresses these questions and aims at providing some clues for the practical diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) in a clinical perspective. RECENT FINDINGS: Definitions have been proposed for possible/probable/proven CAPA, but distinction between colonization and invasive fungal infection is difficult and not possible in most cases in the absence of histopathological proof or positive galactomannan in serum. Most importantly, the recovery of an Aspergillus by a direct (culture, PCR) or indirect (galactomannan) test in a respiratory sample is an indicator of worse outcome, which justifies a screening for early detection and initiation of preemptive antifungal therapy in such cases. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness of IPA among ICU patients.

To test the tool, we targeted MSCs required for mechanical nociception in a specific subset of sensory neurons in intact larvae. Expression of GsMTx4 in these neurons results in robust inhibition of mechanical nociception, demonstrating the toxin is active when expressed in vivo.

In this scenario, precision nutrition, namely personalized dietary patterns based on deep phenotyping and on metabolomics, microbiome, and nutrigenetics of each case, might be more efficient for infertile patients than applying a generic nutritional approach. In this review, we report on new insights into the nutritional management of infertile patients, discussing the main nutrigenetic, nutrigenomic, and microbiomic aspects that should be investigated to achieve effective personalized nutritional interventions.

In the case of fish, this process initiated in the brain has traditionally been considered to be a critical rearing point and despite the pioneering molecular work carried out in other flatfishes, the underlying molecular basis is still relatively poorly characterized. Turbot brain transcriptome of three developmental stages (pre-metamorphic, climax of metamorphosis and post-metamorphic) were analyzed to study the gene expression dynamics throughout the metamorphic process. A total of 1570 genes were differentially expressed in the three developmental stages and we found a specific pattern of gene expression at each stage. Unexpectedly, at the climax stage of metamorphosis, we found highly expressed genes related to the immune response, while the biological pathway enrichment analysis in pre-metamorphic and post-metamorphic were related to cell differentiation and oxygen carrier activity, respectively. In addition, our results confirm the importance of thyroid stimulating hormone, increasing its expression during metamorphosis. Based on our findings, we assume that immune system activation during the climax of metamorphosis stage could be related to processes of larval tissue inflammation, resorption and replacement, as

Lack of a suitable assay has been a major hindrance for enzyme kinetic studies and a large-scale inhibitor screen for SARS 3CL proteinase. Since SARS 3CL proteinase belongs to the cysteine protease family (family C3 in clan CB) with a chymotrypsin fold, it is important to understand the catalytic mechanism of SARS 3CL proteinase to determine whether the proteolysis proceeds through a general base catalysis mechanism like chymotrypsin or an ion pair mechanism like papain. We have established a continuous colorimetric assay for SARS 3CL proteinase and applied it to study the enzyme catalytic mechanism. The proposed catalytic residues His41 and Cys145 were confirmed to be critical for catalysis by mutating to Ala, while the Cys145 to Ser mutation resulted in an active enzyme with a 40-fold lower activity. From the pH dependency of catalytic activity, the pK(a)'s for His41 and Cys145 in the wild-type enzyme were estimated to be 6.38 and 8.34, while the pK(a)'s for His41 and Ser145 in the C145S mutant were estimated to be 6.15 and 9.09, respectively. The C145S mutant has a normal isotope effect in D(2)O for general base catalysis, that is, reacts slower in D(2)O, while the wild-type enzyme shows an inverse isotope effect which may come from the lower activation enthalpy. The pK(a) values measured for the active site residues and the activity of the C145S mutant are consistent with a general base catalysis mechanism and cannot be explained by a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair model.","output":"3C-like proteinase from SARS coronavirus catalyzes substrate hydrolysis by a general base mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently a new infectious agent of zoonotic origin and viral etiology, identified on January 7, 2020, belonging to the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2, has been name by the World Health Organization as a very high risk for all countries The disease has been named COVID-19, it has its origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, epicenter of the disease;the first cases were presented in December 2019 Information on pregnant women with COVID-19 is limited;there are many things to know about it: One of them is if there is vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other is about presence of the virus in the different maternal and newborn fluids Health professionals responsible for the care of pregnant women should be familiar with the epidemiological evolution, the clinical manifestations during pregnancy, the care of the exposed newborn and the measures of prevention to avoid disease ? 2020 Sociedad de Obstetricia y Ginecologia de Venezuela All rights reserved","output":"Nuevo coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) y embarazo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Joint replacement is very cost-effective and provides long-term improvements in pain, mobility and quality of life for most patients.23 In Australia, more than 105,000 primary and revision hip and knee replacements were performed in 2018, and approximately 35% of these operations were performed in the public sector.45 The projected burden of primary total hip and knee replacement in Australia is expected to increase by 208% and 276%, respectively, by the year 2030.6 Unfortunately, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a nationwide, temporary suspension of non-urgent elective surgery was implemented.

In an unknown percentage of patients, this leads to a condition called hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD). Characteristic clinical symptoms of HOD progress slowly over months and consist of a rhythmic palatal tremor, vertical pendular nystagmus, and Holmes tremor of the upper limbs. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) with tractography is a promising method to identify functional pathway lesions along the cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity and to generate a deeper understanding of the HOD pathophysiology. The incidence of HOD development following stroke and the timeline of clinical symptoms have not yet been determined in prospective studiesa prerequisite for the surveillance of patients at risk. Methods and Analysis: Patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum with a topo-anatomical relation to the GMT are recruited within certified stroke units of the Interdisciplinary Neurovascular Network of the Rhine-Main. Matching lesions are identified using a predefined MRI template. Eligible patients are prospectively followed up and present at 4 and 8 months after the index event. During study visits, a clinical neurological examination and brain MRI, including high-resolution T2-, proton-density-weighted imaging, and DTI tractography, are performed. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing is optional if palatal tremor is encountered. Study Outcomes: The primary endpoint of this prospective clinical multicenter study is to determine the frequency of radiological HOD development in patients with a posterior fossa stroke affecting the GMT at 8 months after the index event. Secondary endpoints are identification of (1) the timeline and relevance of clinical symptoms, (2) lesion localizations more prone to HOD occurrence, and (3) the best MR-imaging regimen for HOD identification.

However, an important adverse effect that has raised concerns in the recent times is its possible cardiac toxicity, mainly the 'QT,' prolongation in electro-cardiogram, which has created a sense of apprehension for its use in traditional indications like rheumatological conditions. In decades of HCQ use by rheumatologists, this cardiac toxicity was rarely ever seen. So, what is different in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era? This review outlines various studies on HCQ reporting cardiac adverse events in patients with rheumatic diseases as well as, in patients with COVID-19 infection. In addition, two important observations were noticed; first, the doses that have been used in the current COVID-19 scenario are much higher than what are used in rheumatology. Second, COVID-19 infection may by itself lead to intrinsic cardiac abnormalities, which is probably acting as a confounder. Most of the available and credible data suggest that HCQ is a safe drug, including the RECOVERY trial stating no cardiotoxicity by HCQ. This review reinforces the safety profile of HCQ in a data-driven manner and addresses the concerns of the physicians.

Future decision-making policies require consistent data on the management and prognosis of the older patients (> 70 years old) with COVID-19 admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Characteristics, management, and prognosis of critically ill old patients (> 70 years) were extracted from the international prospective COVID-ICU database. A propensity score weighted-comparison evaluated the impact of intubation upon admission on Day-90 mortality. RESULTS: The analysis included 1199 (28% of the COVID-ICU cohort) patients (median [interquartile] age 74 [72-78] years). Fifty-three percent, 31%, and 16% were 70-74, 75-79, and over 80 years old, respectively. The most frequent comorbidities were chronic hypertension (62%), diabetes (30%), and chronic respiratory disease (25%). Median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3 (2-3). Upon admission, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 154 (105-222). 740 (62%) patients were intubated on Day-1 and eventually 938 (78%) during their ICU stay. Overall Day-90 mortality was 46% and reached 67% among the 193 patients over 80 years old. Mortality was higher in older patients, diabetics, and those with a lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio upon admission, cardiovascular dysfunction, and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 participants, average age 13.1 years, were enrolled. At baseline, second molars were randomized into test and control, and assessed by ICDAS, SOPROLIFE, and DIAGNOdent. An independent investigator irradiated test molars with a CO2 laser (wavelength 9.3 m, pulse duration 4 s, pulse repetition rate 43 Hz, beam diameter 250 m, average fluence 3.9 J/cm2, 20 laser pulses per spot). Test molars received laser and fluoride treatment, control teeth fluoride alone. Fluoride varnish was applied at baseline and at 6 months. After 6 and 12 months, teeth were again assessed. RESULTS: A total of 57 participants completed the 6-month and 51 the 12-month recall. Laser-treated surfaces showed very slight ICDAS improvements over time with ICDAS change - 1 in 11% and 8%, no changes (ICDAS change 0) in 68% and 67%, and slightly worsened (ICDAS change 1) in 19% and 24% at 6- and 12-month recalls, respectively, and worsened by two scores in 2% at both recall time points. Control teeth showed significantly higher ICDAS increases, with 47% and 25% showing ICDAS change 0, ICDAS change 1 in 49% and 55%, and ICDAS change 2 in 4% and 20% at 6- and 12-month recalls, respectively. Differences in ICDAS changes between the groups were statistically significant (P = 0.0002 and P < 0.0001; Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, exact). A total of 22% of the participants developed ICDAS 3 scores on the control teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Microsecond short-pulsed 9.3-m CO2 laser irradiation markedly inhibits caries progression in pits and fissures in comparison with fluoride varnish alone.

The aim of this study was to clarify the factors contributing to death in children receiving home medical care from the child death review database. METHODS: Children receiving home medical care were enrolled from the child death review database from 2014 to 2016 in Aichi prefecture, Japan, with a population of one million children. Types of medical care and factors contributing to death were examined. RESULTS: Of the 631 children who died, 40 children (6%) were receiving home medical care (21: tracheostomy; 19: ventilator; 26: suctioning of naso-oral secretions; 19: oxygen inhalation; 32: tube feeding; 6: urethral catheterization; and 1: peritoneal dialysis). The death rate was 50 times that in the general population of children. Ten children had contributory factors that seemed to be preventable. In four children, the families could not replace the tracheostomy tubes during an accident. In three, oxygen saturation or ventilator alarms were not set appropriately. In two, an oxygen cylinder became empty. One child fell down from a seat in a car. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of devices and correct guidance to caregivers may reduce the death rate in children receiving home medical care. IMPACT: Children receiving home medical care, such as tracheostomy care, mechanical ventilation, or tube feeding, need special attention to prevent unexpected death. In this population-based child death review, 6% of children received home medical care, and it was estimated that 1 of 100 children receiving home medical care died per year.

Many hospitalized patients may still test COVID-19 positive, even after resolution of symptoms. Thus, a pressing concern for clinicians is the safety of discharging these asymptomatic patients if they have any remaining infectivity. This case report explores the viral viability in a patient with persistent COVID-19 over the course of a two-month hospitalization. Positive nasopharyngeal swab samples, analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR), were collected and isolated in the laboratory, and infectious doses were analyzed throughout the hospitalization period. The patient experienced waning symptoms by hospital day 40 and had no viable virus growth in the laboratory by hospital day 41, suggesting no risk of infectivity, despite positive RT-PCR results, which prolonged his hospital stay. Notably, this case showed infectivity for at least 24 days from disease onset, which is longer than the discontinuation of transmission-based precautions recommendation by CDC. Thus, our findings suggest that the timeline for discontinuing transmission-based precautions may need to be extended for patients with prolonged illness.

We review different biomarkers to systematically analyzed these values to evaluate whether are they are correlated with the severity of COVID-19 disease and so their ability to be a predictor for progression. METHODS: The current meta-analysis was carried out to identify relevant articles using eight different databases regarding the values of biomarkers and risk factors of significance that predict progression of mild or moderate cases into severe and critical cases. We defined the eligibility criteria using a PICO model. RESULTS: Twenty-two relevant articles were selected for meta-analysis the following biomarkers C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, LDH, neutrophil, %PD-1 expression, D-dimer, creatinine, AST and Cortisol all recorded high cut-off values linked to severe and critical cases while low lymphocyte count, and low Albumin level were recorded.

COVID-19 has helped reinforce the story and ilustrate the results that technologies achieve on a large scale. Modern marketing and management approaches in insurance are viewed as an activity to optimize and control the insurance company's innovation and marketing activities. It would allow taking a strategicaly advantageous position in the insurance market. There are two kinds of insurance marketing: structural and commodity. Structural marketing could help to solve the problem of the economic efficiency of the activity of insurance companies. Commodity marketing helps to improve financial activity and, as a result, to increase profitability. This article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments within the scientific discussion on the place and prospects marketing and management in insurance (strategies, functions, principles) in the context of key innovation metrics. The study's primary purpose is to confirm the hypothesis about the functional link between the level of innovative development of the country and key insurance determinants as drivers for transformation in marketing strategies of insurance companies. In this regard, the array of input data is presented in the form of seven independent variables (regressors), six of which denote innovation measures, one is control variable, and five dependent variables (regressands), which identify the insurance sector. The study of the impact of innovation metrics on the insurance sector of the country in the article is carried out in the following logical sequence: 1) the formation of an array of input data;selection of relevant indicators using Principal Component Analysis;2) formalization of functional relationships between variables by constructing five-panel Multifactor regression models with Random Effects;and 3) interpretation of the obtained results. Seventeen countries of Central and Eastern Europe were selected as the object of the study for the period from 2004 till 2019.

Due to lower sensitivity, guidelines recommend confirmatory microbiological culture following negative RADT results. This process is time-consuming, and adherence is often poor, resulting in high rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. We sought to evaluate the impact of switching from RADTs to point-of-care (POC) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on use of antibiotics in primary care, when used as part of an antibiotic stewardship initiative. METHODS: In this retrospective beforeCafter study, electronic medical records of any patients presenting with suspected acute pharyngitis (June 2018CMay 2019) across 15 outpatient primary care clinics were evaluated. Strep A was detected using the cobas Strep A assay (cobas Liat system). RESULTS: Analysis of 10 081 eligible patient records showed that POC PCR testing resulted in a 44.1% reduction in antibiotic prescribing for patients with a negative POC PCR test result (10.1% PCR vs 18.0% RADT; P < .0001).

Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induce antibody production, six of these are immunodominant epitopes in individuals, and 23 are conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We find that the immunodominant epitopes of individuals with domestic (China) SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of individuals with imported (Europe) SARS-CoV-2, which may be caused by mutations on the S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we find several epitopes on the S protein that elicit neutralizing antibodies against D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to vaccine design against coronaviruses.","output":"The immunodominant and neutralization linear epitopes for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the World Health Organisation announced the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As well as respiratory failure, the SARS-CoV-2 may cause central nervous system (CNS) involvement, including delirium occurring in critically ill patients (ICU delirium). Due attention must be paid to this subject in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delirium, the detection of which takes less than two minutes, is frequently underestimated during daily routine ICU care, but it may be a prodromal symptom of infection or hypoxia associated with severe respiratory failure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, systematic delirium monitoring using validated tests (CAM-ICU or ICDSC) may be sacrificed. This is likely to be due to the fact that the main emphasis is placed on organisational issues, i.e. the lack of ventilators, setting priorities for limited mechanical ventilation options, and a shortage of personal protective equipment. Early identification of patients with delirium is critical in patients with COVID-19 because the occurrence of delirium may be an early symptom of worsening respiratory failure or of infectious spread to the CNS mediated by potential neuroinvasive mechanisms of the coronavirus. The purpose of this review is to identify problems related to the development of delirium during the COVID-19 epidemic, which are presented in three areas: i) factors contributing to delirium in COVID-19, ii) potential pathophysiological factors of delirium in COVID-19, and iii) long-term consequences of delirium in COVID-19.

The green emission of the CDs could be quenched after the addition of mercury ions or copper ions, and the blue emission of the CDs could be inhibited using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Furthermore, the quenched fluorescence of CDs/Cu(2+) could be recovered through the addition of glyphosate. We developed a multifunctional chemical sensor by using these special fluorescence materials.

METHODS: In a comparative cross-sectional, observational study, patients recovered from COVID-19 were included in this study. All included subjects exhibited a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Spectral domain macular OCTA was performed at least 2 weeks after recovery from systemic COVID-19. Vessel density (VD) of the superficial (SCP) and deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) and the area of the FAZ were measured in COVID-19 recovered patients versus age-matched normal controls. RESULTS: Thirty-one recovered COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy normal controls were studied. Mean quality scan index was 7.64  0.66 in the COVID cases and 8.34  0.71 in the normal controls (pa?=a?0.001). Mean SCP VD and DCP VD of the COVID cohort were significantly lower than the SCP VD and DCP VD of the control group in the foveal and parafoveal regions. FAZ area was greater in the COVID cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant. In addition, in the COVID cohort, VD of the SCP and DCP were lower in patients with a history of COVID-19 hospitalization versus those without such a history, but this did not reach statistical significance.

Life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread all over the world, infecting more than 33,500,000 people and killing over 1 million of them as of October 2020. Infected individuals without any symptoms might still transfer the virus to others underlining the extraordinary transmissibility of this new coronavirus. In order to identify early infections effectively, treat patients on time and control disease spreading, rapid, accurate and onsite testing methods are urgently required. RESULTS: Here we report the development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based method to detect SARS-CoV-2 genes ORF8 and N directly from pharyngeal swab samples. The established reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay detects SARS-CoV-2 directly from pharyngeal swab samples without previous time-consuming and laborious RNA extraction. The assay is sensitive and highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection, showing no cross reactivity when tested on 20 other respiratory pathogens. The assay is 12 times faster and 10 times cheaper than routine reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction, depending on the assay used. CONCLUSION: The fast and easy to handle RT-LAMP assay amplifying specifically the genomic regions ORF8 and N of SARS-CoV-2 is ideally suited for POCT at e.g. railway stations, airports or hospitals.

California has prioritized smoking cessation among these individuals through the Tobacco-Free for Recovery Initiative, which includes an intervention aimed at supporting programs in implementing tobacco-free grounds. The current study examined changes in client smoking prevalence, tobacco use behaviors, and receipt of cessation services among the first seven programs participating in the initiative. METHODS Residential treatment program clients completed cross-sectional surveys at the start of the intervention (baseline: n = 249), at an interim timepoint post-baseline (interim: n = 275), and at the end of the intervention 15 months later (post-intervention: n = 219). All participants reported smoking status. Current smokers reported tobacco use behaviors, and both current smokers and those who quit in treatment reported receipt of cessation services. Univariate analyses explored differences across the three timepoints and multivariate logistic regression assessed change from baseline to interim and baseline to post-intervention. RESULTS Client smoking prevalence decreased from 54.2% at pre- to 26.6% at post-intervention (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.13, 0.45). Current smokers and those who quit while in treatment reported an increase in NRT/pharmacotherapy (11.9% vs. 25.2%; AOR = 3.02, CI = 1.24, 7.35).

CONCLUSION An intervention to promote tobacco-free grounds implemented in residential SUD treatment programs was associated with a significant reduction in client smoking and an increase in NRT/pharmacotherapy. These associations were observed both before the COVID-19 pandemic and in the early stages of the pandemic, suggesting that they may be due to the intervention rather than to the pandemic.","output":"Reducing tobacco use in substance use treatment: An intervention to promote tobacco-free grounds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amphibian skin secretion is an ideal source of antimicrobial peptides that are difficult to induce drug resistance to due to their membrane-targeting mechanism as a new treatment scheme.

The ultimate goal of such work was to improve access to hearing healthcare for individuals that might be unable or reluctant to seek audiological help in a clinic. In 2015, Diane Van Tasell patented a method for measuring an audiogram when the precise signal level was unknown (patent US 8,968,209 B2). In this method, the slope between pure-tone thresholds measured at 2 and 4 kHz is calculated and combined with questionnaire information in order to reconstruct the most likely audiograms from a database of options. An approach like the Van Tasell method is desirable because it is quick and feasible to do in a patient's home where exact stimulus levels are unknown. The goal of the present study was to use machine learning to assess the effectiveness of such audiogram-estimation methods. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a database of audiologic and demographic information, was used to train and test several machine learning algorithms. Overall, 9,256 cases were analyzed. Audiometric data were classified using the Wisconsin Age-Related Hearing Impairment Classification Scale (WARHICS), a method that places hearing loss into one of eight categories. Of the algorithms tested, a random forest machine learning algorithm provided the best fit with only a few variables: the slope between 2 and 4 kHz; gender; age; military experience; and self-reported hearing ability. Using this method, 54.79% of the individuals were correctly classified, 34.40% were predicted to have a milder loss than measured, and 10.82% were predicted to have a more severe loss than measured. Although accuracy was low, it is unlikely audibility would be severely affected if classifications were used to apply gains. Based on audibility calculations, underamplification still provided sufficient gain to achieve ~95% correct (Speech Intelligibility Index  0.45) for sentence materials for 88% of individuals. Fewer than 1% of individuals were overamplified by 10 dB for any audiometric frequency.

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, HCW received 2 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. We included confirmed cases among HCWs from 9 December 2020 to 23 February 2021. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 rates per 100,000 person-days and by time from first injection (1C14 and 15 days) were compared with surrounding community rates. Viral genomes were sequenced. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 cases occurred in 1.4% (96/7109) of HCWs given at least a first dose and 0.3% (17/5913) of HCWs given both vaccine doses. Adjusted rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.73 (.53C1.00) 1C14 days and 0.18 (.10C.32) 15 days from first dose.

Traditional in vitro cell culture systems form one of the corner stones of cancer research. However, the growth of cancer cells in a two-dimensional pattern on a plastic dish in artificial conditions is not ideal, as the growth pattern significantly differs from that of a complex tumor in a patient. Hence, in recent years, efforts have been undertaken to generate more complex three-dimensional in vitro models, so-called organoid or tumoroid models, that more closely resemble the growth pattern and tumor heterogeneity observed in a patient. In this review, we summarize the efforts thus far undertaken in the area of NSCLC organoid development. ABSTRACT: Despite many developments in recent years, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Therefore, additional research, aiming to further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and development of therapy resistance, as well as the identification of additional novel therapeutic avenues, is crucial. For this purpose, reliable in vitro models are indispensable, as they allow for quick identification of suspected oncogenic drivers or evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies in a timely and cost-effective fashion. However, standard two-dimensional cell culture systems, the most frequently used in vitro model, are usually not truly representative of the situation in a patient as these models lack the tumor heterogeneity, the surrounding tumor microenvironment and the three-dimensional complexity of a tumor in vitro. For this reason, 3D cell culture systems, in particular organoids generated from normal non-malignant cells or tumor cell-based organoids (tumoroids), have in recent years gained much attention as alternative in vitro model systems that more closely resemble the actual primary tumor. In this review, we provide an overview of the available literature in the field of NSCLC organoids, which might still be in its infancy, but is gaining momentum.","output":"Primary Lung Cancer Organoids for Personalized MedicineAre They Ready for Clinical Use?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented risks to the well-being of Americans.

Observed values were compared against predicted values at an alpha of .05. RESULTS: Substantially fewer allegations of child maltreatment were reported than expected in March (-28.8%, deviation: 1848, 95% CI: [1272, 2423]), April (-51.5%, deviation: 2976, 95% CI: [2382, 3570]), and May 2020 (-46.0%, deviation: 2959, 95% CI: [2347, 3571]). Significant decreases in child maltreatment reporting were also noted for all reporter subtypes examined for March, April, and May 2020. Fewer CPS investigations warranted preventative services than expected in March 2020 (-43.5%, deviation: 303, 95% CI: [132, 475]). CONCLUSIONS: Precipitous drops in child maltreatment reporting and child welfare interventions coincided with social distancing policies designed to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. In light of these findings, educators and healthcare providers must be especially vigilant when engaging online with children and their families for signs of child abuse and/or neglect.","output":"Reporting of Child Maltreatment During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in New York City from March to May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV2) depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme complex for its genomic replications and thus can be inhibited by nucleoside analogues. An example is Remdesivir, which is a non-obligate chain terminator of RdRp. Therefore, we investigate the activities of Remdesivir against COVID-19. METHOD: This is a systematic-review and meta-analysis of the literature on the effectiveness of Remdesivir in the management of COVID-19 through MEDLINE (from Jan 2019 to January 2021), EMBASE (from Jan 2019 to January 2021), Publics Ovidius Naso (Ovoid), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in Issue 1 of 12, January 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was applied and the questions generated in conformity with the participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS). Statistical analysis was performed in Stata v. 12.1 (StataCorp, Texas USA). RESULTS: The outcome of the reviewed relevant journals and the cross-references including clinical trials, systematic reviews and metanalysis were documented. Out of 569,000 articles, 11 roundly-suited the inclusion criteria.

PURPOSE: The study was planned to develop a simple read out loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting a partial 18S rRNA gene of H. canis with naked eye visualisation of LAMP products. METHODS: A LAMP assay was employed to assess the DNA amplification by adding SYBR Green I dye for naked eye inspection of DNA accumulating in reaction tubes. Positive amplification was read through observation of change in colour of reaction mixture following addition of dye. The visual results were further verified with those of agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA of other haemoparasites of dog viz. Babesia vogeli, B. gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis and Trypanosoma evansi along with no-template control were used to determine the specificity of assay. RESULTS: Among the 109 blood samples presented at Small Animal Clinics, Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, Punjab (India) tested, 39 revealed colour change from orange to green indicating positive reaction while 70 were negative as revealed by no colour change. The results of visual inspection were comparable to those obtained by agarose gel electrophoresis. The LAMP primers specifically amplified H. canis DNA, whereas no amplification was detected in DNA samples of other haemoparasites and no-template control revealing specificity of the assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) of visual LAMP assay with respect to microscopy in detection of H. canis varied from 100% (15.81C100.00%) and 65.42% (55.61C74.35%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The present investigation has developed a specific and rapid LAMP assay for the detection of H. canis, using SYBR Green I dye, which has practical applications for the screening of field samples.","output":"Evaluation of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Technique for the Rapid Visual Detection of Hepatozoon canis Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID\\\\19 pandemic caused by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 has led to millions of deaths worldwide.

When evaluating service quality in public transportation systems, one of the most important factors is customer satisfaction. The increase in service quality increases the usage of public transport system utilization and it helps to solve many problems such as traffic congestion, air and noise pollution and energy consumption. For this purpose, the SERVQUAL model is extended with two new criteria related to Industry 4.0 and the pandemic to understand and evaluate the service quality of public transport systems. New criteria added into the SERVQUAL model and a novel P-SERVQUAL 4.0 (Pandemic SERVQUAL 4.0) model is presented. The novel service quality evaluation model is constructed as a three level hierarchical structure to evaluate public transport systems during the pandemic. Then, the evaluation model is modeled as a multi criteria decision making problem and a novel AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) integrated WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) under interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) environment methodology is employed. A real case application to evaluate Istanbul public transport systems is presented in this study. The proposed novel model is applied to evaluate the most used public transportation alternatives such as IETT Bus, Metrobus, Tram, Metro and Marmaray, in Istanbul. By the application of P-SERVQUAL 4.0 model;as a result of this study, Marmaray is determined as the best alternative. The proposed methodology can be used by public or private organizations to improve their strategies and operations to adapt Industry 4.0 and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

This study empirically examines the impact of ICT market openness on digital service exports on the basis of bilateral trade data at the industry level from 2007 to 2019 from 50 countries. The results show that: (1) ICT market openness seeks the combination of effective regulation and moderate openness, which is mainly reflected in three policy areas: improving information interconnection and sharing, reducing access restrictions and promoting fair competition;(2) The ICT market openness in both exporting and importing countries can significantly boost digital service exports, but in different ways. Exporting countries expand digital service exports mainly by promoting fair competition, while importing countries have the most obvious positive impact on exports through the reduction of access restrictions;(3) The greater the gap between the ICT development levels, and the lower the bilateral risk levels between the two trading countries, the greater the marginal effect that ICT market openness will have on the promotion of digital service exports. Thus, improving market openness indicates an important direction for ICT regulatory reform, but the impact on digital service exports will vary by specific policy area and by trading-partner country.","output":"Does Information-and-Communication-Technology Market Openness Promote Digital Service Exports?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possibility to extend the lifespan or even reuse one-off personal protective equipment, especially for N95 respirator and surgical mask become critical during pandemic.

Over 60% of the findings referred to pathogens with known zoonotic potential and five cases directly referenced zoonotic spillover events. The diversity of pathogens by taxa included 44 different pathogens in birds, 47 in mammals, 16 in reptiles, two in amphibians, two in fish, and one in invertebrates. This is the highest diversity of pathogen types in reported literature related to IWT. However, it is likely not a fully representative sample due to needed augmentation of surveillance and monitoring of IWT and more frequent pathogen testing on recovered shipments. The emergence of infectious disease through human globalization has resulted in several pandemics in the last decade including SARS, MERS, avian influenza H1N1,and Ebola.

We argue that the AIA can be interpreted as a proposal to establish a Europe-wide ecosystem for conducting AI auditing, albeit in other words. Our analysis offers two main contributions. First, by describing the enforcement mechanisms included in the AIA in terminology borrowed from existing literature on AI auditing, we help providers of AI systems understand how they can prove adherence to the requirements set out in the AIA in practice. Second, by examining the AIA from an auditing perspective, we seek to provide transferable lessons from previous research about how to refine further the regulatory approach outlined in the AIA. We conclude by highlighting seven aspects of the AIA where amendments (or simply clarifications) would be helpful.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized in two COVID Centers were enrolled. All patients performed blood gas analysis and lung ultrasound (LUS) at admission. The LUS acquisition was based on standard sequence of 14 peculiar anatomic landmarks with a score between 0-3 based on impairment of LUS picture. Total score was computed with their sum with a total score ranging 0 to 42, according to Soldati LUS score. We evaluated the course of hospitalization until either discharge or death, the ventilatory support and the transition in intensive care if needed. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six patients were included in the final analysis. Most of patients presented moderate-to-severe respiratory failure (FiO2 <20%, PaO2 <60 mmHg) and consequent recommendation to invasive mechanic ventilation (CPAP/NIV/OTI). The median ultrasound thoracic score was 28 (IQR 18-36) and most of patients could be ascertained either in a score 2 (40%) or score 3 pictures (24.4%). The bivariate correlation analysis displayed statistically significant and high positive correlations between the LUS score and the following parameters: ventilation (rho=0.481, p<0.001), lactates (rho=0.464, p<0.001), dyspnea (rho=0.398, p=0.001) mortality (rho=0.410, p=0.001).

We examined the actions underlying the effects of an insulin sensitizer, tolimidone (MLR-1023) and investigated its effects on body weight. Diet-induced obesity (CD1/ICR) and type 2 diabetes (db/db) mouse models were used to study the effect of MLR-1023 on metabolic outcomes and to explore its synergy with menthol. We also examined the efficacy of MLR-1023 alone in a clinical trial (NCT02317796), as well as in combination with menthol in human adipocytes. MLR-1023 produced weight loss in humans in four weeks, and in mice fed a high-fat diet it reduced weight gain and fat mass without affecting food intake.

While there has been a tremendous global effort to create a vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), little is known about its reception in Iraq. Therefore, we sought to examine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitation, and related elements in the Iraqi population. Methods: : Between the 19th of May and the 22nd of September 2021, a descriptive, cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted employing a quantitative approach. Respondents from both sexes aged 18 years and above who live in Iraq and agreed to participate were included. An anonymized online structured questionnaire was designed based on data from prior research on vaccine hesitation in general, and COVID-19 vaccination reluctance specifically. Results: : A total of 1221 eligible participants from various regions in Iraq actively participated in the short web-based questionnaire. The overall acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine was 56.2%, with a greater acceptance rate among younger male participants (p<0.05). Marital status had no significant association (p=0.834).

Finally, we highlight the need for cellular models of fetal brain development to better understand potential short- and long-term impacts of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on the next generation.","output":"COVID-19 in pregnancy: implications for fetal brain development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired, life-threatening hemopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and impaired bone marrow function. Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 27-year-old Caucasian man with PNH presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital with acute onset shortness of breath, cough and blood in urine. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute hemolytic exacerbation of PNH complicated with moderate COVID19 pneumonia. OUTCOMES: The patient was initiated with an anticoagulant unfractionated heparin, dexamethasone, and cefuroxime injection. His symptoms quickly resolved, and he was discharged after 5 days. CONCLUSION: The complement system activation is a critical component in the sequalae of COVID19 infection. Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. Notably, C5a concentration was noted to be higher in patients with COVID19 infection. The use of complement inhibitors to attenuate immune mediated damage in COVID19 nevertheless represents a very interesting theoretical approach. However, careful consideration as to which patients may benefit will be required and the outcome of clinical trials needed.","output":"COVID19 infection in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. To simulate how the number of COVID-19 cases increases versus time, various data sets for the number of new cases and different mathematical models can be used. Since there are some differences in statistical data, the results of simulations can be different. Complex mathematical models contain many unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations of the disease over time. Even long-term monitoring of the epidemic may not provide reliable estimates of its parameters due to the constant change of testing conditions, isolation of infected and quarantine. Therefore, simpler approaches are necessary. In particular, previous simulations of the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Ukraine were based on smoothing of the dependence of the number of cases on time and the generalized SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. These approaches allowed to detect the waves of pandemic and to make adequate predictions of the their duration and final sizes. In particular, eight waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine were investigated. Objective. We will compare the results simulation of a new epidemic wave in Ukraine based on national statistics and data reported by Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Methods. In this study we use the smoothing method for the dependences of the number of cases on time, the generalized SIR model for the dynamics of any epidemic wave, the exact solution of the linear differential equations, and statistical approach developed before. Results. Ninth epidemic wave in Ukraine was simulated. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were calculated and compared with the use of two data sets. Both predictions are not very optimistic: new cases will not stop appearing until June-July 2021. Conclusions. New waves of COVID-19 pandemic can be detected, calculated and predicted with the use of rather simple mathematical models. The results of calculations depend on the data sets for the number of confirmed cases. The expected long duration of the pandemic forces us to be careful and in solidarity. The government and all Ukrainians must strictly adhere to quarantine measures in order to avoid fatal consequences. Probably the presented results could be useful in order to estimate the efficiency of future vaccinations.","output":"Estimates of the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Ukraine based on two data sets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During medical pandemics, protective behaviors need to be motivated by effective communication, where finding predictors of fear and perceived health is of critical importance. The varying trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries afford the opportunity to assess the unique influence of 'macro-level' environmental factors and 'micro-level' psychological variables on both fear and perceived health. Here, we investigate predictors of fear and perceived health using machine learning as lockdown restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were introduced in Austria, Spain, Poland and Czech Republic. Over a seven-week period, 533 participants completed weekly self-report surveys which measured the target variables subjective fear of the virus and perceived health, in addition to potential predictive variables related to psychological factors, social factors, perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), and economic circumstances. Viral spread, mortality and governmental responses were further included in the analysis as potential environmental predictors. Results revealed that our models could accurately predict fear of the virus (accounting for approximately 23% of the variance) using predictive factors such as worrying about shortages in food supplies and perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), where interestingly, environmental factors such as spread of the virus and governmental restrictions did not contribute to this prediction. Furthermore, our results revealed that perceived health could be predicted using PVD, physical exercise, attachment anxiety and age as input features, albeit with smaller effect sizes. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of 'micro-level' psychological factors, as opposed to 'macro-level' environmental factors, when predicting fear and perceived health, and offer a starting point for more extensive research on the influences of pathogen threat and governmental restrictions on the psychology of fear and health.","output":"Predicting fear and perceived health during the COVID-19 pandemic using machine learning: A cross-national longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of a Coronaviridae virus which presents 79% genetic similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been recently recognized as the cause of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) implying a major threat to the world public health. SARS-CoV-2 infects host human cells by binding through the viral spike proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, fuses with the cell membrane, enters and starts its replication process in order to multiply its viral load. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was initially considered a respiratory infection that could cause pneumonia. However, in severe cases, it extends beyond the respiratory system and becomes a multi-organ disease. This transition from localized respiratory infection to multi-organ disease is due to two main complications of COVID-19. On the one hand, the so-called cytokine storm: an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction of the immune system in which defensive molecules become aggressive for the body itself. On the other hand, the formation of a large number of thrombi that can cause myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism (PE). The pulmonary endothelium actively participates in these two processes, becoming the last barrier before the virus spreads throughout the body. In this review, we examine the role of the pulmonary endothelium in response to COVID-19, the existence of potential biomarkers and the development of novel therapies to restore vascular homeostasis and to protect/treat these patients. Additionally, we review the thrombotic complications recently observed in COVID-19 patients and its potential threatening sequelae.

The drop in HIT is proportional to the fraction of the population resistant only when that fraction is effectively segregated from the general population; however, when mixing is random, the drop in HIT is more precipitous. Significant reductions in expected mortality can also be observed in settings where a fraction of the population is resistant to infection.

Previous studies were mainly focused on severe TBI as it occurs in adults. This study explored the long-term adverse effect of mild TBI in juvenile animals (mTBI-J). Male Sprague Dawley rats received mTBI-J or sham treatment at six weeks old, then underwent behavioral, biochemical, and histological experiments three weeks later (at nine weeks old). TTC staining, H&E staining, and brain edema measurement were applied to evaluate the mTBI-J induced cerebral damage. The forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT) were applied for measuring depression-like behavior. The locomotor activity test (LAT) was performed to examine mTBI-J treatment effects on motor function. After the behavioral experiments, the dorsal hippocampus (dHip) and ventral hippocampus (vHip) were dissected out for western blotting to examine the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Finally, a TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF was injected intraperitoneally to evaluate its therapeutic effect on the mTBI-J induced behavioral abnormalities at the early adult age. Results showed that a mild brain edema occurred, but no significant neural damage was found in the mTBI-J treated animals. In addition, a significant increase of depression-like behaviors was observed in the mTBI-J treated animals; the FST revealed an increase in immobility, and a decrease in sucrose consumption was found in the mTBI-J treated animals. There were no differences observed in the total distance traveled of the LAT and the fall latency of the rotarod test. The hippocampal BDNF expression, but not the TrkB, were significantly reduced in mTBI-J, and the mTBI-J treatment-induced depression-like behavior was lessened after four weeks of 7,8-DHF administration. Collectively, these results indicate that even a mild juvenile TBI treatment that did not produce motor deficits or significant histological damage could have a long-term adverse effect that could be sustained to adulthood, which raises the depression-like behavior in the adult age. In addition, chronic administration of 7,8-DHF lessens the mTBI-J treatment-induced depression-like behaviors in adult rats. We suggest the potential usage of 7,8-DHF as a therapeutic agent for preventing the long-term adverse effect of mTBI-J.","output":"Chronic Administration of 7,8-DHF Lessens the Depression-like Behavior of Juvenile Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Treated Rats at Their Adult Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has severely affected healthcare organizations worldwide, and the provision of palliative care (PC) to cancer patients has been no exception.

METHODS: Between 22 June 22 and 15 August 2020, HCWs from institutions in northern/eastern Switzerland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We recorded baseline characteristics, non-occupational and occupational risk factors. We used pairwise tests of associations and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Among 4664 HCWs from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR 59, 95% CI 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and male sex (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1).

Currently, the epidemic is under control in China and production has resumed in various industries. This study investigates the behavioural compliance and related factors for COVID-19 prevention among employees returning to the workplace and provide strategic recommendations for improving individual-level preventive behaviour to prevent a new outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. Data were gathered from returning employees in China using an online questionnaire survey, from March to May, 2020. The questionnaire covered participants COVID-19-related knowledge, compliance with recommended preventive behaviours, and levels of depression and anxiety. Univariate and multi-factor methods were used to analyse the data and identify factors influencing behaviour compliance. RESULTS: Of the 1300 participants completing the full survey, more than half were male (71.92%) and 61% were aged between 31 and 50 years. Six hundred and ninety-eight (53.7%) participants showed high compliance, while 602 (46.3%) showed low compliance.

To avoid recomputing the embedding over time, we explore streaming network embedding for two reasons: 1) to efficiently identify the nodes required to update the embeddings under multi-type network changes, and 2) to carefully revise the embeddings to maintain transduction over different parts of the network. Specifically, we propose a new representation learning framework, named Graph Memory Refreshing (GMR), to preserve both global types of structural information efficiently. We prove that GMR maintains the consistency of embeddings (crucial for network analysis) for isomorphic structures better than existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that GMR outperforms the baselines with much smaller time.","output":"Quality-Aware Streaming Network Embedding with Memory Refreshing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 30 January 2020. We aim to systematically review the tool used for the assessment of the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) on Covid-19 infection. Methods: : We will conduct a systematic review of knowledge, attitude, and practice assessment on COVID-19 infection. The search will cover the period December 2019 to January 2021. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Study quality will be assessed using the STROBE checklist for a cross-sectional study. Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics. The numerical outcome will be analysed using mean and standard deviation. The categorical outcome will be analysed using absolute number and percentage. The range number of items, reliability, and validity of each domain will be assessed descriptively. Discussion: This systematic review of KAP measurement tools will provide a detailed summary of the existing tools used to assess the KAP levels towards COVID-19 and its reliability and validity in different settings and populations. Also, the review will provide evidence on the importance of the reliability and validity of the assessment tools in ensuring quality data from future research.

The aim of this paper is to describe the relationship between individual\\\\level perception of risk and depression, controlling for a set of confounders and for country\\\\level heterogeneity. A cross\\\\sectional and observational online survey was conducted using a non\\\\probability snowball sampling technique. We use data on 11,340 respondents, living in six European countries (Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, France, Poland, Czech Republic) who completed survey questionnaires during the first months of the pandemic. We used a fixed\\\\effect approach, which included individual and macro\\\\level variables. The findings suggest that a high proportion of people suffering from depression and heightened risk perception is positively associated with reporting depressive symptoms, even if this relationship varies significantly between countries. Moreover, the association is moderated by contextual factors including health\\\\care expenditure as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, hospital beds for acute care, and number of medical specialists per head of population.

We also describe the laboratory capacity building for these diagnostics. METHODS: Laboratory registry data for altogether 80,791 specimens from 70,517 individuals was analysed. The data included the date of sampling, sex, age and the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result on specimens collected between 1 February and 15 June 2020. RESULTS: Altogether, 4057/80,791 (5.0%) of the specimens were positive and 3915/70,517 (5.6%) of the individuals were found positive. In all, 37% of specimens were from male and 67% from female subjects. While the number of positive cases was similar in male and female subjects, the positivity rate was significantly higher in male subjects: 7.5% of male and 4.4% of female subjects tested positive. The highest incidence/100,000 was observed in those aged 80 years. The proportion of young adults in positive cases increased in late May 2020. Large dips in testing frequency were observed during every weekend and also during public holidays. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that men pursue SARS-CoV-2 testing less frequently than women. Consequently, a subset of coronavirus disease-2019 infections in men may have gone undetected. People sought testing less frequently on weekends and public holidays, and this may also lead to missing of positive cases. The proportion of young adults in positive cases increased towards the end of the study period, which may suggest their returning back to social behaviour with an increased risk of infection.","output":"Laboratory-based surveillance of COVID-19 in the Greater Helsinki area, Finland, FebruaryCJune 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The questioned link between air pollution and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreading or related mortality represents a hot topic that has immediately been regarded in the light of divergent views. A first school of thought advocates that what matters are only standard epidemiological variables (i.e. frequency of interactions in proportion of the viral charge). A second school of thought argues that co-factors such as quality of air play an important role too. METHODS: We analyzed available literature concerning the link between air quality, as measured by different pollutants and a number of COVID-19 outcomes, such as number of positive cases, deaths, and excess mortality rates. We reviewed several studies conducted worldwide and discussing many different methodological approaches aimed at investigating causality associations. RESULTS: Our paper reviewed the most recent empirical researches documenting the existence of a huge evidence produced worldwide concerning the role played by air pollution on health in general and on COVID-19 outcomes in particular. These results support both research hypotheses, i.e. long-term exposure effects and short-term consequences (including the hypothesis of particulate matter acting as viral carrier) according to the two schools of thought, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The link between air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes is strong and robust as resulting from many different research methodologies. Policy implications should be drawn from a rational assessment of these findings as not taking any action represents an action itself.","output":"AIR quality and COVID-19 adverse outcomes: Divergent views and experimental findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide COVID-19 infection poses an enormous risk to public health and an alarming global socioeconomic burden The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with underlying health conditions as well as on the elderly population is extensive and effective strategies are needed to understand the mechanism behind it Cellular senescence defines as an irreversible cell cycle arrest due to DNA damage leading to accumulation of senescent cells in the elderly population and may result in worsening of COVID-19 mediated increased mortality However, whether this variation in senescence levels, in different aged populations, translation to COVID-19 infection is unknown The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been recently identified to be responsible for inducing pathogenic signals, although a clear understanding of how the host receptor interacts with SARS-CoV-2 protein and mediates the immune responses is not clear In this review, we address the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the cellular senescence responding immune response to pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 We provide a prospective summary of what to expect and how to brace the possible immunological strategy to protect against COVID-19 infection The review majorly explores an underline mechanism of how senescent cells trigger a hyperimmune inflammatory response and cause high mortality in aging people could serve as a potential aid to alleviate the treatment for elderly battling COVID-19 infection [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Aging & Disease is the property of JKL International LLC and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"An Account of Immune Senescence in the Clinical Pathophysiology of COVID-19 Infection in Aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purposes: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an increased importance on physical distancing to minimize the risk of transmission in radiation oncology departments The pandemic has also increased the use of hypo-fractionated treatment schedules where MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) can aid in dose escalation This specialized technique requires increased staffing in close proximity, thus requiring novel coverage practices to increase physical distancing while still providing specialty care Materials and Methods A remote physician ART coverage practice was developed and described using commercially available software products Our remote physician coverage practice provided control to the physician to contour, and review images and plans The time from completion of image registration to the beginning of treatment was recorded for 20 fractions before remote physician ART coverage and 14 fractions after implementation of remote physician ART coverage Visual quality was calculated using cross correlation between the treatment delivery computer screen and the remote physician screen Results For the 14 fractions after implementation, the average time from image registration to the beginning of treatment was 24 96 1min In comparison, the 20 fractions analyzed without remote coverage had an average time of 29 29 8min The correlation between the console screen and the remote physician screen was R = 0 95 Conclusion Our novel remote physician ART coverage practice is secure, interactive, timely, and of high visual quality When utilizing remote physicians for ART, our department was able to increase physical distancing to lower the risk of virus transmission while providing specialty care to our patients in need","output":"Implementing a Novel Remote Physician Treatment Coverage Practice for Adaptive Radiotherapy during the Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proteoglycan versican (VCAN) plays a complex role in cancer.

In addition, its interaction with surface cell receptors EGFR, HER-2 and CD44 in malignant epithelial cells may be responsible for proliferation and cellular motility in early stages of cancer. We comparatively evaluated the expression of this proteoglycan and its receptors in in situ and invasive areas of simple carcinomas (SC) and CMT to investigate similarities and differences between these histological types. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-VCAN, anti-CD44, anti-EGFR and anti-HER-2 antibodies in 32 cases of SC or CMT. VCAN was highly expressed in stroma adjacent to invasive areas in SC and CMT. CMTs presented comparatively higher expression of VCAN in stroma adjacent to in situ and in invasive areas than in corresponding areas in SCs. In CMT, EGFR and HER-2 expressions were higher in situ compared to invasive areas. In contrast, increased CD44 and EGFR expression was found in invasive areas in SC compared to CMT. These results indicate that versican expression is similarly associated with invasiveness in SC and CMT, however higher levels were seen in CMT suggesting that the presence of myoepithelial proliferation in this tumor type participates in stromal composition and promoting an increase in the expression of versican.","output":"Expression of VCAN and its receptors in canine mammary carcinomas with or without myoepithelial proliferation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused millions of deaths worldwide. COVID-19s clinical manifestations range from no symptoms to a severe acute respiratory syndrome, which can result in multiple organ failure, sepsis, and death. Severe COVID-19 patients develop pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections, with a hypercoagulable state. Several inflammatory or coagulatory biomarkers are currently used with predictive values for COVID-19 severity and prognosis. In this manuscript, we investigate if a combination of coagulatory and inflammatory biomarkers could provide a better biomarker with predictive value for COVID-19 patients, being able to distinguish between patients that would develop a moderate or severe COVID-19 and predict the disease outcome. We investigated 306 patients with COVID-19, confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA detected in the nasopharyngeal swab, and retrospectively analyzed the laboratory data from the first day of hospitalization. In our cohort, biomarkers such as neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio from the day of hospitalization could predict if the patient would need to be transferred to the intensive care unit but failed to identify the patients outcomes. The ratio between platelets and inflammatory markers such as creatinine, C-reactive protein, and urea levels is associated with patient outcomes. Finally, the platelet/neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on the first day of hospitalization can be used with predictive value as a novel severity and lethality biomarker in COVID-19. These new biomarkers with predictive value could be used routinely to stratify the risk in COVID-19 patients since the first day of hospitalization.","output":"Platelet-Based Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of information and communication technology (ICT) in medical and healthcare services goes beyond everyday life.

Methods: LRx contains all anonymized medication dispenses prescribed in outpatient care in a representative panel of French retails pharmacies, including data of near 40 million patients. The impact of B/TST initiation and renewal were studied using 2019 as reference and dispense deliveries data of pharmacies with regular flew in order to perform the comparison. B/TST considered were abatacept, anti-TNF, anti-IL6, anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23 or anti-IL23, JAK inhibitors (JAKi) and other classes such as aprelimast, aminosalicylates (AS), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and methotrexate (MTX). A treatment initiated was defined as a treatment not delivered in the past 12 months, and conversely for a treatment renewal.

Children on chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) represent a vulnerable population that could benefit from increased use of TH. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid adoption of TH services in the population among pediatric centers participating in The Childrens Hospital Associations Standardizing Care to Improve Outcomes in Pediatric ESKD (SCOPE) Collaborative. METHODS: We developed a survey to explore the experience of both pediatric PD providers and caregivers of patients receiving PD care at home and using TH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We obtained responses from 27 out of 53 (50.9%) SCOPE centers that included 175 completed surveys from providers and caregivers. Major challenges identified by providers included inadequate/lack of physical exam, inability to visit with the patient/family in-person, and inadequate/lack of PD catheter exit site exam. Only 51% of caregivers desired future TH visits; however, major benefits of TH for caregivers included no travel, visit takes less time, easier to care for other children, more comfortable for patient, and no time off from work. Providers and caregivers agreed that PD TH visits are family centered (p = 0.296), with the lack of a physical exam (p < 0.001) and the inability to meet in-person (p = 0.002) deemed particularly important to caregivers and providers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TH is a productive and viable visit option for children on PD; however, making this a successful, permanent part of routine care will require an individualized approach with standardization of core elements.

Species react across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably, diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks. The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed by a combination of degrees in the different layers.

Data on the demographics, symptoms, first laboratory results, treatments and outcomes (within 12 days of hospitalization) were collected. The results showed that the median duration from symptom onset to admission shortened over time (13, 10 and 5 days, respectively, p < 0.05). Fewer patients had fever symptoms and bilateral pneumonia in group C than in the group A and B. Laboratory results showed that white blood cell, neutrophil, and platelet counts, lactic acid and D-dimer levels were lower, while lymphocyte, CD3, and CD8 counts were higher in group C. In addition, group C had more mild-moderate cases and fewer severe cases than the other two groups.

Unfortunately, as discussed in this article, moderate doses of genotoxic drugs such as cisplatin typical of those achieved in the clinic often invoke a cytostatic/dormancy rather than cytotoxic/apoptosis response in solid tumour-derived cell lines. This is commonly manifested by an extended apoptotic threshold, with extensive apoptosis only being seen after very high/supralethal doses of such agents. The dormancy response can be associated with senescence-like features, polyploidy and/or multinucleation, depending in part on the p53 status of the cells. In most solid tumour-derived cells, dormancy represents a long-term survival mechanism, ultimately contributing to disease recurrence. This review highlights the nonlinearity of key aspects of the molecular and cellular responses to bulky DNA lesions in human cells treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., cisplatin) or ultraviolet light-C (a widely used tool for unraveling details of the DNA damage-response) as a function of the level of genotoxic stress. Such data highlight the growing realization that targeting dormant cancer cells, which frequently emerge following conventional anticancer treatments, may represent a novel strategy to prevent or, at least, significantly suppress cancer recurrence.","output":"Cellular Responses to Platinum-Based Anticancer Drugs and UVC: Role of p53 and Implications for Cancer Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is asking health care workers (HCWs) to meet extraordinary challenges In turn, HCWs were experiencing tremendous psycho-social crisis as they have had to deal with unexpected emotional requirements (ERs) arising from caring for suffering and dying patients on a daily basis In that context, recent studies have highlighted how HCWs working during the COVID-19 outbreak manifested extreme emotional and behavioral reactions that may have impacted their mental health, increasing the risk for developing post-traumatic stress symptoms Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate post-traumatic stress symptoms, such as intrusion symptoms, as a potential mediator of the link between ERs and crying at work, and whether rumination moderates the relationship between ERs and intrusion-based PTS symptoms among HCWs who have had to deal with patients dying from COVID-19","output":"Dealing With COVID-19 Patients: A Moderated Mediation Model of Exposure to Patients' Death and Mental Health of Italian Health Care Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the spring of 2020, the skilled crafts sector was simultaneously affected by two different policy measures: the COVID-19-induced lockdown measures and a new market entry regulation.

However, a number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases. METHODS: We examined data from Departments of Health websites in six U.S. states experiencing surges in cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two prevalence-related measures, in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures related to prevalence were: (Percentage of cases observed in a given age group)  (percentage of cases expected based on population demographics); and percentage deviation, or [(% observed-% expected)/ % expected] x 100. RESULTS: Prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p < .00001), as was percentage observed  percentage expected (p < .005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p < 0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p< 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults. Possible reasons for the findings are suggested, and we note that public health messaging targeting adolescents and youth might be helpful in curbing the pandemic. Also, the findings of the potential for high transmission among adolescents and youth, should be factored into decisions regarding school reopening.","output":"Prevalence of COVID-19 in adolescents and youth compared with older adults in states experiencing surges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) may elicit anaphylaxis to COVID\\\\19 mRNA vaccines, and guidance for patients at risk is needed. METHODS: In retrospective patients with PEG allergy collected from 2006 till 2019, clinical, skin, and basophil activation test (BAT) characteristics discriminative for PEG allergy were analyzed and compared with the literature. In 421 prospective real\\\\life patients asking for allergy workup for COVID\\\\19 vaccine hypersensitivity in 2020/2021, risk assessment was performed and tolerance of the recommended vaccination approach was assessed. RESULTS: Ten patients with PEG allergy were found in the retrospective cohort. Patients reacted with immediate anaphylaxis (100%) not only to PEG\\\\based laxatives/bowel preparations or injections, but also to cold medication, antiseptics, analgetics, or antibiotics. Skin tests  BAT with PEG  elicitors were positive in 10/10. Provocation tests were positive in 7/9 patients.

However, the persistent pandemic and similar CT manifestations between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) raise methodological requirements. METHODS: A fully automatic pipeline of deep learning is proposed for distinguishing COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. Inspired by the diagnostic process of radiologists, the pipeline comprises four connected modules for lung segmentation, selection of slices with lesions, slice-level prediction, and patient-level prediction. The roles of the first and second modules and the effectiveness of the capsule network for slice-level prediction were investigated. A dataset of 326 CT scans was collected to train and test the pipeline. Another public dataset of 110 patients was used to evaluate the generalization capability. RESULTS: LinkNet exhibited the largest intersection over union (0.967) and Dice coefficient (0.983) for lung segmentation. For the selection of slices with lesions, the capsule network with the ResNet50 block achieved an accuracy of 92.5% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.933. The capsule network using the DenseNet121 block demonstrated better performance for slice-level prediction, with an accuracy of 97.1% and AUC of 0.992. For both datasets, the prediction accuracy of our pipeline was 100% at the patient level.

We noted near identical diagnostic models in both standard and low volume IVDr lipoprotein analysis (measuring 112 lipoprotein parameters) with a comparison of the two tubes yielding R2 values ranging between 0.82 and 0.99 for the 40 paired lipoprotein parameters samples. Lipoprotein measurements for the 3 mm tubes were achieved without time penalty over the 5 mm tubes as defined by biomarker recovery for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, biomarker pattern recovery for the lipoproteins was extremely similar, but there were some small positive offsets in the linear equations for several variables due to small shimming artifacts, but there was minimal degradation of the biological information. For the standard untargeted 1D, CPMG, and JRES NMR experiments on the same samples, the reduced signal-to-noise was more constraining and required greater scanning times to achieve similar differential diagnostic performance (15 min per sample per experiment for 3 mm 1D and CPMG, compared to 4 min for the 5 mm tubes). We conclude that the 3 mm IVDr method is fit-for-purpose for quantitative lipoprotein measurements, allowing the preparation of smaller volumes for high value or limited volume samples that is common in clinical studies.

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine clinician confidence in telemedicine-based eye care services during COVID-19. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was sent to clinicians at University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center (April 17, 2020-May 6, 2020) when nonemergent in-person visits and procedures were restricted. The primary outcome was clinician confidence in using telemedicine-based eye care during COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included telemedicine utilization and its association with clinician confidence using Fisher's exact test. Results: Of the 88 respondents (90.7% response rate; n = 97 total), 83.0% (n = 73) were ophthalmologists and 17.0% (n = 15) were optometrists. Telemedicine utilization increased from 30.7% (n = 27) before the pandemic to 86.2% (n = 75) after the pandemic. Clinicians' confidence in their ability to use telemedicine varied with 28.6% (24/84) feeling confident/extremely confident, 38.1% (32/84) somewhat confident, and 33.3% (28/84) not-at-all confident. Most felt that telemedicine was underutilized (62.1%; 54/87) and planned continued use over the next year (59.8%; 52/87). Confident respondents were more likely to have performed three or more telemedicine visits (p = 0.003), to believe telemedicine was underutilized (p < 0.001), and to anticipate continued use of telemedicine (p = 0.009).

In addition, liver fibrosis is amplified by migrated Th2 lymphocytes and transforming growth factor beta from the spleen. There is a possibility that increase of the spleen stiffness is the primary factor of idiopathic portal hypertension. Spleen stiffness is caused by bleeding, fibrosis, and calcareous deposits after increase in red pulp pressure due to venous congestion. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, macrophage activity in the spleen is upregulated. In addition, high levels of inflammatory cytokines are produced and T cell shows increased proliferation in the spleen. In autoimmune hepatitis model, CD4(+) T cells are differentiated into follicular helper T cells (T(FH)) in the spleen. T(FH) cells promoted hypergammaglobulinemia and antinuclear antibodies production. T(FH) cells migrate from the spleen to the liver, triggering induction of autoimmune hepatitis in this model.

The mediating role of impulse buying and the moderating role of neuroticism on food waste during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were also uncovered in this study. A self-administered online survey was distributed to a total of 274 consumers who had experienced a lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak and were also regular buyers of food. Empirical findings supported the fact that social media usage, neuroticism, and impulse buying were positively related to food waste. Impulse buying mediates the relationship between social media usage and food waste, as well as between neuroticism and food waste. The study results also revealed that neuroticism positively moderates the relationship between social media usage and food waste. This paper offers new insights into efforts for sustainable food consumption to tackle the issue of food waste.","output":"Exploring food waste during the COVID-19 pandemic among Malaysian consumers: The effect of social media, neuroticism, and impulse buying on food waste"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decision-makers need signals for action as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic progresses. Our aim was to demonstrate a novel use of statistical process control to provide timely and interpretable displays of COVID-19 data that inform local mitigation and containment strategies. Healthcare and other industries use statistical process control to study variation and disaggregate data for purposes of understanding behavior of processes and systems and intervening on them. We developed control charts at the county and city/neighborhood level within one state (California) to illustrate their potential value for decision-makers. We found that COVID-19 rates vary by region and subregion, with periods of exponential and non-exponential growth and decline. Such disaggregation provides granularity that decision-makers can use to respond to the pandemic. The annotated time series presentation connects events and policies with observed data that may help mobilize and direct the actions of residents and other stakeholders. Policy-makers and communities require access to relevant, accurate data to respond to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.

The virus is also spreading worldwide rapidly, with 490 confirmed cases in 24 countries and 1 death at current stage. Numerous studies have recently been published in terms of genome structure, transmission, infection mechanism, and drug development of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this study, we performed a descriptive study by focusing on the first 63 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Xuzhou, a major city and a transportation hub with 10.44 million population (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2019) on the east coast of China. Among the 63 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the median age is 45-year-old and 49.21% are male. 23 cases (36.51%) are imported. 23 cases (36.51%) were confirmed between from January 26 to 31 while 40 cases (63.49%) from February 1 to 10. The mean period from isolation to confirmation is 4.95 days. Among the ten administrative divisions of Xuzhou city, Suining county (n=17) and Pizhou City (n=15) have the most cases while Tongshan district has none. A representative familial cluster was analysed in detail in order to get a better understanding of the transmission routes of the virus. Clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 in 41 confirmed cases were analysed, which could provide a meaningful understanding during the initial screening of the disease. In sum, this study provides an epidemiological overview of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Xuzhou, the economic hub of Huaihai Economic Zone (HEZ) and an important transportation center in China. Considering the ongoing situation of this newly emerged infection both domestically and internationally, more efforts should be required to reduce the transmission of the virus so as to avoid further casualties, economic losses, and global pandemic.Authors Liang Wang, Jiawei Yan, and Zhanzhong Liu contributed equally to this study.","output":"Descriptive study of the first 63 cases of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the transportation hub city Xuzhou in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]Cristian B?hn?reanu, PhD Senior Researcher, highlights the economic impact of the pandemics;next, Alexandra Sarcinschi, PhD Senior Researcher, analyses the distinction between the terms \\"social distance\\" and \\"physical distance\\", identifying their impact on the societal security sector, in the article Measures and Consequences of Managing COVID-19 Pandemic: from Physical Distance to Social Distance For those who read for the first time Strategic Impact, it is an open-access peer reviewed journal, edited by the Centre for Defence and Security Strategic Studies and published with the support of the \\"Carol I\\" National Defence University Publishing House, and, according to the National Council for Titles, Diplomas and Certificates (CNATDCU), the publication is a prestigious scientific journal in the field of military sciences, information and public order [ ]we would like to encourage those interested to publish in our journal to prospect and evaluate thoroughly the dynamics of the security environment and, also, we invite the interested students, Master Students and Doctoral Candidates to submit articles for publication in the monthly supplement of the journal, Strategic Colloquium, available on the Internet at http://cssas unap ro/ro/cs htm, indexed in the international database CEEOL, Google scholar and ROAD ISSN","output":"Editor's Note"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a central health challenge of the twenty first century, poses substantial population health risks, with deaths currently estimated to be around 700,000 per year globally. The international community has signaled its commitment to exploring and implementing effective policy responses to AMR, with a Global Action Plan on AMR approved by the World Health Assembly in 2015. Major governance challenges could thwart collective efforts to address AMR, along with limited knowledge about how to design effective global governance mechanisms. To identify common ground for more coordinated global actions we conducted a narrative review to map dominant ideas and academic debates about AMR governance. We found two categories of global governance mechanisms: binding and non-binding and discuss advantages and drawbacks of each. We suggest that a combination of non-binding and binding governance mechanisms supported by leading antimicrobial use countries and important AMR stakeholders, and informed by One Health principles, may be best suited to tackle AMR.

This review aimed to scope the literature to identify what is known about the frequency and duration of e-bike use, their impact on travel behaviour, the purposes for which e-bikes are used and factors associated with e-bike use. In addition, the review aimed to identify gaps in the literature and highlight future research priorities. METHODS: A scoping review of published and unpublished literature in any language. Relevant articles were identified through searching six databases, two grey literature platforms and reference lists. Searches were conducted until August 2019. Data were extracted using a standardised extraction form and descriptive and narrative results are provided. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies met the inclusion criteria. The volume of research has increased since 2017 and primarily examines personal e-bike use, as opposed to e-bike share/rental schemes or organizational e-bike initiatives. The use of e-bikes increased the frequency and duration of cycling compared to conventional cycling and may help overcome barriers associated with conventional cycling. The uptake in e-cycling largely substitutes for conventional cycling or private car journeys, though the degree of substitution depends on the primary transport mode prior to e-bike acquisition. E-bikes are primarily used for utilitarian reasons, though older adults also engage in recreational e-cycling. Research priorities include quantitatively examining e-bike use, their impact on overall transport behaviour and identifying determinants of e-cycling to inform intervention and policy. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that the personal use of e-bikes is associated with a reduction in motorized vehicle use, which has potential positive impacts on the environment and health. The impacts of e-bike share schemes and workplace initiatives are less well understood.

Two time periods were observed using VOSviewer and Harzing to determine whether a shift in focus on these topics took place as a result of the pandemic and what the overall insights were. In addition, a co-citation analysis was done in two parts. One part gave consideration of the references from a search using terms motivation and remote work. The other considered the same search terms with constraints on the dates of articles for the analysis to emphasize prior research that was more recently emphasized. Upon further analysis, it was found that a shift did take place with earlier research focusing on combating low motivation of healthcare workers in remote regions and the latest research focusing on potential solutions for reduced motivation levels of individuals who had to work from home. In both instances, it was seen that work in remote regions and work done remotely, that is from home, were associated with low motivation levels. While the area of remote work and motivation are highly relevant to job design, it also implicates human-computer interaction as an increase in the number of remote jobs may imply more time spent with computers which in turn may have potential connections with human motivation. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"A Systematic Literature Review of Potential and Emerging Links Between Remote Work and Motivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background Viral respiratory illnesses are common causes of outbreaks and can be fatal to some patients. Aim To investigate the association between laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections and potential sources of exposure during the previous 7 days. Methods In this nested caseCcontrol analysis, healthcare personnel from nine Canadian hospitals who developed acute respiratory illnesses during the winters of 2010/11C2013/14 submitted swabs that were tested for viral pathogens. Associated illness diaries and the weekly diaries of non-ill participants provided information on contact with people displaying symptoms of acute respiratory illness in the previous week. Conditional logistic regression assessed the association between cases, who were matched by study week and site with controls with no respiratory symptoms. Findings There were 814 laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory illnesses. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a viral illness was higher for healthcare personnel reporting exposures to ill household members [7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4C9.1], co-workers (3.4, 95% CI 2.4C4.7) or other social contacts (5.1, 95% CI 3.6C7.1). Exposures to patients with respiratory illness were not associated with infection (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7C1.2); however, healthcare personnel with direct patient contact did have higher odds (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1C1.6). The aORs for exposure and for direct patient contact were similar for illnesses caused by influenza. Conclusion Community and co-worker contacts are important sources of viral respiratory illness in healthcare personnel, while exposure to patients with recognized respiratory infections is not associated. The comparatively low risk associated with direct patient contact may reflect transmission related to asymptomatic patients or unrecognized infections.","output":"Sources of viral respiratory infections in Canadian acute care hospital healthcare personnel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the likely spread of Covid-19 to rural areas in India and the preparedness of Indian rural healthcare systems to meet the demands created by the pandemic Less well recognized are the lockdown's adverse impacts on the social determinants of health and on access to essential health services If the impact of this disease is similar to that of earlier contagious diseases like TB, it will have a greater adverse impact on socio-economically disadvantaged populations For example, although both infection and case fatality are higher in males, 70 per cent of health and social service staff, globally, are women, putting them at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19 Also, there are other gendered effects that flow from the lockdown, rather than the virus For instance, domestic violence increased globally during the 2014-16 Ebola and 2015-16 Zika epidemics, and is increasing during the Covid-19 pandemic as well Although India's Covid-19 death rates may be lower than elsewhere because of India's younger population, this demographic advantage may be offset by the threat of malnutrition One recent post-lockdown study by PRADHAN conducted in 12 States showed that 50 per cent of rural households are eating less than usual, and 68 per cent have reduced the number of food items from their meals The workforce in health must have regular employment It is difficult, if not impossible, to provide universal access to quality public services using only contractual or contracted-in employment If public policy supports a meaningful expansion of public sector employment, it could be an effective way to address burgeoning poverty and unemployment as well as the lack of social security across rural India","output":"Challenges to India's rural healthcare system in the context of COVID-19.

This has also compromised the capacity for application of specialized Parkinson's disease (PD) therapies to an unknown extent. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study using administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of PD receiving multimodal complex treatment (PD-MCT), initial setup of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) or continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) in Germany. We compared case numbers and clinical characteristics of the pandemic (March 16th - May 15th, 2020) and post-lockdown (July 16th - September 15th, 2020) period with the pre-pandemic (January 16th - March 15th, 2020) and historical control period (March 16th - May 15th, 2019). RESULTS: We identified a strong decline for PD-MCT(-62.8%) and for the application of drug pump-based therapies (-69.4%) during the first peak phase of the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period while specialized PD treatment procedures increased again in the post-lockdown phase. Advanced disease was a marker for PD-MCT patients during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Besides the marked decline in specialized PD treatments during the first peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found recuperative effects for these procedures in the post-lockdown period without reaching pre-pandemic levels.

Significant case and fatality spatial clusters were most prevalent between November 2020 and January 2021. Distinct urbanCrural differences in COVID-19 experiences uncovered higher rural cases and fatalities per 100,000 population and fewer government mitigation actions enacted in rural counties. High levels of social vulnerability and the absence of mitigation policies were significantly associated with higher fatalities, while existing community resilience had more influential spatial explanatory power. Using differences in percentage unemployment changes between 2019 and 2020 as a proxy for pre-emergent recovery revealed urban counties were hit harder in the early months of the pandemic, corresponding with imposed government mitigation policies. This longitudinal, place-based study confirms some early urbanCrural patterns initially observed in the pandemic, as well as the disparate COVID-19 experiences among socially vulnerable populations.

AIM: One way that can be used is the application of lean six sigma. The application of the Lean six sigma concept can be done in the service and manufacturing industries. One of the service industries that is interesting to apply the Lean six sigma concept is health services through hospitals. METHODS: This concept uses five stages, namely, define (problem identification), measure (measurement of quality performance), analyze (analyze the causes of defects), improvement (make improvement efforts to improve quality), and control or control. The method used in this research is action research with univariate and bivariate analysis. RESULTS: The results of the application of the lean six sigma concept indicate that there are problems in nursing services where nurse services should be a competitive value or competitive advantage from Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU) Hospital in accordance with the hospitals motto. After the analysis, it was found that there was an influence between rewards on the performance of nurses. CONCLUSION: There needs to be more attention from the hospital on the rewards given to nurses.

Noninvasive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of stenotic lesions may enhance therapeutic decision-making. We determined whether physiologic parameters change downstream cerebral hemodynamics in patients with ICAS. METHODS Consecutive ICAS patients who underwent both CT angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography were enrolled. CFD models were made using CTA source images. Inlet boundary conditions were defined using three ranges of systolic blood pressure (BP) (109.2, 158, and 225 mmHg) and hematocrit (27.3, 40.2, and 48.8). Ratios of pressure, shear strain rates (SSR), and flow velocity across the lesion were calculated using CFD simulations. A linear mixed model was used for the statistical analysis of repeated simulations. RESULTS Among the 56 patients, 32 had moderate stenosis (50-69%) and 24 had severe stenosis (70-99%). A linear mixed model revealed that the ratio of pressure was predicted by systolic BP and stenosis group interaction (P = .036). These pressure decreases were associated with systolic BP (P < .001) and stenosis group (P < .001), but not with hematocrit (P = .337). Post-hoc analysis revealed that pressure decreases were more profound in the severe stenosis than the moderate stenosis group when comparing high and low systolic BP (P = .0108). Ratios of SSR and velocity were only associated in the stenosis group. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that systolic BP along with the degree of stenosis was associated with pressure decreases across stenotic lesions.

This response is initiated by the endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and PKR-like ER kinase, which increase the expression of the genes involved in the folding and degradation processes and decrease the protein input into the ER by inhibiting translation. It has been shown that viruses both induce and manipulate the UPR in order to protect the host cells from an ER stress-mediated death, thus permitting the translation of viral proteins and the efficient replication of the virus. To understand the cellular events that occur during the rotavirus replication cycle, we examined the activation of the three UPR arms following infection, using luciferase reporters driven by promoters of the ER stress-responsive genes and real-time reverse transcription-PCR to determine the levels of the stress-induced mRNAs. Our findings indicated that during rotavirus infection two of the three arms of the UPR (IRE1 and ATF6) become activated; however, these pathways are interrupted at the translational level by the general inhibition of protein synthesis caused by NSP3. This response seems to be triggered by more than one viral protein synthesized during the replication of the virus, but not by the viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), since cells transfected with psoralen-inactivated virions, or with naked viral dsRNA, did not induce UPR.","output":"Rotavirus infection induces the unfolded protein response of the cell and controls it through the nonstructural protein NSP3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic appears to have some streaks of severity in pediatrics These streaks include variable signs of respiratory distress, a new entity called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and some evidences of neurological symptoms involving both central and peripheral nervous systems Here, we described the first pediatric patient with COVID-19 who presented with acute transverse myelitis An 11-year-old otherwise healthy girl presented to our clinic with acute onset of lower limbs paresis, urinary and fecal retention, alongside epigastric pain, and fever for 3 days A neurological examination revealed a severe flaccid paraplegia in her lower limbs associated with a sensory level at T5 She was evaluated systematically for all probable causes of her symptoms, and finally, due to having a positive nasopharyngeal PCR test, she was considered to suffer from post-COVID-19 transverse myelitis She underwent intravenous-immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone pulse, and other supportive cares without obvious results Therefore, she underwent seven sessions of plasma exchange with little effects on muscle strength The focal inflammation and injury of the spinal cord, otherwise known as transverse myelitis, have a wide array of potential etiologies Transverse myelitis has been well documented to be the result of viral and bacterial infections We believe our patient was not involved in a cytokine storm status due to good CRP, IL-6 and Ferritin levels Albeit, we cannot certainly consider the patient to have a direct viral impact or involved in a late immunity process To our knowledge, this is the first report of TM in the field of pediatrics occurred after COVID-19 Thus, this is critical to note that children can present with some severe types of COVID-19","output":"Acute transverse myelitis of childhood due to novel coronavirus disease 2019: The first pediatric case report and review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CoVID-19 pandemic signified the importance of social distancing and non-contact routines.

Our study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being in a cohort of Italian university students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the period immediately after the first lockdown through the administration of a questionnaire on the personal websites of students attending their undergraduate courses at the Universit Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. We used the Patient-Health-Engagement-Scale, Self-Rating-Anxiety-Scale, and Self-Rating-Depression-Scale to assess engagement, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms of our sample. RESULTS: The sample size was 501 subjects, of which 35.33% were classified as anxious and 72.93% as depressed. Over 90% of respondents had good understanding of the preventive measures despite over 70% suffered from the impossibility of physically seeing friends and partners. Around 55% of students would have been willing to contribute much more to face the pandemic. An increase in the occurrences of anxiety was associated with being female, being student of the Rome campus, suffering from the impossibility of attending university, being distant from colleagues, and being unable of physically seeing one's partner. Performing physical activity reduced this likelihood. CONCLUSION: University students are at risk of psychological distress in the case of traumatic events.

Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has required all states parties to strengthen core capacities to respond to public health emergencies under the International Health Regulations (2005), the actions of most countries to combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has showed that they are not well-prepared. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the health system resilience of selected countries and analyze their strategies and measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: : This study selected five countries including the Iran, Japan, Republic of Korea (South Korea), the U.K., and the U.S., based on the severity of the national epidemic, the geographical location, and the development level. Cumulative number of death cases derived from WHO COVID-19 dashboard was used to measure the severity of the impact of the pandemic in each country; WHO State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) Scores and Global Health Security (GHS) Index were applied to measure the national health system resilience; and research articles and press materials were summarized to identify the strategies and measures adopted by countries during response to COVID-19. This study applied the resilient health systems framework to analyze health system resilience in the selected countries from five dimensions, including awareness, diversity, self-regulation, integration and adaptation. RESULTS: : The SPAR Scores and GHS Index of the four developed countries, Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and the U.S. were above the global and regional averages; the SPAR Scores of Iran were above the global average while the GHI Index lain below the global average. In terms of response strategies, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. invested more health resources in the treatment of severe patients, while South Korea and Iran had adopted a strategy of extensive testing and identification of suspected patients. In terms of specific measures, all the five countries adopted measures such as restrictions on entry and international travel, closure of schools and industries, lockdown and quarantine. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of implementing these measures varied across countries, based on the response strategies. CONCLUSION: : Although SPAR Scores and GHS Index have evaluated the national core capacities for preparedness and response, the actions to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the fact that most countries still do not build resilient health systems in response to public health emergencies.

To improve the availability of regional variant surveillance, we describe a variant genotyping system that is rapid, accurate, adaptable, and able to detect new low-level variants built with existing hospital infrastructure. METHODS: We used a tiered high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 screening program to characterize variants in a supraregional health system over 76 days. Combining targeted reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and selective sequencing, we screened SARS-CoV-2 reactive samples from all hospitals within our health care system for genotyping dominant and emerging variants. RESULTS: The median turnaround for genotyping was 2 days using the high-throughput RT-PCRCbased screen, allowing us to rapidly characterize the emerging Delta variant. In our population, the Delta variant is associated with a lower cycle threshold value, lower age at infection, and increased vaccine-breakthrough cases. Detection of low-level and potentially emerging variants highlights the utility of a tiered approach. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need for fast, low-cost, high-throughput monitoring of regional viral sequences as the pandemic unfolds and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants increases. Combining RT-PCRCbased screening with selective sequencing allows for rapid genotyping of variants and dynamic system improvement.","output":"High-Throughput Adaptable SARS-CoV-2 Screening for Rapid Identification of Dominant and Emerging Regional Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Australia has maintained low rates of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) infection, due to geographic location and strict public health restrictions. However, the financial and social impacts of these restrictions can negatively affect parents and childrens mental health. In an existing cohort of mothers recruited for their experience of adversity, this study examined: 1) families experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health restrictions in terms of clinical exposure, financial hardship family stress, and family resilience (termed COVID-19 impacts); and 2) associations between COVID-19 impacts and maternal and child mental health. METHODS: Participants were mothers recruited during pregnancy (2013C14) across two Australian states (Victoria and Tasmania) for the right@home trial. A COVID-19 survey was conducted from May-December 2020, when children were 5.9C7.2 years old. Mothers reported COVID-19 impacts, their own mental health (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales short-form) and their childs mental health (CoRonavIruS Health and Impact Survey subscale). Associations between COVID-19 impacts and mental health were examined using regression models controlling for pre-COVID-19 characteristics. RESULTS: 319/406 (79%) mothers completed the COVID-19 survey. Only one reported having had COVID-19. Rates of self-quarantine (20%), job or income loss (27%) and family stress (e.g., difficulty managing childrens at-home learning (40%)) were high. Many mothers also reported family resilience (e.g., family found good ways of coping (49%)). COVID-19 impacts associated with poorer mental health (standardised coefficients) included self-quarantine (mother:  = 0.46, child:  = 0.46), financial hardship (mother:  = 0.27, child:  = 0.37) and family stress (mother:  = 0.49, child:  = 0.74). Family resilience was associated with better mental health (mother:  = -0.40, child:  = -0.46). CONCLUSIONS: The financial and social impacts of Australias public health restrictions have substantially affected families experiencing adversity, and their mental health. These impacts are likely to exacerbate inequities arising from adversity. To recover from COVID-19, policy investment should include income support and universal access to family health services.","output":"Clinical, financial and social impacts of COVID-19 and their associations with mental health for mothers and children experiencing adversity in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans are particularly drawn to social connections.

In the absence of systematic studies on this topic, the aim of this study is to evaluate the attendance and perceived quality of the 2020 EAN virtual congress (VC) compared to the 2019 EAN face-to-face congress (FFC). METHODS Analysis of demographic data of participants obtained from the online registration collected. Comparison of the two congresses based on a survey with questions on the perception of speakers' performance, quality of networking, and other aspects. RESULTS Of 43,596 registered participants, 20,694 active participants attended the VC. Compared to 2019, the number of participants tripled (6916 in 2019) and the cumulated number of participants attending the sessions was five times higher (169,334 in 2020 vs 33,024 in 2019). Out of active participants 55% were from outside Europe, 42% were board-certified neurologists (FFC: 80%), and 21% were students (FFC: 0.6%). The content of the congress was evaluated as 'above expectation' by 56% of the attendees (FFC: 41%). Out of the respondents who had been exposed to earlier EAN congresses 73% preferred the FFC congress compared to the VC (17%). CONCLUSION The VC fulfilled the main mission of organizing high quality EAN congresses despite the restrictions of the impersonal format. The geographical distribution of the participants prove the expected higher inclusivity of a VC.

An important issue is the assessment of within-country heterogeneity for geographically extensive countries. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal changes in health status in Russia and to compare these regional changes with global trends. METHODS: The index, which considers the infant mortality rate and the male and female life expectancy at birth, was used for this purpose. Homogeneous territorial groups were identified using principal component analysis and multivariate ranking procedures. Trend analysis of individual indicators included in the index was also performed to assess the changes over the past 20 years (1990C2017). RESULTS: The study indicated a trend towards convergence in health indicators worldwide, which is largely due to changes in infant mortality. It also revealed that the trend of increasing life expectancy in many regions of Russia is not statistically significant. Significant interregional heterogeneity of health status in Russia was identified according to the application of typological ranking. The regions were characterized by similar index values until the mid-1990s. CONCLUSIONS: The strong spatial inequality in health of population was found in Russia. While many regions of Russia were comparable to the countries in the high-income group in terms of GDP, the progress in health was less pronounced.

Central to this debate is the role of NIRS in preventing intubation in patients with mild respiratory disease and the potential beneficial effects on both patient outcome and resource utilization. However, there remains valid concern that use of NIRS may prolong time to intubation and lung protective ventilation in patients with more advanced disease, thereby worsening respiratory mechanics via self-inflicted lung injury. In addition, the risk of aerosolization with the use of NIRS has the potential to increase healthcare worker (HCW) exposure to the virus. We review the existing literature with a focus on rationale, patient selection and outcomes associated with the use of NIRS in COVID-19 and prior pandemics, as well as in patients with acute respiratory failure due to different etiologies (i.e., COPD, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, etc.) to understand the potential role of NIRS in COVID-19 patients.

It is testimony to the intellectual breadth of Waltons ideas in argumentation theory and fallacies that his work should find a home in medical and health disciplines, particularly epidemiology and public health. In this paper, I examine three areas of Waltons theoretical approach to argument and fallacies that I have found most beneficial to my work on reasoning in public health. First, Waltons collaboration with John Woods resulted in a new, rigorous program of fallacy research. Integral to this new approach to the fallacies was the characterization of non-fallacious variants of most of the major informal fallacies. Second, Walton advocated for a third category of presumptive argument to sit alongside deduction and induction, with plausibility as the standard of rational evaluation. Many so-called informal fallacies, he contended, are rationally warranted presumptive arguments in the practically oriented contexts in which they are advanced. Third, Walton argued that presumptive arguments like the argument from expert opinion can be scrutinized using critical questions during systematic reasoning. They may also bypass critical questions and facilitate a quick leap to a conclusion based on one or two explicit premises during heuristic reasoning. Each of these three areas in Waltons work is discussed in the context of medicine and health, with illustration provided by the current Covid-19 pandemic. ? 2021, College Publications.

However, as more countries' borders closed, the likelihood is that cryptomarkets have been negatively impacted. We aim to measure and understand the success rate of transactions on cryptomarkets during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, through recourse to self-reported data that documents the outcome of cryptomarket transactions. METHODS: To collect self-reported data on cryptomarket transactions, we launched a platform where participants can enter information about their prior activities on cryptomarkets.

RESULTS: The number of unsuccessful transactions increased concurrently with the global spread of the pandemic. Both the international and inter-continental nature of the transactions and the severity of the crisis in the vendor's country are significantly associated with delivery failure. CONCLUSIONS: Drug cryptomarkets may have been disrupted due to the pandemic. The results lead to two opposing explanations for unsuccessful transactions.

Applications exploit the ability of LVMs to identify latent data structure in order to improve data (e.g., through denoising) or to estimate the relation between latent causes and measurements in medical data. In the latter case, LVMs in the form of noisy-OR Bayes nets represent the standard approach to relate binary latents (which represent diseases) to binary observables (which represent symptoms). Bayes nets with binary representation for symptoms may be perceived as a coarse approximation, however. In practice, real disease symptoms can range from absent over mild and intermediate to very severe. Therefore, using diseases/symptoms relations as motivation, we here ask how standard noisy-OR Bayes nets can be generalized to incorporate continuous observables, e.g., variables that model symptom severity in an interval from healthy to pathological. This transition from binary to interval data poses a number of challenges including a transition from a Bernoulli to a Beta distribution to model symptom statistics. While noisy-OR-like approaches are constrained to model how causes determine the observables mean values, the use of Beta distributions additionally provides (and also requires) that the causes determine the observables variances. To meet the challenges emerging when generalizing from Bernoulli to Beta distributed observables, we investigate a novel LVM that uses a maximum non-linearity to model how the latents determine means and variances of the observables. Given the model and the goal of likelihood maximization, we then leverage recent theoretical results to derive an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for the suggested LVM. We further show how variational EM can be used to efficiently scale the approach to large networks. Experimental results finally illustrate the efficacy of the proposed model using both synthetic and real data sets. Importantly, we show that the model produces reliable results in estimating causes using proofs of concepts and first tests based on real medical data and on images.","output":"Inference and Learning in a Latent Variable Model for Beta Distributed Interval Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study divulges the new concept of employees' withdrawal behavior during the global pandemic (COVID-19).

Increasing urbanization of MAYV outbreaks in the Americas has led to concerns that this virus could further expand its geographic range. Given the potential importance of this pathogen, we sought to fill some critical gaps in knowledge regarding MAYV infectivity and geographic variation. This study describes the cytopathogenicity of MAYV in human dermal fibroblasts, human skeletal muscle satellite cells, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK), peripherally derived human macrophages, and Vero cells. MAYV strain isolated from Bolivia (MAYV-U) infected cells more rapidly compared to MAYV strains isolated in Peru and Brazil (MAYV-P; MAYV-B), with high titers (1108 pfu/ml) peaking at 37 hours post infection. MAYV-U also caused the most cytopathic effect in a time dependent manner. Furthermore, differently from the other two prototypic strains, MAYV-U harbors unique mutations in the E2 protein, D60G and S205F, likely to interact with the host cell receptor, which may explain the observed differences in infectivity. We further demonstrate that pre-treatment of cells with interferon- inhibited viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these findings advance our understanding of MAYV infection of human target cells and provide initial data regarding MAYV phenotypic variation according to geography. Author Summary Arthropod-borne viruses are of great public health concern, causing epidemics worldwide due to climate change, changes in land use, rapid urbanization, and the expanding geographic ranges of suitable vectors. Among these viruses, Mayaro is an emerging virus for which little is currently known. This study aims to answer fundamental questions of Mayaro virus biology using three geographically distinct viral strains to examine variability in infection kinetics and infectivity in susceptible cell types. We found one geographic isolate to have accelerated infection kinetics and increased cell damage because of infection. To better understand what was unique about this isolate, we compared their envelope protein, which is critical for entry into a cell. We found that the isolate with increased replication kinetics possessed mutations at sites that may promote viral entry, which could explain these findings. Together, these findings further our understanding of Mayaro virus biology and provide insight into factors that contribute to Mayaro transmission and infectivity.","output":"Infectivity of three Mayaro Virus (Genus Alphavirus, Family Togaviridae) geographic isolates in human cell lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to model and evaluate the Specific Energy Absorption Rate (SAR) values in humans in proximity to fixed multi-antenna I-RFID readers of passive tags under various scenarios mimicking exposure when they are incorporated in Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS), or used to monitor Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

Antigen binding via His-tag insertion into the CoPoP bilayer results in a serum-stable and conformationally intact display of the RBD on the liposome surface. Compared to other vaccine formulations, immunization using CoPoP liposomes admixed with recombinant RBD induces multiple orders of magnitude higher levels of antibody titers in mice that neutralize pseudovirus cell entry, block RBD interaction with ACE2, and inhibit live virus replication. Enhanced immunogenicity can be accounted for by greater RBD uptake into antigen-presenting cells in particulate form and improved immune cell infiltration in draining lymph nodes.

We aimed to assess which intervention components and contextual factors may contribute to the successful delivery and implementation of primary care-led post-diagnostic dementia care. METHODS: Mixed-methods systematic review. We searched five databases (inception-March 2019) with reference list screening and citation tracking. We included studies evaluating post-diagnostic dementia care interventions where primary care had a significant role in dementia care, which assessed one or more implementation elements (acceptability, feasibility, adoption, sustainability, reach, costs, appropriateness or fidelity). Two authors independently critically appraised studies. RESULTS: Out of 4528 unique references, we screened 380 full texts and included 49 evaluations of services collecting implementation process data. Most services had high acceptability ratings. The most acceptable components were information provision, social and emotional support and links to community organisations. Feasibility was chiefly influenced by provider engagement and leadership, building dementia care capacity, sufficient resources/funding and collaboration. Care quality was maximised through adding capacity from a dementia-specific health professional. On the basis of limited data, costs for various primary care-led models did not substantially differ from each other. CONCLUSION: A range of primary care-led dementia care models appear feasible and acceptable. Future services should: add dementia-focussed health professionals into primary care, develop primary care leadership and provide sufficient funding and collaboration opportunities.

The mean age was 49 years (range 9-83 years), and there were seven male patients and 30 female patients. The median size of the feeding artery was 3.7 mm (range 1.5-6.1 mm), and the median size of the venous sac was 9.3 mm (range 2.6-36.6 mm).

How the proteins cooperate in mRNA transport is unknown. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of a Khc-aTm1 complex. The proteins form a tripartite coiled coil comprising two in-register Khc chains and one aTm1 chain, in antiparallel orientation. We show that aTm1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved cargo binding site on Khc, and mutational analysis confirms the importance of this interaction for mRNA transport in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Khc binds RNA directly and that it does so via its alternative cargo binding domain, which forms a positively charged joint surface with aTm1, as well as through its adjacent auxiliary microtubule binding domain. Finally, we show that aTm1 plays a stabilizing role in the interaction of Khc with RNA, which distinguishes aTm1 from classical motor adaptors.","output":"Molecular basis of mRNA transport by a kinesin-1-atypical tropomyosin complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Muscle builders frequently consume protein supplements, but little is known about their effect on the gut microbiota.

The data provide socio-demographic information, level of concerns about the flu, past experience with illnesses, and the type of behavioral changes implemented by each participant. We describe each response with a set of features and divide them in three target categories. These describe those that report i) no (26 %), ii) only moderately (36 %), iii) significant (38 %) changes in behaviors. In these settings, we adopt machine learning algorithms to investigate the extent to which target variables can be predicted by looking only at the set of features. Notably, $66\\\\%$ of the samples in the category describing more significant changes in behaviors are correctly classified through Gradient Boosted Trees. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of each feature in the classification task and uncover complex relationships between individuals' characteristics and their attitude towards behavioral change. We find that intensity, recency of past illnesses, perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of an infection are the most significant features in the classification task. Interestingly, the last two match the theoretical constructs suggested by the Health-Belief Model.

It is still unclear whether a true increase in the risk of stroke exists among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In-hospital ischemic stroke (IHIS) complicated the 0.04C0.06% of all admissions in the pre-COVID-19 era, but its incidence has not been assessed among inpatients with COVID-19. We aimed to compare IHIS incidence among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with that of inpatients with non-COVID-19 illnesses from the same outbreak period and from previous periods. METHODS: This historical cohort study belongs to the COVID-19@Vallecas cohort. The incidence of IHIS was estimated for patients with SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized during MarchCApril 2020 [COVID-19 cohort (CC)], for patients with non-COVID-19 medical illness hospitalized during the same outbreak period [2020 non-COVID-19 cohort (20NCC)], and for inpatients with non-COVID-19 illness admitted during MarchCApril of the years 2016C2019 [historical non-COVID-19 cohort (HNCC)]. Unadjusted risk of IHIS was compared between the three cohorts, and adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of IHIS between cohorts was obtained by means of Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 8126 inpatients were included in this study. Patients in the CC were younger and more commonly men than those from the HNCC and 20NCC. Absolute risk of IHIS was 0.05% for HNCC, 0.23% for 20NCC, and 0.36% for CC, (p = 0.004 for HNCC vs. CC). Cumulative incidence for IHIS by day nine after admission, with death as a competing risk, was 0.09% for HNCC, 0.23% for 20NCC, and 0.50% for CC. In an adjusted Poisson regression model with sex, age, needing of intensive care unit admission, and cohort (HNCC as reference) as covariates, COVID-19 was an independent predictor for IHIS (IRR 6.76, 95% confidence interval 1.66C27.54, p = 0.01). A nonsignificant increase in the risk of IHIS was observed for the 20NCC (IRR 5.62, 95% confidence interval 0.93C33.9, p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was associated with an increase in the incidence of IHIS when compared with inpatients from a historical cohort. Viral infection itself may be related to the increased risk of IHIS among patients with COVID-19, but in view of our results from the 20NCC, it is likely that other factors, such as hospital saturation and overwhelming of health systems, may have played a role in the increased frequency of IHIS.

RESULTS The final structural model was well reflected by fit indices. The research model of international students' intention to wear a mask for protection against COVID-19 was acceptable. All of the hypotheses were supported. Attitude and perceived behavioral control (PBC) were positively related to behavior intention (BI), respectively. Subjective norm (SN) also had a direct effect on attitude, PBC, and BI. CONCLUSIONS Referring to TPB was useful in identifying determinants of mask-wearing. The strongest predictor was SN, which indicated it was deserving of increased attention.

In this context, we implemented a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness intervention in the form of meditation involving together cancer patients, health professionals, and third persons. METHODS: Two groups of 15 participants equally composed of patients, health professionals and third persons were constituted. A dedicated programme on mindfulness and compassion was constructed, including 12 weekly sessions of 1.5 h and a half-day retreat. Adherence and satisfaction with the programme were evaluated. All participants completed questionnaires on perceived stress, quality of life, mindfulness, empathy, and self-efficacy. Burnout was assessed in health professionals. RESULTS: Shared meditation was feasible as 70% of participants attended  80% of the 13 meditation sessions. Satisfaction with the programme was high (median satisfaction score: 9.1 out of 10) and all participants expressed positive attitudes towards shared meditation and a benefit on their global quality of life. Participants reported significant improvement in stress (p < 0.001), global quality of life (p = 0.004), self-efficacy (p < 0.001), and mindfulness skills (p < 0.001) from baseline to post-programme.

However, systematic reviews of the registered clinical trials are still lacking. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials for COVID-19 to summarize their characteristics. METHODS: This study is based on the PRISMA recommendations in the Cochrane handbook. The Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched to identify registered clinical trials related to COVID-19. The retrieval inception date was February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) for COVID-19 were identified. The majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials have been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in the pre-experiment stage, 13 trials were phase III, and four trials were phase IV. The intervention methods included traditional Chinese medicine in 26 trials, Western medicine in 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in 19 trials. The subjects were primarily non-critical adult patients ( 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60C200), and the median length of the trial periods was 179 d (IQR: 94C366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, the methodological quality of both the interventional trials and observational studies was low. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive clinical trials on the treatment of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be performed in China. However, based on the uncertain methodological quality, small sample size, and long trial duration, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence regarding the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future.

Since vaccines have high failure rates, as an alternative, we are presenting a new, designed multi-peptide subunit-based epitope vaccine against COVID-19. The recombinant vaccine construct comprises an adjuvant, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes joined by linkers. The computational data suggest that the vaccine is non-toxic, non-allergenic, thermostable, with the capability to elicit a humoral and cell-mediated immune response. The stabilization of the vaccine construct is validated with molecular dynamics simulation studies. This unique vaccine is made up of 33 highly antigenic epitopes from three proteins that have a prominent role in host-receptor recognition, viral entry, and pathogenicity.

To evaluate the plant importance, use value (UV), relative frequency citation (RFC), relative important index (RI), informant consensus factor (ICF), and fidelity level (FL) were used. Curcuma longa L. had the highest UV (0.79), Artemisia vulgaris L. had the highest RFC value (0.57), and Annona muricata L. had the highest RI value (0.88). Diseases and symptoms or signs involving the respiratory system and injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of external causes recorded the highest ICF value (0.80). Blumea balsamifera (L.) DC. and Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King & H. Rob were the most relevant and agreed species for the former and latter disease categories, respectively. C. odorata had the highest FL value (100%) and was the most preferred medicinal plant used for cuts and wounds.

We utilize the proposed model-calibrated on epidemiological and demographic data-to investigate current questions concerning the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the vaccination campaign. Specifically, we consider scenarios in which the most fragile population has already received the vaccine, and we focus our analysis on the role of schools as drivers of the contagions and on the implementation of targeted intervention policies oriented to children and their families. We perform our analysis by means of a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings suggest that, in a phase with NPIs enacted but in-person education, children play a key role in the spreading of COVID-19. Interestingly, we show that children's testing might be an important tool to flatten the epidemic curve, in particular when combined with enacting temporary online education for classes in which infected students are detected. Finally, we test a vaccination strategy that prioritizes the members of large families and we demonstrate its good performance. We believe that our modeling framework and our findings could be of help for public health authorities for planning their current and future interventions, as well as to increase preparedness for future epidemic outbreaks.","output":"A multi-layer network model to assess school opening policies during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"City bikes and bike-sharing systems (BSSs) are one solution to the last mile problem. BSSs guarantee equity by presenting affordable alternative transportation means for low-income households. These systems feature a multitude of bike stations scattered around a city. Numerous stations mean users can borrow a bike from one location and return it there or to a different location. However, this may create an unbalanced system, where some stations have excess bikes and others have limited bikes. In this paper, we propose a solution to balance BSS stations to satisfy the expected demand. Moreover, this paper represents a direct extension of the deferred acceptance algorithm-based heuristic previously proposed by the authors. We develop an algorithm that provides a delivery truck with a near-optimal route (i.e., finding the shortest Hamiltonian cycle) as an NP-hard problem. Results provide good solution quality and computational time performance, making the algorithm a viable candidate for real-time use by BSS operators. Our suggested approach is best suited for low-Q problems. Moreover, the mean running times for the largest instance are 143.6, 130.32, and 51.85 s for Q = 30, 20, and 10, respectively, which makes the proposed algorithm a real-time rebalancing algorithm.","output":"A Feasible Solution for Rebalancing Large-Scale Bike Sharing Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has led to the sharpest collapse in the Spanish trade of goods and services in recent decades.

The Internet serves as a digital health information platform and is indispensable as a source of medical information. The aim of this work was to examine the behavior of orthopedic patients with respect to finding information on their illnesses. The role and the importance of the Internet as an informative health application for these patients are highlighted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The basis of this prospective cross-sectional study was a patient survey in Germany of orthopedic patients from July 2019 to July 2020. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analyses were carried out to show coherent results. RESULTS: We analyzed the responses of 1262 orthopedic patients. Most of them used the Internet as a digital health information platform. Patients rated their Internet skills as good to very good, regardless of age or educational level. Most respondents said that they currently use the Internet at least once a week to find out about their orthopedic illnesses. Patients reported a positive change in attitude towards the Internet as a digital source of medical information, and its use has increased in the past 12 months. CONCLUSION: The Internet as an informative digital health application in orthopedics is used intensively and is widely accepted by patients. While mistrust of orthopedic health information from the Internet has decreased, patient confidence in meaningful digital health information platforms has increased. The Internet is seen as a useful health information platform alongside medical advice.","output":"Die Rolle des Internets als medizinische Informationsquelle fr orthop?dische Patienten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study examines the market reaction to the World Health Organization (WHO) announcement of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic on the emerging equity markets and compares the reaction with developed markets This study also compares the market reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic with the market reactions to the 2008 global financial crisis Design/methodology/approach: Using the Morgan Stanley Capital International daily stock indices data and the Carhart and the GARCH(1,1) models for an event study, the authors examine the cumulative abnormal returns during 30 and 10 trading days and the extended 60 days before and after the WHO pandemic announcement It also compares the market reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic with the reactions to the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy announcement during the 2008 global financial crisis Findings: This study finds that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly greater negative impact to the stock markets in emerging countries than in the developed countries The negative impact on the emerging markets is more pronounced for firms with small market capitalizations and for growth stocks The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is stronger in the energy and financial sectors in both emerging and developed markets The positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in healthcare and telecommunications for the emerging markets and information technology for the developed markets This study also finds that the equity markets in both emerging and developed countries recovered faster from the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the 2008 global financial crisis Social implications: Investors' desire to diversify their risks across different countries and sectors in the emerging markets could bring superior returns The diversification strategies bring critical financial supports to forestall the contagion of COVID-19, to protect lives, and to save the emerging economies, especially for those financially constrained countries that are facing twin health and economic shocks by channeling their investments to countries with weak healthcare systems Originality/value: This study extends the literature that examines market reactions to stock market shocks by examining the market reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak on the emerging and developed equity markets across different market capitalizations, valuation and sectors This study also finds that the markets recovered quicker from the COVID-19 pandemic announcement than during the 2008 global financial crisis ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Market reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from emerging markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article develops an agent-level stochastic simulation model, termed RAW-ALPS, for simulating the spread of an epidemic in a community The mechanism of transmission is agent-to-agent contact, using parameters reported for the COVID-19 pandemic When unconstrained, the agents follow independent random walks and catch infections due to physical proximity with infected agents Under lockdown, an infected agent can only infect a coinhabitant, leading to a reduction in the spread The main goal of the RAW-ALPS simulation is to help quantify the effects of preventive measurestiming and durations of lockdownson infections, fatalities, and recoveries The model helps measure changes in infection rates and casualties due to the imposition and maintenance of restrictive measures It considers three types of lockdowns: 1) whole population (except the essential workers), 2) only the infected agents, and 3) only the symptomatic agents The results show that the most effective use of lockdown measures is when all infected agents, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic, are quarantined, while the uninfected agents are allowed to move freely This result calls for regular and extensive testing of a population to isolate and restrict all infected agents ?

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase and EuropePMC on 19 November 2020. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, defined as a combined endpoint of mortality, severity, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and need for intensive care unit care. Severity followed the included studies criteria. RESULTS: There are 10 399 patients from 21 studies. Elevated LDH was present in 44% (34%C53%) of the patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that diabetes was correlated with elevated LDH (OR 1.01 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.02), p=0.038), but not age (p=0.710), male (p=0.068) and hypertension (p=0.969). Meta-analysis showed that elevated LDH was associated with composite poor outcome (OR 5.33 (95% CI 3.90 to 7.31), p<0.001; I(2): 77.5%). Subgroup analysis showed that elevated LDH increased mortality (OR 4.22 (95% CI 2.49 to 7.14), p<0.001; I(2): 89%).

DESIGN: Qualitative semistructured interviews. SETTING: All participants were currently, or had previously cared for, a tracheostomised child who had attended a tertiary care centre in the North of England. Health professionals were purposively sampled to include accounts from a range of professions from primary, community, secondary and tertiary care. PARTICIPANTS: Carers of children with tracheostomies (n=34), including health professionals (n=17) and parents (n=17). INTERVENTIONS: Interviews were undertaken between July 2020 and February 2021 by telephone or video link. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Qualitative reflexive thematic analysis with QSR NVivo V.12. RESULTS: The pandemic has presented an additional and, for some, substantial challenge when caring for tracheostomised children, but this was not always felt to be the most overriding concern. Interviews demonstrated rapid adaptation, normalisation and varying degrees of stoicism and citizenship around constantly changing pandemic-related requirements, rules and regulations. This paper focuses on four key themes: reconceptualising safe care and safe places; disrupted support and isolation; relationships, trust and communication; and coping with uncertainty and shifting boundaries of responsibility. These are described within the context of the impact on the child, the emotional and physical well-being of carers and the challenges to maintaining the values of family-centred care.

Using experience from past outbreaks and the current COVID-19 pandemic, we advise strategies to increase surge capacity and limit patient inflow. Triage should identify and geographically cohort symptomatic patients within a designated unit to limit exposure early in an outbreak. Screening and PPE guidelines for both patient and staff should be followed closely, as determined by hospital administration and the CDC.

We examined test scores and measures of clinical performance as well as student experience in order to understand the impact of this change. RESULTS: Two hundred and eight students were included in the analysis, 104 in each cohort. No statistically significant differences were noted between cohorts on NBME subject examination results. There were no significant differences on Step 2 CK scores between the traditional curriculum cohort (M = 249.4, SD = 13.7) and shortened curriculum cohort (M = 248.7, SD = 15.8).

NPI effect on the transmission of other respiratory viruses has not been examined at the national level thus far. Methods Upper respiratory tract specimens from 3580 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), collected within the nationwide German ARI Sentinel, underwent RT-PCR diagnostics for multiple respiratory viruses. The observation period (weeks 1-38 of 2020) included the time before, during and after a far-reaching contact ban. Detection rates for different viruses were compared to 2017-2019 sentinel data (15350 samples;week 1-38, 11823 samples). Findings The March 2020 contact ban, which was followed by a mask mandate, was associated with an unprecedented and sustained decline of multiple respiratory viruses. Among these, rhinovirus was the single agent that resurged to levels equalling those of previous years. Rhinovirus rebound was first observed in children, after schools and daycares had reopened. By contrast, other nonenveloped viruses (i.e. gastroenteritis viruses reported at the national level) suppressed after the shutdown did not rebound. Interpretation Contact restrictions with a subsequent mask mandate in spring may substantially reduce respiratory virus circulation. This reduction appears sustained for most viruses, indicating that the activity of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the subsequent winter season might be low,whereas rhinovirus resurgence, potentially driven by transmission in educational institutions in a setting of waning population immunity, might signal predominance of rhinovirus-related ARIs.

Here, we describe the discovery and genetic characterization by direct pyrosequencing of two novel, divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single male red colobus monkey from Kibale National Park, Uganda. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The viruses were detected directly from blood plasma using pyrosequencing, without prior virus isolation and with minimal PCR amplification. The two new SHFV variants, SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highly divergent from each other (51.9% nucleotide sequence identity) and from the SHFV type strain LVR 42-0/M6941 (52.0% and 51.8% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively) and demonstrate greater phylogenetic diversity within SHFV than has been documented within any other arterivirus. Both new variants nevertheless have the same 3 genomic architecture as the type strain, containing three open reading frames not present in the other arteriviruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results represent the first documentation of SHFV in a wild primate and confirm the unusual 3 genetic architecture of SHFV relative to the other arteriviruses. They also demonstrate a degree of evolutionary divergence within SHFV that is roughly equivalent to the degree of divergence between other arterivirus species. The presence of two such highly divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single individual represents a degree of within-host viral diversity that exceeds what has previously been reported for any arterivirus. These results expand our knowledge of the natural history and diversity of the arteriviruses and underscore the importance of wild primates as reservoirs for novel pathogens.","output":"Novel, Divergent Simian Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses in a Wild Ugandan Red Colobus Monkey Discovered Using Direct Pyrosequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive medical staff compared with those of public.

In vivo induction of hyperglycemia with 100 mg/kg streptozotocin in KrasLSL G12D Pdx1Cre (KP) mice promoted the PanIN formation and progression. Preconditioning with a high- or low-glucose medium for 28 days showed that a high-glucose environment increased cell viability and sphere formation in PANC-1, a Kras-mutant human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, and mPKC1, a Kras-mutant murine pancreatic cancer cell line. In contrast, no changes were observed in BxPC3, a Kras-wild-type human pancreatic cancer cell line. Orthotopic injection of mPKC1 into the pancreatic tails of BL6/J mice showed that cells maintained in high-glucose medium grew into larger tumors than did those maintained in low-glucose medium. Hyperglycemia strengthened the STAT3 phosphorylation, which was accompanied by elevated MYC expression in Kras-mutant cells. Immunohistochemistry showed stronger phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) and MYC staining in PanINs from diabetic KP mice than in those from euglycemic counterparts.

One of the biggest challenges faced by the COVID-19 researchers in the therapeutic field is the knowledge about the biological functions in disease-human interacting proteins. The detection of COVID-19 protein complexes, a group of proteins that possess the same biological functions, helps in better understanding of the biological processes in our body. The main contribution of this work is to cluster proteins that perform the same biological functions to increase the knowledge about the COVID-19 disease-human interacting proteins. The authors investigated proteins linked with COVID-19 disease by creating a disease-human protein-protein interaction graph. Topological means of graph analysis and graph clustering have been employed to group proteins that possess the same biological functions. These clusters will be the protein complexes that work together to carry out a specific biological function in a human cell. Moreover, through the cluster analysis, we can uncover previously unknown COVID-19 disease-human protein links that are beneficial for promising knowledge discovery. Also, the authors evaluated how the Markov Cluster algorithm, a graph-based algorithm finds interesting patterns of similar features from COVID-19 disease-human protein-protein interaction graph. The Markov Cluster algorithm results in six statistically significant protein clusters, including cluster (A): keratinization (3.50E-71), (B): regulation of cellular process (6.62E-05), (C): regulation of cell cycle (1.31E-27), (D): mitotic cell cycle (1.66E-06), (E): regulation of phosphoprotein phosphatase activity (1.15E-09), and (G): G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle (3.03E-07).","output":"Graph analysis and clustering of proteins linked with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on vaccine protection remains poorly understood. Objective: To assess protection from SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection after mRNA vaccination among persons with vs without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Matched-cohort studies in Qatar for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. A total of 1 531 736 individuals vaccinated with either vaccine between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021, were followed up beginning 14 days after receiving the second dose until September 19, 2021. Exposures: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive nasopharyngeal swab regardless of reason for PCR testing or presence of symptoms. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. Results: The BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort comprised 99 226 individuals with and 290 432 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 37 years; 68% male). The mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohort comprised 58 096 individuals with and 169 514 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 36 years; 73% male). Among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, 159 reinfections occurred in those with and 2509 in those without prior infection 14 days or more after dose 2. Among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, 43 reinfections occurred in those with and 368 infections in those without prior infection. Cumulative infection incidence among BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals was an estimated 0.15% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.18%) in those with and 0.83% (95% CI, 0.79%-0.87%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio for breakthrough infection with prior infection, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.15-0.21]; P < .001). Cumulative infection incidence among mRNA-1273-vaccinated individuals was an estimated 0.11% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.15%) in those with and 0.35% (95% CI, 0.32%-0.40%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.25-0.48]; P < .001). Vaccinated individuals with prior infection 6 months or more before dose 1 had statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection than those vaccinated less than 6 months before dose 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.92]; P = .02 for BNT162b2 and 0.40 [95% CI, 0.18-0.91]; P = .03 for mRNA-1273 vaccination). Conclusions and Relevance: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection among individuals receiving the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines in Qatar between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021.

Existing computational tools for the analysis of transcriptomic data are not designed to optimally identify distinct temporal patterns when analyzing dynamic differentially expressed genes (DDEGs). Moreover, there is also a lack of methods to assess and visualize the temporal progression of biological pathways or gene sets mapped from time course transcriptomic datasets. In this study, we developed the open-source R package TrendCatcher (https://github.com/jaleesr/TrendCatcher), which applies the smoothing spline ANOVA model and break point searching strategy to estimate dynamic signals. TrendCatcher identifies and visualizes distinct dynamic transcriptional gene signatures and biological processes from sequential datasets. We used TrendCatcher to perform a systematic temporal analysis of COVID-19 peripheral blood transcriptomic datasets, including both whole blood bulk RNA-seq and PBMC scRNA-seq time course data. TrendCatcher uncovered the early and persistent activation of neutrophils as well as impaired type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in circulating cells as early hallmark of patients who progressed to develop severe COVID-19, whereas no such patterns were identified in individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations or patients with mild COVID-19. These results underscore the importance of systematic temporal analysis of gene expression during disease progression to identify biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets.","output":"Systematic temporal analysis of transcriptomes using TrendCatcher identifies early and persistent neutrophil activation as an early hallmark of severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 as a novel etiological agent of severe respiratory disease in humans. As during infection by other viruses, host sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces several antiviral pathways. These include interferon (IFN), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L, and protein kinase R (PKR). Coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, potently suppress the activation of these pathways, inducing only modest host responses. Our study describes the functions of two accessory proteins unique to MERS-CoV and related viruses, NS4a and NS4b, during infection in human airway epithelium-derived A549 cells. NS4a has been previously characterized as a dsRNA binding protein, while NS4b is a 2,5-phosphodiesterase with structural and enzymatic similarity to NS2 encoded by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We found that deletion of NS4a results in increased interferon lambda (IFNL1) expression, as does mutation of either the catalytic site or nuclear localization sequence of NS4b. All of the mutant viruses we tested exhibited slight decreases in replication. We previously reported that, like MHV NS2, NS4b antagonizes OAS-RNase L, but suppression of IFN is a previously unidentified function for viral phosphodiesterases. Unexpectedly, deletion of NS4a does not result in robust activation of the PKR or OAS-RNase L pathways. Therefore, MERS-CoV likely encodes other proteins that contribute to suppression or evasion of these antiviral innate immune pathways that should be an important focus of future work. This study provides additional insight into the complex interactions between MERS-CoV and the host immune response.","output":"Antagonism of dsRNA-Induced Innate Immune Pathways by NS4a and NS4b Accessory Proteins during MERS Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Labeo rohita, one of the Indian major carps, is the most popular culture species in Indian subcontinent due to its consumer preference and delicacy.

Many VoC mutations are found in the viral spike protein (S-protein), and are thus implicated in host infection and response to therapeutics. Bivalent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are promising therapeutics for COVID-19, but are limited due to low potency and vulnerability to RBD mutations found in VoCs. To address these issues, we used naive phage-displayed peptide libraries to isolate and optimize 16-residue peptides that bind to the RBD or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S-protein. We fused these peptides to the N-terminus of a moderate affinity nAb to generate tetravalent peptide-IgG fusions, and showed that both classes of peptides were able to improve affinities for the S-protein trimer by >100-fold (apparent KD < 1 pM). Critically, cell-based infection assays with a panel of six SARS-CoV-2 variants demonstrate that an RBD-binding peptide was able to enhance the neutralization potency of a high-affinity nAb >100-fold. Moreover, this peptide-IgG was able to neutralize variants that were resistant to the same nAb in the bivalent IgG format. To show that this approach is general, we fused the same peptide to a clinically approved nAb drug, and showed that it rescued neutralization against a resistant variant. Taken together, these results establish minimal peptide fusions as a modular means to greatly enhance affinities, potencies, and breadth of coverage of nAbs as therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Peptide-antibody Fusions Engineered by Phage Display Exhibit Ultrapotent and Broad Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in 2006 significantly reduced childhood incidence of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide.

Our study aimed to summarize the epidemiology of AGE in northeastern Poland prior to 2021 and to evaluate the effectiveness of voluntary, out-of-pocket rotavirus childhood vaccination on the incidence of rotavirus AGE. METHODS: A review of patients aged 0-17 years with gastroenteritis hospitalized between 2006 and 2020 in northeastern Poland in the context of rotavirus vaccine coverage in the region. RESULTS: Rotavirus was the most common agent of gastroenteritis in hospitalized patients. The seasonality of rotavirus gastroenteritis peaked between February and May in each year of study, except for 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic skewed any viable comparison of seasonality. Rotavirus vaccine coverage in northeastern Poland did not exceed 25% during the study period and had no impact on hospitalization numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus was the primary causative agent of AGE in children hospitalized in northeastern Poland during the study period. Voluntary vaccinations did not affect the number of hospitalizations due to rotavirus AGE.

Why are forecasts or predictions made by so-called experts often grossly wrong, concerning the numbers of people who get infected or die? The purpose of this study is to better understand the stochastic nature of an epidemic disease, and answer the above questions. Much of the work on infectious diseases has been based on \\"SIR deterministic models,\\" (Kermack and McKendrick:1927.) We will explore stochastic models that can capture the essence of the seemingly erratic behavior of an infectious disease. A stochastic model, in its formulation, takes into account the random nature of an infectious disease. The stochastic model we study here is based on the \\"birth-and-death process with immigration\\" (BDI for short), which was proposed in the study of population growth or extinction of some biological species. The BDI process model ,however, has not been investigated by the epidemiology community. The BDI process is one of a few birth-and-death processes, which we can solve analytically. Its time-dependent probability distribution function is a \\"negative binomial distribution\\" with its parameter $r$ less than $1$. The \\"coefficient of variation\\" of the process is larger than $\\\\sqrt{1/r} > 1$. Furthermore, it has a long tail like the zeta distribution. These properties explain why infection patterns exhibit enormously large variations. The number of infected predicted by a deterministic model is much greater than the median of the distribution. This explains why any forecast based on a deterministic model will fail more often than not.","output":"Stochastic Modeling of an Infectious Disease, Part I: Understand the Negative Binomial Distribution and Predict an Epidemic More Reliably"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile applications for digital contact tracing have been developed and introduced around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed as a tool to support traditional forms of contact-tracing carried out to monitor contagion, these apps have triggered an intense debate with respect to their legal and ethical permissibility, social desirability and general feasibility. Based on a large-scale study including qualitative data from 349 interviews conducted in nine European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, German-speaking Switzerland, the United Kingdom), this paper shows that the binary framing often found in surveys and polls, which contrasts privacy concerns with the usefulness of these interventions for public health, does not capture the depth, breadth, and nuances of peoples positions towards COVID-19 contact-tracing apps. The paper provides a detailed account of how people arrive at certain normative positions by analysing the argumentative patterns, tropes and (moral) repertoires underpinning peoples perspectives on digital contact-tracing. Specifically, we identified a spectrum comprising five normative positions towards the use of COVID-19 contact-tracing apps: opposition, scepticism of feasibility, pondered deliberation, resignation, and support. We describe these stances and analyse the diversity of assumptions and values that underlie the normative orientations of our interviewees. We conclude by arguing that policy attempts to develop and implement these and other digital responses to the pandemic should move beyond the reiteration of binary framings, and instead cater to the variety of values, concerns and expectations that citizens voice in discussions about these types of public health interventions.

As there is a paucity of evidence on which population is more likely to progress into severe conditions among cases, we looked into the first cluster of death cases, aiming to add to current evidence and reduce panic among the population. METHODS: We prospectively collected the demographic and clinical data of the first 38 fatalities whose information was made public by the Health Commission of Hubei province and the official Weibo account of China Central Television news center, starting from 9 January through 24 January 2020. The death cases were described from four aspects (gender and age characteristics, underlying diseases, the time course of death, symptoms at the incipience of illness and hospital admission). RESULTS: Among the 38 fatalities, 71.05% were male, and 28.95% were female, with the median age of 70 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 65-81). Persons aged 66-75 made up the largest share. Twenty-five cases had a history of chronic diseases. The median time between the first symptoms and death was 12.50 days (IQR = 10.00-16.25), while the median time between the admission and death was 8.50 (IQR = 5.00-12.00) days. In persons aged over 56 years, the time between the first symptoms and death decreased with age, and so did the time between the admission and death, though the latter increased again in persons aged over 85 years. The major first symptoms included fever (52.63%), cough (31.58%), dyspnea (23.68%), myalgia and fatigue (15.79%). CONCLUSIONS: Among the death cases, persons with underlying diseases and aged over 65 made up the majority. The time between the first symptoms and death decreased with the advanced age.

We aimed to quantify the importance of predictors of poor functional outcome despite successful reperfusion. METHODS We analyzed patients from the MR CLEAN Registry between March 2014 and November 2017 with successful reperfusion (extended Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2B). First, predictors were selected based on expert opinion and were clustered according to acquisition over time (ie, baseline patient factors, imaging factors, treatment factors, and postprocedural factors). Second, several models were constructed to predict 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS)). The relative importance of individual predictors in the most extensive model was expressed by the proportion of unique added 2 to the model of that individual predictor. RESULTS Of 3180 patients, 1913 (60%) had successful reperfusion. Of these 1913 patients, 1046 (55%) were functionally dependent at 90 days (mRS >2). The most important predictors for mRS were baseline patient factors (ie, pre-stroke mRS, added 2 0.16; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline, added 2 0.12; age, added 2 0.10), and postprocedural factors (ie, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), added 2 0.12; pneumonia, added 2 0.09). The probability of functional independence for a typical stroke patient with sICH was 54% (95% CI 36% to 72%) lower compared with no sICH, and 21% (95% CI 4% to 38%) for pneumonia compared with no pneumonia. CONCLUSION Baseline patient factors and postprocedural adverse events are important predictors of poor functional outcome in successfully reperfused patients with ischemic stroke.

These seven major causes are detected: flaws of master planning, planner's inadequate background survey and analysis, planner's inaccurate anticipation, planner's lack of practical experience, practitioner's misunderstanding, divergence of views between practitioner and planner, pitfalls of private investment and imbalance of development between regions of China.","output":"Gap between tourism planning and implementation: A case of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of death in cancer patients. Severe treatment side effects and late stage of disease at diagnosis continue to be an issue. We investigated whether local treatment using 2-diethylaminoethyl-dextran methyl methacrylate copolymer with p53 (DDMC-p53) with or without cisplatin and/or microwave ablation enhances disease control in BALBC mice. We used a Lewis lung carcinoma cell line to inoculate 140 BALBC mice, which were divided into the following seven groups; control, cisplatin, microwave ablation, DDMC-p53, DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin, DDMC-p53 plus microwave, and DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin plus microwave. Microwave ablation energy was administered at 20 W for 10 minutes. Cisplatin was administered as 1 mL/mg and the DDMC-p53 complex delivered was 0.5 mL. Increased toxicity was observed in the group receiving DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin plus microwave followed by the group receiving DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin. Infection after repeated treatment administration was a major issue. We conclude that a combination of gene therapy using DDMC-p53 with or without cisplatin and microwave is an alternative method for local disease control. However, more experiments are required in a larger model to identify the appropriate dosage profile.","output":"DDMC-p53 gene therapy with or without cisplatin and microwave ablation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak was announced as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and has affected a growing number of people in the past few months. In this context, advanced artificial intelligence techniques are brought to the forefront as a response to the ongoing fight toward reducing the impact of this global health crisis. In this study, potential use-cases of intelligent speech analysis for COVID-19 identification are being developed. By analyzing speech recordings from COVID-19 positive and negative patients, we constructed audio- and symptomatic-based models to automatically categorize the health state of patients, whether they are COVID-19 positive or not. For this purpose, many acoustic features were established, and various machine learning algorithms are being utilized. Experiments show that an average accuracy of 80% was obtained estimating COVID-19 positive or negative, derived from multiple cough and vowel /a/ recordings, and an average accuracy of 83% was obtained estimating COVID-19 positive or negative patients by evaluating six symptomatic questions.

Novel infectious disease outbreaks, as illustrated by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, demand a rapid response in terms of identifying effective treatments for seriously ill patients. The repurposing of approved drugs from other therapeutic areas is one of the most practical routes through which to approach this. Here, we present a systematic network-based drug repurposing methodology, which interrogates virusChuman, human proteinCprotein and drugCprotein interactome data. We identified 196 approved drugs that are appropriate for repurposing against COVID-19 and 102 approved drugs against a related coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). We constructed a proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network based on disease signatures from COVID-19 and SARS multi-omics datasets. Analysis of this PPI network uncovered key pathways. Of the 196 drugs predicted to target COVID-19 related pathways, 44 (hypergeometric p-value: 1.98e-04) are already in COVID-19 clinical trials, demonstrating the validity of our approach.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may increase the incidence of abuse in the community, creating an additional burden amid the crisis. However, the incidence of abuse in Japan during COVID-19 remains to be evaluated. Accordingly, our study aimed to assess the incidence of physical and verbal abuse among the general population in Japan and to identify the associated factors of abuse during COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: We used the data obtained from a nationwide, cross-sectional internet survey conducted in Japan between August and September 2020. Sampling weights were used to calculate national estimates, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the associated factors for physical and verbal abuse. RESULTS: Out of the total 25 482 participants, 965 (3.8 %) reported experiencing physical abuse and 1941 (7.6%) verbal abuse from April 2020 to September 2020. The incidence of physical and verbal abuse was higher among female participants. Participants who lived in areas where the state of emergency was enforced were more likely to suffer from physical abuse. Similarly, vulnerable participants such as those below age 18, with low income, bad family relationships, and disabled people were more likely to experience both physical and verbal abuse. Participants suffering from COVID-19-related symptoms, who had poor health status and widows/divorcees were more likely to be verbally abused. Furthermore, those who did not follow preventive behaviours such as wearing masks in public places, abusing drugs and drinking alcohol in high amounts were also more likely to experience abuse. CONCLUSION: The impact of abuse was found disproportionately greater in more vulnerable groups of the population.

Although many adenoviruses have been identified in monkeys, the knowledge of these viruses from the Colobinae members is quite limited. FINDINGS: We conducted a surveillance of viral infection in endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) in the subfamily Colobinae in China, and found that 5.1% of sampled individuals were positive for adenovirus. One of the adenoviruses (SAdV-WIV19) was successfully isolated and its full-length genome was sequenced. The full-length genome of WIV19 is 33,562 bp in size, has a G + C content of 56.2%, and encodes 35 putative genes. Sequence analysis revealed that this virus represents a novel species in the genus Mastadenovirus. Diverse cell lines, including those of human origin, were susceptible to WIV19. CONCLUSION: We report the first time the isolation and full-length genomic characterization of an adenovirus from the subfamily Colobinae.

To assess the risk, severity and duration of COVID-19 in relation to access to PPE in at-risk healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: From 17 July to 25 September 2020, at-risk physicians and nurses registered as a provider in the Survey Healthcare Globus network in six countries (the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and USA) were identified based on adult medical specialties with frequent and close contact with patients with COVID-19. Exposed HCWs completed a detailed questionnaire including demographics, medical, social and lifestyle factors. COVID-19 cases were defined as COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, loss of taste or smell) and asymptomatic COVID-19 test positive cases. RESULTS: Among 2884 exposed HCWs (94% medical doctors and 6% nurses or physician assistants), there were 514 reports of COVID-19 illness and 54 asymptomatic COVID-19 test positive cases. COVID-19 risk was significantly associated with close contact with COVID-19 cases both inside and outside the workplace, number of work shifts and hours worked per week. Limited access to PPE compared with access to a fresh mask, gown and gloves and face shield with each patient encounter was associated with a 2.2-fold to 22-fold increased risk of reporting COVID-19 symptoms (p<0.0001), a pattern consistent across all six countries. Further, limited access to PPE was associated with symptom duration greater than 2 weeks and the presence of moderate to severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, abnormal chest X-ray, low oxygen saturations, respiratory distress and acute lung injury. CONCLUSION: In six countries, less access to PPE was strongly associated with both increased risk of reporting COVID-19 illness as well as more prolonged and severe disease course in frontline HCWs.","output":"Access to personal protective equipment in exposed healthcare workers and COVID-19 illness, severity, symptoms and duration: a population-based case-control study in six countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wearing a facemask (FM) reduces the spread of COVID-19, but it also blocks a person's lower visual field. Many new public safety rules were created in response to COVID-19, including mandated FM wearing in some youth sports like youth ice hockey. We hypothesized that FM wearing in youth hockey players obstructs the lower field of view and may impact safety. Youth hockey players (n = 33) aged 12.03 (1.6) years button press when they saw an LED on the floor turn on in two conditions (wearing FM or no FM) in random order. An interleaved one-up/one-down two-alternative-forced-choice adaptive staircase design was used. Visual thresholds were calculated for each condition and participant. The visual angle threshold (VAT) was determined using standing eye height and the linear distance from the tip of the skates to the visual threshold. Paired t-tests determined whether mask wearing changed the VAT. We modeled the probability a player could see the puck on their stick in four distinct scenarios to estimate the potential impact of FM wearing during hockey play. The average unmasked VAT (11.4 degrees) was significantly closer to the skates than the masked VAT (20.3 degrees) (p < 0.001). Our model indicated a significant reduction in ability to visualize the puck using peripheral vision when more upright while wearing a FM. FM wearing compromised their lower visual field, suggesting a downward head tilt may be necessary to see the puck. Playing ice hockey while wearing a FM may lead to unsafe on-ice playing conditions due to downward head tilt to see the puck.","output":"Facemasks Block Lower Visual Field in Youth Ice Hockey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children are exposed to large amounts of information and high levels of stress and anxiety from adults around them, the media, and social communication networks during the Covid-19 period.

This review aims to summarize the current state of the art for safety and efficacy studies in pharmaceutical research and industry to address the relevant regulatory challenges and to provide an outlook on implementing more in vitro methods as alternative to animal testing. While the public demand for alternative methods is becoming louder, first examples have meanwhile found acceptance in relevant guidelines, e.g. the OECD guidelines for skin sensitizer. Besides ethically driven developments, also the rather low throughput and relatively high costs of animal experiments are forcing the industry towards the implementation of alternative methods. In this context, the development of orally inhaled drug products is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the lung as biological barrier and route of administration. The replacement of animal experiments with focus on the lungs requires special designed tools to achieve predictive data.

RESULTS: Two primary themes related to participants perceptions of sources of information about COVID-19 are reported: 1) trusted sources of information and 2) distrust or lack of trust in sources of information. Several subthemes emerged within each primary theme. Results showed high trust in the academic medical center, federal and state public health agencies, and local health care providers. The study also documents diverging voices of distrust and uncertainty in making sense of contradictory information. Participants reported the main reason for their lack of trust was the rapidly changing information and the lack of consistency in information provided across sources.

The corticosteroids appear to be an affordable alternative to tocilizumab. This study aims to estimate the efficacy of tocilizumab and the corticosteroids particularly dexamethasone and methylprednisolone and to identify possible determinants of their efficacy. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched for studies involving tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone in treating COVID-19. We included caseCcontrol and randomized or partially randomized trials. Meta-regression for patient baseline characteristics, co-medications, and tocilizumab dose regimens was performed to identify contributing factors to drug efficacy. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and twenty-four caseCcontrol studies were included in our meta-analysis involving 18,702 patients. Meta-analysis among the RCTs showed that a summary estimate favoring mortality reduction (OR 0.71, 95%CI 0.55 C 0.92) contributed mainly by tocilizumab and dexamethasone. Among caseCcontrol studies, meta-analysis showed mortality reduction (OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.36 C 0.75) contributed by tocilizumab and tocilizumab-methylprednisolone combination. Methylprednisolone alone did not reduce mortality except for one study involving high dose pulse therapy. Meta-analysis also found that all three drugs did not significantly reduce mechanical ventilation (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.32 C 1.60).

In the present study, we systematically collected datasets on Norovirus outbreaks in Japan from 2005 to 2019 and analyzed time-dependent changes in the asymptomatic ratio, the probability of virus detection, and the probability of infection given exposure. Reports of 1,728 outbreaks were published, and feces from all involved individuals, including those with asymptomatic infection, were tested for virus in 434 outbreaks. We found that the outbreak size did not markedly change over this period, but the variance in outbreak size increased during the winter (NovemberCApril). Assuming that natural history parameters did not vary over time, the asymptomatic ratio, the probability of virus detection, and the probability of infection given exposure were estimated to be 18.6%, 63.3% and 84.5%, respectively.

The asymptomatic ratio was as high as 25.8% for outbreaks caused by genotype GII.4 noroviruses.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, aetiology and outcomes of physician-diagnosed sepsis in hospitalised neonates who had previously been discharged home after delivery in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective review using data abstracted from clinical and laboratory databases identified physician-diagnosed sepsis cases in neonates admitted to the general paediatric wards at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital from January 2015 to September 2016. Neonates with physician-diagnosed sepsis were categorised into two groups based on putative pathogens recovered from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid specimens: (i) culture-confirmed sepsis; and (ii) culture-negative sepsis. RESULTS: Of 1 826 neonatal admissions, 1 025 (56.2%) had physician-diagnosed sepsis: 166 (16.2%) with culture-confirmed sepsis and 859 (83.8%) with culture-negative neonatal sepsis. The commonest pathogens causing culture-confirmed neonatal sepsis were Streptococcus viridans (n=53; 26.5%), S. agalactiae (n=38; 19.0%), and Staphylococcus aureus (n=25; 12.5%). The case fatality rates for culture-confirmed sepsis and culture-negative sepsis were 10.8% (18/166) and 2.6% (22/859), respectively. The odds of death occurring during hospitalisation was 10-fold (95% confidence interval 3.7 - 26.9) higher in neonates with culture-confirmed sepsis compared with culture-negative sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, physician-diagnosed sepsis represents a huge disease burden in previously healthy neonates hospitalised from home.

DATA SOURCES We performed a systematic search using Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Popline, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov (1990-2018) using MeSH terms related to maternal mortality, morbidity, and social determinants of health, and limited to the United States. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION Selection criteria included studies examining associations between social determinants and adverse maternal outcomes including pregnancy-related death, severe maternal morbidity, and emergency hospitalizations or readmissions. Using Covidence, three authors screened abstracts and two screened full articles for inclusion. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Two authors extracted data from each article and the data were analyzed using a descriptive approach. A total of 83 studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Seventy-eight of 83 studies examined socioeconomic position or individual factors as predictors, demonstrating evidence of associations between minority race and ethnicity (58/67 studies with positive findings), public or no insurance coverage (21/30), and lower education levels (8/12), and increased incidence of maternal death and severe maternal morbidity. Only 2 of 83 studies investigated associations between these outcomes and socioeconomic, political, and cultural context (eg, public policy), and 20 of 83 studies investigated material and physical circumstances (eg, neighborhood environment, segregation), limiting the diversity of social determinants of health studied as well as evaluation of such evidence.

In May 2020, Argentine facilities with more than 500 annual births were contacted; 58 % of these were from the public sector. RESULTS In total, 104/147 facilities answered (71 %). All had guidelines for care during the pandemic, and 93 % indicated they had been trained on how to use them. A companion was not allowed during childbirth in 26 % of private facilities and in 60 % of public ones (p < 0.01). Deferred cord clamping was recommended in 87 %; rooming-in with asymptomatic newborns was promoted in 62 %; breastfeeding using protective measures was recommended in 70 %; and breast milk using a bottle, in 23 %. In 94 %, family visiting in the Neonatology Unit was restricted. Difficulties included the unavailability of individual rooms for symptomatic newborn infants and a potential shortage of health care staff and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS All facilities are aware of the national guidelines to fight the pandemic. Most have the resources to comply with the recommended protective measures.

Drops in demand, the loss of markets and employment and growing concerns about international cooperation are indications of possible deeper disruptions to come. Amidst this uncertainty, strategies to safeguard food and nutrition security of the worlds poor need to prioritize diversification of production and markets. Nutritious, biofortified crops such as potato, sweetpotato, but also wheat, maize and beans among others, can play a more significant role to provide key micronutrients (vitamin A, iron, zinc) at large scale. Strong local market chains, robust smallholder production systems and increasing commercial utilization make these crops powerful vehicles for securing nutrition when markets and mobility look uncertain. We posit that the evolving impacts of COVID-19 provide an opportunity to focus agricultural innovations, including the development and delivery of biofortified crops, on new and more specifically defined jobs to be done throughout the food system.

DESIGN: A comparative interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the impact of the Executive Order in NY with Massachusetts (MA) as a comparison state. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data on COVID-19 in NY and MA from March 25 to May 6, 2020. INTERVENTION: The Executive Order on face mask use in NY. MAIN MEASURES: Daily numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. KEY RESULTS: The average daily number of confirmed cases in NY decreased from 8549 to 5085 after the Executive Order took effect, with a trend change of 341 (95% CI, 187-496) cases per day. The average daily number of deaths decreased from 521 to 384 during the same two time periods, with a trend change of 52 (95% CI, 44-60) deaths per day. Compared to MA, the decreasing trend in NY was significantly greater for both daily numbers of confirmed cases (P = 0.003) and deaths (P < 0.001).

However, there have been concerns among educators regarding the efficacy of this vaccine, as compared to the other types of vaccines (e.g., mRNA). The objective of this study was to investigate the reactogenicity and the immunogenicity of this vaccine. Participants, specifically teachers, were invited for serological testing  4 weeks post-vaccination. Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) were measured. Of the 192 participants, the mean age was 50.5  8.3 years and the mean (range) dosing interval was 69.6  (25C111) days. Adverse reactions included feeling feverish (44.8%), headache (41.7%), malaise/chills (38.0%), and injection-site tenderness (37.5%); these were reported more frequently after the first dose (84.9%). Fewer males than females (54.8% vs. 80.1%) and fewer older participants (65.7% vs. 90.4%) reported side effects (p < 0.002; p < 0.0001, respectively).

Genetic complementation analyses suggest that the majority of the gene 1 products are required for viral RNA synthesis. However, there is no physical evidence supporting the association of any of these products with viral RNA synthesis. We have now performed immunofluorescent-staining studies with four polyclonal antisera to localize various MHV-A59 gene 1 products in virus-infected cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that these antisera detected proteins representing the two papain-like proteases and the 3C-like protease encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1a, the putative polymerase (p100) and a p35 encoded by ORF 1b, and their precursors. De novo-synthesized viral RNA was labeled with bromouridine triphosphate in lysolecithin-permeabilized MHV-infected cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that all of the viral proteins detected by these antisera colocalized with newly synthesized viral RNA in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region of infected cells. Several cysteine and serine protease inhibitors, i.e., E64d, leupeptin, and zinc chloride, inhibited viral RNA synthesis without affecting the localization of viral proteins, suggesting that the processing of the MHV gene 1 polyprotein is tightly associated with viral RNA synthesis. Dual labeling with antibodies specific for cytoplasmic membrane structures showed that MHV gene 1 products and RNA colocalized with the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells. However, in murine 17CL-1 cells, the viral proteins and viral RNA did not colocalize with the Golgi apparatus but, instead, partially colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results provide clear physical evidence that several MHV gene 1 products, including the proteases and the polymerase, are associated with the viral RNA replication-transcription machinery, which may localize to different membrane structures in different cell lines.","output":"Colocalization and membrane association of murine hepatitis virus gene 1 products and De novo-synthesized viral RNA in infected cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading globally, and the WHO has declared this outbreak a pandemic.

Recent Findings: Clinical pharmacology is an essential core competency for all health professionals, correlating with ability to appropriately and safely prescribe, administer, or optimize medication regimens. Computer-assisted learning became the earliest form of simulation applied to pharmacology teaching, arising from increasing pressure to deviate from animal and tissue experiments in undergraduate education in the 1990s. In the last decade, high fidelity patient simulation, using manikin technology, has demonstrated benefit in building connectivity between knowledge and clinical application within patient care. Serious games, or computer-based educational games, provide an alternative method for creating context, with potential realized for newer technologies like augmented reality. These tools, while beneficial, are not applied in a uniform manner across programs. We advocate for routine incorporation of these tools as they offer significant opportunities to address the challenges faced in today's healthcare education, particularly with the need for continued social distancing and limitations on in-person educational engagement during coronavirus.

We assessed the perceived impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, length of isolation, diagnosis/symptoms/hospitalisation related to the COVID-19 (oneself and family). Paranoid ideations and hallucination-like experiences were assessed via the Paranoia Scale and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale, respectively. Self-reported measures of negative affect, loneliness, sleep difficulties, jumping to conclusion bias, repetitive thoughts, among others, were also included. RESULTS Final regression model for paranoia indicated that socio-demographic variables (age, sex and education), loneliness, cognitive bias, anxiety, experiential avoidance, repetitive thoughts and hallucinations were associated with paranoia (R2 = 0.43). For hallucinations, clinical variables as well as the quality of sleep, behavioural activation, repetitive thoughts, anxiety and paranoia were associated with hallucinations in our sample (R2 = 0.27).

For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases. According to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95% credible interval [CI] 2.5, 4.2) after first possible detectability at a cycle threshold value of 22.3 (95% CI 20.5, 23.9).

A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR test substantially improves certainty about a patients infection stage. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time.

Human-derived cell lines are susceptible to PDCoV infection. Herein, we compare the gene expression profiles of an established host swine cells to potential emerging host human cells after infection with PDCoV. Cell lines derived from intestinal lineages were used to reproduce the primary sites of viral infection in the host. Porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC) were infected with PDCoV. RNA-sequencing was performed on total RNA extracted from infected cells. Human cells exhibited a more pronounced response to PDCoV infection in comparison to porcine cells with more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in human, 7486, in comparison to pig cells, 1134. On the transcriptional level, the adoptive host human cells exhibited more DEGs in response to PDCoV infection in comparison to the primary pig host cells, where different types of cytokines can control PDCoV replication and virus production. Key immune-associated DEGs and signaling pathways are shared between human and pig cells during PDCoV infection. These included genes related to the NF-kappa-B transcription factor family, the interferon (IFN) family, the protein-kinase family, and signaling pathways such as the apoptosis signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, inflammation/cytokineCcytokine receptor signaling pathway. MAP4K4 was unique in up-regulated DEGs in humans in the apoptosis signaling pathway. While similarities exist between human and pig cells in many pathways, our research suggests that the adaptation of PDCoV to the porcine host required the ability to down-regulate many response pathways including the interferon pathway. Our findings provide an important foundation that contributes to an understanding of the mechanisms of PDCoV infection across different hosts.

The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools were applied to evaluate the quality of studies. The primary outcome was defined as the proportion of patients with the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) scale of 2b/3 at the end of all procedures. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with functional independence (modified Rankin scale of 0-2) at the third month, the proportion of patients with the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) scale of 2b/3 by primary chosen device, and the proportion of patients who received rescue therapies. Safety outcomes were the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) rate and the mortality rate within 3 months. Results: One randomized controlled trial, one prospective cohort study, and two retrospective cohort studies were included. No significant difference between these 2 strategies of management were observed in the primary outcome (TICI scale at the end of all procedures, odds ratio [OR] = 0.78), two secondary outcomes (functional independence at the third month, OR = 1.16; TICI scale by primary chosen device, OR = 1.25), and all safety outcomes (sICH rate, OR = 1.56; mortality rate, OR = 0.91). The proportion of patients who received rescue therapies was higher in the first-line ADAPT group (OR = 0.64). Conclusions: Among first-line thrombectomy devices for patients with ischemic stroke, ADAPT with the latest thrombosuction system was as efficient and safe as stent retrievers.","output":"First-Line A Direct Aspiration First-Pass Technique vs. First-Line Stent Retriever for Acute Ischemic Stroke Therapy: A Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an urgent call to contribute to the fight against an immense threat to the human population.

Inaccessible by conventional techniques, the mass of single nanoparticles and viruses (>10MDa) can be readily measured by NEMS (Nano-electromechanical Systems) based Mass Spectrometry, where charged and isolated analyte particles are generated by Electrospray Ionization (ESI) in air and transported onto the NEMS surface for capture and detection. However, the applicability of NEMS as a practical solution is hindered by their miniscule surface area, which results in poor limit-of-detection and low capture efficiency values. Another hindrance is the necessity to house the NEMS inside complex vacuum systems, which is required in part to focus analytes towards the miniscule detection surface of the NEMS. Here, we overcome both limitations by integrating an ionic lens onto the NEMS chip. The ionic lens is composed of a polymer layer, which charges up by receiving part of the ions incoming from the ESI tip and consequently starts to focus the analytes towards an open window aligned with the active area of the NEMS electrostatically. With this integrated system, we have detected the mass of gold and polystyrene nanoparticles under ambient conditions and with record capture efficiencies. We then applied this technology to obtain the mass spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and BoHV-1 virions. With the increase in analytical throughput, the simplicity of the overall setup and the operation capability under ambient conditions, the technique brings NEMS mass spectrometry one step closer towards efficient mass detection of engineered nanoparticles and biological samples.","output":"Vacuum-Free Mass Spectrometry of Single Viruses and Nanoparticles by Nano-Electromechanical Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emission-aware and flexible building operation can play a crucial role in the energy transition. On the one hand, building operation accounts for a significant portion of global energy-related emissions. On the other hand, they may provide the future low-carbon energy system with flexibility to achieve secure, stable, and efficient operation. This paper reports an experimental implementation of an emission-aware flexible prosumer considering all behind-the-meter assets of an actual occupied building by incorporating a model predictive control strategy into an existing building energy management system. The resultant can minimize the equivalent carbon emission due to electricity imports and provide flexibility to the energy system. The experimental results indicate an emission reduction of 12.5% compared to a benchmark that maximizes PV self-consumption. In addition, flexibility provision is demonstrated with an emulated distribution system operator. The results suggest that flexibility can be provided without the risk of rebound effects due to the flexibility envelope self-reported in advance.","output":"Experimental implementation of an emission-aware prosumer with online flexibility quantification and provision"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a major unanticipated stress on our workforce, organizational structure, systems of care, and critical resource supply.

Currently, RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based nucleic acid assays, while SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody are identified by immunological assays. Both nucleic acid assays and immunological assays rely on the luminescence signals of specific luminescence probes for qualitative and quantitative detection. The exploration of novel luminescence probes will play a crucial role in improving the detection sensitivity of the assays. As innate probes, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit negligible luminescence in the free state but enhanced luminescence in the aggregated or restricted states. Moreover, AIEgen-based nanoparticles (AIE dots) offer efficient luminescence, good biocompatibility and water solubility, and superior photostability. Both AIEgens and AIE dots have been widely used for high-performance detection of biomolecules and small molecules, chemical/biological imaging, and medical therapeutics. In this review, the availability of AIEgens and AIE dots in nucleic acid assays and immunological assays are enumerated and discussed.

In a previous phase 2a trial, RTB101 (previously known as BEZ235), an oral mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, was observed to increase IFN-induced antiviral gene expression and decrease the incidence of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in older adults. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether oral RTB101 upregulated IFN-induced antiviral responses and decreased the incidence of viral RTIs when given once daily for 16 weeks during winter cold and flu season. Methods We did a phase 2b and a phase 3 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in adults aged at least 65 years enrolled in New Zealand, Australia, and the USA at 54 sites. In the phase 2b trial, patients were aged 65-85 years, with asthma, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, were current smokers, or had an emergency room or hospitalisation for an RTI within the past 12 months. In the phase 3 trial, patients were aged at least 65 years, did not have COPD, and were not current smokers. In the phase 2b trial, patients were randomly assigned to using a validated automated randomisation system to oral RTB101 5 mg, RTB101 10 mg once daily, or placebo in part 1 and RTB101 10 mg once daily, RTB101 10 mg twice daily, RTB101 10 mg plus everolimus once daily, or matching placebo in part 2. In the phase 3 trial, patients were randomly assigned to RTB101 10mg once daily or matching placebo. The phase 2b primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed RTIs during 16 weeks of winter cold and influenza season and the phase 3 primary outcome was the incidence of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness defined as symptoms consistent with an RTI, irrespective of whether an infection was laboratory-confirmed. Patients, investigators, and sponsor were masked to treatment assignments. All patients who received at least part of one dose of study drug were included in the primary and safety analyses. The phase 2b trial was registered with ANZCTR, ACTRN12617000468325, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03373903, and the phase 3 trial was registered with ANZCTR, ACTRN12619000628145. Findings In the phase 2b trial, we recruited 652 participants in total between May 16, 2017, and Jan 10, 2018, 179 participants to part 1 of the study (randomly assigned 1:1:1 to RTB101 5 mg once daily [61 participants], RTB101 10 mg once daily [58 participants], or matching placebo [60 participants]) and 473 patients to part 2 (randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to RTB101 10 mg once daily [118 participants], RTB101 10 mg twice daily [120 participants], RTB101 10 mg in combination with everolimus 0.1 mg daily [115 participants] or matching placebo [120 participants]). In our first prespecified statistical analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for part 2 of the phase 2b trial efficacy of RTB101 10 mg in combination with everolimus 0.1 mg once daily compared with placebo did not meet statistical significance but, in our second prespecified analysis, which included data from part 1 and part 2, we found a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients who had one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs in the RTB101 10 mg once daily treatment group (34 [19%] of 176) compared with the pooled placebo group (50 [28%] of 180;odds ratio [OR] 0.601 [90% CI 0.391-0.922];p=0.02). In the phase 3 trial, we enrolled 1024 patients between May 7, 2018, and July 19, 2019. 513 (50.1%) participants were randomly assigned to RTB101 10 mg once daily and 510 (49.9%) to placebo. In the full analysis set of the phase 3 trial, RTB101 did not reduce the proportion of patients with clinically symptomatic respiratory illness (134 [26%] of 511 patients in the RTB101 treatment group vs 125 [25%] 510 patients in the placebo treatment group;OR 1.07 [90% CI 0.80-1.42];p=0.65). In both trials, significantly more IFN-induced antiviral genes were upregulated in patients treated with RTB101 as compared with placebo. The study drug was found to be safe and well-tolerated across trials and treatment groups. Only one patient in the placebo group in the phase 3 trial had serious adverse events (nausea, fatigue, hyponatraemia, and arthralgia) which were considered related to study drug treatment. Three patients died in the phase 2b trial and one in the phase 3 trial but no deaths were considered related to study treatment. Interpretation The combined results indicate that low doses of the mTOR inhibitor RTB101 are well tolerated and upregulate IFN-induced antiviral responses in older adults. Further refinement of clinical trial endpoints and patient populations might be required to identify whether upregulation of IFN responses by mTOR inhibitors consistently decreases the incidence or severity of viral infections in older adults.

METHODS: The survey questionnaire was designed by a team of experts based on a review of the literature and was distributed electronically through the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties to residents registered in all radiology residency training programs in Saudi Arabia during the academic year 2019 to 2020. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentage. Numerical variables were presented as mean and standard deviation if normally distributed. Chi-square testing was used to compare categorical variables with the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spearman correlation was used to correlate numerical variables at the level of significance p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 109 residents completed the online survey during the study period, with a response rate of 32.2% (109/337). The mean age was 27.3 years (standard deviation, 1.86). The majority of respondents (71.5%, 78/109) reported either a severe or moderate negative impact on educational activities. Also, the majority (73.4%, 80/109) reported either a minimal or moderate negative impact on clinical activities. Residents training in the western province perceived a statistically higher negative impact on educational activities compared to their peers in other regions (pa?=a?0.01). Residents in their second year of residency training perceived a statistically higher negative impact on their participation in clinical activities (pa?=a?0.014).

While the four seasonal HCoVs appear to be mildly pathogenic and circulate among human populations, the other three designated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe diseases in some cases. The newly identified SARS-CoV-2, a causative virus of COVID-19 that can be deadly, is now spreading worldwide much more efficiently than the other two pathogenic viruses. Despite evident differences in these properties, all HCoVs commonly have an exceptionally large genomic RNA with a rather peculiar gene organization and have the potential to readily alter their biological properties. CoVs are characterized by their biological diversifications, high recombination, and efficient adaptive evolution. We are particularly concerned about the high replication and transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to the emergence of more transmissible and/or pathogenic viruses than ever before. Furthermore, novel variant viruses may appear at any time from the CoV pools actively circulating or persistently being maintained in the animal reservoirs, and from the CoVs in infected human individuals. In this review, we describe knowns of the CoVs and then mention their unknowns to clarify the major issues to be addressed. Genome organizations and sequences of numerous CoVs have been determined, and the viruses are presently classified into separate phylogenetic groups. Functional roles in the viral replication cycle in vitro of non-structural and structural proteins are also quite well understood or suggested. In contrast, those in the in vitro and in vivo replication for various accessory proteins encoded by the variable 3 one-third portion of the CoV genome mostly remain to be determined. Importantly, the genomic sequences/structures closely linked to the high CoV recombination are poorly investigated and elucidated. Also, determinants for adaptation and pathogenicity have not been systematically investigated. We summarize here these research situations. Among conceivable projects, we are especially interested in the underlying molecular mechanism by which the observed CoV diversification is generated.

Although screening is a successful technique for lowering these rates, there are still great differences in screening adherence in Spain. The aims of this study were to examine the evolution of cytology screening adherence from 2017 and 2020 and to identify the factors associated with uptake among women in Spain. We found that 73.18% of women had received a cytology test during the previous three years. From 2017 and 2020, there was an increase in cytology screening participation among women aged 45C65 years. Foreigners were less likely to have a cytology test. The characteristics associated with cervical cancer screening that we discovered have significant value for public health initiatives, as they will assist health professionals in identifying women who are less likely to undergo screening and encouraging these women to do so. ABSTRACT: Cervical cancer rates have declined in industrialized nations as a result of cytology screening programs. However, there are still sizeable differences in screening adherence in Spain. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of cervical cancer screening among women in Spain, to analyze trends in that prevalence from 2017 and 2020 and to identify socio-demographic, health, and lifestyle factors related with adherence to this screening test. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 13,619 women aged 25C65 who participated in the 2017 Spanish National Health Survey and the 2020 European Health Survey for Spain. We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between socio-demographic, health and lifestyle factors and cervical cancer adherence. The prevalence of adherence was 73.18%. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in cervical cancer screening uptake from 2017 and 2020 among women aged 25C44 years (2017: 77.80%, 2020: 75.20%, p = 0.02), but an increase in the age group of 45C65 years (2017: 68.93%, 2020: 72.39%, p < 0.01) and in foreigners (2017: 64.29%, 2020: 72.29%, p < 0.01). Screening for cervical cancer is related with age, educational level, social class, insurance status, visits to the family doctor, alcohol consumption and free time physical exercise.","output":"Trends and Determinants in Uptake of Cervical Cancer Screening in Spain: An Analysis of National Surveys from 2017 and 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in severe disruption to people's lives as governments imposed national lockdowns. Several large surveys have underlined the detrimental short- and long-term mental health consequences resulting from this disruption, but survey findings are only informative of individuals' retrospectively reported psychological states. Furthermore, knowledge on psychobiological responses to lockdown restrictions is scarce. We used smartphone-based real-time assessments in 731 participants for 7 days and investigated how individuals self-reported stress and mood fluctuated diurnally during lockdown in spring 2020. We found that age, gender, financial security, depressive symptoms and trait loneliness modulated the diurnal dynamics of participants' momentary stress and mood. For example, younger and less financially secure individuals showed an attenuated decline in stress as the day progressed, and similarly, more lonely individuals showed a diminished increase in calmness throughout the day. Hair collected from a subsample (n = 140) indicated a decrease in cortisol concentrations following lockdown, but these changes were not related to any of the assessed person-related characteristics.

A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sourcesWikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archiveto quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.","output":"The impact of news exposure on collective attention in the United States during the 2016 Zika epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) represent an innovative development approach for new alloy systems. These materials have been found to yield promising properties, such as high strength in combination with sufficient ductility as well as high wear and corrosion resistance. Especially for alloys with a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, advantageous surface properties have been revealed. However, typical HEA systems contain high contents of expensive or scarce elements. Consequently, applying them as coatings where their use is limited to the surface represents an exciting pathway enabling economical exploitation of their superior properties. Nevertheless, processing conditions strongly influence the resulting microstructure and phase formation, which in turn has a considerable effect on the functional properties of HEAs. In the presented study, microstructural differences between high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and high-velocity air fuel (HVAF) sprayed coatings of the alloy AlCrFeCoNi are investigated. A metastable bcc structure is formed in both coating processes. Precipitation reactions are suppressed by the rapid solidification during atomization and by the relatively low thermal input during spraying. The coating resistance to corrosive media was investigated in detail, and an improved passivation behavior was observed in the HVAF coatings.","output":"Microstructure and Corrosion Properties of AlCrFeCoNi High-Entropy Alloy Coatings Prepared by HVAF and HVOF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND CONTEXT Rapid and stable fixation at the bone-implant interface would be regarded as one of the primary goals to achieve clinical efficacy, regardless of the surgical site. Although mechanical and physical properties of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) provide advantages for implant devices, the hydrophobic nature and the lack of direct bone contact remains a limitation. PURPOSE To examine the effects of a plasma-sprayed titanium coated PEEK on the mechanical and histologic properties at the bone-implant interface. STUDY SETTING A preclinical laboratory study. METHODS Polyetheretherketone and plasma-sprayed titanium coated PEEK implants (Ti-bond; Spinal Elements, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were placed in a line-to-line manner in cortical bone and in a press-fit manner in cancellous bone of adult sheep using an established ovine model. Shear strength was assessed in the cortical sites at 4 and 12 weeks, whereas histology was performed in cortical and cancellous sites at both time points. RESULTS The titanium coating dramatically improved the shear strength at the bone-implant interface at 4 weeks and continued to improve with time compared with PEEK. Direct bone ongrowth in cancellous and cortical sites can be achieved using a plasma-sprayed titanium coating on PEEK. CONCLUSIONS Direct bone to implant bonding can be achieved on PEEK in spite of its hydrophobic nature using a plasma-sprayed titanium coating.

RESULTS: A comprehensive test and treatment strategy and risk analysis was developed with practical suggestions for a wide range of typical activities in dental and medical offices. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants via aerosols and droplets as well as the difficulties to maintain the minimum distance form special challenges to the dental routine. RATs might in addition to optimal and necessary hygienic standards in combination with the use of adequate personal protection equipment be an important instrument in managing the challenges.

The infectious risk from blood transfusion is predominantly hepatitis, and non-A, non-B and hepatitis C (HCV) are the most common subtypes noted.

The aim of this mixed-methods study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on eating styles and behaviors, physical activity (PA), screen time, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children (0C18 years) with severe obesity. METHODS: During the first COVID-19 wave (April 2020), validated questionnaires were completed and semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with parents of children with severe obesity (adult body mass index [BMI]-equivalent 35 kg/m2) and/or with the children themselves. Changes in pre-pandemic versus lockdown scores of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire Children, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and Dutch PA Questionnaire were assessed. Qualitative analyses were performed according to the Grounded Theory. RESULTS: Ninety families were approached of which 83 families were included. Characteristics of the included children were: mean age 11.2  4.6 years, 52% female, mean BMI SD-score +3.8  1.0. Emotional, restrained, and external eating styles, HRQoL, and (noneducational) screen time did not change on group level (all p > 0.05). However, weekly PA decreased (mean difference ?1.9 h/week, p = 0.02) mostly in adolescents. In the majority of children, mean weekly PA decreased to 2 h/week. Children with high emotional or external eating scores during lockdown or pre-existent psychosocial problems had the lowest HRQoL (p < 0.01). Qualitative analyses revealed an increased demand for food in a significant proportion of children (n = 21), mostly in children <10 years (19/21). This was often attributed to loss of daily structure and perceived stress. Families who reported no changes (n = 15) or improved eating behaviors (n = 11) attributed this to already existing strict eating schemes that they kept adhering to during lockdown. CONCLUSION: This study shows differing responses to COVID-19 lockdown measures in children with severe obesity. On group level, PA significantly decreased and in substantial minorities eating styles and HRQoL deteriorated. Children with pre-existent psychosocial problems or pre-pandemic high external or emotional eating scores were most at risk. These children and their families should be targeted by health care professionals to minimize negative physical and mental health consequences.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Related Lockdown Measures on Lifestyle Behaviors and Well-Being in Children and Adolescents with Severe Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza A virus NS1 protein is a multifunctional virulence factor consisting of an RNA binding domain (RBD), a short linker, an effector domain (ED), and a C-terminal tail. Although poorly understood, NS1 multimerization may autoregulate its actions. While RBD dimerization seems functionally conserved, two possible apo ED dimers have been proposed (helix-helix and strand-strand). Here, we analyze all available RBD, ED, and full-length NS1 structures, including four novel crystal structures obtained using EDs from divergent human and avian viruses, as well as two forms of a monomeric ED mutant. The data reveal the helix-helix interface as the only strictly conserved ED homodimeric contact. Furthermore, a mutant NS1 unable to form the helix-helix dimer is compromised in its ability to bind dsRNA efficiently, implying that ED multimerization influences RBD activity. Our bioinformatical work also suggests that the helix-helix interface is variable and transient, thereby allowing two ED monomers to twist relative to one another and possibly separate. In this regard, we found a mAb that recognizes NS1 via a residue completely buried within the ED helix-helix interface, and which may help highlight potential different conformational populations of NS1 (putatively termed helix-closed and helix-open) in virus-infected cells. Helix-closed conformations appear to enhance dsRNA binding, and helix-open conformations allow otherwise inaccessible interactions with host factors. Our data support a new model of NS1 regulation in which the RBD remains dimeric throughout infection, while the ED switches between several quaternary states in order to expand its functional space. Such a concept may be applicable to other small multifunctional proteins.","output":"A Transient Homotypic Interaction Model for the Influenza A Virus NS1 Protein Effector Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in increased rates of hepatic decompensation, morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from existing liver disease, and deranged liver biochemistries in those without liver disease.

In 2006, a partnership developed between occupational health and infection control experts in Canada and institutions in South Africa (including an institute with a national mandate to conduct research and provide guidance to protect health workers from infectious diseases and promote improved working conditions). This article describes the collaboration, analyzes the determinants of success and shares lessons learned. METHODS: Synthesizing participant-observer experience from over 9 years of collaboration and 10 studies already published from this work, we applied a realist review analysis to describe the various achievements at global, national, provincial and hospital levels. Expectations of the various parties on developing new insights, providing training, and addressing service needs were examined through a micro-meso-macro lens, focusing on how each main partner organization contributed to and benefitted from working together. RESULTS: A state-of-the-art occupational health and safety surveillance program was established in South Africa following successful technology transfer from a similar undertaking in Canada and training was conducted that synergistically benefitted Northern as well as Southern trainees. Integrated policies combining infection control and occupational health to prevent and control infectious disease transmission among health workers were also launched. Having a national (South-South) network reinforced by the international (NorthCsouth) partnership was pivotal in mitigating the challenges that emerged. CONCLUSIONS: High-income country partnerships with experience in health system strengthening C particularly in much needed areas such as occupational health and infection control C can effectively work through strong collaborators in the Global South to build capacity. Partnerships are particularly well positioned to sustainably reinforce efforts at national and sub-national LMIC levels when they adopt a communities of practice model, characterized by multi-directional learning.

In the absence of vaccines that provide complete protection against these viruses, viral surveillance can identify disease burden and target virus-specific preventative measures. Influenza infection, in particular, has significant adverse effects on force readiness. METHODS We tracked the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center tested for during routine patient care using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen testing. We collected data on the date and location of the testing, as well as the age of the individual tested from two consecutive respiratory viral seasons. RESULTS During the first year of data compilation (2017-2018), 2556 tests were performed; 342 (13.4%) were positive for influenza A and 119 (4.7%) were positive for influenza B. After influenza, the most common families of viruses identified were rhino/enterovirus (490 [19.2%]). During the second year (2018-2019), 4,458 tests were run; 564 (12.7%) were positive for influenza A and 35 (0.79%) were positive for influenza B, while rhino/enterovirus was identified in 690 (15.4%). Influenza peaked early during the 2017-2018 season and later during the 2018-2019 season. Importantly, during the 2017-2018 season, the vaccine was less effective for the H3N2 strain circulating that year and viral surveillance quickly identified a hospital-specific outbreak and a larger disease burden. This was in contrast to the 2018-2019 vaccine which exhibited higher effectiveness for circulating strains. CONCLUSION Our data highlight the seasonality of respiratory viruses with a focus on influenza. By tracking respiratory viruses in Department of Defense communities, we may be able to predict when influenza may cause the greatest burden for distinct organizational regions and prescribe with greater precision preventative protocols by location, as well as rapidly determine vaccine efficacy. Our current data suggest that when vaccine strains are mismatched, rapid upfront targeting of antivirals may be warranted, but when the vaccine strains are better matched, late season peaks of disease may indicate waning immunity and should be monitored.","output":"Local Respiratory Viral Surveillance Can Focus Public Health Interventions to Decrease Influenza Disease Burden."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Kawasaki disease (KD) can be associated with concomitant viral or bacterial infections. Children with persistent or recurrent fever 36 hours after the end of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are considered to be resistant to treatment and are at increased risk for coronary complications. Although concomitant infection does not affect coronary outcome, it is unknown how it influences the response to IVIG treatment. METHODOLOGY: Retrospective cohort study between 2008 and 2016 in a tertiary pediatric university hospital, including 154 children, of which 59 (38%) had concomitant infection. RESULTS: Children with concomitant infection were more likely to have fever 48 hours after initial IVIG treatment (36% vs 20%, p = 0.05) and to be treated with a second dose (33% vs 18%, p = 0.04). Children with infection had higher C-reactive protein at the time of diagnosis (148 vs 112 mg/L, p = 0.04), and 48 hours after IVIG administration (111 vs 59 mg/L, p = 0.003). Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of coronary complications (Z-score > 2.5) between children with and without concomitant infection (36% vs 39%, p = 0.68). CONCLUSION: Children with KD and concomitant infection are more likely to have persistent fever and elevated inflammatory markers after treatment. This association increases the likelihood of receiving a second dose of IVIG but not the risk of coronary complication. Accordingly, prospective studies to distinguish true IVIG resistance from infection induced persistent fever is warranted.","output":"Profile of resistance to IVIG treatment in patients with Kawasaki disease and concomitant infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce this thematic issue by exploring the role of leadership in social and political change In current times, the importance of leadership and choice has proved as important as ever Leadership is often the critical variable separating success or failure, legitimacy and sustainability or collapse This thematic issue explores a range of in-depth case studies across the Asia-Pacific region that help illustrate the critical elements of leadership Collectively they demonstrate that leadership is best understood as a collective process involving motivated agents overcoming barriers to cooperation to form coalitions that have enough power, legitimacy and influence to transform institutions Five themes emerge from the thematic issue as a whole: leadership is political;the centrality of gender relations;the need for a more critical localism;scalar politics;and the importance of understanding informal processes of leadership and social change ? 2020 by the authors;licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal) tion 4 0 International License (CC BY)","output":"Leadership and change in asia-pacific: Where does political will come from?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This literature review summarizes the main immunological characteristics of type III interferons (IFN) and highlights the clinically relevant aspects and future therapeutic perspectives for these inflammatory molecules. SOURCE Relevant articles in PubMed MEDLINE from the first publication (2003) until 2020. N=101 articles were included in this review. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Type III IFNs represent a relatively newly described inflammatory cytokine family. Although they induce substantially similar signalling to the well-known type I IFNs, significant functional differences make these molecules remarkable. Type III IFNs have extensive biological effects, contributing to the pathogenesis of several diseases and also offering new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches: 1) their potent anti-viral properties make them promising therapeutics against viral hepatitis and even against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is causing the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; 2) imbalances in the IFN-s contribute to several forms of chronic inflammation (e.g., systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases) and potentially predict disease progression and therapeutic response to biologic therapies; and 3) the antitumor properties of the type III IFNs open up new therapeutic perspectives against malignant diseases. CONCLUSION Over the last 18 years, researchers have gathered extensive information about the presence and role of these versatile inflammatory cytokines in human diseases, but further research is needed to clarify the mechanistic background of those observations. Better understanding of their biological activities will permit us to use type III IFNs more efficiently in new diagnostic approaches and individualized therapies, consequently improving patient care.","output":"The Role of Type III Interferons in Human Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The appearance and quick spread of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease, COVID-19, brought major societal challenges.

Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, and contribute symmetrically to a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and to a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage.

This species occurs in sympatry with Leishmania infantum in areas where canine leishmaniasis is endemic. In the present study, we investigated the circulation of L. tarentolae and L. infantum in sand flies, dogs and lizards in a dog shelter in southern Italy, where canine leishmaniasis by L. infantum is endemic. METHODS: Sheltered dogs (n = 100) negative for Leishmania spp. (March 2020) were screened by immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) using promastigotes of both species at two time points (June 2020 and March 2021). Whole blood from dogs, tissues of Podarcis siculus lizards (n = 28) and sand flies (n = 2306) were also sampled and tested by a duplex real-time PCR (dqPCR). Host blood meal was assessed in sand flies by PCR. RESULTS: Overall, 16 dogs became positive for L. infantum and/or L. tarentolae by IFAT at one or both sampling periods. One canine blood sample was positive for L. infantum, whilst two for L. tarentolae by dqPCR. At the cytology of lizard blood, Leishmania spp. amastigote-like forms were detected in erythrocytes. Twenty-two tissue samples, mostly lung (21.4%), scored molecularly positive for L. tarentolae, corresponding to 10 lizards (i.e., 35.7%). Of the female Sergentomyia minuta sampled (n = 1252), 158 scored positive for L. tarentolae, four for L. infantum, and one co-infected. Two Phlebotomus perniciosus (out of 29 females) were positive for L. tarentolae. Engorged S. minuta (n = 10) fed on humans, and one P. perniciosus, positive for L. tarentolae, on lagomorphs. CONCLUSIONS: Dogs and lacertid lizards (Podarcis siculus) were herein found for the first time infected by L. tarentolae. The detection of both L. tarentolae and L. infantum in S. minuta and P. perniciosus suggests their sympatric circulation, with a potential overlap in vertebrate hosts.

They are at high risk for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of strategies for COVID-19 management among sheltered homeless adults. DESIGN: We developed a dynamic microsimulation model of COVID-19 in sheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts. We used cohort characteristics and costs from Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Disease progression, transmission, and outcomes data were from published literature and national databases. We examined surging, growing, and slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers [R(e)] 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9). Costs were from a health care sector perspective; time horizon was 4 months, from April to August 2020. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Simulated cohort of 2,258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston. INTERVENTIONS: We assessed daily symptom screening with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of screen-positives, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternate care sites [ACSs] for mild/moderate COVID-19, and temporary housing, each compared to no intervention. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative infections and hospital-days, costs to the health care sector (US dollars), and cost-effectiveness, as incremental cost per case prevented of COVID-19. RESULTS: We simulated a population of 2,258 sheltered homeless adults with mean age of 42.6 years. Compared to no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs for pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild/moderate disease led to 37% fewer infections and 46% lower costs (R(e)=2.6), 75% fewer infections and 72% lower costs (R(e)=1.3), and 51% fewer infections and 51% lower costs (R(e)=0.9). Adding PCR testing every 2 weeks further decreased infections; incremental cost per case prevented was $1,000 (R(e)=2.6), $27,000 (R(e)=1.3), and $71,000 (R(e)=0.9). Temporary housing with PCR every 2 weeks was most effective but substantially more costly than other options. Results were sensitive to cost and sensitivity of PCR and ACS efficacy in preventing transmission. CONCLUSIONS & RELEVANCE: In this modeling study of simulated adults living in homeless shelters, daily symptom screening and ACSs were associated with fewer COVID-19 infections and decreased costs compared with no intervention. In a modeled surging epidemic, adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks was associated with further decrease in COVID-19 infections at modest incremental cost and should be considered during future surges.","output":"Clinical Outcomes, Costs, and Cost-effectiveness of Strategies for People Experiencing Sheltered Homelessness During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 created a crisis that forced people to deal with the social, emotional, personal, and interpersonal impact of the virus in the United States Simultaneously, Black people continued to be murdered and victimized by systemic racism and social injustice Choosing wellness, self-recovery, and self-care during the global pandemonium surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic serves as an act of political resistance in the face of oppression and violence The purpose of this essay is to explore the authors embodied uses of personal narratives centering the work sisters of the yam: black women and self-recovery, feminist theory, and African-centered social work paradigms as coping strategies and healing work during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Becoming a Yam: Healing Narratives as Political Resistance in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Silicosis is one of the most common occupational pulmonary fibrosis caused by respirable silica-based particle exposure, with no ideal drugs at present.

Silicon dioxide (SiO(2))-stimulated lung epithelial cells/macrophages and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-1)-induced differentiated lung fibroblasts were used for in vitro models. RESULTS: At the concentration of 300 mg/kg in the mouse model, metformin significantly reduced lung inflammation and fibrosis in SiO(2)-instilled mice at the early and late fibrotic stages.

The situation seems to be worse in growing megacities where more than 10 million people live and rapid urban sprawl has caused serious problems with the supply of health and public transport services. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic calls for particular attention to be afforded to the matter of equal access to basic medical facilities and services for people across different neighborhoods. Although some studies have already been undertaken into the subject of health-focused inequality in the cities of developing countries, the spatial inequity in hospital accessibility has rarely been discussed to date. In this paper, I aim to provide new evidence by considering Beijing as a case study. With the results of my analysis, I show that low-income neighborhoods have experienced lower levels of accessibility not only to high-tier hospitals (secondary and tertiary hospitals) but also to primary healthcare services (primary hospital and neighborhood clinics). The rate at which high-income neighborhoods access secondary and tertiary hospitals is approximately 4 times and 1.5 times as high as that of low-income neighborhoods. Low-income face nearly twice the travel time of those from high-income neighborhoods to reach the nearest primary hospital or neighborhood clinics. Suburban neighborhoods have less access to medical services than neighborhoods that are located in the central urban areas. It seems that the rapid urban sprawl has been worsening spatial inequality in the context of access to medical services in the growing megacity of Beijing. Equal access to healthcare services should be prioritized in future policy discussions, especially in relation to the urban growth management of megacities in developing countries in order to ensure that fair and inclusive urbanization processes are undertaken.

Minimally invasive approaches with the help of a microscope or endoscope using hemilaminectomy have been found to be safe and effective. We report our initial experience of 18 patients using the endoscopic technique. Material and Methods A retrospective study of intradural extramedullary tumors extending up to two vertebral levels was studied. Pre- and postoperative clinical status, magnetic resonance imaging was done in all patients. The Destandau technique was used, and resection of ipsilateral lamina, medial part of the facet joint, base of the spinous process, and undercutting of the opposite lamina was performed. Dura repair was done using an endoscopic technique. Fibrin glue was used to reinforce repair in the later part of the study. Results The sagittal and axial diameter of tumor ranged from 21 to 41 mm and 12 to 18 mm, respectively. There were four cervical, two cervicothoracic, five thoracic, three thoracolumbar, and four lumbar tumors, respectively. All 18 patients improved after total excision of tumor. Average duration of surgery and blood loss was 140 minutes and 60 mL, respectively. Postoperative stay and follow-up ranged from 3 to 7 days and 9 to 24 months, respectively.

These programs have typically been conducted at research-focused institutions, involving hands-on-research and various enrichment experiences. For 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of on-campus student activities at American universities, necessitating a switch to a virtual format for these URM-focused programs. Outcomes, however, from these programs conducted virtually, necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have not been reported. The Penn Access Summer Scholars (PASS) program at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) targets URM undergraduates, providing two consecutive summers of mentored research and enrichment experiences, with the goal of enabling participants' matriculation to PSOM. PASS has been an 8 week on-campus experience, but during summer 2020, virtual programming of 6 weeks was provided due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the 2020 virtual offering of PASS completed pre- and post-program surveys that included 5-point Likert-style and open-ended questions to determine the impact of the programing on self-assessments of research skills, familiarity with the physician identity, and preparedness to be a PSOM student. Post-program, participants also assessed program administration and content. With respect to program objectives, participants reported significant increases in their self-reported confidence in conducting research, understanding of physician identity, and sense of preparedness for medical school. The educational value of the program content, their level of engagement in the program and the overall quality of the program were rated as excellent or outstanding by large majorities of respondents. Content analyses of participant comments were consistent with these quantitative results.

Selecting the right supplier is a critical decision in green supply chain management. We propose a fuzzy green supplier selection model for sustainable supply chains in reverse logistics. We define a novel hierarchical fuzzy best-worst method (HFBWM) to determine the importance weights of the green criteria and sub-criteria selected. The fuzzy extension of Shannons entropy, a more complex evaluation method, is also used to determine the criteria weights, providing a reference comparison benchmark. Several hybrid models integrating both weighting techniques with fuzzy versions of complex proportional assessment (COPRAS), multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA), and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are designed to rank the suppliers based on their ability to recycle in reverse logistics. We aggregate these methods ranking results through a consensus ranking model and illustrate the capacity of relatively simple methods such as fuzzy COPRAS and fuzzy MOORA to provide robust rankings highly correlated with those delivered by more complex techniques such as fuzzy MULTIMOORA. We also find that the ranking results obtained by these hybrid models are more consistent when HFBWM determines the weights.

METHODS: The aim of the present study was to compare the 4C mortality score, other measures of the systemic inflammatory response and clinicopathological characteristics in two consecutive cohorts of patients on admission with COVID-19. Electronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17/3/2020-1/5/2020) and (cohort 2: 18/5/2020-6/7/2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data. RESULTS: Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). In cohort 2, age >70 (p<0.05), male gender (p<0.05), COPD (p<0.05), cognitive impairment (p<0.05), frailty (p<0.001), delirium (p = 0.001), CRP>150mg/L (p<0.05), albumin <30 g/L (p<0.01), elevated perioperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p<0.05), elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), low haematocrit (p<0.01), elevated PT (p<0.05), sodium <133 mmol/L (p<0.01) elevated urea (p<0.001), creatinine (p<0.001), glucose (p<0.05) and lactate (p<0.001) and the 4C score (p<0.001) were associated with 30-day mortality. In multivariate analysis, greater frailty (CFS>3) (OR 11.3, 95% C.I. 2.3-96.7, p<0.05), low albumin (<30g/L) (OR 2.5, 95% C.I. 1.0-6.2, p<0.05), high NLR (&#8805;3) (OR 2.2, 95% C.I. 1.5-4.5, p<0.05) and the 4C score (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1.0-5.6, p<0.05) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality.

However, the mechanism by which TBI causes ALI/ARDS is not fully understood. Here, we used a severe TBI model to examine the effects of a low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, on inflammasome activation and lung injury damage. We investigated whether enoxaparin inhibits ALI and inflammasome signaling protein expression in the brain and lungs after TBI in mice. C57/BL6 mice were subjected to severe TBI and were treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin 30 min after injury. Lung and brain tissue were collected 24 h post-TBI and were analyzed by immunoblotting for expression of the inflammasome proteins, caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1?. In addition, lung tissue was collected for histological analysis to determine ALI scoring and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration post-injury. Our data show that severe TBI induces increased expression of inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1? in the brain and lungs of mice after injury. Treatment with enoxaparin attenuated inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs 24 h after injury. Enoxaparin significantly decreased ALI score as well as neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in lungs at 24 h after injury. This study demonstrates that enoxaparin attenuates ALI and inhibits inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs after TBI. These findings support the hypothesis that inhibition of the neural-respiratory inflammasome axis that is activated after TBI may have therapeutic potential.","output":"Enoxaparin Attenuates Acute Lung Injury and Inflammasome Activation after Traumatic Brain Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine perception, acceptance, confidence, hesitancy, and barriers among health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: An online national cross-sectional pilot-validated questionnaire was self-administered by HCWs in Saudi Arabia, which is a nation with MERS-CoV experience. The main outcome variable was HCWs acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The factors associated with vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis, and the level of anxiety was measured using a validated instrument to measure general anxiety levels. RESULTS: Out of the 1512 HCWs who completed the study questionnaireof which 62.4% were women70% were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines. A logistic regression analysis revealed that male HCWs (ORa = 1.551, 95% CI: 1.122C2.144), HCWs who believe in vaccine safety (ORa = 2.151; 95% CI: 1.708C2.708), HCWs who believe that COVID vaccines are the most likely way to stop the pandemic (ORa = 1.539; 95% CI: 1.259C1.881), and HCWs who rely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for COVID 19 updates (ORa = 1.505, 95% CI: 1.125C2.013) were significantly associated with reporting a willingness to be vaccinated. However, HCWs who believed that the vaccines were rushed without evidence-informed testing were found to be 60% less inclined to accept COVID-19 vaccines (ORa = 0.394, 95% CI: 0.298C0.522). CONCLUSION: Most HCWs are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines once they are available; the satisfactoriness of COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs is crucial because health professionals knowledge and confidence toward vaccines are important determining factors for not only their own vaccine acceptance but also recommendation for such vaccines to their patients.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine confidence and hesitancy among health care workers: A cross-sectional survey from a MERS-CoV experienced nation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Censorship in the area of public health has become increasingly important in many parts of the world for a number of reasons.

Using the Rip1Tag2 transgenic mouse model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), we have investigated the potential benefit of a combination of anti-angiogenic treatment with targeted internal radiotherapy. METHODS [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4, a radiopeptide that selectively binds to GLP-1R expressed on insulinoma and other neuroendocrine tumor cells, was co-administered with oral vatalanib (an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)) or imatinib (a c-kit/PDGFR inhibitor). The control groups included single-agent kinase inhibitor treatments and [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-natIn)NH2]-exendin-4 monotherapy. For biodistribution, Rip1Tag2 mice were pre-treated with oral vatalanib or imatinib for 0, 3, 5, or 7 days at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Subsequently, [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 was administered i.v., and the biodistribution was assessed after 4 h. For therapy, the mice were injected with 1.1 MBq [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 and treated with vatalanib or imatinib 100 mg/kg orally for another 7 days. Tumor volume, tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation, and microvessel density were quantified. RESULTS Combination of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4 and vatalanib was significantly more effective than single treatments (p < 0.05) and reduced the tumor volume by 97% in the absence of organ damage. The pre-treatment of mice with vatalanib led to a reduction in the tumor uptake of [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4, indicating that concomitant administration of vatalanib and the radiopeptide was the best approach. Imatinib did not show a synergistic effect with [Lys40(Ahx-DTPA-111In)NH2]-exendin-4.

The purpose of the present study was to design and develop an experimental porcine model of ARDS by inducing lung injury with intrapulmonary administration of sodium polyacrylate (SPA). METHODS The present study was performed at the Centre for Comparative Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia. Human alveolar epithelial cells were cultured with several different concentrations of SPA; a bioluminescence technique was used to assess cell death associated with each concentration. In the anesthetized pig model (female Yorkshire X pigs (n = 14)), lung injury was caused in 11 animals (SPA group) by injecting sequential aliquots (5 mL) of 1% SPA gel in aqueous solution into the distal airway via a rubber catheter through an endotracheal tube. The SPA was dispersed throughout the lungs by manual bag ventilation. Three control animals (CON group) underwent all experimental procedures and measurements with the exception of SPA administration. RESULTS The mean ( SD) ATP concentration after incubation of human alveolar epithelial cells with 0.1% SPA (0.92  0.27 M/well) was approximately 15% of the value found for the background control (6.30  0.37 M/well; p < 0.001). Elastance of the respiratory system (E RS) and the lung (E L) increased in SPA-treated animals after injury (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Chest wall elastance (E CW) did not change in SPA-treated animals. There were no differences in E RS, E L, or E CW in the CON group when pre- and post-injury values were compared. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed a significant shift toward neutrophil predominance from before to after injury in SPA-treated animals (p < 0.001) but not in the CON group (p = 0.38). Necropsy revealed marked consolidation and congestion of the dorsal lung lobes in SPA-treated animals, with light-microscopy evidence of bronchiolar and alveolar spaces filled with neutrophilic infiltrate, proteinaceous debris, and fibrin deposition. These findings were absent in animals in the CON group. Electron microscopy of lung tissue from SPA-treated animals revealed injury to the alveolar epithelium and basement membranes, including intra-alveolar neutrophils and fibrin on the alveolar surface and intravascular fibrin (microthrombosis). CONCLUSIONS In this particular porcine model, the nonimmunogenic polymer SPA caused a rapid exudative lung injury.

Despite the accumulated knowledge about coronavirus-related pathogens, development of an effective treatment for its new variant COVID-19 is highly challenging. For the highly-conserved and main coronavirus protease 3CLpro, dimerization is known to be essential for its catalytic activity and thereby for virus proliferation. Here, we assess the potential of short peptide segments to disrupt dimerization of the 3CLpro protease as a route to block COVID-19 proliferation. Based on the X-ray structure of the 3CLpro dimer, we identified the SPSGVY126QCAMRP dodecapeptide segment as overlapping the hotspot regions on the 3CLpro dimer interface. Using computational blind docking of the peptide to the 3CLpro monomer, we found that the SPSGVY126QCAMRP peptide has favourable thermodynamic binding (G= -5.93 kcal/mol) to the hotspot regions at the 3CLpro dimer interface. Importantly, the peptide was also found to preferentially bind to the hotspot regions compared to other potential binding sites lying away from the dimer interface (G=-1.31 kcal/mol). Docking of peptides corresponding to systematic mutation of the V125 and Y126 residues led to the identification of seven peptides, SPSGHAQCAMRP, SPSGVTQCAMRP, SPSGKPQCAMRP, SPSGATQCAMRP, SPSGWLQCAMRP, SPSGAPQCAMRP and SPSGHPQCAMRP, that outperform the wild-type SPSGVY126QCAMRP peptide in terms of preferential binding to the 3CLpro dimer interface. These peptides have the potential to disrupt 3CLpro dimerization and therefore could provide lead structures for the development of broad spectrum COVID-19 inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The respiratory sequelae of COVID\\\\19 in children remain poorly characterized. In this study we describe health data and respiratory findings in pediatric patients presenting with persistent respiratory symptoms following COVID\\\\19. METHODS: This study included patients referred to Pulmonary Clinic at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between December 2020 and April 2021 (n = 29). Inclusion criteria included a history of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 RNA positivity or confirmed close household contact and suggestive symptoms. A retrospective chart review was performed and demographic, clinical, imaging, and functional test data were collected. RESULTS: The mean age at presentation to clinic was 13.1 years (range: 4C19 years). Patients had persistent respiratory symptoms ranging from 1.3 to 6.7 months postacute infection. Persistent dyspnea and/or exertional dyspnea were present in nearly all (96.6%) patients at the time of clinic presentation. Other reported chronic symptoms included cough (51.7%) and exercise intolerance (48.3%). Fatigue was reported in 13.8% of subjects.

The optimal dose of immunosuppression for the treatment of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still unknown. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of high- versus low-dose corticosteroids with or without tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS This was a retrospective study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) requiring mechanical ventilation who received high- versus low-dose corticosteroids with or without tocilizumab. The primary outcome was survival to discharge. Safety outcomes included infections and incidence of hyperglycemia. RESULTS In this cohort, 110 (54%) and 95 (46%) patients received high-dose (10 mg dexamethasone equivalent) and low-dose (<10 mg dexamethasone equivalent) corticosteroids for more than 3 consecutive days, respectively. Thirty-five patients (32%) in the high-dose group and 33 patients (35%) in the low-dose group survived to hospital discharge (P = 0.85). There was no difference in 28-day mortality in patients who received high-dose corticosteroids without tocilizumab compared with those who received low-dose corticosteroids with tocilizumab (n = 38/82, 46% vs n = 19/40, 48% P = 0.99); however, there was a higher mortality if patients received low-dose corticosteroids without tocilizumab (n = 39/55, 71%, P = 0.01). The highest rate of a bacterial pneumonia was in patients who received high-dose corticosteroids with tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients with COVID-19 ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, we found no difference in high- versus low-dose corticosteroids with regard to survival to hospital discharge. However, patients receiving only low-dose corticosteroids without tocilizumab did worse than the other groups.

METHODS Prospective study of 41 dogs with thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries investigated by magnetic resonance imaging. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the vertebral level of the cutaneous trunci reflex cut-off and the maximal and cranial lesion extent. The association between cutaneous trunci reflex cut-off and spinal cord injury severity was tested using a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Cutaneous trunci reflex cut-off was evident in 33 (80%) of dogs. The cut-off level was 0 to 4 vertebrae caudal to the maximal spinal cord lesion in all dogs. In 16 (48.5%) dogs the cut-off was either 2 or 3 vertebrae caudal to the lesion. The presence of a cut-off significantly correlated with increasing severity (P=0.0001). Loss of the reflex occurred at less severe grades than loss of ambulation and in dogs with ambulatory paresis it was significantly (P=0.0084) associated with increasing severity.

METHODS A comparative analysis of the codon usage bias of the 28 herpesviruses was performed by using the CodonW 1.4 program and CUSP (create a codon usage table) program of EMBOSS (The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite). RESULTS The results showed obvious differences of the synonymous codon usage bias in the 28 herpesviruses indicated by the Codon Adaptation Index, effective number of codons (ENc), and the value of G + C content at the 3rd codon position. The codon usage pattern of the DPV UL35 gene was phylogenetically conserved and similar to that of the UL35-like genes of the avian alpha-herpesvirus, with a strong bias towards the codons with A and T at the 3rd codon position. A cluster analysis of codon usage pattern of the DPV UL35 gene with other reference herpesviruses demonstrated that the codon usage bias of the UL35 genes of the 28 herpesviruses had a very close relation with their gene function. The ENc-plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in the DPV UL35 gene and the 27 reference herpesviruses were constrained by G + C content, while gene length exerted relatively weaker influences. In addition, comparisons of the codon preferences in the UL35 gene of DPV with those of Escherichia coli, yeast and humans revealed that there were 33 codons showing distinct usage differences between the DPV and yeast, and 38 between the DPV and humans, but only 31 between the DPV and E. coli. Therefore, the E. coli system may be more suitable for the expression of the DPV UL35 gene.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of computed tomography (CT) critical test results in the ED. METHODS We performed a retrospective observational study of ED CT usage at 4 Ontario hospitals (1 urban academic, 1 northern academic, 1 urban community and 1 rural community) over 1 month during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020) and over the same month 1 year earlier (April 2019; before the pandemic). The CT findings from 1 of the 4 hospitals, Hamilton Health Sciences, were reviewed to determine the number of critical test results by body region. Total CT numbers were compared using Poisson regression and CT yields were compared using the 2 test. RESULTS The median number of ED CT examinations per day was markedly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic (82 v. 133, p < 0.01), with variation across hospitals (p = 0.001). On review of 1717 CT reports from Hamilton Health Sciences, fewer critical test results were demonstrated on CT pulmonary angiograms (43 v. 88, p < 0.001) and CT examinations of the head (82 v. 112, p < 0.03) during the pandemic than before the pandemic; however, the yield of these examinations did not change. Although the absolute number of all CT examinations with critical test results decreased, the number of CT examinations without critical results decreased more, resulting in a higher yield of CT for critical test results during the pandemic (46% [322/696] v. 37% [379/1021], p < 0.01). INTERPRETATION Emergency department CT volumes markedly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly because there were fewer examinations with new or unexpected findings.

This chapter reviews the epidemiological evidence that implicates infectious pathogens as triggers. The chapter also discusses the mechanisms of interaction between the host-pathogen response and preexisting airway pathology resulting in an exacerbation. Much of the treatment of infective exacerbations for both asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of bronchodilators or supportive in the form of oxygen, and in severe cases it includes noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures. The current therapy for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD relies on increased treatment of preexisting disease. Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial infections. The effective use of antiviral agents, particularly for influenza viruses, requires viral diagnosis, commencement of treatment early in the course of an exacerbation, or the targeting of high-risk groups for prophylaxis. Alternative strategies for drug development involve the identification of key factors common to exacerbations induced by a range of different viruses.

The aim of this systematic review was to determine if the use of mucoactive agents in patients with ARF improves clinical outcomes. METHODS We searched electronic and grey literature (January 2020). Two reviewers independently screened, selected, extracted data and quality assessed studies. We included trials of adults receiving ventilatory support for ARF and involving at least one mucoactive agent compared with placebo or standard care. Outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random-effects modelling and certainty of the evidence was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS Thirteen randomised controlled trials were included (1712 patients), investigating four different mucoactive agents. Mucoactive agents showed no effect on duration of mechanical ventilation (seven trials, mean difference (MD) -1.34, 95% CI -2.97 to 0.29, I2=82%, very low certainty) or mortality, hospital stay and ventilator-free days.

The perspective of circular economy allows rethinking these waste conditions as an opportunity to reactivate virtuous circuits capable of promoting sustainable development focused on human needs.

Facemask use has been qualitatively associated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but no study has quantitatively assessed the impact of government mask mandates (MM) on new COVID-19 cases across multiple US States. Data and Methods: We utilized a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm to test the a priori hypothesis that MM were associated with reductions in new COVID-19 cases. Publicly available data were used to analyze new COVID-19 cases from 37 States and the District of Columbia (i.e., \\"38 States\\"). We conducted confirmatory All-States and State-Wise analyses, validity analyses [e.g., leave-one-out (LOO) and bootstrap resampling], and covariate analyses. Results: No statistically significant difference in the daily number of new COVID-19 infections was discernible in the All-States analysis. In State-Wise LOO validity analysis, 11 States exhibited reductions in new COVID-19 and the reductions in four of these States (AK, MA, MN, VA) were significant in bootstrap resampling. Only the Social Capital Index predicted MM success (training p<0.028 and LOO p<0.013). Conclusion: Results obtained when studying the impact of MM on COVID-19 cases varies as a function of the heterogeneity of the sample being considered, providing clear evidence of Simpson's Paradox and thus of confounded findings. As such, studies of MM effectiveness should be conducted on disaggregated data.

Currently, COVID-19 vaccine rollouts are finally upon us carrying the hope of herd immunity once a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated or infected, as a new horizon. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants brought concerns since, as the virus is exposed to environmental selection pressures, it can mutate and evolve, generating variants that may possess enhanced virulence. Codon usage analysis is a strategy to elucidate the evolutionary pressure of the viral genome suffered by different hosts, as possible cause of the emergence of new variants. Therefore, to get a better picture of the SARS-CoV-2 codon bias, we first identified the relative codon usage rate of all Betacoronaviruses lineages. Subsequently, we correlated putative cognate transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAs) to reveal how those viruses adapt to hosts in relation to their preferred codon usage. Our analysis revealed seven preferred codons located in three different open reading frame which appear preferentially used by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the tRNA adaptation analysis indicates a wide strategy of competition between the virus and mammalian as principal hosts highlighting the importance to reinforce the genomic monitoring to prompt identify any potential adaptation of the virus into new potential hosts which appear to be crucial to prevent and mitigate the pandemic.","output":"Betacoronaviruses genome analysis reveals evolution toward specific codons usage: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The best way to teach human gross anatomy to medical students has often been debated, although recent studies emphasize on the benefits of dissection\\\\based courses (DOI 10.1002/ase.1859). Prosection and model\\\\based courses, online and virtual reality approaches have been introduced over time, due to reduction in teaching time, and due to economic reasons with decreasing budget. In 2020, we were challenged by the pandemic of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and corresponding COVID\\\\19 public health measures. We had to change and adapt several times anatomy teaching and learning over the two semesters for the cohort of 112 first/second year undergraduate medical students. With the experience of this student cohort with various anatomy learning approaches, we wanted to know what anatomy teaching method was best perceived by the students. METHODS: 112 medical students were asked about their learning experience with various anatomy teaching approaches for 2020, including 1) dissection\\\\based learning, 2) prosections and models\\\\based demonstrations, 3) structured self\\\\directed learning using written instructions and corresponding anatomical material, 4) structured self\\\\directed learning using online instructions via Moodle and an online anatomy program (https://e\\\\learn.anatomy.uzh.ch/Anatomy/Anatomy.html; German version). All students agreed to participate in the study. The questionnaire was administered by https://www.surveymonkey.com and done anonymously. To date 66/112 (59%) students replied. RESULTS: The majority of the students (92%) preferred the dissection course as their main anatomy learning method, 80% of students were happy with a demonstration course using prosections and anatomical models. Only a minority liked to have structured self\\\\directed learning with either anatomical specimens and models (42%) or with online material (36%). Rather few students preferred learning with an online course (18%) or through unstructured self\\\\directed learning using their own resources (12%). For the dissection course the students appreciated the 3 dimensional aspect (92%), the real size appearance of the structures (90%), the active explorative approach (81%), the topographical relationship of the structures (81%) and anatomical variability (72%). During complete lock\\\\down of the COVID\\\\19 measures when the students had to stay isolated at home for several weeks, the majority of students thought that the offered online structured self\\\\directed course was most adequate under those circumstances (55%), but would otherwise not be the preferred replacement of a dissection course (55%). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of student experience with a variety of anatomy learning methods clearly indicate that a structured dissection\\\\based course with additional anatomical demonstration would be preferred by the majority of our students. Online material would be beneficial as additional learning support. However, the majority of students agreed that, under strict COVID\\\\19 stay\\\\at\\\\home measures, the structured self\\\\directed online course was the best way to learn anatomy. When going back to normal, we will offer the newly developed online material for guided self\\\\directed learning, in addition to the established dissection course.","output":"Anatomy Learning under COVID\\\\19 Measures: A Real World Educational Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted cancer care in Africa, further exposing major health disparities. This paper compares and contrasts the experiences of 15 clinicians in six different African cancer centers to highlight the positive aspects (silver linings) in an otherwise negative situation. METHODS: Data are from personal experience of the clinicians working at the six cancer centers blended with what is available in the literature. RESULTS: The impact of COVID-19 on cancer care appeared to vary not only across the continent but also over cancer centers. Different factors such as clinic location, services offered, available resources, and level of restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 were associated with these variations. Collectively, delays in treatment and limited access to cancer care were commonly reported in the different regions. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of data on cancer patients with COVID-19 and online COVID-19 and cancer registries for Africa. Analysis of the available data, however, suggests a higher mortality rate for cancer patients with COVID-19 compared with those without cancer. Positive or silver linings coming out of the pandemic include the adoption of hypofractionated radiation therapy and teleoncology to enhance access to care while protecting patients and staff members. Increasing collaborations using online technology with oncology health professionals across the world are also being seen as a silver lining, with valuable sharing of experiences and expertise to improve care, enhance learning, and reduce disparities.

Multiple parameters, including the molecular weight, relative concentration, polarity, and solubility, affect the physicochemical properties of the polymer blend. Here, molecular dynamics simulations with the united-atom 2016H66 force field are used to model the behavior of PLGA and PEG chains and thus predict the overall physicochemical features of the resulting blend. First, the model accuracy is validated against fundamental properties of pure PLGA and PEG samples. In agreement with previous experimental and theoretical observations, the PLGA solubility results to be higher in acetonitrile than in water, with Flory parameters &#957;ACN = 0.63  0.01 and &#957;W = 0.21  0.02, and the Young's modulus of PLGA and PEG equal to Y = 2.0  0.43 and 0.32  0.34 GPa, respectively. Next, four PEG/PLGA blending regimes are identified by varying the relative concentrations and molecular weights of the individual polymers. The computational results demonstrate that at low PEG concentrations (<8% w/w), homogeneous blends are generated for both low and high PEG molecular weights. In contrast, at comparable PEG and PLGA concentrations (a??50% w/w), short PEG chains are only partially miscible whereas long PEG chains segregate within the PLGA matrix. This behavior has been confirmed experimentally via differential scanning calorimetry and is in agreement with previous observations. Finally, the computed Young's modulus of PLGA/PEG blends is observed to decrease with the PEG content returning the lowest values for the partial and fully segregated regimens (Y &#8776; 1.3 GPa). This work proposes a computational scheme for predicting the physicochemical properties of PLGA/PEG blends paving the way toward the rational design of polymer mixtures for biomedical applications.","output":"Predicting the Miscibility and Rigidity of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/Polyethylene Glycol Blends via Molecular Dynamics Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus triggering the disease COVID-19, has a catastrophic health and socioeconomic impact at a global scale Three key factors contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19: excessive inflammation, immune system depression/inhibition, and a set of proinflammatory cytokines Common to these factors, a central function of oxidative stress has been highlighted A diversity of clinical trials focused predominantly on antioxidants are being implemented as potential therapies for COVID-19 In this study, we look at the role of zinc, glutathione, and polyphenols, as key antioxidants of possible medicinal or nutritional significance, and examine their role in the antiviral immune response induced by SARS-Cov-2 An unresolved question is why some people experience chronic COVID and others do not Understanding the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system, as well as the role of defective immune responses to disease development, would be essential to recognize the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the risk factors that affect the harmful consequences of the disease, and the rational design of successful therapies and vaccinations We expect that our research will provide a novel perspective that contributes to the design of clinical or nutritional targets for the prevention of this pandemic","output":"Impact of Zinc, Glutathione, and Polyphenols as Antioxidants in the Immune Response against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Persistent infection with HPV can result in cancers affecting men and, especially, women. Lower uptake exists by area and different population groups. Increasing parental confidence about, and adolescent access to, the universal HPV vaccination programme may help reduce inequalities in uptake. However, the evidence-base for interventions to address uptake for schools-based HPV vaccination programmes is currently lacking. This study protocol outlines how a multicomponent intervention to address this evidence gap will be codesigned with parents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The proposed research will be undertaken in localities covered by two immunisation teams in London and the south-west of England. The person-based approach to intervention development will be followed. In the first phase, an exploratory qualitative study will be undertaken with key stakeholders (n=8) and parents (n=40) who did not provide consent for their adolescent child to be vaccinated. During the interviews, parents views on ways to improve parental confidence about, and adolescents access to, HPV vaccination will be sought. The findings will be used to inform the co-design of a preliminary plan for a targeted, multicomponent intervention. In the second phase, at least two parent working groups (n=8) will be convened and will work with creative designers to co-design communication materials aimed at increasing parents confidence in vaccination. At least two workshops with each parent group will be organised to obtain feedback on the intervention plan and communication materials to ensure they are fit for purpose. These findings will inform a protocol for a future study to test the effectiveness of the intervention at increasing HPV vaccination uptake. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The National Health Services Research Ethics Service and London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Observational / Interventions Research Ethics Committee provided approvals for the study (reference 22/SW/0003 & 26902, respectively).

Like other low- and middle-income countries, Bangladeshi schools lack facilities for girls to change and dispose of their menstrual absorbents. We explored existing systems for disposing of menstrual absorbent wastes in urban and rural schools of Bangladesh and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of alternative disposal options. METHODS: We explored how girls dispose of their menstrual products, identified girls' preferences and choices for a disposal system and piloted four disposal options in four different schools. We then implemented one preferred option in four additional schools. We explored girls', teachers', and janitors' perspectives and evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and potential for sustainability of the piloted disposal system. RESULTS: Barriers to optimal menstrual hygiene management included lack of functional toilets and private locations for changing menstrual products, and limited options for disposal. Girls, teachers, and janitors preferred and ranked the chute disposal system as their first choice, because it has large capacity (765 L), is relatively durable, requires less maintenance, and will take longer time to fill. During implementation of the chute disposal system in four schools, girls, teachers, and janitors reported positive changes in toilet cleanliness and menstrual products disposal resulting from the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The chute disposal system for menstrual products is a durable option that does not require frequent emptying or regular maintenance, and is accepted by schoolgirls and janitors alike, and can improve conditions for menstrual hygiene management in schools. However, regular supervision, motivation of girls to correctly dispose of their products, and a long-term maintenance and management plan for the system are necessary.","output":"Piloting an acceptable and feasible menstrual hygiene products disposal system in urban and rural schools in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide epidemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a strong demand for highly efficient immunobinding to achieve rapid and accurate on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, hour-scale time-consumption is usually required to ensure the adequacy of immunobinding on expensive large instruments in hospitals, and the common false negative or positive results often occur in rapid on-site immunoassay (e.g. immunochromatography). We solved this dilemma by presenting a reciprocating-flowing immunobinding (RF-immunobinding) strategy. RF-immunobinding enabled the antibodies in fluid contacting with the corresponding immobilized antigens on substrate repeatedly during continuous reciprocating-flowing, to achieve adequate immunobinding within 60 s. This strategy was further developed into an immunoassay method for the serological detection of 13 suspected COVID-19 patients. We obtained a 100% true negative and true positive rate and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 4.14 pg/mL.

Antibody response is often a poor marker of prior coronavirus infection, particularly in mild infections, and is shorter-lived than virus-reactive T-cells; strong antibody response correlates with more severe clinical disease while T-cell response is correlated with less severe disease; and antibody-dependent enhancement of pathology and clinical severity has been described. Indeed, it is unclear whether antibody production is protective or pathogenic in coronavirus infections. Early data with SARS-CoV2 support these findings. Data from coronavirus infections in animals and humans emphasize the generation of a high-quality T cell response in protective immunity. Yellow Fever and smallpox vaccines are excellent benchmarks for primary immune response to viral vaccination and induce long-lived virus-reactive CD8 T-cells, which are measurable within 1-4 months of vaccination. Progress in laboratory markers for SARS-CoV2 has been made with identification of epitopes on CD4 and CD8 T-cells in convalescent blood. These are much less dominated by spike protein than in previous coronavirus infections. Although most vaccine candidates are focusing on spike protein as antigen, natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 induces broad epitope coverage, cross-reactive with other betacoronviruses. It will be important to understand the relation between breadth, functionality and durability of T-cell responses and resulting protective immunity. It would be a public health and general trust-in-medicine nightmare - including a boost to anti-vaccine forces - if immune protection wears off or new disease patterns develop among the immunized. Data correlating clinical outcomes with laboratory markers of cell-mediated immunity, not only with antibody response, after SARS-CoV2 natural infection and vaccines may prove critically valuable if protective immunity fades or if new patterns of disease emerge.","output":"What are the roles of antibodies versus a durable, high quality T-cell response in protective immunity against SARS-CoV2?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With conversational agents triaging symptoms, cameras aiding diagnoses, and remote sensors monitoring vital signs, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) outside of hospitals has the potential to improve health, according to a recently released report from the National Academy of Medicine.

Economic insecurity and mental disorders are risk factors for suicide, which may increase during the pandemic. METHODS: Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years (LY) were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations and linear time trends, suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with data from 2010 to 2019 using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: A total of 643 suicides were registered and 6 032 690 LY were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 53 suicides and 450 429 LY accounted for the year 2020.

Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed using changes in eating alone/together as the independent variable and body weight status as the dependent variable. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, living arrangements, educational level, diseases receiving medical treatment, cognitive status, depression, and instrumental activities of daily living. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. Results : The average age of participants was 81.1 years (standard deviation = 4.9 years). Individuals who reported eating alone in both surveys were more likely to report weight loss than those who reported eating with others in both surveys (adjusted model: OR = 2.25, 95% confidence interval = 1.06C4.78, p = 0.04). Conclusions : These findings suggest that measures to prevent weight loss in older adults who eat alone are particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Eating alone and weight change in community-dwelling older adults during the coronavirus pandemic: A longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fan support has often been considered to be a main driver of the home advantage in sports. Using the natural experiment of ghost games during the COVID-19 pandemic in German professional soccer and a dataset of 6,120 matches ranging over the seasons 2011/2012 to 2020/2021, we test this claim. Indeed, applying a difference-in-differences setup, we identify a reduction in the home performance - though with much heterogeneity across leagues and teams. We, moreover, observe the home advantage to recover over time. In analysing whether betting markets anticipated this drop in the home advantage and its recovery, we test the effcient market hypothesis. In the short-run, betting odds do not properly reflect the effect of ghost games regarding changes in the home advantage but suitably account for it in the long-run. Also, league heterogeneity is efficiently captured in the odds. Based on these findings, we show how simple, short-run betting strategies could have exploited the discussed phenomenon. Our findings also have implications for agents' behavior on financial markets in the presence of unforeseen and unfamiliar shocks.","output":"Home Advantage in Professional Soccer and Betting Market Efficiency: The Role of Spectator Crowds (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gemella morbillorum is increasingly implicated in infectious endocarditis.

Although each of these threats has its own characteristics, its underlying network determines the spreading. To restrain the spreading, a widely used approach is the fragmentation of these networks through immunization, so that epidemics cannot spread. Here we develop an immunization approach based on optimizing the susceptible size, which outperforms the best known strategy based on immunizing the highest-betweenness links or nodes. We find that the network's vulnerability can be significantly reduced, demonstrating this on three different real networks: the global flight network, a school friendship network, and the internet.

Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance deep network (called M [Formula: see text] UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M [Formula: see text] UNet consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods.","output":"Synergistic learning of lung lobe segmentation and hierarchical multi-instance classification for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outdoor temperature lower than 50F and greater than 70F is shown to nearly double the transmission efficiency of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Outdoor temperature is an important factor behind the current surge in US Covid-19 cases. Correlation of northern state infection data and outdoor temperatures is used to identify the change in disease transmission efficiency as northern states passed through the lower temperature bound (50F) in spring, and more recently transitioned to temperatures above the higher bound (70F). At current disease transmission efficiency levels, social distancing must be increased above a UMD Social Distance Index (SDI) level of 36 to stop the accelerated increase of daily infection cases. At current disease transmission efficiency (G=0.19) and SDI of 33, the US will approach 150,000 infections per day in September before declining as average US temperature falls below 70F. A primary reason for enhanced disease transmission below 50F and above 70F is attributed to inadequate indoor ventilation. Swing season occurs when outdoor temperatures are between 50F and 70F, and is the time of year when homes and buildings are opened to the outdoors. Increased fresh air ventilation (greater than 40cfm per person), improved air filtration (MERV11 and greater filters), and UVGI (Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation, 0.02WUV per cfm airflow) coupled with wearing face masks, 6ft distancing and surface sanitation are estimated to reduce indoor disease transmission probability to a third of the transmission probability resulting from standard building ventilation practice.","output":"Linking Outdoor Air Temperature and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in the US Using a Two Parameter Transmission Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia in the form of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is a critical intervention delivered by advanced pre-hospital critical care teams. Our previous simulation study determined the feasibility of in-aircraft RSI. We now examine whether this feasibility is preserved in a simulated setting, when clinicians wear personal protective equipment (PPE) for aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) for in-aircraft, on-the-ground RSI. Methods Air Ambulance Kent Surrey Sussex is a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) which utilises an AW169 cabin simulator. Wearing full AGP PPE (eye protection, FFP3 mask, gown, gloves), 10 doctor-paramedic teams performed RSI in a standard can intubate, can ventilate scenario and a can't intubate, can't oxygenate (CICO) scenario. Pre-specified timings were reported, and participant feedback was sought by questionnaire. Results RSI was most commonly performed by direct laryngoscopy and was successfully achieved in all scenarios. Time to completed endotracheal intubation (ETI) was fastest (287s) in the standard scenario and slower (370s, p=.01) in the CICO scenario. Time to ETI was not significantly delayed by wearing PPE in the standard (p=.19) or CICO variant (p=.97). Communication challenges, equipment complications and PPE difficulties were reported, but ways to mitigate these also reported. Conclusion In-aircraft RSI (aircraft on-the-ground) whilst wearing PPE for AGPs had no significant impact on time to successful completion of ETI in a simulated setting. Patient safety is paramount in civilian HEMS, but the adoption of in-aircraft RSI could confer significant patient benefit in terms of pre-hospital time saving and further research is warranted.","output":"Feasibility of pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia in the cabin of an AW169 helicopter wearing personal protective equipment during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disasters are unfortunate but integral part of civilisation While the incidence of disaster cannot be prevented altogether, the effects can be modified to the extent that there will be minimum or no loss of life, minimum loss to property and quick restoration to normalcy Virtually in many instances effects can be reduced to nil or negligible if sufficient diligence is practiced Epidemic diseases are regarded as disasters too Homoeopathy is a medical system of therapeutics which claims to have effective intervention in epidemics Any system of medicine that offers to intervene in any epidemic should be embraced Epidemics have occurred in the past not only in India but in other countries as well, such as Cholera, Asian flu, Spanish flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Avian influenza When an epidemic spreads in wider geographical area and affects large number of people, it is termed as pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that began in December 2019 Homoeopathic system of medicine claims to have effective treatment in epidemics But hardly any effort seems to have been made to correlate the limited documented studies on epidemics that may consolidate the positive results of homoeopathy in such a way that can help policy makers to give a serious thought to the fact that homoeopathy can be trusted to combat epidemic diseases This article involves data collection using existing published articles on case series/individual cases in peer-reviewed Journals assessing the applicability of homoeopathy in epidemics/pandemics and in COVID-19 With such a background finding suitable solutions is a necessary step toward prevention and treatment of epidemic diseases","output":"A Brief Account of Homoeopathic Approach to Fight COVID-19 Disaster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are at risk for a variety of COVID-19 complications.

Functional multi-parametric renal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging strategy whereby several sequences are employed within a single session to quantify renal perfusion, tissue oxygenation, fibrosis, inflammation, and oedema without using ionizing radiation. In this review, we discuss evidence surrounding its use in several clinical settings including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, polycystic kidney disease and around renal transplantation. Kidney size on MRI is already a validated measure for making therapeutic decisions in the setting of polycystic kidney disease. Functional MRI sequences, T1 mapping and apparent diffusion coefficient, can non-invasively quantify interstitial fibrosis and so may have a near-future role in the nephrology clinic to stratify the risk of progressive chronic kidney disease or transplant dysfunction. Beyond this, multi-parametric MRI may be utilised diagnostically, for example differentiating inflammatory versus ischaemic causes of renal dysfunction, but this remains to be proven. Changes in MRI properties of kidney parenchyma may be useful surrogate markers to use as end points in clinical trials to assess if drugs prevent renal fibrosis or alter kidney perfusion.

We assessed the extent to which black South African controllers (n=9), differ from uninfected healthy controls (HCs, n=22) in terms of lymphocyte and monocyte CCR5 expression (density and frequency of CCR5-expressing cells), immune activation as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) mitogen-induced chemokine/cytokine production. In addition, relative CD4+ T cell CCR5 mRNA expression was assessed in a larger group of controllers (n=20) compared to HCs (n=10) and HIV-1 progressors (n=12). Despite controllers having significantly higher frequencies of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (HLA-DR+) compared to HCs, CCR5 density was significantly lower in these T cell populations (P=0.039 and P=0.064, respectively). This lower CCR5 density was largely attributable to controllers with higher VLs (>400 RNA copies/ml). Significantly lower CD4+ T cell CCR5 density in controllers was maintained (P=0.036) when HCs (n=12) and controllers (n=9) were matched for age. CD4+ T cell CCR5 mRNA expression was significantly less in controllers compared to HCs (P=0.007) and progressors (P=0.002), whereas HCs and progressors were similar (P=0.223). The levels of soluble CD14 in plasma did not differ between controllers and HCs, suggesting no demonstrable monocyte activation. While controllers had lower monocyte CCR5 density compared to the HCs (P=0.02), significance was lost when groups were age-matched (P=0.804). However, when groups were matched for both CCR5 promoter haplotype and age (n=6 for both) reduced CCR5 density on monocytes in controllers relative to HCs was highly significant (P=0.009). Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated PBMCs from the controllers produced significantly less CCL3 (P=0.029), CCL4 (P=0.008) and IL-10 (P=0.028) compared to the HCs, which was largely attributable to the controllers with lower VLs (<400 RNA copies/ml). Our findings support a hypothesis of an inherent (genetic) predisposition to lower CCR5 expression in individuals who naturally control HIV-1, as has been suggested for Caucasian controllers, and thus, likely involves a mechanism shared between ethnically divergent population groups.","output":"Reduced CCR5 Expression and Immune Quiescence in Black South African HIV-1 Controllers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim: To determine the level of public awareness of COVID-19 and information needs, as well as level of public confidence in both official information on COVID-19 and to develop recommendations for communication policy on longer-term awareness in pandemic settings COVID-19, using principles of behavioral economics. PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: 4 focus group interviews were conducted in residents of Ukraine, with a total quantity of 48 people aged 16-70 years questioned and an anonymous questionnaire was conducted in 1,700 respondents, representing the adult population aged 18 years and older from all over Ukraine. The representative error of the study with probability of 0.95 does not exceed 4%. The processing of questionnaires was carried out by SDU Center of Social Researches (SDUCSR) employees, using the OSA program. RESULTS Results: 28.5% of respondents believe that politicians and media underestimate the danger of the COVID-19 epidemic, while other 28.1% believe that politicians and media adequately assess its danger. 18.9% of respondents are sure that the danger is exaggerated. As much as 24.5% of Ukrainian respondents could not decide on such assessment. The most common sources of information about disease/treatment are Internet and social media. Traditional media and relatives/acquaints who endured the COVID-19 also gain population\`s confidence. A family doctor is the least popular source of information. 42.1% of respondents do not trust official information on the number of infected people and severity of the disease, and another 40% are not sure whether they should trust or not. Only 17.9% of respondents trust official information. CONCLUSION Conclusions: Within informing the society about public health in conditions of a COVID-19 pandemic it is better to provide communication strategy for various target audiences: for youth which is inclined to underestimate threats of epidemic and obtains information on social networks; for people of a retirement age (as risk group) who lack information because they use only traditional media (mainly TV); for women who need psychological support to decrease in level of stress in the family more often and also to overcome the negative post-stressful situations (connected with the death of the family/relatives); for men who are inclined to neglect their own health, etc.; for the people who have endured COVID-19 to prevent possible reinfection in them.","output":"APPLICATION OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS INSIGHTS TO INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC AWARENESS OF COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The shift to distance learning has created unique perspectives and challenges to educational stakeholders specifically among teachers who are tasked with keeping teaching and learning on track despite their professional, technical, and personal concerns, and inadequate familiarity to the new learning modality.

However, a tragic consequence of adult deaths is that high numbers of children might lose their parents and caregivers to COVID-19-associated deaths. Methods: We quantified COVID-19-associated caregiver loss and orphanhood in the US and for each state using fertility and excess and COVID-19 mortality data. We assessed burden and rates of COVID-19-associated orphanhood and deaths of custodial and co-residing grandparents, overall and by race/ethnicity. We further examined variations in COVID-19-associated orphanhood by race/ethnicity for each state. Results: We found that from April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, over 140,000 children in the US experienced the death of a parent or grandparent caregiver. The risk of such loss was 1.1 to 4.5 times higher among children of racial and ethnic minorities, compared to Non-Hispanic White children. The highest burden of COVID-19-associated death of parents and caregivers occurred in Southern border states for Hispanic children, Southeastern states for Black children, and in states with tribal areas for American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Conclusions: We found substantial disparities in distributions of COVID-19-associated death of parents and caregivers across racial and ethnic groups. Children losing caregivers to COVID-19 need care and safe, stable, and nurturing families with economic support, quality childcare and evidence-based parenting support programs.

She also had numbness of her left arm and legs, flashing lights, and headaches. On physical examination, her BMI was 32.8. Her vital signs were normal. She had moderate left hemiparesis (MRC grade III), numbness on her left face, arms, and legs. Her weakness continued for 5 days. A brain CT scan was done showing no evidence of acute infarction. Acute treatment with aspirin was given. MRI in conjunction with MRA was performed in which no restricted diffusion was seen. A SPECT was performed to evaluate the function of the brain showing significant hypoperfusion of the right hemisphere. The patient gradually improved and was discharged. DISCUSSIONS: In this study, we present the first case of stroke mimic after CoronaVac vaccination. After negative imaging studies had been performed repeatedly, we reach a conclusion that stroke is unlikely to be the cause. Presumably, this phenomenon could possibly have abnormal functional imaging study. Therefore, we believed that it might be due to cortical spreading depression, like migraine aura, which we had conducted a literature review.","output":"Acute prolonged motor aura resembling ischemic stroke after COVID ? 19 vaccination (CoronaVac): the first case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden change of moving the majority of teaching online at Universities due to the global Covid-19 pandemic has caused an increased amount of workload for academics.

After repeated administration, both antagonists showed strong analgesic activity toward thermal hypersensitivity; however, ()-NBI-74330 was more effective at reducing mechanical hypersensitivity.

The second adds a rule enforcement mechanism that reduces the users benefit from reckless behavior. Both strategies should be effective if agents are expected-value maximizers, risk averse, and behave in accordance with cumulative prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) or in accordance with the Cognitive Hierarchy model (Camerer et al., 2004). A multi-player trust-game experiment was designed to compare the effectiveness of the two policies. The results reveal a substantial advantage to the enforcement application, even one with occasional misses. The enhanced-alert strategy was completely ineffective.

He developed early-onset severe dyspnea associated with acute coronavirus HKU1 (non-COVID-19) infection, with diffuse pneumonitis evidenced by ground glass opacification on CT scan. He was treated with steroids leading to resolution of pneumonitis on repeat imaging, suggesting an exacerbated immune-mediated toxicity. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a patient with melanoma with severe and reversible diffuse pneumonitis in association with coronavirus HKU1 following combined nivolumab and ipilimumab immunotherapy. Although we do not have data on the impact of ICI therapy on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) symptomatology, a possible interaction should be considered when deciding on dosing in patients with possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure or when evaluating patients with presumed ICI-related pneumonitis during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Diffuse pneumonitis from coronavirus HKU1 on checkpoint inhibitor therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diseases caused by Flaviviridae have a wide global and economic impact due to high morbidity and mortality. Flaviviridae infection usually leads to severe, acute or chronic diseases, such as liver injury and liver cancer resulting from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) caused by dengue virus (DENV). Given the highly complex pathogenesis of Flaviviridae infections, they are still not fully understood at present. Accumulating evidence suggests that host autophagy is disrupted to regulate the life cycle of Flaviviridae. Organelle-specific autophagy is able to selectively target different organelles for quality control, which is essential for regulating cellular homeostasis. As an important sub process of autophagy, lipophagy regulates lipid metabolism by targeting lipid droplets (LDs) and is also closely related to the infection of a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. In this review, we briefly understand the LDs interaction relationship with Flaviviridae infection, outline the molecular events of how lipophagy occurs and the related research progress on the regulatory mechanisms of lipophagy in Flaviviridae infection. Exploring the crosstalk between viral infection and lipophagy induced molecular events may provide new avenues for antiviral therapy.","output":"Molecular Events Occurring in Lipophagy and Its Regulation in Flaviviridae Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In China, lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death among residents. Early diagnosis is of great significance for early interventional treatment and prolonging survival. PET/CT uses positron radiopharmaceuticals to observe the physiological and biochemical changes of the drug and its metabolites in the body and finally diagnoses the disease. 18F-FDG is a commonly used imaging agent, but its short isotopic half-life limits clinical high-throughput testing. This study retrospectively analyzed the imaging material of 100 lung cancer patients pathologically confirmed. Patients with lymph node metastasis were classified into the LM group (n = 30 cases), and those with no lymph node metastasis were classified into the NLM group (n = 70 cases). The results showed that MRI of superparamagnetic nanoferric oxide was better than diagnosis of lung cancer by the 18F-FDG PET/CT and had a high predictive power for lymph node metastasis.

Many tumors overexpress arginase, but it is unclear how these cancers, but not T cells, tolerate arginine depletion. In this study, we show that tumor cells synthesize arginine from citrulline by upregulating argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1). Under arginine starvation, ASS1 transcription is induced by ATF4 and CEBP binding to an enhancer within ASS1. T cells cannot induce ASS1, despite the presence of active ATF4 and CEBP, as the gene is repressed. Arginine starvation drives global chromatin compaction and repressive histone methylation, which disrupts ATF4/CEBP binding and target gene transcription. We find that T cell activation is impaired in arginine-depleted conditions, with significant metabolic perturbation linked to incomplete chromatin remodeling and misregulation of key genes. Our results highlight a T cell behavior mediated by nutritional stress, exploited by cancer cells to enable pathological immune evasion.","output":"Chromatin accessibility governs the differential response of cancer and T cells to arginine starvation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the concept of the disease curve has become ubiquitous in medicine and across society.

Here we report a newly detected strain of CHIK, Zhejiang/chik-sy/2012, in China, a nonindigenous region for CHIK, using a modified approach based on the classic cDNA-AFLP. We then performed etiological and phylogenetic analyses to better understand its molecular characterization and phylogenetic pattern, and also to aid in further evaluating its persistence in Southeast Asia. METHODS: By using this modified procedure, we determined for the first time the complete genome sequence of the chikungunya virus strain, Zhejiang/chik-sy/2012, isolated in 2012 from a patient in Zhejiang, China. Sequence analyses revealed that this positive single strand of RNA is 12,017 bp long. We found no single amino acid mutation in A226V, D284E and A316V. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our strain shared the greatest homology with a strain isolated in Taiwan, which was derived from a strain from Indonesia. Chik-sy/2012 is in a different clade from other CHIK viruses found in China previously. CONCLUSIONS: A modified cDNA-AFLP in virus discovery was used to isolate the first CHIK and the first complete genome sequence of virus strain chik-sy/2012 in 2012 from a patient with CHIK fever in Zhejiang, China. The infection displayed great phylogenetic distance from viruses detected in Guangdong, China, in 2008 and 2010, since they were derived from another evolutionary lineage.

Over the past few months, the lives of people around the world have changed dramatically. Within a few days, they have been forced to adapt their daily behavior and habits to new conditions. The cause of this phenomenon is a state of the pandemic, introduced by the WHO in connection with the spread of the new pathogen causing COVID-19. The group particularly affected by the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic are the people involved in remote working, including students who, since the beginning of the pandemic, have been carrying out the entire educational process or using the support of distance learning methods and techniques. Objective. the study aims to assess the level of well-being and emotions accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic among students of three large Polish public universities. Material and methods. The survey was attended by 1054 students from three Polish public universities. The study was conducted using a questionnaire including mental health interview;WHO-5 scale-Good Feeling Index developed by the Psychiatric Research Unit of WHO;Beck's scale of depression;author's multiple-choice questions about the impact of the epidemic situation on the current life of the studied population. Statistical significance was determined using the chi-quadrat, U Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Statistical significance level p=0.05 was assumed for each test. Results. The mild form of depression was distinguished: 17% of respondents in March, 28% in June/July, and October. A moderate form of depression was found: in 4% of respondents in March, 6% in June/July, and 8% in October. The risk of developing depressive symptoms is higher with each successive stage of the study, this phenomenon is particularly visible in the group of women in whom depressive symptoms are more frequent (p&lt;0.05).

In 2019, a Phase IV Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)-linked malaria vaccine implementation was underway. However, in December 2019, a novel pneumonia condition termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with many clinical, epidemiological, and biological parallels to malaria, was reported in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, and, as of the 3rd of June, 2020, more than 382,507 persons had died from COVID-19. Children under 5 years who suffer high malaria-attributable mortalities are largely asymptomatic for COVID-19. Considering that the malaria burden is highest in low-income tropical countries with little capacity to fund malaria control and eradication programs, the fight against malaria in these regions is likely to be hampered. Access to healthcare has generally been limited, while malaria interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemotherapy and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets, have been suspended due to lockdowns. Likewise, the repurposing of antimalarials for treatment of COVID-19 shared symptoms and the shift in focus from the production of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to COVID-19 RDTs is a cause for concern in malaria-endemic regions. Children are less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the elderly. However, due to the fears of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the elderly who are worst affected by COVID-19 may not take children for malaria medication, resulting in high malaria-related mortalities among children.

Whether this was associated with an increased risk of overdose is unclear. Objective: To evaluate whether increased take-home doses of OAT early in the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with treatment retention and opioid-related harm. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective propensity-weighted cohort study of 21a?297 people actively receiving OAT on March 21, 2020, in Ontario, Canada. Changes in OAT take-home dose frequency were assessed between March 22, 2020, and April 21, 2020, and individuals were observed for up to 180 days to assess outcomes (last date of follow-up, October 18, 2020). Exposures: Exposure was defined as extended take-home doses in the first month of the pandemic within each of 4 cohorts based on OAT type and baseline take-home dose frequency (daily dispensed methadone, 5-6 take-home doses of methadone, daily dispensed buprenorphine/naloxone, and 5-6 take-home doses of buprenorphine/naloxone). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were opioid overdose, interruption in OAT, and OAT discontinuation. Results: Among 16a?862 methadone and 4435 buprenorphine/naloxone recipients, the median age ranged between 38 and 42 years, and 29.1% to 38.2% were women. Among individuals receiving daily dispensed methadone (n = 5852), initiation of take-home doses was significantly associated with lower risks of opioid overdose (6.9% vs 9.5%/person-year; weighted hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.96]), treatment discontinuation (51.0% vs 63.6%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.72-0.90]), and treatment interruption (19.0% vs 23.9%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]) compared with no change in take-home doses. Among individuals receiving daily dispensed buprenorphine/naloxone (n = 662), there was no significant difference in any outcomes between exposure groups. Among individuals receiving weekly dispensed OAT (n = 11a?010 for methadone; n = 3773 for buprenorphine/naloxone), extended take-home methadone doses were significantly associated with lower risks of OAT discontinuation (14.1% vs 19.6%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.62-0.84]) and interruption in therapy (5.1% vs 7.4%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.90]), and extended take-home doses of buprenorphine/naloxone were significantly associated with lower risk of interruption in therapy (9.5% vs 12.9%/person-year; weighted HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.99]) compared with no change in take-home doses.

We sought to shed further light on this issue by conducting a single-center study in a kidney transplant center located in one of the France's highest risk zone (Grand Est) for Covid-19 during the initial disease outbreak. METHOD: To this aim, we used a survey approach coupled with systematic investigation of SARS-CoV-2 serology in a cohort of 1390 KTR. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 serologies were available for 780 survey respondents, among whom 48 had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (total seroprevalence: 6.2%). Thirty-five of the 48 seropositive KTR had previously received a diagnosis of Covid-19, whereas the remaining 13 patients were not known to be infected (8 asymptomatic cases). Specifically, 18.7% of seropositive KTR and 1.1% of the entire cohort were asymptomatic. Household exposure was found to markedly increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in KTR living in one of the France's highest risk zone for Covid-19 during the first French lockdown was as low as 6.3%. A rapid and strict implementation of protective measures could have significantly mitigated virus spread even in an area of high virus circulation.","output":"SARS-Cov-2 Seroprevalence in a French Kidney Transplant Center Located Within a \\"High Risk\\" Zone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is still a major threat to the world In this pandemic, transplantation activities have largely been affected worldwide We are still facing with this pandemic;however, after regulations, we have started our transplantation activities We report the first kidney transplantation whose recipient and living donor recovered from COVID-19 A 31-year-old male with renal failure was admitted for transplantation with an ABO-compatible relative The recipient and the donor were tested for COVID-19 before transplantation, and they were both positive with a polymerase chain reaction The recipient had minor symptoms and received therapy;the living donor also received therapy Thirty days after recovery, surgery was performed successfully The recipient was discharged with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus, and steroid 15 days after surgery In the follow-up, they were both negative for COVID-19 45 days after surgery Although there is missing literature regarding safety concerns and short-term follow-up, living-donor transplantation may be considered for patients, who recovered from COVID-19, after careful selection with paying attention to precautions","output":"The first kidney transplantation after recipient and living donor recovered from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 strain EDL933 encodes the single chromosomal 9-O-acetylesterase NanS, and several copies of prophage-encoded 9-O-acetylesterases (NanS-p). These enzymes have recently been shown to cleave 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac(2)) to yield de-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, the latter of which may serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. In the current study, we investigated the NanS- and NanS-p-mediated digestion of synthetic O-acetylated neuraminic acids and bovine submaxillary glands mucin (BSM)-derived O-acetylneuraminic acids by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and nano electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI MS). Initial HPTLC analyses showed the expected activity of NanS and NanS-p variants for Neu5,9Ac(2). However, all tested enzymes were unable to de-O-acetylate 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,4 Ac(2)) in our test system. The nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids after treatment of BSM with NanS-p gave evidence that NanS-p variants of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 cleave off O-acetyl groups from mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), regardless of the carbon positions C7, C8 or C9 of the acetate esters. This enzyme activity leads to neuraminidase-accessible Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc on mucin glycans. Moreover, we could demonstrate by HPTLC analyses that recombinant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase (BTSA-His) was able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac(2) from BSM and that the combination of BTSA-His with both NanS-His and NanS-p-His derivatives enhanced the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans. Growth experiments with EHEC wildtype strain EDL933, its nanS and nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant and exogenous BTSA-His in BSM demonstrated that the presence of BTSA-His enhanced growth of EDL933 and the nanS deletion mutant but not the nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant. Thus, we hypothesize that the expression of sialic acid O-acetylesterases with a broad specificity could be an advantage in competition with the gut microbiota for nutrients and facilitate EHEC colonization in the human large intestine.","output":"De-O-Acetylation of mucin-derived sialic acids by recombinant NanS-p esterases of Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain EDL933"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most controversial issues among rheumatologists is the best approach to managing a rheumatic patient (RP) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In a cross-sectional study, all RPs with an updated medical record between December 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020, at the rheumatology clinic of Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Qom, Iran were included (as the case group), and the prevalence of COVID-19 was compared to the paired control group-individuals without RDs, randomly selected from the Qom Health Network's database. Qom was the first city in Iran in which COVID-19 was identified and spread rapidly. Both groups were paired regarding sex, age, and underlying severe conditions. The prevalence of COVID-19 was lower in RPs than the control group (p = 0.028). Moreover, patients who were under treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents seemed to possess a lower risk for COVID-19. Two RPs died from COVID-19, both of whom had granulomatosis and polyangiitis (GPA). The prevalence of COVID-19 in the RPs was lower than the control group, which could be associated with more adherence to the quarantine and social distancing rules by RPs and stricter routine follow-ups than the general population. Besides, taking DMARDs, such as leflunomide, might possess a protective effect against severe COVID-19, probably as a result of preventing cytokine storm.","output":"Prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in rheumatic patients and evaluation of the effect of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to predict COVID-19 patients' level of severity (death or survival) enables clinicians to prioritise treatment.

To sustain performance, the proposed method partitioned data into three different time windows. For each window, an end-classifier, a mid-classifier and a front-classifier were designed respectively using the XGboost single tree approach. These time window classifiers were integrated into a majority vote classifier and tested with an isolated test data set. The voting classifier strengthens the overall performance of 90% cumulative accuracy from a 14 days window to a 21 days prediction window. An additional 7 days of prediction window can have a considerable impact on a patient's chance of survival.

Contrasting switch and stay trials provided an index for whole-language inhibition, while contrasting bivalent and univalent stimuli provided an index for item-specific inhibition. We then investigated the involvement of domain-general brain mechanisms in these two levels of language control. Neuroimaging studies report activation of the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), a key region in the executive control brain network, during language switching tasks. However, it is unclear whether or not the pre-SMA plays a causal role in language control, and at which level it exerts control. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to transiently disrupt the pre-SMA, we observed an essential role of this brain region in general speech execution, while evidence for its specific involvement in each level of inhibition remains inconclusive.","output":"Whole-Language and Item-Specific Inhibition in Bilingual Language Switching: The Role of Domain-General Inhibitory Control."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The African continent currently experiences 25% of the global burden of disease with only 1.3% of the worlds healthcare workers.

METHODS: A 39-item anonymous electronic survey was developed and distributed to medical students across Africa through social networks to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education. The survey assessed the domains of: class structure changes and timing, patient interactions, exam administration, learning environment satisfaction, mental health impacts, and volunteer opportunities/engagement. RESULTS: 694 students across 33 countries participated. 80% of respondents had their classes suspended for varied lengths of time during the pandemic, and from these students 59% of them resumed their classes. 83% of students felt they were in a supportive learning environment before the pandemic, which dropped to 32% since the start. The proportion of students taking exams online increased (6C26%, p<0.001) and there was a decrease in the proportion of students seeing patients as a part of their education (72C19%, p<0.001).

Traditional epidemiologic models choose to simplify reality by ignoring both the spatial distribution of populations and possible intrapopulation heterogeneities, whereas more recent solutions based on Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) can achieve high precision but are costly to compute and analyze. We introduce here an original alternative to these two approaches, which relies on a novel hybrid modeling framework and incarnates a multiscale view of epidemics. The model relies on a technical fusion of two modeling paradigms: System Dynamics (SD) and Individual-Based Modeling. It features an aggregated representation of local outbreaks rendered in SD, and at the same time a spatially-explicit simulation of the spread between populations simulated in IBM. We first present the design of this deterministic model, show that it can reproduce the dynamics of real resurgent epidemics, and infer from the sensitivity of several spatial factors absent in compartmental models the importance of having large-scale epidemiological processes represented inside of an explicitly disaggregated metapopulation. After discussing the implications of results obtained from simulation runs and the applicability of this model, we conclude that SDCIB hybrid modeling can be an interesting choice to represent epidemics in a spatially-explicit way without necessarily taking into account individual heterogeneities, and therefore it can be considered as a valuable alternative to simple compartmental models suffering from detrimental effects of the well-mixed assumption.","output":"Impact of the topology of metapopulations on the resurgence of epidemics rendered by a new multiscale hybrid modeling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a polyglycolic acid (PGA) yarn implant for nonthermal ablation of saphenous vein reflux. METHODS In two consecutive cohort studies (TAHOE I and TAHOE II), the feasibility of abolition of great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux by implantation of a PGA yarn was tested under ultrasound guidance in 51 and 30 patients, respectively. The use of tumescent local anesthesia was not required. Graduated compression stockings and thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin were used for 2 weeks after intervention in the first study only. RESULTS Of 81 enrolled patients, 77 (95%) were available at 6-month follow-up. Complete occlusion of the treated GSV was confirmed by duplex ultrasound in all patients except one patient at day 1. In TAHOE II, closure was preserved in a higher percentage of patients at 6 weeks, with 96.4% vs 82.0% in TAHOE I. The 6-month Kaplan-Meier estimated occlusion rates for TAHOE I and TAHOE II were 68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54%-79%) and 69% (95% CI, 49%-82%), respectively, with an estimated combined occlusion rate of 69% (95% CI, 57%-76%).

We propose a method for predicting both ICU requirements and the number of deaths, and which will enable the health authorities of the countries involved to plan the resources needed to face the pandemic as many days in advance as possible. Methods We use official Spanish data to predict ICU admissions and deaths based on the number of infections. We employ OLS to perform the econometric estimation, and through RMSE, MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE forecast performance measures we select the best lagged predictor of both dependent variables. Findings For Spain, our prediction shows that the best predictor of ICU admissions is the number of people infected eight days before, and that the best predictor of deaths is the number of people infected five days before. In the first case, we obtain a 98% coefficient of determination, and in the second a 97% coefficient. The estimated delayed elasticities find that a 1% increase in the number of cases today will imply a 0.72% increase in ICU patients eight days later and a 1.09% increase in the number of deaths five days later. Interpretation The model is not intended to analyse the epidemiology of COVID-19. Our objective is rather to estimate a leading indicator of clinical needs.

OBJECTIVES: We determined how anxiety, depression, and pain outcomes varied during the Stay-at-Home order compared with the prepandemic period and whether nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms would occur. METHODS: We conducted an online survey to opportunistically reassess clinical anxiety, depression, pain intensity, and pain interference while controlling for somatic symptom severity during the prepandemic and Stay-at-Home order period. During the Stay-at-Home period, anxiety, depression, pain intensity, and pain interference were reassessed. Coping strategies were assessed as a critical factor influencing pain behaviors. In addition, we explored the occurrence of nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms with an ad hoc survey referencing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publicly available COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in depression and anxiety levels during the Stay-at-Home period. Coping strategy changes (eg, increased exercise) were linked to lower pain severity and interference which improved overall. Participants who self-reported nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms had higher prepandemic depression. Among the 72 participants not diagnosed with COVID-19, 70.8% of the participants experienced symptoms resembling those associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We suggest the parallel between pain outcome improvement and worsening anxiety and depression during the Stay-at-Home order might reflect a shift in symptoms, indicating that those patients with underlying mood disorders may require more help than they did before the pandemic.","output":"Pain experience and mood disorders during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States: an opportunistic study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The investigation of acute pulmonary embolism is a common task for radiologists in Canada.

Image quality can be affected by patient factors (such as body habitus, motion artifact and cardiac output), intravenous (IV) contrast protocols (including the timing, rate and volume of IV contrast administration) and common physics artifacts (including beam hardening). Mimics of acute pulmonary embolism can be seen in normal anatomic structures, disease in non-vascular structures and pulmonary artery filling defects not related to acute pulmonary emboli. Understanding these pitfalls can help mitigate error, improve diagnostic quality and optimize patient outcomes. Dual energy computed tomography holds promise to improve imaging diagnosis, particularly in clinical scenarios where routine CTPA may be problematic, including patients with impaired renal function and patients with altered cardiac anatomy.","output":"Canadian Society of Thoracic Radiology/Canadian Association of Radiologists Best Practice Guidance for Investigation of Acute Pulmonary Embolism, Part 2: Technical Issues and Interpretation Pitfalls."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transient lymphocytopenia is frequently observed in acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

Here, we showed that humoral immunity components, including anti-S + N, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), gradually waned and decreased the neutralizing capacity against emerging Omicron variants at 3 and 6 months after two inactivated COVID-19 vaccinations. We evaluated two boosting strategies with either a third dose of inactivated vaccine (homologous, I-I-I) or a recombinant subunit vaccine (heterologous, I-I-S). Both strategies induced the production of high levels of NAbs with a broad neutralizing capacity and longer retention. Interestingly, I-I-S induced 3.5-fold to 6.8-fold higher NAb titres than I-I-I, with a broader neutralizing capacity against six variants of concern, including Omicron. Further immunological analysis revealed that the two immunization strategies differ considerably, not only in the magnitude of total NAbs produced, but also in the composite pattern of NAbs and the population of virus-specific CD4+ T cells produced. Additionally, in some cases, heterologous boosted immunity induced the production of more effective epitopes than natural infection. The level of I-I-S-induced NAbs decreased to 48% and 18% at 1 and 3 months after booster vaccination, respectively.

This trend has occurred alongside a growing body of evidence linking these behaviors to cognitive function. B-vitamins are thought to be particularly important in the neural development that occurs during pregnancy, as well as in healthy cognitive aging. However, much less is known regarding the role of B-vitamins during childhood. Given that preadolescent childhood is a critical period for cognitive development, this study investigated the relationship between specific aspects of nutrition, particularly B-vitamins, and related health factors (e.g., body mass, fitness) on selective attention in children. Children (n = 85; 8C11 years) completed a selective attention task to assess inhibition. Participants dietary intake was collected using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h dietary assessment tool. Correlations between specific nutrients, BMI, fitness, and task performance were investigated. After accounting for demographic variables and total caloric intake, increased B-vitamin intake (i.e., thiamin and folic acid) was associated with shorter reaction times (ps < 0.05), fitness was associated with greater response accuracy (p < 0.05), and increased BMI was related to increased variability in reaction times (p < 0.05). Together, these findings suggest that aspects of health may have unique contributions on cognitive performance. Proper physical health and nutrition are imperative for effective cognitive functioning in preadolescent children.

METHODS: We matched lab-confirmed COVID-19 case and death data reported to the NYC Health Department as of June 2, 2020, against the NYC HIV surveillance registry. We describe and compare the characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes of PWH diagnosed with COVID-19 with all NYC PWH and with all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19. RESULTS: Through June 2, 204,583 NYC COVID-19 cases were reported. The registry match identified 2,410 PWH with diagnosed COVID-19 eligible for analysis (1.06% of all COVID-19 cases). Compared with all NYC PWH and all New Yorkers diagnosed with COVID-19, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 were older, male, Black or Latino, and living in high-poverty neighborhoods. At least one underlying condition was reported for 58.9% of PWH with COVID-19. Compared with all NYC COVID-19 cases, a higher proportion of PWH with COVID-19 experienced hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and/or death; most PWH who experienced poor COVID-19-related outcomes had CD4 <500 cells/L. CONCLUSIONS: Given NYC HIV prevalence is 1.5%, PWH were not overrepresented among COVID-19 cases. However, compared with NYC COVID-19 cases overall, a greater proportion of PWH had adverse COVID-19-related outcomes, perhaps because of a higher prevalence of factors associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes.

Thermal imagers and pyrometers are the equipment commonly used to measure temperature in these barriers. In this paper, Temperature measurements performed by these instruments were compared considering the regions usually monitored in these barriers: forehead, ear, and wrist. The temperatures of volunteers were recorded after initial acclimatization, a short period of physical exercise, and a rest period after exercise, evaluating the instruments and regions of measurement and the influence of the condition of rest and physical exercise of the person. The compatibility of the performed measurements in each of these three moments was then compared using statistical and metrological tools. The outcomes showed that the pyrometer has low repeatability since its results vary widely among different measurements due to the temperature variation existing within the analyzed region and the difficulty of guaranteeing the same measurement point. As a result, a thermal imager is more recommended for taking body temperature measurements on the forehead and, preferably, on the ear. It was also determined that the wrist, in particular, has a significantly lower temperature than the central body temperature, and thus this is not a recommended region to measure body temperature when screening febrile people. ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Comparative analysis of the use of pyrometers and thermal imagers in sanitary barriers for screening febrile people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS EUS-guided liver biopsy is an emerging method of liver tissue acquisition which is safe and had been shown to produce excellent histological yield.

AIM: The aim of this study was to compare male reproductive hormones such as total testosterone (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulant hormone (FSH), and prolactin between patients with COVID-19, age-matched cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection, and age-matched controls. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study and included 262 men aged between 20 and 65 years. The study comprised 3 groups including patients with COVID-19 (n = 89), cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection (n = 30), and age-matched controls (n = 143). All cases were evaluated using TT, LH, FSH, and prolactin. Correlations between TT and clinical parameters of patient groups were investigated using Pearson's correlation test. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome of the study was detection of the difference of TT, FSH, LH, and prolactin levels between the groups. Secondary outcome was to correlate TT and hospitalization time and oxygen saturation on hospital admission (SpO2) of patients. RESULTS: The mean age of study groups was 49.9  12.5 years, 52.7  9.6 years, and 50  7.8 years, respectively (P = .06). Serum TT levels was median 185.52 ng/dL in patients with COVID-19, median 288.67 ng/dL in patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection and median 332 ng/dL in control cases, (P < .0001). The proportion of patients with testosterone deficiency in group 1, group 2, and group 3 was 74.2%, 53.3%, and 37.8%, respectively (P < .0001). Serum LH levels (P = 0.0003) and serum prolactin levels (P = .0007) were higher in patients with COVID-19 and patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection than control cases. Correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlation between serum TT levels and hospitalization time of patients with COVID-19 (r = -0.45, P < .0001). In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between SpO2 and serum TT levels in patients with COVID-19 ( r = 0.32, P = .0028). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Physicians may consider to evaluate male patients with COVID-19 for concomitant androgen deficiency. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths include the evidence about the alteration of male reproductive hormones under COVID-19. Limitations include the analysis limited to one general hospital, only a single measurement of TT was available, free and bioavailable testosterone levels were not evaluated. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates COVID-19 is associated with decreased level of TT and increased level of LH and prolactin.

AIM: Our aim is to describe COVID-19 symptoms in the Irish population at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and compare symptoms between those reporting positive and negative test results. METHOD: A Web page MyCovidSymptoms.ie was created by researchers at the National University of Ireland, Galway, in April 2020 to investigate COVID-19 symptoms in Ireland. The Web page invited participants to self-report RT-PCR test outcome data (positive, negative, untested), temperature and a range of symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of taste, loss of smell). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three Irish participants who had a RT-PCR test for COVID-19 logged their symptoms. Eighty-four patients reported that they tested positive for COVID-19, and 39 patients reported a negative COVID-19 test. In our cohort of respondents with a positive COVID-19 test, 49/84 (58%) respondents reported a cough. Of the 39 respondents with a negative COVID-19 test, 17 (44%) reported having a cough.

No one standard SLT exists and options include regimens containing platinum, gemcitabine, and more recently brentuximab vedotin (BV). Complete response rates associated with these regimens range from 50-70%. Due to the increasing use of BV in the front-line setting, development of SLT regimens that are both highly effective and BV-sparing are needed. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are highly active in RR cHL and have the potential to enhance the efficacy of standard chemotherapy. Here we report the results of our phase II study evaluating a novel anti-PD-1-based regimen, pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and liposomal doxorubicin (pembrolizumab-GVD), as SLT for RR cHL. Methods: Transplant eligible patients (pts) with RR cHL following failure of 1-line of therapy were eligible. Treatment consisted of 2 to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab (200mg IV, day 1), gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), vinorelbine (20mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8) and liposomal doxorubicin (15mg/m2, days 1 and 8), given on 21-day cycles. Pts who achieved CR by PET (Deauville 3) after 2 or 4 cycles proceeded to HDT/AHCT. HDT/AHCT was carried out according to institutional standards and BV maintenance was allowed following HDT/AHCT. The primary endpoint was CR rate after 2 or 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD. Enrollment occurred according to a Simon 2-stage design with sample size based upon a projected CR rate of 70%. In stage 1, 23 pts enrolled and 12 or more CRs were required to proceed to stage II;in stage II, an additional 16 pts enrolled. Out of a total of 39 pts, 24 CRs were required to declare this regimen promising. Results: Among 39 patients enrolled, 37 are evaluable for toxicity (2 pts have not yet started treatment) and 34 are evaluable for response (4 pts too early, 1 pt found to have composite lymphoma after enrollment). Of 37 treated pts, median age is 36 (range 21-71), 43% are male, 23 (62%) had advanced stage disease, and 15 (41%) had primary refractory disease.

An additional 1 pt achieved CR after 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD, therefore in total, 32 of 34 (94%) achieved CR following pembrolizumab-GVD. 4 pts with CR after 2 cycles received an additional 2 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD in order to delay HDT/AHCT during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (n=3) or due to refusing HDT/ASCT (n=1). To date, 32 have undergone HDT/AHCT following 2 (n=27) or 4 (n=5) cycles of treatment. 1 pt is awaiting HDT/AHCT;1 pt refused HDT/ASCT and received pembrolizumab maintenance instead. 2 pts received involved site radiation therapy to initial area of relapsed disease prior to planned HDT/AHCT and 10 pts received post-HDT/ASCT maintenance with BV. Median follow-up post-HDT/AHCT is 9 mos (range 0.03-20.9 mos) and all pts remain in remission to date. Conclusion: Second-line therapy with pembrolizumab-GVD is a highly effective and well-tolerated regimen that can efficiently bridge pts with RR cHL to HDT/AHCT. Updated results including all 39 enrolled pts will be presented at the meeting. Given the high CR rate observed with pembrolizumab-GVD, an expansion cohort evaluating 8 cycles of pembrolizumab maintenance (instead of HDT/AHCT) for patients who achieve CR af er 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD is planned.

Monitoring online data related to COVID-19 vaccine candidates can track vaccine misinformation in real-time and assist in negating its impact. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, understand their context, and then review interventions to manage this misinformation and increase vaccine acceptance. METHOD: In June 2020, a multi-disciplinary team was formed to review and collect online rumors and conspiracy theories between 31 December 2019-30 November 2020. Sources included Google, Google Fact Check, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, fact-checking agency websites, and television and newspaper websites. Quantitative data were extracted, entered in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed descriptively using the statistical package R version 4.0.3. We conducted a content analysis of the qualitative information from news articles, online reports and blogs and compared with findings from quantitative data. Based on the fact-checking agency ratings, information was categorized as true, false, misleading, or exaggerated. RESULTS: We identified 637 COVID-19 vaccine-related items: 91% were rumors and 9% were conspiracy theories from 52 countries. Of the 578 rumors, 36% were related to vaccine development, availability, and access, 20% related to morbidity and mortality, 8% to safety, efficacy, and acceptance, and the rest were other categories. Of the 637 items, 5% (30/) were true, 83% (528/637) were false, 10% (66/637) were misleading, and 2% (13/637) were exaggerated. CONCLUSIONS: Rumors and conspiracy theories may lead to mistrust contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Tracking COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in real-time and engaging with social media to disseminate correct information could help safeguard the public against misinformation.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories: The need for cognitive inoculation against misinformation to improve vaccine adherence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is accountable for a major pandemic situation. The emergence of the B.1.1.7 strain, as a highly transmissible variant has accelerated the world-wide interest in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants occurrence. Similarly, other extremely infectious variants, were described and further others are expected to be discovered due to the long period of time on which the pandemic situation is lasting. All described SARS-CoV-2 variants present several mutations within the gene encoding the Spike protein, involved in host receptor recognition and entry into the cell. Hence, instead of sequencing the whole viral genome for variants tracking, herein we propose to focus on the SPIKE region to increase the number of candidate samples to screen at once; an essential aspect to accelerate diagnostics, but also variants emergence/progression surveillance. This proof of concept study accomplishes both at once, population-scale diagnostics and variants' tracking. This strategy relies on (1) the use of the portable MinION DNA sequencer; (2) a DNA barcoding and a SPIKE gene-centered variants tracking, increasing the number of candidates per assay; and (3) a real-time diagnostics and variants tracking monitoring thanks to our software RETIVAD. This strategy represents an optimal solution for addressing the current needs on SARS-CoV-2 progression surveillance, notably due to its affordable implementation, allowing its implantation even in remote places over the world.","output":"Real-time SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and variants tracking over multiple candidates using nanopore DNA sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that smartphone apps can be effective in the self-management of weight. Given the low cost, broad reach, and apparent effectiveness of weight loss apps, governments may seek to encourage their uptake as a tool to reduce excess weight in the population. Mass media campaigns are 1 mechanism for promoting app use. However, the cost and potential cost-effectiveness are important considerations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to use modeling to assess the health impacts, health system costs, cost-effectiveness, and health equity of a mass media campaign to promote high-quality smartphone apps for weight loss in New Zealand. METHODS: We used an established proportional multistate life table model that simulates the 2011 New Zealand adult population over the lifetime, subgrouped by age, sex, and ethnicity (Mori [Indigenous] or non-Mori). The risk factor was BMI. The model compared business as usual to a one-off mass media campaign intervention, which included the pooled effect size from a recent meta-analysis of smartphone weight loss apps. The resulting impact on BMI and BMI-related diseases was captured through changes in health gain (quality-adjusted life years) and in health system costs. The difference in total health system costs was the net sum of intervention costs and downstream cost offsets because of altered disease rates. An annual discount rate of 3% was applied to health gains and health system costs. Multiple scenarios and sensitivity analyses were conducted, including an equity adjustment. RESULTS: Across the remaining lifetime of the modeled 2011 New Zealand population, the mass media campaign to promote weight loss app use had an estimated overall health gain of 181 (95% uncertainty interval 113-270) quality-adjusted life years and health care costs of CNZ $606,000 (CUS $408,000; 95% uncertainty interval CNZ $2,540,000 [CUS $1,709,000] to NZ $907,000 [US $610,000]). The mean health care costs were negative, representing overall savings to the health system. Across the outcomes examined in this study, the modeled mass media campaign to promote weight loss apps among the general population would be expected to provide higher per capita health gain for Mori and hence reduce health inequities arising from high BMI, assuming that the intervention would be as effective for Mori as it is for non-Mori. CONCLUSIONS: A modeled mass media campaign to encourage the adoption of smartphone apps to promote weight loss among the New Zealand adult population is expected to yield an overall gain in health and to be cost-saving to the health system. Although other interventions in the nutrition and physical activity space are even more beneficial to health and produce larger cost savings (eg, fiscal policies and food reformulation), governments may choose to include strategies to promote health app use as complementary measures.","output":"The Cost-effectiveness of a Mass Media Campaign to Promote Smartphone Apps for Weight Loss: Updated Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the face of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), people's adherence to precautionary behavioral measures (e g social distancing) largely influences the effectiveness of those measures in containing the spread of the coronavirus The present study aims at testing the applicability of the health belief model (HBM) and generalised social beliefs (i e social axioms) to explore strategies for promoting adherence to COVID-19 precautionary measures METHODS: We conducted a telephone survey with a two-step stratified random sampling method and obtained a probability sample of 616 adults in Macao, China (18-87 years old;60 9% women) in April 2020 RESULTS: Our participants showed stronger adherence to some COVID-19 precautionary measures (e g face mask wearing;96 4%) but not others (e g social distancing;42 3%) Their adherence to those measures was found to be significantly associated with four HBM factors and two social axioms, after controlling for gender, age, and years of education CONCLUSIONS: The HBM and the generalised social beliefs of social cynicism and reward for application can be applied to understanding adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19 Strategies based on beliefs were proposed to facilitate the promotion of precautionary measures","output":"Adherence to COVID-19 Precautionary Measures: Applying the Health Belief Model and Generalised Social Beliefs to a Probability Community Sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic and there is an urgent need to understand the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beclin-1 is an essential scaffold autophagy protein that forms two distinct subcomplexes with modulators Atg14 and UVRAG, responsible for autophagosome formation and maturation, respectively. In the present study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an incomplete autophagy response, elevated autophagosome formation but impaired autophagosome maturation, and declined autophagy by genetic knockout of essential autophagic genes reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication efficiency. By screening 28 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrated that expression of ORF3a alone is sufficient to induce incomplete autophagy. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a interacts with autophagy regulator UVRAG to facilitate Beclin-1-Vps34-Atg14 complex but selectively inhibit Beclin-1-Vps34-UVRAG complex. Interestingly, although SARS-CoV ORF3a shares 72.7% amino acid identity with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, the former had no effect on cellular autophagy response. Thus, our findings provide the mechanistic evidence of possible takeover of host autophagy machinery by ORF3a to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication and raises the possibility of targeting the autophagic pathway for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"ORF3a mediated-incomplete autophagy facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread around the world like wildfire, impacting health, industry, the global economy, and the environment This paper focuses on climate change, discussing the global trend in CO2 emissions and how COVID-19 is impacting climate change Global warming is the greatest environmental challenge our planet has ever faced According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CO2 emissions declined by 8% during 2020 Of the wide range of sustainable technologies available for carbon capture, mineralization technology is the first to produce carbonate minerals by directly reacting minerals with low concentration CO2 This long-term technology affords extended capacity for CO2 storage We consider the extensive guidelines required for climate change during the battle against COVID-19 ? 2021, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society","output":"COVID-19 Impacts on Climate ChangeSustainable Technologies for Carbon Capture Storage and Utilization (CCUS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a grade B infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) In pace with the spreading of the disease, biosafety risk of the biological specimen preservation in biobanks has been significantly increased and biosafety protection during biological specimen preservation become increasingly important According to the related national rules and the corresponding guidelines of Chinese Medical Association, this paper introduced the etiology about SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology about COVID-19, and the biosafety protection principles of individuals and biological specimen storage places in the process of personal protection, protection of collection, transport, handling, preservation, detection, post-detection disposal and emergencies of biological specimen Emphasized to carry out a strict biosafety-risk assessment on biological specimen basing on virus load information, infectivity, and sample type (possible contact transmission, aerosol transmission, and fecal oral transmission)","output":"[Principles and suggestions on biosafety protection of biological specimen preservation during prevalence of COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Watching multiple episodes using streaming services, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Youku, has become widespread in recent years. While much attention has been paid to binge-watching, there is, however, a dearth of research on binge-watching and its adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, less attention has been paid to understanding the multiple influences of binge-watching on binge-watchers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the past studies on this topic mainly underscored the individuals motivations for binge-watching. Also, past studies were limited and inconclusive as they mostly espoused only the underpinning adverse effects of binge-watching without looking into the association between binge-watching and screen time for web series through online streaming services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study sought to fill this gap by probing the association between binge-watching and psychological aftereffects. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional research design vis--vis the survey method. A sample of 1089 adult respondents was collected through an online administrated questionnaire. RESULTS: The findings of this study demonstrated that extensive binge-watching is an antecedent of stress, loneliness, insomnia, depression and anxiety. Furthermore, it was found that screen time on binge-watching could intensify these adverse effects of binge-watching. Interestingly, the moderating effect of screen time on binge-watching was found to be insignificant for stress and loneliness. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that binge-watching correlates with psychological and mental health symptoms including stress, loneliness, insomnia, depression and anxiety. Hence, this study suggests that consumption of web series through online streaming services related literacy interventions are imperative to help the audience become critical about online streaming content and its comparison to the real social world.","output":"Investigating Binge-Watching Adverse Mental Health Outcomes During Covid-19 Pandemic: Moderating Role of Screen Time for Web Series Using Online Streaming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social distancing measures are used to reduce the spreading of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of local restrictions on the transmission of respiratory virus infections. Methods: we retrospectively analyzed the nasopharyngeal samples of all patients (0C18 years old) admitted with respiratory symptoms in a large Italian tertiary hospital during the last three seasons from 2018 to 2021. Results: A strong reduction in all viral respiratory infections was observed in the last season (2020C2021) compared to the two previous seasons (?79.69% and ?80.66%, respectively). In particular, we found that during the epidemic period 2018C2019 and 2019C2020, the total number of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) cases was, respectively 726 and 689, while in the last season a total of five cases was detected. In the first months of 2018C2019 and 2019C2020, the total flu infections were 240 and 354, respectively, while in the last season we did not detect any influenza virus. As other viruses, the presence of Rhinovirus declined, but to a lesser extent: a total of 488 cases were assessed compared to the 1030 and 1165 cases of the two previous respective epidemic seasons. Conclusions: Public health interventions and distancing (including continuous use of face masks) settled to counter the pandemic spread of COVID-19 had a macroscopic impact on all respiratory virus transmission and related diseases, with a partial exception of Rhinovirus.

We reviewed the effects of the pandemic on the neurosurgical case volume to study the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing these procedures during the perioperative period and compared the characteristics and outcomes of this group to those of patients without COVID-19. METHODS: The neurosurgical and neurointerventional procedures at 2 tertiary care centers during the pandemic were reviewed. The case volume, type, and acuity were compared to those during the same period in 2019. The perioperative COVID-19 tests and results were evaluated to obtain the incidence. The baseline characteristics, including a modified Medically Necessary Time Sensitive (mMeNTS) score, and outcome measures were compared between those with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 405 cases were reviewed, and a significant decrease was found in total spine, cervical spine, lumbar spine, and functional/pain cases. No significant differences were found in the number of cranial or neurointerventional cases. Of the 334 patients tested, 18 (5.4%) had tested positive for COVID-19. Five of these patients were diagnosed postoperatively. The mMeNTS score, complications, and case acuity were significantly different between the patients with and without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: A small, but real, risk exists of perioperative COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients, and those patients have tended to have a greater complication rate. Use of the mMeNTS score might play a role in decision making for scheduling elective cases.

Attenuation of NS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo. This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a NS1 virus results in an immediate antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies suggest that NS1 influenza viruses could be used for the prophylaxis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory viral infections, and that an influenza virus vaccine based on NS1 live attenuated viruses would confer broad protection against influenza virus infection from the moment of administration, first by non-specific innate immune induction, followed by specific adaptive immunity.","output":"Prophylactic protection against respiratory viruses conferred by a prototype live attenuated influenza virus vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Objetivo: descrever um cluster da COVID-19 e as estratgias utilizadas para a conten??o do vrus, num municpio do interior de Mato Grosso, Brasil.

Recent studies suggest that while the demand for public transport has decreased due to passengers inability to maintain physical distance inside this mode, the demand for private automobile and active transport modes (walking and cycling) has increased during the pandemic. Policymakers should take this opportunity given by the pandemic and encourage people to use active transport more in the new normal situation to achieve sustainable transportation outcomes. This study explores the expected change in active transport mode usage in the new normal situation in Bangladesh based on the data from a questionnaire survey. The study finds that 56% and 45% of the respondents were expected to increase travel by walking and cycling, respectively, during the new normal situation. On the other hand, 19% of the respondents were expected to do the opposite.

At the same time, economic strain may operate as a risk factor for a wide range of undesired mental and physical health outcomes in Black communities. Aim The current study investigated the combined effects of education and economic strain on the following five health outcomes in Black older adults in underserved areas of South Los Angeles: depressive symptoms, number of chronic diseases, pain intensity, self-rated health, and sick days. Methods This cross-sectional study included 619 Black older adults residing in South Los Angeles. Data on demographic factors (age and gender), socioeconomic characteristics, economic strain, health insurance, living arrangement, marital status, health behaviors, depressive symptoms, pain intensity, number of chronic diseases, sick days, and self-rated health were collected. Five linear regressions were used to analyze the data. Results Although high education was associated with less economic strain, it was the economic strain, not educational attainment, which was universally associated with depressive symptoms, pain intensity, self-rated health, chronic diseases, and sick days, independent of covariates. Similar patterns emerged for all health outcomes suggesting that the risk associated with economic strain and lack of health gain due to educational attainment are both robust and independent of type of health outcome. Conclusion In economically constrained urban environments, economic strain is a more salient social determinant of health of Black older adults than educational attainment. While education loses some of its protective effects, economic strain deteriorates health of Black population across domains. There is a need for bold economic and social policies that increase access of Black communities to cash at times of emergency. There is also a need to improve the education quality in the Black communities.","output":"Economic Strain Deteriorates While Education Fails to Protect Black Older Adults Against Depressive Symptoms, Pain, Self-rated Health, Chronic Disease, and Sick Days."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The computed tomography angiography (CTA) spot sign is widely used to assess the risk of hematoma expansion following acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, not all patients can receive intravenous contrast nor are all hospital systems equipped with this technology. We aimed to independently validate the Hematoma Expansion Prediction (HEP) Score, an 18-point non-contrast prediction scale, in an external cohort and compare its diagnostic capability to the CTA spot sign. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of the predicting hematoma growth and outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage using contrast bolus CT (PREDICT) Cohort Study. Primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion ( 6 mL or  33%). We generated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparing the HEP score to significant expansion. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) for each score point. We determined independent predictors of significant hematoma expansion via logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 292 patients were included in primary analysis. Hematoma growth of  6 mL or  33% occurred in 94 patients (32%). The HEP score was associated with significant expansion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.30). ROC curves comparing HEP score to significant expansion had an area under the curve of 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71). Youden's method showed an optimum score of 4. HEP Scores  4 (n = 100, sensitivity 49%, specificity 73%, PPV 46%, NPV 75%, aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.09-3.64) accurately predicted significant expansion. PPV increased with higher HEP scores, but at the cost of lower sensitivity. The diagnostic characteristics of the spot sign (n = 82, Sensitivity 49%, Specificity 81%, PPV 55%, NPV 76%, aOR 2.95, 95% CI 1.61-5.42) were similar to HEP scores  4. CONCLUSION The HEP score is predictive of significant expansion ( 6 mL or  33%) and is comparable to the spot sign in diagnostic accuracy.

The study focuses on measuring the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies before and after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination among long-term care facility (LTCF) elderly residents. We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational study among LTCF residents. The study protocol was based on three blood sample acquisitions: first taken at baseline5 days before the first dose of the vaccine, second20 days after the first dose, and third12 days after the second shot of the vaccine. The comparison was made for two cohorts: patients with and without prior COVID-19 infection. The data was collected from January to March 2021. A total number of 78 LTCF residents (55 women and 23 men) aged 62C104, 85.72  7.59 years (mean  SD), were enrolled in the study. All study participants were investigated for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike (S) protein IgG, using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Frailty was assessed with the Clinical Frailty Scale. Among elderly COVID-19 survivors in LTCF, a single dose of vaccine significantly increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels. IgG concentration after a single and double dose was comparable, which may suggest that elderly COVID-19 survivors do not require a second dose of vaccine.

Objective: To develop and validate a prognostic model based on routine hematological parameters to predict uncomplicated disease progression to support the decision for an earlier discharge. Design: Development and refinement of a multivariable logistic regression model with subsequent external validation. The time course of several hematological variables until four days after admission were used as predictors. Variables were first selected based on subject matter knowledge; their number was further reduced using likelihood ratio-based backward elimination in random bootstrap samples. Setting: Model development based on three Austrian hospitals, validation cohorts from two Austrian and one Swedish hospital. Participants: Model development based on 363 survivors and 78 non-survivors of Covid-19 hospitalized in Austria. External validation based on 492 survivors and 61 non-survivors hospitalized in Austria and Sweden. Outcome: In-hospital death. Main Results: The final model includes age, fever upon admission, parameters derived from C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, platelet count and creatinine concentration, approximating their baseline values (CRP, creatinine) and change over time (CRP, platelet count). In Austrian validation cohorts both discrimination and calibration of this model were good, with c indices of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.96) in a cohort from Vienna and 0.93 (0.88 - 0.98) in one from Linz. The model performance seems independent of how long symptoms persisted before admission. In a small Swedish validation cohort, the model performance was poorer (p = 0.008) compared with Austrian cohorts with a c index of 0.77 (0.67 - 0.88), potentially due to substantial differences in patient demographics and clinical routine. Conclusions: Here we describe a formula, requiring only variables routinely acquired in hospitals, which allows to estimate death probabilities of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. The model could be used as a decision support for earlier discharge of low-risk patients to reduce the burden on the health care system. The model could further be used to monitor whether patients should be admitted to hospital in countries with health care systems with emphasis on outpatient care (e.g. Sweden).","output":"Development and external validation of a logistic regression derived formula based on repeated routine hematological measurements predicting survival of hospitalized Covid-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the 2019 pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease (COVID 19)has triggered movements of people from urban areas to rural areas.

METHODS: We examined early responses of IL-37, a powerful anti-inflammatory cytokine, in 254 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients prior to any clinical intervention and determined its correlation with clinical prognosis. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes elevation of plasma IL-37. Higher early IL-37 responses correlated with earlier viral RNA negative conversion, chest CT image improvement and cough relief, consequently resulted in earlier hospital discharge. Further assays showed that higher IL-37 was associated with lower IL-6 and IL-8 and higher IFN-&#945; and facilitated biochemical homeostasis. Low IL-37 responses predicted severe clinical prognosis in combination with IL-8 and CRP. In addition, we observed that IL-37 administration was able to attenuate lung inflammation and alleviate respiratory tissue damage in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that IL-37 plays a protective role by antagonizing inflammatory responses while retaining type I IFN, thereby maintaining the functionalities of vital organs.

He developed new ST-segment elevation, elevated cardiac enzymes, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and high inflammatory markers in the setting of haemodynamic and respiratory collapse from the viral illness. He was diagnosed with COVID-19-induced myopericarditis. He showed rapid clinical improvement with a rapid wean off pressure support, resolution of electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and recovery of left ventricular systolic function following treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone. DISCUSSION: COVID-19s complex and devastating complications continue to create new challenges for clinicians. Cardiac complications, specifically, have been shown to be a signal for worse prognosis in these patients.

Exploiting variation in the timing of policies in difference-in-difference models, we show that much of the decline in foot traffic early in the pandemic was due to private precautionary behavior. SAH orders explain almost none of the foot traffic decline in industries with high risk of virus transmission, but they do explain a substantial share of the decline in moderate- to low-risk industries such as outdoor sports and visits to parks. Targeted restrictions tend to impact intended industries, as well as complementary ones. We show that the impact of targeted restrictions is largest in counties with no SAH restrictions, suggesting that better targeting of public restrictions can have important efficiency gains.","output":"Total shutdowns, targeted restrictions, or individual responsibility: How to promote social distancing in the COVID-19 Era?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate whether dry eye disease (DED) is a risk factor for COVID-19.

Because psychological constructs are not objectively existing constituents of reality but rather efforts to represent it, they tend to become more or less relevant and salient as a function of prevailing conditions. Starting from this premise, the current paper focuses on the relevance that fears with an interpersonal basis (i.e. the fear of missing out and the fear of not mattering) have during a period in which physical distancing or social distancing has been implicated as a crucial important public health intervention that can help stop transmission of the coronavirus.

Moreover, indiscriminate use of antibiotics in conventional aquaculture practices in order to prevent or control disease outbreaks has resulted in the occurrence of residues and antimicrobial resistance. Thus, the application of eco-friendly feed additives, such as probiotics, as a safer alternative has received increasing attention in recent years. However, only minimal information on the administration of probiotics via freshwater cladoceran Moina micrura is available despite being commonly used for larval and post-larval feeding of freshwater crustaceans and fish. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the application of Bacillus pocheonensis strain S2 administered via M. micrura to red hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) larvae. Bacillus pocheonensis that has been previously isolated from Spirulina sp. was subjected to preliminary in vitro evaluation of antagonistic properties. The agar well-diffusion assay revealed that this probiont could inhibit the growth of Streptococcus agalactiae and Aeromonas hydrophila. The size of inhibition zones ranged from 8.8  0.2 to 18.2  0.4 mm. Moina micrura was later used as a biological model in preliminary in vivo bacterial challenge assays to evaluate the efficacy of B. pocheonensis in protecting the host from diseases. Moina micrura was pre-enriched with B. pocheonensis at [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] before S. agalactiae and A. hydrophila were introduced into the culture. The study revealed that B. pocheonensis at [Formula: see text] was able to significantly enhance the survival of M. micrura after being challenged with both pathogens (63  3%) in comparison to the control group. The relative percentage survival (RPS) of M. micrura was highest (p < 0.05) when treated with B. pocheonensis at both concentrations [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (38.33) after being challenged against S. agalactiae. To assess the efficacy of B. pocheonensis in protecting red hybrid tilapia against streptococcosis, the larvae were fed with either unenriched (control) Moina or probiont-enriched Moina daily for 10 days. A significantly (p < 0.05) higher survival rate (77  3%) was observed in larvae fed with probiont-enriched M. micrura compared to other treatments, and the RPS was recorded at 62.90. In addition, the S. agalactiae load was suppressed in larvae fed probiont-enriched M. micrura ([Formula: see text]) in comparison to the control group ([Formula: see text]), indicating that the probiont might have contributed to the improvement of tilapia health and survival.

RESULTS Compared with adjacent tissues, miR-203 expression was significantly increased in tumor tissues and SCOS3 mRNA expression was decreased. Compared with those with lower miR-203 expression, the prognosis of patients with higher expression of miR-203 was significantly worse. There was a targeted regulatory relationship between miR-203 and SOCS3 mRNA. Compared with IOSE80 cells, miR-203 expression in HO8910 and SKOV3 cells was increased, and its expressions of SOCS3 mRNA and protein were decreased. Compared with miR-NC group, the transfection of miR-203 inhibitor significantly increased SOCS3 expression, and decreased the expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 protein. We draw the conclusion that miR-203 increased cell apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation. However, opposite results were observed after the transfection of miR-203 mimic. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal miR-203 and SOCS3 expression are related to the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. MiR-203 affects the proliferation of JAK-STAT pathway and regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells by targeting the inhibition of SOCS3 expression.","output":"MiR-203 regulates proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells by targeting SOCS3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Methamphetamine (Meth) is a highly addictive and hallucinogenic agent which is used as the second most common illicit drug globally. Meth could affect the retina and optic nerve by inducing the release of vasoconstrictive agents such as endothelin 1 and induction of severe oxidative stress with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. AIM To evaluate the effects of chronic Meth abuse on the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the Bruch's membrane opening minimum rim width (MRW). METHOD In this case-control study, we recruited 55 Meth abusers and 49 healthy individuals with mean age of 44.63  0.97 and 43.08  0.91 years, respectively. RNFL thickness, GCL thickness and MRW were evaluated using optical coherence tomography. RESULTS We found statistically significant decrease in RNFL, MRW thickness in Meth abusers (P: 0.002 and P: 0.006, respectively). We did not detect statistically significant difference regarding GCL thickness between the groups (P = 0.320). Our results showed a weak but statistically significant correlation of Meth dose increment and decrement of RNFL thickness ((P: 0.005, r = -0.193) and MRW (P: 0.013, r = -0.174). We found no correlation between duration of Meth consumption with RNFL and MRW thickness (P: 0.205, r= -0.124; P: 0.771, r= -0.029, respectively). CONCLUSION We found a statistically significant adverse association in meth abusers with RNFL thickness and MRW. These two parameters were also statistically associated with the meth dose as measured by daily dose of Meth.

Although MS is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease, clinical manifestations including continence control disorders have traditionally been attributed to the loss of neural signaling due to neurodegeneration. Clinical approaches to MS-LUTS/LUTD have focused on addressing symptoms in the context of urodynamic dysfunctions as pathophysiologic understandings are incomplete. The mouse model provides a useful research platform for discovery of more detailed molecular, cellular, and tissue-level knowledge of the disease and its clinical manifestations. The aim of this two-part review is to provide a state-of-the-art update on the use of the mouse model for MS research, with a focus on lower urinary tract symptoms.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including alkalizing lysosomes and blocking autophagy as well as exhibiting dose-limiting toxicities in patients. Therefore, we evaluated additional lysosomotropic compounds to identify an alternative lysosome-based drug repurposing opportunity. We found that six of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) values ranging from 2.0 to 13 M and selectivity indices (SIs; SI = CC(50)/EC(50)) ranging from 1.5- to >10-fold. The compounds (1) blocked lysosome functioning and autophagy, (2) prevented pseudotyped particle entry, (3) increased lysosomal pH, and (4) reduced (ROC-325) viral titers in the EpiAirway 3D tissue model. Consistent with these findings, the siRNA knockdown of ATP6V0D1 blocked the HCoV-NL63 cytopathic effect in LLC-MK2 cells. Moreover, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cell lysate revealed significant dysregulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, suggesting a contribution of the lysosome to the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.

Generalized restriction of movement, together with unprecedented pressure on Health System, disrupted routine care for non-COVID-19 patients. Telemedicine has been promoted to reduce the risk of infections and to offer medical assistance to the restricted population. This paper is aimed to evaluate the impact of tele-consulting technology in a single bariatric center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our outpatient clinic reorganized the service from on-site to long-distance video consultations. All patients received a satisfaction questionnaire. The main goals were to evaluate patient compliance and to assess patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the 33 booked patients who were offered a teleconsultation, 19 (57.6%) participated in the video-call. No significant differences were found between participants and non-participants in terms of age and gender ratio. Urban area residents were 57.9% of the participants versus 42.8% of the non-participants group. Of the participants, 52.6% completed the survey reporting levels of satisfaction ranging from high to very high. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has been advocated as a useful tool to relieve pressure on the overwhelmed Health Systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, e-health technologies are not yet widely adopted. Our initial experience, also compared with national data relating to the digital divide, suggests that the absence of basic computer skills and the lack of confidence with video-call systems may be patient-specific barriers for the implementation of telemedicine. In this context, telemedicine implementation can run up against various patient-related barriers, and several challenges remain for e-health to be integrated into outpatient practice.","output":"Telemedicine Implementation on a Bariatric Outpatient Clinic During COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: an Unexpected Hill-Start"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We performed molecular dynamics simulation of the dimeric SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2) main protease (Mpro) to examine the binding dynamics of small molecular ligands. Seven HIV inhibitors, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir, were used as the potential lead drugs to investigate access to the drug binding sites in Mpro. The frequently accessed sites on Mpro were classified based on contacts between the ligands and the protein, and the differences in site distributions of the encounter complex were observed among the ligands. All seven ligands showed binding to the active site at least twice in 28 simulations of 200 ns each. We further investigated the variations in the complex structure of the active site with the ligands, using microsecond order simulations. Results revealed a wide variation in the shapes of the binding sites and binding poses of the ligands. Additionally, the C-terminal region of the other chain often interacted with the ligands and the active site. Collectively, these findings indicate the importance of dynamic sampling of protein-ligand complexes and suggest the possibilities of further drug optimisations.","output":"Drug binding dynamics of the dimeric SARS-CoV-2 main protease, determined by molecular dynamics simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Recently, the number of gynecological cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been increasing. This article was committed to studying the influence of gynecological tumor treatment history compared to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was of great significance for the treatment of gynecological cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the diagnosis and treatment of six gynecological cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 30 to March 25, 2020. To better explain the treatment of gynecological cancer patients during the epidemic of COVID-19, we summarized the case characteristics, auxiliary examination, treatment plan, and outcome of these six patients. Results: We observed a high rate of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection among these six gynecological cancer patients, who were in a low immune state. Also, due to the influence of cancer treatment history, COVID-19-related atypical symptoms became the first symptom of COVID-19 in some cases, which increased the difficulty of diagnosis. Furthermore, in terms of treatment for these cases, immune boosters and reagents that raised white blood cells were applied, except for in symptomatic antiviral treatment. At present, all patients in this study were discharged from the hospital with a good prognosis. Conclusion: After cancer-related treatment, the gynecological cancer patients became more susceptible to COVID-19. Besides, the history of cancer treatment made the diagnosis of COVID-19 difficult, which also affected the treatment of COVID-19.

The adoption of WFH impacts energy use in the residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. Consequently, this affects the greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and the associated energy costs to workers and employers. This study estimates the effects of WFH on the GHGE and energy-related costs in the residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. A simple linear model was used to estimate the changes in the GHGEs and cost by a typical employee when WFH practice is adopted for 1.5 and 4 days per week. The adoption of WFH reduces the operational GHGE accounted for commercial buildings and transport. However, it increases the operational GHGE accounted for residential buildings, which is a maximum of about 6% and 12%, respectively, for WFH 1.5 and 4 days. The reduction of GHGE from transport is significantly higher than that of residential buildings. The GHGE reductions from the transport sector are about 30% and 80%, respectively, for WFH 1.5 days and 4 days per week. WFH for 1.5 and 4 days per week reduces the national annual GHGE by about 1.21 Mt CO2-e and 5.76 Mt CO2-e, respectively. Further, the annual transportation cost of an employee is reduced by 30% and 80% in each city when the employee WFH for 1.5 and 4 days per week. The outcomes of this study offer a direction to reduce energy consumption and related costs and potential future research avenues on this topic.

During previous crisis, especially during global financial crisis, most governments responded with austerity measures and fiscal consolidation. This time it is different. Governments worldwide approved additional expenditures, tax cuts, government bond issuance and borrowing in order to mitigate economic consequences of the looming crisis. One of the pandemic's result is dramatic increase of indebtedness that could affect efficiency of fiscal and monetary responses created before to fight against crisis.

This paper examines the applicability of the logistic growth model, with implications for the study of the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases. METHODS: An NLS (Non-Linear Least Squares) method was employed to estimate the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function using new daily COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and in other selected countries. The estimation was based upon training data from January 20, 2020 to March 13, 2020. A restriction test was subsequently implemented to examine whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries, and the diagnosis of residuals was also conducted. The model's goodness of fit was checked using testing data from March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020. RESULTS: The model presented in this paper fitted time-series data exceedingly well for the whole of China, its eleven selected provinces and municipalities, and two other countries - South Korea and Iran - and provided estimates of key parameters. This study rejected the null hypothesis that the growth rates of outbreaks were the same among ten selected non-Hubei provinces in China, as well as between South Korea and Iran. The study found that the model did not provide reliable estimates for countries that were in the early stages of outbreaks. Furthermore, this study concured that the R2 values might vary and mislead when compared between different portions of the same non-linear curve. In addition, the study identified the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and countries. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there is potential for this model to contribute to better public health policy in combatting COVID-19.

RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were analyzed, of whom 51 (48.1%) required BMV using the new protocol. Of clinical factors, only patient BMI was significantly associated with the requirement for BMV. Mean seizure duration reduced from 52.0  22.4 to 46.6  17.1 s, but seizure duration was adequate in all cases. No acute physical, respiratory, or psychiatric complications occurred during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A modified anesthesia protocol reduces the use of BMV by more than 50%, while retaining adequate seizure duration.","output":"Modified Anesthesia Protocol for Electroconvulsive Therapy Permits Reduction in Aerosol-Generating Bag-Mask Ventilation during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), came as a significant health care challenge for humans in 2019-20. Based on recent laboratory and epidemiological studies, a growing list of mutations in the virus has the potential to enhance its transmission or help it evade the immune response. To further compound the problems, there are considerable challenges to the availability of effective, affordable, safe vaccines on a mass scale. These impediments have led some to explore additional options available in traditional medicines, especially immune-boosting natural products. Saffron has been used for centuries to treat fever, bronchitis, cold and other immune, respiratory disorders. Herein, we discuss the potential role of saffron during and after COVID-19 infection, focusing on immunomodulation, respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular functions. As a nutraceutical or drug supplement, it can alleviate the magnitude of COVID-19 symptoms in patients. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and other medicinal properties attributed to saffron bioactive compounds can help in both pre-and post- infection management strategies. The abnormalities associated with COVID-19 survivors include anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Saffron can help manage these post-hospitalization abnormalities (sub-acute and chronic) too, owing to its anti-depressant property. It can help common people boost immunity and manage depression, stress and anxiety caused due to prolonged lockdown, isolation or quarantine.","output":"Saffron: A potential drug-supplement for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COVID) management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While many countries are preparing to face the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported cases in Africa remain low.

In absence of official recommendations, implementing daily multidisciplinary team (MDT) COVID-19 meetings was urgently needed. Our aim was to describe our initial institutional standard operating procedures for implementing these meetings, and their impact on daily practice. METHODS: All consecutive patients who were hospitalized in our institution due to COVID 19, from March 31 to April 15, 2020, were included. Criteria to be presented at MDT meetings were defined as a proven COVID-19 by PCR or strongly suspected on CT scan, requiring hospitalization and treatment not included in the standard of care. Three investigators identified the patients who met the predefined criteria and compared the treatment and outcomes of patients with predefined criteria that were presented during MDT meeting with those not presented during MDT meeting. COVID-19 MDT meeting implementation and adhesion were also assessed by a hospital medical staff survey. RESULTS: In all, 318 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were examined in our hospital. Of these, 230 (87%) were hospitalized in a COVID-19 unit, 91 (40%) of whom met predefined MDT meeting criteria. Fifty (55%) patients were presented at a MDT meeting versus 41 (45%) were not. Complementary exploration and inclusion in the CorImmuno cohort were higher in MDT meeting group (respectively 35 vs. 15%, P=0.03 and 80 versus 49%, P=0.0007). Prescription of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate was higher in group of patients not presented during MDT meeting (24 vs. 51%, P=0.007). Almost half of the patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were not presented at MDT meeting, which can be partly explained by technical software issues. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary COVID-19 meetings helped implementing a single standard of care, avoided using treatments that were untested or currently being tested, and facilitated the inclusion of patients in prospective cohorts and therapeutic trials.","output":"Daily multidisciplinary COVID-19 meeting: Experiences from a French university hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study describes the epidemiology of COVID-19 outbreaks in four care homes in terms of spread, severity, presentation and interventions.

Their job descriptions vary, which may lead to lack of clarity or preparedness regarding their roles and core tasks during a crisis such as COVID-19. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore hospital-employed healthcare researchers' experiences of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A qualitative design based on Graneheim and Lundman's latent content analysis of two focus groups with researchers in clinical practice was chosen to explore researchers' experiences of work during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Fifteen hospital researchers participated in two focus groups, divided into predoctoral and postdoctoral researchers. Focus groups were conducted in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, using the voice over IP service, Skype?, due to risk of contagion. FINDINGS: 'Searching for a new normal during the COVID-19 pandemic' was the main theme during the latent content interpretation, with subthemes of (i) balancing calm and insecurity, (ii) negotiating core tasks and (iii) considering the future. CONCLUSION: The 15 researchers tried to balance calm and insecurity within work and family, on standby for the hospital's contingency plan, and in their research tasks. This led them to negotiate their core tasks and to reflect on the changes and consequences for their positions as researchers in clinical practice in the future. SUMMARY STATEMENT: What is already known about this topic? During a major healthcare crisis, normal plans and procedures at hospitals are set aside. Working under unexpected and unsecure conditions may lead to postcrisis reactions. Researchers with nursing and allied health backgrounds, who are the first generation of these researchers at hospitals, do not have fully developed and recognized positions. What this paper adds? Nurse and allied health researchers searched for a new normal in their work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurse and allied health researchers tried to balance calm and insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the imbalance between their research-related tasks and their status on standby for clinical tasks in the hospital contingency plan. Nurse and allied health researchers struggled with identifying and negotiating their core tasks by reconsidering possible changes and consequences for their positions as researchers in clinical practice in the future. The implications of this paper: Nurse and allied health researchers employed in clinical practice were willing to participate on the frontline, monitoring and evaluating major healthcare crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This could potentially lead to new and important context-sensitive learnings after crisis but only if healthcare leaders and organizations clearly formulate the expectations for the researchers.","output":"Searching for a new normal-Hospital-employed researchers' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Articles submitted 1 June 2019C31 May 2020 (Vol. 93) Rubric Approved Under Evaluation Rejected Total Submitted Book Series C C 1 1 Dossiers pdagogiques 5 C 3 8 Film 4 C 7 11 Focus on the Classroom 7 1 14 22 Interview 2 C 3 5 Linguistics 2 C 3 5 Literature 26 1 43 70 Professional Issues C C 1 1 Society and Culture 5 C 9 14 Totals 51 2 84 137 Vol. 93 was my tenth year as Editor in Chief of the French Review.

Many countries including the United Kingdom have relied on the symptom-based test and trace strategy in bringing the COVID-19 pandemic under control. The effectiveness of a test and trace strategy based on symptoms has been questionable and has failed to meet testing and tracing needs. This is further exacerbated by it not being delivered at the point of care, leading to rising cases and deaths. Increases in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United Kingdom despite performing the highest number of tests in Europe suggest that symptom-based testing and contact tracing might not be effective as a control strategy. An alternative strategy is making testing available to all. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review was to compare mass testing and contact tracing with the conventional test and trace method in the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The secondary objective was to determine the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases reported during mass testing interventions. METHODS: Literature in English was searched from September through December 2020 in Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Mendeley, and PubMed. Search terms included mass testing, test and trace, contact tracing, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, effectiveness, asymptomatic, symptomatic, community screening, UK, and 2020. Search results were synthesized without meta-analysis using the direction of effect as the standardized metric and vote counting as the synthesis metric. A statistical synthesis was performed using Stata 14.2. Tabular and graphical methods were used to present findings. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 286 articles from Google Scholar, 20 from ScienceDirect, 14 from Mendeley, 27 from PubMed, and 15 through manual search. A total of 35 articles were included in the review, with a sample size of nearly 1 million participants. We found a 76.9% (10/13, 95% CI 46.2%-95.0%; P=.09) majority vote in favor of the intervention under the primary objective. The overall proportion of asymptomatic cases among those who tested positive and in the tested sample populations under the secondary objective was 40.7% (1084/2661, 95% CI 38.9%-42.6%) and 0.0% (1084/9,942,878, 95% CI 0.0%-0.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was low-level but promising evidence that mass testing and contact tracing could be more effective in bringing the virus under control and even more effective if combined with social distancing and face coverings. The conventional test and trace method should be superseded by decentralized and regular mass rapid testing and contact tracing, championed by general practitioner surgeries and low-cost community services.","output":"Mass Testing With Contact Tracing Compared to Test and Trace for the Effective Suppression of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The acute disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS COV-2) is accompanied by a hypercoagulable state.

All cases presented with an acute confusional state and were accompanied by rapid elevations of lactate and D-dimers and leukocytes. The end organs involved were the kidneys, spleen, liver, lungs, central nervous system, intestines and limbs. Only one of the five patients survived.

The risk of COVID-19 and impact of immunosuppressive treatment on disease course in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain controversial. We aimed to determine the change of intestinal ACE2 expression before and after biologics treatment including anti-tumor necrosis factor  (anti-TNF), anti-integrin, and anti-interleukin (IL)12/23 in IBD patients. Methods: We analyzed the ACE2 expression through the public database of paired intestinal biopsies from IBD patients before and after biologic therapy. Change of ACE2 RNA and protein expression were validated in two independent cohorts (Birmingham cohort and Guangzhou cohort). The correlation between ACE2 expression and disease activity was also analyzed. Results: Mining information from the GEO database showed that compared with healthy control, intestinal ACE2 expression was downregulated in ileum of CD patients, while upregulated in colon of both CD and UC patients. Colonic ACE2 RNA expression was decreased significantly in patients responding to anti-TNF but not anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23, which was validated in the Birmingham cohort. Using the Guangzhou cohort including 53 patients matched by pre- and post-anti-TNF therapy, colonic ACE2 protein expression was significantly downregulated after anti-TNF treatment in responders (P < 0.001) rather than non-responders. Colonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in patients with severe histologically active disease compared with those with moderate (P < 0.0001) and mild (P = 0.0002) histologically active disease. Conclusion: Intestinal inflammation influences the expression of intestinal ACE2 in IBD patients, with different alterations in the ileum and colon. Colonic ACE2 expression was downregulated after anti-TNF therapy in IBD patients responding to treatment. This might provide new clues regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential benefit of sustaining anti-TNF treatment in patients with IBD.","output":"Down-Regulation of Colonic ACE2 Expression in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Responding to Anti-TNF Therapy: Implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychopathology and cognitive development are closely related. Assessing the relationship between multiple domains of psychopathology and cognitive performance can elucidate which cognitive tasks are related to specific domains of psychopathology. This can help build theory and improve clinical decision-making in the future. In this study, we included 13,841 children and adolescents drawn from two large population-based samples (Generation R and ABCD studies). We assessed the cross-sectional relationship between three psychopathology domains (internalizing, externalizing, dysregulation profile (DP)) and four cognitive domains (vocabulary, fluid reasoning, working memory, and processing speed) and the full-scale intelligence quotient. Lastly, differential associations between symptoms of psychopathology and cognitive performance by sex were assessed. Results indicated that internalizing symptoms were related to worse performance in working memory and processing speed, but better performance in the verbal domain. Externalizing and DP symptoms were related to poorer global cognitive performance. Notably, those in the DP subgroup had a 5.0 point lower IQ than those without behavioral problems. Cognitive performance was more heavily affected in boys than in girls given comparable levels of psychopathology. Taken together, we provide evidence for globally worse cognitive performance in children and adolescents with externalizing and DP symptoms, with those in the DP subgroup being most heavily affected.","output":"Cognitive performance in children and adolescents with psychopathology traits: A cross-sectional multicohort study in the general population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging pollutants and priority substances are of growing concern due to their toxicity potential to aquatic organisms and human health. However, few reports on this issue in marine ecosystems in general and, more specifically, on the Colombian Caribbean coast are available. The aim of this study was to detect these compounds in sediments from Cartagena Bay (CB) and in the Grand Marsh of Santa Marta, GMSM (Ramsar site), in order to determine how they related to in vitro cytotoxicity assays on HepG2 cells of sediment extracts. A total of thirty compounds were detected using GCCMS/MS in fifteen stations during both the rainy and the dry seasons. Sediments from CB had a wide range of different toxicants, with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) being the most prevalent (12 PAHs, 5.5C881.6 ng/g). Total PCBs ranged from < LOD to 18.6 ng/g, with PCB 138 being the most common detected congener. Residues of p,p-DDE, Chlorpyrifos and two organophosphate flame retardants, TEHP and ToTP, were found in most sampling locations. The UV filters 4MBC and homosalate were recurrently found in sediments, and the fragrance galaxolide appeared in all cases, with the greatest concentrations found on a touristic beach. In GMSM, with the exception of deltamethrin, all chemicals evaluated had lower average values than in CB. According to sediment quality guidelines, some sites in CB presented values of PAHs higher than the threshold effects level, while in the marsh, none of the stations exceeded it. HepG2 cells exposed to 1% sediment extracts presented reduced cell viability up to 26%. Cytotoxicity displayed a negative correlation with chlorpyrifos concentration. In short, these data suggest the bay and the marsh have specific contamination fingerprints related to anthropogenic interventions. This research highlights the need to further investigate the ecotoxicological implications of detected chemical stressors in these ecosystems.

OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of COVID-19 on tacrolimus trough levels (primary outcome) in OTRs and the association of the later with acute kidney injury, bacterial infection, and oxygen requirements. METHODS: We studied adult (>18-year-old) hospitalized OTRs with COVID-19, who were receiving tacrolimus between 3/1 and 12/16/2020. RESULTS: Among 30 OTRs, 67% were men, 90% had a kidney transplant. Median age was 60.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 45-68) years, median time from transplant 36 (IQR: 20-84) months. Tacrolimus troughs were higher on admission for COVID-19 than baseline (average over 6 months prior) (P = .001). Eighteen patients (60%) had admission tacrolimus trough >10, 5 (17%) >20 ng/mL. Patients with diarrhea had borderline higher tacrolimus troughs, compared to those without diarrhea (P = .09).

The acceptability of APS to HTS providers is important for the quality and effectiveness of APS delivery. Within a larger ongoing implementation science study of APS in western Kenya, we qualitatively evaluated the provider acceptability of APS. METHODS: From MayCJune 2020, we conducted virtual, semi-structured in-depth interviews with 14 HTS providers recruited from 8 of 31 study health facilities in Homa Bay and Kisumu counties. Participants were selected using criteria-based purposive sampling to maximize variation on patient volume (assessed by the number of index clients tested for HIV) and APS performance (assessed by sexual partners elicitation and enrollment). Interviews inquired providers experiences providing APS including challenges and facilitators and the impact of contextual factors. Data were analyzed using an inductive approach. RESULTS: Overall, HTS providers found APS acceptable. It was consistently reported that doing APS was a continuous process rather than a one-day job, which required building rapport and persistent efforts. Benefits of APS including efficiency in HIV case finding, expanded testing coverage in men, and increased HIV status awareness and linkage to care motivated the providers. Provider referral was perceived advantageous in terms of independent contact with partners on behalf of index clients and efficiency in partner tracing. Challenges of providing APS included protecting clients confidentiality, difficulty obtaining partners accurate contact information, logistic barriers of tracing, and clients refusal due to fear of being judged for multiple sexual partners, fear of breach of confidentiality, and HIV stigma. Building rapport with clients, communicating with patience and nonjudgmental attitude and assuring confidentiality were examples of facilitators. Working in rural areas and bigger facilities, training, supportive supervision, and community awareness of APS promoted APS delivery while low salaries, lack of equipment, and high workload undermined it. CONCLUSIONS: HTS providers found APS acceptable. Delivering APS as a process was the key to success. Future scale-up of APS could consider encouraging provider referral instead of the other APS methods to improve efficiency and reduce potential harm to clients.","output":"It is a process C a qualitative evaluation of provider acceptability of HIV assisted partner services in western Kenya: experiences, challenges, and facilitators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A reliance on telemedicine to conduct outpatient appointments has been essential in reducing physical doctor-patient contact during the coronavirus pandemic. We investigated whether the use of remote monitoring in cardiac telehealth consultations affected identification of elective replacement intervals (ERI), and subsequent generator changes for cardiac devices. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on cardiology pacing clinic patients at a regional hospital in Victoria between March 2020 and September 2020. Patients were stratified into those who received in-person clinician, pacing technician, and telehealth reviews. The primary outcome was ERI identification and generator changes. Results: 408 patients were identified (65% male, age 65  14 years), 230 received telehealth review, 115 cardiac technician-only, and 63 in-person physician review. There was no significant difference in baseline demographics. Remote monitors were used in 52% (n=120) of the telehealth cohort. We identified 1.8% (n=4), 6.5% (n=4) and 8% (n=7) of patients who had reached ERI in telemedicine, physician review and technician reviews respectively (p=0.036). Patients in the telemedicine cohort who were previously identified to be approaching ERI did not have remote monitors, compared to physician and technician reviews, which utilised both remote monitoring and direct interrogation. Conclusion: Telemedicine review without remote monitoring was associated with reduced detection of ERI compared to patients receiving in-hospital device interrogation. The use of remote monitoring may improve ERI detection when used in conjunction with telemedicine. Further studies are required to determine whether delayed ERI identification in this cohort leads to adverse outcomes.","output":"Cardiac Device Elective Replacement Intervals and Subsequent Generator Changes are Identified Later in Patients Reviewed in Telemedicine Pacing Clinics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the features and trends in inbound and outbound tourism flows between Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region (BSR) countries in 20122019.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seven (n=107) patients of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, between 20 April 2020 and 13 May 2020 were included in the study using consecutive sampling. Data were collected using the Excel audit tool and included age, gender, weight, estimated eGFR, D-dimer values on admission, intensive care unit admission, presence of respiratory failure, imaging results for evaluation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and anticoagulation received on admission. The data were entered in the SPSS (V.17) and were analysed. Data were summarised as meansSD, number or percentage as appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The frequency of VTE was found to be 11.2% in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia.

To make it proper to perform them, understanding of the immunological aspects is critically important. The present study aimed to assess humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests. METHODS: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titres of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titres measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titres were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred, while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases.

In this study, the neuroimaging findings and clinical course of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to a tertiary care hospital network in Canada were characterized. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary hospital network in Ontario, Canada. All adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted from February 1, 2020 to July 22, 2020 who received neuroimaging related to their COVID-19 admission were included. CT and MR images were reviewed and categorized by fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. Demographic and clinical data were collected and correlated with imaging findings. RESULTS: We identified 422 patients admitted with COVID-19 during the study period. 103 (24.4%) met the inclusion criteria and were included: 30 ICU patients (29.1%) and 73 non-ICU patients (70.9%). A total of 198 neuroimaging studies were performed: 177 CTs and 21 MRIs. 17 out of 103 imaged patients (16.8%) had acute abnormalities on neuroimaging: 10 had macrohemorrhages (58.8%), 9 had acute ischemia (52.9%), 4 had SWI abnormalities (23.5%), and 1 had asymmetric sulcal effacement suggesting possible focal encephalitis (5.8%). ICU patients were more likely to have positive neuroimaging findings, more specifically acute ischemia and macrohemorrhages (P < 0.05). Macrohemorrhages were associated with increased mortality (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Macrohemorrhages, acute ischemia and SWI abnormalities were the main neuroimaging abnormalities in our cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients with complete or partial mole diagnosed at our institution between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2020, were included. To verify whether there was an increase in the incidence of hydatidiform mole (HM) and deliveries in 2020, the incidences for each year from January 2010 to October 2020 were recorded. In addition, we identified all women who were diagnosed with HM from January to November 2020, and compared them with a control group who underwent uterine evacuation for missed abortion of a singleton pregnancy during the same period. We also documented the time taken to diagnose missed abortion or molar pregnancy to check if a delay in diagnosis can explain the increase in HM incidence. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of molar pregnancy. A further increase occurred in 2020 (odds ratio = 2.071). The mean gestational age of the embryo at the time of diagnosis was smaller in the HM group than in the missed abortion group (6.3  1.67C7.4  2.4, one-sided P = 0.034), meaning that it took more time (days) to diagnose molar pregnancy than missed abortion (22.38  10.32 vs. 15.83  7.83 days, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in the incidence of molar pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly because of the delay in receiving medical care.

In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of Eadyn to predict the arterial blood pressure response to a fluid challenge (FC) in preload-dependent, spontaneously breathing patients. METHODS Patients admitted postoperatively and monitored with the Nexfin monitor (BMEYE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were enrolled in the study. Patients were included in the analysis if they were spontaneously breathing and had an increase in cardiac output 10% during an FC. Patients were classified according to the increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) after FC into MAP-responders (MAP increase 10%) and MAP-nonresponders (MAP increase <10%). Eadyn was continuously calculated from the PPV and SVV values obtained from the monitor. RESULTS Thirty-four FCs from 26 patients were studied. Seventeen FCs (50%) induced a positive MAP response. Preinfusion Eadyn was significantly higher in MAP-responders (1.39  0.41 vs 0.85  0.23; P = 0.0001). Preinfusion Eadyn predicted a positive MAP response to FC with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.92  0.04 of standard error (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.99; P < 0.0001). A preinfusion Eadyn value 1.06 (gray zone: 0.9-1.15) discriminated MAP-responders with a sensitivity and specificity of 88.2% (approximate 95% confidence interval, 64%-99%), respectively.

Acyclovir is a substrate of organic anion transporter (OAT) 1/3 and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2. Considering the extraordinarily long half-life of LEFs active metabolite teriflunomide (TER) and the kidney injury risk of acyclovir, it is necessary to elucidate the potential impact of LEF on the disposition of acyclovir. Here we used a specific MRP inhibitor MK571 and probenecid (OAT1/3 and MRP2 inhibitor) to assess the effects of MRP2 and OAT1/3 on the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of acyclovir in rats. We showed that LEF and probenecid, but not MK571 significantly increased the plasma concentration of acyclovir. However, kidney and liver exposures of acyclovir were increased when coadministered with LEF, probenecid or MK571. The kidney/plasma ratio of acyclovir was increased to approximately 2-fold by LEF or probenecid, whereas it was increased to as much as 14.5-fold by MK571. Consistently, these drugs markedly decreased the urinary excretion of acyclovir. TER (0.5?100 mol/L) dose-dependently increased the accumulation of acyclovir in MRP2-MDCK cells with an IC(50) value of 4.91 mol/L. TER (5 mol/L) significantly inhibited the uptake of acyclovir in hOAT1/3-HEK293 cells. These results suggest that LEF/TER increased the kidney accumulation of acyclovir by inhibiting the efflux transporter MRP2, which increased its kidney/plasma ratio and renal injury risk. However, the inhibitory effects of LEF/TER on OAT1/3 reduced the tubular cells uptake of acyclovir and increased the plasma concentration.","output":"Leflunomide increased the renal exposure of acyclovir by inhibiting OAT1/3 and MRP2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The aim of the study was to identify strategies adopted by radiotherapy centres in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to get a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of AMDV in northeast China to control and prevent AMD from further spreading. This study for the first time isolated AMDV from fecal swab samples of mink in China. RESULTS: A total of 157/291 (54.0%) of the fecal swab samples were positive for AMDV. Of these, 23 AMDV positive samples were randomly selected for sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis based on the acquired partial fragments of VP2 gene with the hypervariable region. Comparative DNA sequence analysis of 23 AMDV isolates with a reference nonpathogenic (AMDV-G) strain revealed 8.3% difference in partial VP2 nucleotide sequences. Amino acid alignment indicated the presence of several genetic variants, as well as one single amino acid residue deletion. The most concentrated area of variation was located in the hypervariable region of VP2 protein. According to phylogenetic analysis, the Chinese AMDV strains and the other reference AMDV strains from different countries clustered into three groups (clades A, B and C). Most of the newly sequenced strains were found to form a Chinese-specific group, which solely consisted of Chinese AMDV strains. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that a high genetic diversity was found in Chinese AMDV strains and the virus distribution were not dependent on geographical origin.

Emerging evidence shows that the pandemic has had dramatic mental health impacts, bringing about increased anxiety and greater social isolation due to the physical distancing policies introduced to control the disease. In this context, it is possible to more deeply appreciate the health consequences of loneliness and social isolation, which researchers have argued are enduring experiences for many people and under-recognised contributors to public health. In this paper, we examine the social and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on what this has revealed about the need to better understand and respond to social isolation and loneliness as public health priorities. Social isolation and loneliness are understood to be distinct conditions, yet each has been found to predict premature mortality, depression, cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Estimates of the prevalence and distribution of social isolation and loneliness vary, possibly ranging from one-in-six to one-in-four people, and the lack of knowledge about the extent of these conditions indicates the need for population monitoring using standardised methods and validated measures. Reviews of the evidence relating to social isolation and loneliness interventions have found that befriending schemes, individual and group therapies, various shared activity programs, social prescription by healthcare providers, and diverse strategies using information and communication technologies have been tried. There remains uncertainty about what is effective for different population groups, particularly for prevention and for addressing the more complex condition of loneliness. In Australia, a national coalition - Ending Loneliness Together - has been established to bring together researchers and service providers to facilitate evidence gathering and the mobilisation of knowledge into practice.

Importantly, by aggregating VOC-associated and plasma-selected spike substitutions into a single polymutant spike protein, we show that 20 naturally occurring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike are sufficient to confer near-complete resistance to the polyclonal neutralizing antibodies generated by convalescents and mRNA vaccine recipients. Strikingly however, plasma from individuals who had been infected and subsequently received mRNA vaccination, neutralized this highly resistant SARS-CoV-2 polymutant, and also neutralized diverse sarbecoviruses. Thus, optimally elicited human polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be resilient to substantial future SARS-CoV-2 variation and may confer protection against future sarbecovirus pandemics.","output":"High genetic barrier to escape from human polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the rate-limiting steps in analyzing immune responses to vaccines or infections is the isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies.

One solution involves splitting one ventilator to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are obvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments expanding on the previous studies using two types of test lungs, different ventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs proportional with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway resistances, and that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also change the tidal volume delivered to the other test lung when in volume controlled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that higher PEEP settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is indicated for mitigating risks.","output":"Splitting one ventilator for multiple patients -- a technical assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We critically analyze the currently available status indicators of the COVID-19 epidemic so that state governors will have the guideposts necessary to decide whether to further loosen or instead retighten controls on social and economic activity.

Resilience is a positive adaptation to stress that may act as a buffer against adverse mental health outcomes. Based on prior knowledge, we hypothesized that PLWH would display higher resilience than HIV-uninfected peers, and that high resilience would be associated with lower risk of substance misuse. METHODS: This analysis of the Collaborating Consortium of Cohorts Producing NIDA Opportunities (C3PNO) included data from six USA cohorts that administered a COVID-19-related survey with a 3-month follow-up during May 2020 and March 2021. All data was self-reported. The Brief Resilience Scale and General Anxiety Disorder-7 were utilized. Primary analyses consisted of multivariate generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1,430 participants completed both surveys, of whom 670 (46.9%) were PLWH. PLWH had lower odds of anxiety (OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.51-0.89) and higher odds of high resilience (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.02-1.44) than HIV-uninfected participants, adjusted for covariates. The presence of anxiety was associated with higher risk of misuse of all substances. High resilience was associated with lower risk of anxiety and misuse of substances, adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological resilience was associated with lower risk of anxiety and substance misuse, potentially serving as a buffer against poor mental and behavioral health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To determine whether the 3'-end sequence is also involved in subgenomic mRNA transcription, we have constructed MHV defective interfering (DI) RNAs which contain a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene placed behind an intergenic sequence and a 3'-end sequence with various degrees of internal deletions. The DI RNAs were transfected into MHV-infected cells, and CAT activities, which represent subgenomic mRNA transcription from the intergenic site, were determined. The results demonstrated that the deletions of sequence upstream of the 350 nt at the 3'-end, which include the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), of MHV genomic RNA did not affect subgenomic mRNA transcription. However, deletions that reduced the 3'-end sequences to 270 nt or less completely abolished the mRNA transcription despite the fact that all of these clones synthesized minus-strand RNAs. These results indicated that mRNA transcription from an intergenic site in the MHV DI RNA requires most of the 3'-UTR as a cis-acting signal, which likely exerts its effects during plus-strand RNA synthesis. A substitution of the corresponding bovine coronavirus sequence for the MHV sequence within nt 270 to 305 from the 3'-end abrogated the CAT gene expression, suggesting a very rigid sequence requirement in this region. The deletion of a putative pseudoknot structure within the 3'-UTR also abolished the CAT gene expression.

Through a series of linear diagrams, it is convenient to compare and analyze the genomes of the samples collected in different regions more intuitively, which may be conducive to further data mining of genomic information and refined explorations of COVID-19 for patients.","output":"Protein Coding of Variations on SARS-CoV-2 Genomes in Various Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction As technology continuously improves, there is an increasing demand for higher quality educational resources The internet has decreased barriers of accessing quality educational resources for students of all backgrounds In medical education, the costs of obtaining and maintaining cadavers for the understanding of the human body can be a major expense Furthermore, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in minimizing in-person learning, the demand for quality anatomy resources is at an all-time high Objectives This project aimed to create a quality and informative dissection of the anterior abdominal wall for learners, and to investigate the impact of virtual learning as a supplementary resource Methods A complete and skilled dissection of the anterior abdominal wall was recorded In addition, specific anatomical features were explained during the recording The footage was then edited via Camtasia, a video editing software, where visual features, audio features, a comprehensive quiz, and the video's introductory and outgoing effects were prepared The final production was uploaded to YouTube and prepared for medical students at the University of British Columbia, as well as the online community A survey was linked at the end of the video, which was open for anyone who watched the production Results People from across the world watched and provided feedback on this dissection While a majority of feedback received came from respondents in North America, some comments were received from viewers in Brazil, India and China 94 7% of respondents were actively completing or had completed an MD Degree and 5 3% of participants were actively completing or had completed an MBBS program 84 2% of participants used this resource to prepare for their anatomy labs and dissections, 63 2% used this video to prepare for their anatomy lectures, and 68 4% of people used this to prepare for their examinations Overall, 21 1% of respondents agreed and 78 9% of respondents strongly agreed that this online resource assisted them in fulfilling their purposes of watching this video Conclusion Responses from the online survey indicate that using gross anatomy dissection videos helped improve the learning experience of anatomy and more resources should be created to fill this demand Video Link: https://youtu be/_Cl1djsxQlY","output":"A Guide to the Anatomy of the Anterior Abdominal Wall: Examining the Impact of Virtual Dissection on the Learner's Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters into target cells by exploiting the cellular transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for spike protein cleavage. Male gender, age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension are some of the factors related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality. Prostate cancer (PCa) patients (pts) are expected to be at higher risk for COVID-19 due to age and disease related comorbidities. TMPRSS2 transcription depends on androgens and androgen receptor and it is significantly downregulated by hormone therapies commonly used to treat PCa in different settings. Supposing that in PCa pts androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) could hamper SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, we aim to evaluate if the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the androgen responsive elements (AREs) in the TMPRSS2 promoter is associated to COVID-19 outcomes. Trial design: The present exploratory biological study is part of an ongoing retrospective-prospective multicenter cohort trial designed to verify whether PCa pts on ADT develop milder clinical presentation of COVID-19 than the general male population. The cohort trial collects real world data since February 2020 through regional databases that identified 200,000 potential pts to be enrolled to compare the clinical outcome of COVID-19 between PCa pts on active therapy (Study Group) and non-PCa pts (Control Group). Within the Study Group, we will compare the COVID-19 outcome between treatment subgroups: ADT alone, ADT plus antiandrogens, CYP17 inhibitors or chemotherapy. To identify SNPs in AREs of the TMPRSS2 gene and to describe possible associations with COVID-19 outcome, blood samples will be collected from 50 PCa pts treated at selected centers. Pts will participate voluntarily and sign an informed consent approved by local ethical committees. We will centrally perform PBMCs isolation and DNA extraction by using quiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. SNPs will be evaluated with the Axiom? Human Genotyping SARS-CoV-2 array. The effect of ADT will be corrected depending on identified SNPs and associated to COVID-19 outcome.

We applied Lean Six Sigma processes to optimize clinic workflow to reduce patient wait times and improve the patient experience. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study. METHODS We implemented (1) pushing most extended wait times to the end of the workflow by rooming the patient directly and (2) using distractions during the waiting process by using educational videos and a timer for physician arrival in the patient exam room. We compared the patient wait times and subcomponents of Press Ganey scores as a surrogate for changes in patient experience and satisfaction from the preimplementation period (n = 277) to the 3-month (September 1, 2020, to November 30, 2020) postimplementation period (n = 218). RESULTS There was a significant reduction in overall throughput time (38 vs 35 minutes) and wait before rooming (11 vs 8 minutes), and increased physician time with patients (15 vs 17 minutes) (P < .0001 for all). These results corresponded with a significant improvement in Press Ganey subcomponents of (1) waiting time in the exam room before being seen by the care provider, (2) degree to which you were informed about any delays, (3) wait time at clinic (from arriving to leaving), and (4) length of wait before going to an exam room (P < .001 for all).

It identifies the different phases of a pandemic and the implications for capacity and mutual aid within a national healthcare system, and introduces a revised CRITCON-PANDEMIC framework for shared operational responsibilities and clinical decision-making. Usual legal and ethical frameworks should continue to apply while capacity and mutual aid are available (CRITCON-PANDEMIC levels 0-3); clinicians should focus on current clinical needs and should not treat patients differently because of anticipated future pressures. In conditions of resource limitation (CRITCON-PANDEMIC 4), a structured and equitable approach is necessary and an objective Decision Support Aid is proposed. In producing this guidance, we emphasise that all patients must be treated with respect and without discrimination, because everyone is of equal value. The guidance has been put together with input from patient and public groups and aims to provide standards that are fair to everyone. We acknowledge that COVID-19 is a new disease with a partial and evolving knowledge base, and aim to provide an objective clinical decision-making framework based on the best available information. It is recognised that a factual assessment of likely benefit may take into account age, frailty and comorbidities, but the guidance emphasises that every assessment must be individualised on a balanced, case by case, basis and may inform clinical judgement but not replace it. The effects of a comorbidity on someone's ability to benefit from critical care should be individually assessed.

Ad mist university examinations in India medical schools have switched to online assessment methods to avoid student gatherings. In this context, we conducted online anatomy practical evaluation and we have aimed at quantifying the students' experience on virtual assessment. METHODS: A total of 250 first year MBBS students appeared for online anatomy practical examinations. Immediately after the completion of exams electronic feedback about their experience, in questionnaire format was obtained after getting informed consent. Their feedback was analysed and quantified. RESULTS: Completed feedback forms were submitted by 228 students. More than 50% of students favoured online anatomy spotter examinations. Only 32.8% of students were comfortable with soft parts discussion using images. For image based viva voce 61.4%, 80% & 82% of students responded that the features and orientation of osteology, radiology and embryology images, respectively, were good. For surface marking 55% of the participants preferred online verbal evaluation. Finally, more than 60% of the students preferred the conventional over online assessment methods. CONCLUSIONS: The inclination of students' preference for traditional anatomy examination methods mandates adequate training of both students and teachers for virtual examination. The superiority of conventional anatomy practical examination methods is unbiased but pandemic situations warrant adequate preparedness.

It is useful for residency programs to know the impact that offering GH opportunities has on resident recruitment. The study objectives were to explore the importance of GH opportunities in residency selection among fourth-year medical students, examine the relationship between interest in GH and career plans, and describe students perspectives on prior GH experiences. METHODS: The authors administered an electronic survey to all fourth-year medical students attending 12 different US institutions in February 2020. Data from the ten schools who were able to comply with the survey distribution methodology and with response rates above 25% were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearsons correlation. RESULTS: A total of 707 fourth-year medical students from the included schools completed the survey out of 1554 possible students (46% response rate). One third of respondents ranked the presence of GH experiences in residency as moderately or very important and 26% felt that the presence of a formal GH curriculum was at least moderately important, with variation noted among specialties. After training, 65% of students envision practicing internationally in some capacity. A desire to care for underserved patients in their careers was significantly correlated with an interest in GH experiences during residency. CONCLUSIONS: The opportunity to be involved in GH experiences during training can be an important factor for many medical students when considering residency choice, and the availability of these opportunities may be a valuable recruitment tool.

Many providers transitioned from seeing their patients in person to virtually using telemedicine platforms with limited training and experience using this medium. In pediatric rheumatology, this was further complicated as musculoskeletal exams typically require hands-on assessment of patients. The objective of this study was to examine the adoption of telemedicine into pediatric rheumatology practices, to assess its benefits and challenges, and to gather opinions on its continued use. A survey was sent to the lead representatives of each Pediatric Rheumatology Care and Outcomes Improvement Network (PR-COIN) site to collect data about their center's experience with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were thematically analyzed. Responses were received from the majority [19/21 (90%)] of PR-COIN sites. All respondents reported transitioning from in-person to primarily virtual patient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. All centers reported seeing both new consultations and follow-up patients over telemedicine. Most centers reported using both audio and video conferencing systems to conduct their telemedicine visits. The majority of respondents [13/19 (68%)] indicated that at least 50% of their site's providers consistently used pediatric Gait Arms Legs and Spine (pGALS) to perform active joint count assessments over telemedicine. Over half of the centers [11/19 (58%)] reported collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs), but the rate of reliably documenting clinical components varied. A few sites [7/19 (37%)] reported performing research-related activity during telemedicine visits. All centers thought that telemedicine visits were able to meet providers' needs and support their continued use when the pandemic ends. Benefits reported with telemedicine visits included convenience and continuity of care for families. Conversely, challenges included limited ability to perform physical exams and varying access to technology. Pediatric rheumatology providers were able to transition to conducting virtual visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVES AND BRIEF METHODS: Our primary objective is to evaluate the TtLIVE intervention compared to a usual care control group using an eight-center, pragmatic, parallel-group single-blind (outcome assessors) randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients are children and adults newly transitioning to HMV in Ontario, Canada. Our target sample size is 440 participants (220 each arm). Our co-primary outcomes are a number of emergency department (ED) visits in the 12 months after randomization and change in family caregiver (FC) reported Pearlin Mastery Scale score from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes also measured in the 12 months post randomization include healthcare utilization measured using a hybrid Ambulatory Home Care Record (AHCR-hybrid), FC burden using the Zarit Burden Interview, and health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D. In addition, we will conduct a cost-utility analysis over a 1-year time horizon and measure process outcomes including healthcare provider time using the Care Coordination Measurement Tool. We will use qualitative interviews in a subset of study participants to understand acceptability, barriers, and facilitators to the TtLIVE intervention. We will administer the Family Experiences with Care Coordination (FECC) to interview participants. We will use Poisson regression for a number of ED visits at 12 months. We will use linear regression for the Pearlin Mastery scale score at 12 months. We will adjust for the baseline score to estimate the effect of the intervention on the primary outcomes.

METHODS: The primary objective of this randomized controlled study is to assess the effectiveness of a mental imagery intervention on wearing face coverings, as a defined core COVID-19 preventative behaviour. Participants will consist of UK university students and university employees of any age. Participants will be randomized to complete an outcome imagery or a process imagery exercise, both exercises (i.e. a combined condition) or neither exercise (i.e. a control condition).

Interestingly, mouse models of neuroinflammation have higher IFITM levels and deficits in -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related markers that are similar to findings in schizophrenia, suggesting that a shared pathogenetic process might underlie diverse cortical pathology in the disorder. However, the cell types that overexpress IFITM messenger RNA (mRNA) in schizophrenia are unknown, and it is unclear whether higher IFITM mRNA levels are associated with lower GABA-related marker levels in the same schizophrenia subjects. METHODS We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization with film and grain counting analyses to quantify IFITM mRNA levels in prefrontal cortex area 9 of 57 schizophrenia and 57 healthy comparison subjects and in antipsychotic-exposed monkeys. RESULTS Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization film analysis revealed markedly elevated IFITM mRNA levels (+114% and +117%, respectively) in prefrontal gray matter in schizophrenia. Interestingly, emulsion-dipped, Nissl-stained sections from schizophrenia and comparison subjects revealed IFITM mRNA expression in pia mater and blood vessels. The IFITM grain density over blood vessels was 71% higher in schizophrenia. The IFITM mRNA levels were negatively correlated with GABA-related mRNAs in the same schizophrenia subjects. CONCLUSIONS The finding that schizophrenia subjects with higher IFITM mRNA levels in cortical blood vessels have greater disturbances in cortical GABA neurons suggests that these cell-type distinct pathological disturbances might be influenced by a shared upstream insult that involves immune activation.","output":"Elevated viral restriction factor levels in cortical blood vessels in schizophrenia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To eliminate the spread of a novel coronavirus breaking out in the end of 2019 (COVID-19), the Chinese government has implemented a nationwide lockdown policy after the Chinese lunar New Year of 2020, resulting in a sharp reduction in air pollutant emissions. To investigate the impact of the lockdown on aerosol chemistry, the number fraction, size distribution and formation process of oxalic acid (C2) containing particles and its precursors were studied using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) at the urban site of Liaocheng in the North China Plain (NCP). Our results showed that five air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO) decreased by 30.0-59.8% during the lockdown compared to those before the lockdown, while O3 increased by 63.9% during the lockdown mainly due to the inefficient titration effect of O3 via NO reduction. The increased O3 concentration can boost the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and further enhance the formation of secondary organic aerosols, thereby significantly enhancing the C2 particles and its precursors as observed during the lockdown. Before the lockdown, C2 particles were significantly originated from biomass burning emissions and their subsequent aqueous-phase oxidation. The hourly variation patterns and correlation analysis before the lockdown suggested that relative humidity (RH) and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) played a key role in the formation of C2 particles and the increased aerosol acidity can promote the conversion of precursors such as glyoxal (Gly) and methyglyoxal (mGly) into C2 particles in the aqueous phase. RH and ALWC decreased sharply but O3 concentration and solar radiation increased remarkably during the lockdown, the O3-dominated photochemical pathways played an important role in the formation of C2 particles in which aerosol acidity was ineffective.

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report on the development of an analytical framework to quantify the relative values of various longitudinal infection surveillance data collected in field sites undergoing mass drug administrations (MDAs) for calibrating three lymphatic filariasis (LF) models (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, and TRANSFIL), and for improving their predictions of the required durations of drug interventions to achieve parasite elimination in endemic populations. The relative information contribution of site-specific data collected at the time points proposed by the WHO monitoring framework was evaluated using model-data updating procedures, and via calculations of the Shannon information index and weighted variances from the probability distributions of the estimated timelines to parasite extinction made by each model. Results show that data-informed models provided more precise forecasts of elimination timelines in each site compared to model-only simulations. Data streams that included year 5 post-MDA microfilariae (mf) survey data, however, reduced each models uncertainty most compared to data streams containing only baseline and/or post-MDA 3 or longer-term mf survey data irrespective of MDA coverage, suggesting that data up to this monitoring point may be optimal for informing the present LF models. We show that the improvements observed in the predictive performance of the best data-informed models may be a function of temporal changes in inter-parameter interactions. Such best data-informed models may also produce more accurate predictions of the durations of drug interventions required to achieve parasite elimination. SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge of relative information contributions of model only versus data-informed models is valuable for improving the usefulness of LF model predictions in management decision making, learning system dynamics, and for supporting the design of parasite monitoring programmes. The present results further pinpoint the crucial need for longitudinal infection surveillance data for enhancing the precision and accuracy of model predictions of the intervention durations required to achieve parasite elimination in an endemic location.","output":"Quantifying the value of surveillance data for improving model predictions of lymphatic filariasis elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determining the number of nurses required for patients with coronavirus disease receiving mechanical ventilation and/or veno\\\\veno extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is important to provide quality care.

Although the implementation of effective measures resulted in a significant decrease of global mortality, much remains to be done. The burden of GE in the neonatal age is generally reduced in relation to some protective factors (breastfeeding, minimal exposure to water and contaminated food, passive maternal immunity). In newborns, the contribution of the various causative agents could differ from that of the other pediatric age groups, nevertheless Rotavirus and pathogenic strains of E. coli remain the main etiologies. The acquisition of the pathogen generally occurs through the contaminated birth canal or by the use of contaminated tools, objects, or hands of the caregivers. The clinical presentation may vary widely from an acute, self-limiting disease to life-threatening complicated infections. The assessment of the dehydration and its rapid correction represent the cornerstones of the management of any GE. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved to cases with systemic symptoms, severe dehydration, or in the presence of bloody diarrhea. While the occurrence of diarrhea in the neonatal age is mainly caused by acute gastrointestinal infections, differential diagnosis with several other diseases including forms of severe congenital disorders should be considered.","output":"Gastroenteritis and Intractable Diarrhea in Newborns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning in 2002, a small number of pig farms in western Canada began reporting 4-7-week-old pigs with bilateral hind-end paresis or paralysis.

This study aimed to examine transfer rates and identify risk factors associated with transfers among long-term nursing home residents before (2018-2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). Using the Michigan state Minimum Data Set data 2018-2020, we identified long-term residents as those who stayed in nursing homes for at least 100 days each year (N=39,693, 39,454, and 35,575, respectively). We defined a facility-to-facility transfer as a direct transfer between two nursing homes. We first examined the likelihood of transfer by year using logistic regression models, adjusting for residents age, sex, race, and marital status. We then examined two health statuses that could be associated with a transfer: activities of daily living (ADL) and cognitive impairment. Finally, we compared transfers that occurred before COVID-19 (2018-2019) and during COVID-19 (2020), adjusting for residents demographic characteristics and health statuses. After adjustment, age was the only factor associated with transfers for all three years (Age>=80: AOR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.54-0.69; AOR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.55-0.72; AOR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.63-0.80, respectively).

METHODS: Ambispective observational study with prospective recruitment was done from 1(st) January 2019 to 31(st) August 2020. Retrospective data included between 1(st) January 2009 and 31(st) December 2018. In the retrospective group surgical database of our department was searched and those with MBC diagnosis on post-operative histopathology recruited. In prospective group patients with MBC on core biopsy were followed and those operated were included. The patients followed up at our breast cancer clinic (BCC) and their demographic, clinical, pathological radiological and treatment details noted. RESULTS: Forty patients formed the study population. The mean age of the patents was 42 years. Ipsilateral axillary lymph node metastasis was present in 22.5%. The pathological median tumor size was 5.4 (range 2.1 to 22 cm). The most common differentiation was cartilaginous (35%) followed by squamous (32.5%). The most common mammographic grading was BIRADS 4 (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data system). Magnetic resonance imaging was T2 hyperintense with peripheral rim enhancement and restriction on DWI. The median overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 42 and 40 months, respectively. Fifteen patients (37.5%) had disease related mortality. A subgroup analysis revealed that, type of differentiation, histopathology and tumor size > 5cm affected both OS and DFS significantly. CONCLUSION: Metaplastic breast cancer in our setup presents in young patients with aggressive large tumors at a higher stage and diverse histopathology and with comparable overall and disease-free survival.

Group A and group O individuals showed a higher and lower risk, respectively, of becoming infected. No association was observed between ABO groups and mortality. To verify this association, we performed a retrospective study of two cohorts of patients with different demographic and clinical characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 854 regular blood donors were recruited for convalescent plasma donation after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection, and a group of 965 patients more severely affected who were transfused during hospitalisation were also included. We also investigated the potential role of the different risk factors on patient outcome and death. To eliminate the confounding effect of risk factors on mortality, a propensity score analysis was performed. RESULTS: Blood group A and blood group O COVID-19 blood donors showed a higher and lower risk, respectively, for acquiring COVID-19. In contrast, this association was not found in the group of patients transfused during hospitalisation, probably due to the great differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Regarding severity, age was one of the most significant risk factors. ABO blood groups were also seen to represent important risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality. Mortality risk in group A individuals was significantly higher than in group O individuals (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.22-2.51). DISCUSSION: The association between the ABO blood groups and the susceptibility to acquire COVID-19 infection was confirmed in the group of blood donors. ABO blood groups were also associated to COVID-19 severity and mortality in the group of patients transfused during hospitalisation.

It is comprised of two major structural domains: the RNA binding domain, which interacts with viral and host RNA, and the oligomerization domain which assembles to form the viral core. Here, we investigate the assembly state and RNA binding properties of the full-length nucleocapsid protein using native mass spectrometry. We find that dimers, and not monomers, of full-length N protein bind RNA, implying that dimers are the functional unit of ribonucleoprotein assembly. In addition, we find that N protein binds RNA with a preference for GGG motifs which are known to form short stem loop structures. Unexpectedly, we found that N undergoes autoproteolytic processing within the linker region, separating the two major domains. This process results in the formation of at least five proteoforms that we sequenced using electron transfer dissociation, higher-energy collision induced dissociation and corroborated by peptide mapping. The cleavage sites identified are in highly conserved regions leading us to consider the potential roles of the resulting proteoforms. We found that monomers of N-terminal proteoforms bind RNA with the same preference for GGG motifs and that the oligomeric state of a C-terminal proteoform (N156-419) is sensitive to pH. We used mass spectrometry to show that N binds to a monoclonal antibody raised against full-length N. No antibody interactions were detected for N proteoforms without C-terminal residues, therefore locating antigenic regions towards the C-terminus. We then tested interactions of the proteoforms with the immunophilin cyclophilin A, a key component in coronavirus replication. We found that N1-209 and N1-273 bind directly to cyclophilin A, an interaction that is abolished by the approved immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. We propose that the proteoforms generated via autoproteolysis evade antibody detection through removal of the antigenic C-terminus and facilitate interactions with structured RNA or cyclophilin thereby enabling the virus to proliferate.","output":"Autoproteolytic Products of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein are Primed for Antibody Evasion and Virus Proliferation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multidimensional data sources require identification of proper pattern to get knowledge Knowledge mining helps to design an information system in the process of decision making It helps to extract, structure, and organize knowledge from a database In this paper, an attempt is made in the direction of knowledge mining to analyse and visualize spreading pattern of COVID-19 and its impact on India economy The economy trend before and after COVID-19 is analyzed and forecasting is done for near future of Indian economy ? 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing All rights reserved","output":"Knowledge mining in spreading pattern of COVID-19 and its impact on India economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring antigen-specific T cell immunity relies on functional tests that require T cells and antigen presenting cells to be uncompromised.

With increasing burden, the novel coronavirus has posed a dire threat to public health, social interaction, and global economy. Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are moderately evolving which might have contributed to its genome variability, transmission, replication efficiency, and virulence in different regions of the world. RESULTS: The present study elucidated the mutational landscape in the SARS-CoV-2 genome among the African populace, which may have contributed to the virulence, spread, and pathogenicity observed in the region. A total of 3045 SARS-CoV-2 complete protein sequences with the reference viral sequence (EPI_ISL_402124) were mined and analyzed.

METHODS: We collected data for 35 children diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 who were admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 2020 to June 2020, and analyzed their epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, chest imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes. RESULTS: The children comprised 18 boys (51.4%) and 17 girls (48.6%) aged 6 months to 15 years. All patients had clear epidemiological history, with family clusters accounting for 28 cases (80.0%) and clear tracing of exposure to high epidemic areas in the remaining 7 cases (20.0%). Four (11.4%) patients were classified as asymptomatic, 17 (48.6%) as acute upper respiratory infection, and 14 (40.0%) as mild pneumonia, with no severe or critical cases. Clinical manifestations were mild, including fever in 18 (51.4%), cough in 14 (40.0%), and nausea and diarrhea in 7 (20.0%) patients. White blood cell count was mostly normal (26 cases, 74.3%) or decreased (7 cases, 20.0%); lymphocyte percentage was increased in 24 (68.7%); neutrophil percentage was decreased in 25 (71.4%); alanine aminotransferase was increased in 3 (8.6%); and serum potassium was decreased in 4 (11.4%). Time to negative viral nucleic acid testing was 2C42 days (mean: 14.0  9.4 days). Chest imaging examination revealed that 20 patients (57.1%) had different forms of lung inflammation. Treatment was mainly isolation and nutritional support. Eleven patients were treated with interferon atomization inhalation. No patients required oxygen therapy. All 35 children were cured and discharged. Length of hospital stay was 9C54 days (mean: 25.4  13.8 days). During regular follow\\\\up after discharge, 5 children showed positivity again in the viral nucleic acid test and were re\\\\hospitalized for observation and treatment.

Whether serum Sirt6 is correlated with aging and could be used as an aging biomarker is unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the age-related Sirt6 changes in the serum of human adults. METHODS Participants were divided into three groups according to age: 20-30 years (Young); 45-55 years (Middle-aged); and  70 years (Old). The Sirt6 and telomerase serum concentrations were determined by ELISA. The Sirt6 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression in vessels from amputated human lower limbs were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining. The relationships between variables were evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS The Sirt6 and telomerase serum levels reduced with an increase in age. A similar tendency was observed for Sirt6 and hTERT in the vessel. Serum levels of Sirt6 were higher in females compared with males. Pearson's regression analysis revealed that the Sirt6 serum level positively correlated with telomerase (r = 0.5743) and both were significantly negatively correlated with age (r = - 0.5830 and r = - 0.5993, respectively). CONCLUSIONS We reported a negative correlation between serum Sirt6 concentration and aging in human beings. Therefore, the Sirt6 serum level is a potential sex-specific aging marker.","output":"Age-related changes of human serum Sirtuin6 in adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), primarily type 1 DM. To our knowledge, only one study explored DKA readmission rates in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: Identify and analyze precipitating factors for DKA admission and readmission. DESIGN: Medical record review. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all patients aged 15 years and older admitted with DKA from 2018 to 2020. Descriptive factors and uni-and multivariate analyses are presented for associations with initial admission and readmission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationships between precipitating factors and initial admission and readmission. SAMPLE SIZE: 176 patients. RESULTS: Most of the patients had type 1 DM (n=157). The median (interquartile percentiles) for duration of DM was 6.0 (1.0-12.0) years. The mean (SD) HbA1C (%) was 11.8 (2.6). The factors that precipitated DKA were most commonly treatment nonadherence (55.1%), followed by infections (31.8%) and nonadherence to diet (25.6%). The most common symptoms were nausea and vomiting (87.5%), followed by abdominal pain (72.7%). During the study period, 32.4% of the sample were read-mitted with DKA. The median (interquartile range) duration between the first and second admission was 12 (4-25) weeks. In the multivariate analysis, increased odds of readmission for DKA were associated with type 1 DM and medication nonadherence (P=.038, P=.013, respectively). The severity of the initial DKA and the control of DM were not associated with the readmission rate. CONCLUSION: Treatment nonadherence is the leading precipitating factor of DKA in our region. Patient education and counseling play a major role in addressing this preventable complication and its medical and financial burden. We advocate more efforts dedicated toward patient education and logistic support. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective-single center.

In this review, we focused on COVID-19 coupled with the coagulopathy contributes to severe outcome inclusive of comorbidities such as venous thromboembolism, stroke, diabetes, lung, heart attack, AKI, and liver injury. Initially, the COVID-19 patient associated coagulation disorders show an elevated level of the D-dimer, fibrinogen, and less lymphocyte count such as lymphopenia. COVID-19 associated with the Kawasaki disease has acute vasculitis in childhood which further affects the vessels found all over the body. COVID-19 linked with the thrombotic microangiopathy triggers the multiple vasculitis along with the arterioles thrombosis, medium, large venous and arterial vessels mediates the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). SARS-Co-V-2 patients have reduced primary platelet production, increased destruction of the platelet, decreased circulating platelet leads to the condition of increased thrombocytopenia which contributes to the coagulation disorder. Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in the coagulation disorders via increased generation of the thrombin and stops fibrinolysis further leads to hypercoagulopathy. Along with that endothelial dysfunction activates the complement system pathways and contributes to the acute and chronic inflammation via cytokine storm with the production of the cytokines and chemokines, coagulation in different organs such as lung, brain, liver, heart, kidney and further leads to multi-organ failure.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation disorders in different organs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of the choice growth chart and threshold used to define small for gestational age (SGA) on the predictive value of SGA for placenta-related or unexplained antepartum stillbirth. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all women with a singleton pregnancy who gave birth > 24 week gestation in a single center (2000-2016). The exposure of interest was SGA, defined as birth weight < 10th or < 25th centile according to three fetal growth charts (Hadlock et al., Radiology 181:129-133, 1991; intergrowth-21st (IG21), WHO 2017, and a Canadian birthweight-based reference-Kramer et al., Pediatrics 108:E35, 2001). The outcome of interest was antepartum stillbirth due to placental dysfunction or unknown etiology. Cases of stillbirth attributed to other specific etiologies were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 49,458 women were included in the cohort. There were 103 (0.21%) cases of stillbirth due to placental dysfunction or unknown etiology. For cases in the early stillbirth cluster (&#8804; 30 weeks), the detection rate was high and was similar for the three ultrasound-based fetal growth charts of Hadlock, IG21, and WHO (range 83.3-87.0%). In contrast, the detection rate of SGA for cases in the late stillbirth cluster (> 30 weeks) was low, being highest for WHO and Hadlock (36.7% and 34.7%, respectively), and lowest for IG21 (18.4%). Using a threshold of the 25th centile increased the detection rate for stillbirth by approximately 15-20% compared with that achieved by the 10th centile cutoff.

As governments have pushed physical and social distancing as protective strategies, this study explores the extent to which this approach is relevant for Syrian refugees living in Lebanon and Turkey. METHODS: This qualitative study draws on 11 interviews with refugee experts and development practitioners (3) and Syrian refugee families (4 from Turkey, 4 from Lebanon) during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a review of recent literature. In addition, it draws on 71 semi-structured interviews with staff at NGOs supporting refugees (48 from Turkey, 23 from Lebanon) collected in 2018. Qualitative data analysis software ATLAS.ti 8 was used to perform content-based thematic analysis using both deductive and inductive coding. FINDINGS: The study finds that distancingphysically and sociallycan be ineffective as a disease protection strategy in Syrian refugee communities. This is influenced by six major interconnected dimensions of refugee vulnerabilitypolitical, material, spatial, physiological, psychological and socioculturalwhich collectively form an interdisciplinary framework to guide more relevant COVID-19 interventions in refugee communities. The inability to distance is not necessarily rooted in lack of knowledge. Rather, when the inside conditions of living are crowded and unhygienic, but also include cultural expectations of familial care, and the outside conditions of survival-necessitated work are perpetuated through precarious political protections, distancing becomes impractical in application, despite the sense of internalized responsibility to keep one another safe. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that more relevant COVID-19 interventions and protection measures must consider the non-physiological manifestations of disease across multiple dimensions of vulnerability to mitigate decreased distancing abilities in settings of refugee life.","output":"Exploring the impact of multidimensional refugee vulnerability on distancing as a protective measure against COVID-19: The case of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) arrived in the United Kingdom (UK) in February 2020, placing an unprecedented burden on the National Health Service (NHS) Literature from past epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the importance of using a gender lens when considering policy, experiences, and impacts of the disease Researchers are increasingly examining the experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs), yet there is a dearth of research considering how gender shapes HCWs&rsquo;personal experiences As the majority of HCWs in the UK and worldwide are women, research that investigates gender and focuses on women&rsquo;s experiences is urgently needed We conducted an analysis of 41 qualitative interviews with HCWs in the British NHS during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Spring of 2020 Our findings demonstrate that gender is significant when understanding the experiences of HCWs during COVID-19 as it illuminates ingrained inequalities and asymmetrical power relations, gendered organizational structures and norms, and individual gendered bodies that interact to shape experiences of healthcare workers These findings point to important steps to improve gender equality, the wellbeing of healthcare workers, and the overall strength of the NHS","output":"Gender Matters: A Gender Analysis of Healthcare Workers Experiences during the First COVID-19 Pandemic Peak in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 outbreak, a recurrent subject in scientific literature has been brought back into discussion: whether surgical masks provide a sufficient protection against airborne SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Meanwhile, the number of patients receiving vital health intervention is particularly low in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of hospital attributes on patient preference for outpatients in the Wolaita area in September 2020. METHODS: A discrete choice experimental study was applied to determine the effect of hospital attributes on patient preference with a sample size of 1077. The experimental survey was conducted among outpatient attendants selected through a systematic random sampling approach. Six key attributes (competence of healthcare providers; availability of medical equipment and supplies; cost of service; wait time; distance; and hospital reputation) deduced from various hospital attributes were used to elicit the patient preferences. The data was collected from participants through the Open Data Kit application. A random effect probit model with marginal willingness to pay measure and partially log-likelihood analysis was applied to extract important attributes. We used STATA version 15 software for analysis, and the fitness of the model was verified by the calculated p-value for the Wald chi-square with a cut-point value of 0.05. RESULT: One thousand forty-five patients who received outpatient care participated in the study. The random effect probit results have shown that all hospital attributes included in the study were significantly valued by patients while choosing the hospital (p-value < 0.001). Meanwhile, based on marginal willingness to pay and partial log-likelihood analysis, the competence of health care providers was identified as the most important attribute followed by the availability of medical equipment and supplies in hospitals. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The results suggested that the quality of health care providers and availability of medical equipment and supply in hospitals would be primary interventional points for improving the patient preference of hospitals. Assessment, education, and training are recommended for enhancing the quality of health care providers. And stock balance checks, inspections, and accreditation are believed to be valuable for improving the availability of equipment and supply in hospitals.

To cope with the resulting crowding situation, redirecting patients to new healthcare services was considered a viable solution which would spread demand more evenly across available healthcare delivery points and render care more efficient. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of opening new on-demand care services based on variations in patient flow at a large hospital emergency department. METHODS: We performed a before-and-after study investigating the use of unscheduled care services in the Aube region in eastern France, that focused on ED attendance at Troyes Hospital. A hierarchical clustering based on co-occurrence of diagnoses was applied which divided the population into different multimorbidity profiles. Temporal trends of the resultant clusters were also studied empirically and using regression models. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to adjust the periodic effect for appropriate confounders and therefore confirm its presence. RESULTS: In total, 120,722 visits to the ED were recorded over a 24-month period (2018C2019) and 16 clusters were identified, accounting for 94.76% of all visits. There was a decrease of 56.77 visits per week in seven specific clusters and an increase of use of unscheduled health care services by 328.12 visits per week.

Specifically, new diagnostics using engineered RNAs are able to detect both pathogens and chemicals while generating an easily detectable fluorescent signal as an indicator. New classes of vaccines and therapeutics are also using engineered RNAs to target a wide range of genetic and pathogenic diseases. Here, we discuss the recent breakthroughs in RNA engineering enabling these innovations and examine how advances in RNA design promise to accelerate the impact of engineered RNA systems. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Volume 12 is June 2021.

It is suggested that COVID-19 associated PE represents in situ immunothrombosis rather than venous thromboembolism, although the origin of thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we assessed the clinical and computed tomography (CT) characteristics of PE in 23 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and compared these to those of 100 consecutive control patients diagnosed with acute PE before the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, RV/LV diameter ratio, pulmonary artery trunk diameter and total thrombus load (according to Qanadli) were measured and compared. RESULTS: We observed that all thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients were found to be in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19. Also, the thrombus load was lower in COVID-19 patients (Qanadli score ?8%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] ?16 to ?0.36%) as was the prevalence of the most proximal PE in the main/lobar pulmonary artery (17% versus 47%; ?30%, 95%CI ?44% to ?8.2). Moreover, the mean RV/LV ratio (mean difference ?0.23, 95%CI ?0.39 to ?0.07) and the prevalence of RV/LV ratio >1.0 (prevalence difference ?23%, 95%CI ?41 to ?0.86%) were lower in the COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings therefore suggest that the phenotype of COVID-19 associated PE indeed differs from PE in patients without COVID-19, fuelling the discussion on its pathophysiology.","output":"Clinical and computed tomography characteristics of COVID-19 associated acute pulmonary embolism: A different phenotype of thrombotic disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense pressure on the National Health Service (NHS) and all healthcare professionals, not only physically but also mentally and the need to fully develop and implement a strategy to protect the mental health of healthcare professionals has never been more urgent. Research has demonstrated that staff can be supported by strengthening teams and offering frequent well-being support. AIMS: To assess the feedback from delivery of a strategy to provide psychological well-being support to NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this 'Support for Teams' initiative made a positive impact on staff and in what way. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used to gain quantitative and qualitative feedback from staff. Feedback was collected from two groups: Well-being Leads and clinicians providing support and resources to Well-being Leads. Feedback was collected via online forms. RESULTS: Collectively, feedback responses were received from 70 staff members. The majority of staff members felt supported and benefitted from the provisions provided. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation showed that our healthcare system must continue to proactively implement and adapt staff support strategies to protect the mental well-being of healthcare professionals, both in the context of future health crises and in everyday practice.

We hypothesized that natural language processing (NLP) models could quantify changes in detection of acute abdominal pathology (acute appendicitis (AA), acute diverticulitis (AD), or bowel obstruction (BO)) on CT reports. METHODS: This retrospective study included 22,182 radiology reports from CT abdomen/pelvis studies performed at an urban ED between January 1, 2018 to August 14, 2020. Using a subset of 2448 manually annotated reports, we trained random forest NLP models to classify the presence of AA, AD, and BO in report impressions. Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross validation. The NLP classifiers were then applied to all reports. RESULTS: The NLP classifiers for AA, AD, and BO demonstrated cross-validation classification accuracies between 0.97 and 0.99 and F1-scores between 0.86 and 0.91. When applied to all CT reports, the estimated numbers of AA, AD, and BO cases decreased 43-57% in April 2020 (first regional peak of COVID-19 cases) compared to 2018-2019. However, the number of abdominal pathologies detected rebounded in May-July 2020, with increases above historical averages for AD. The proportions of CT studies with these pathologies did not significantly increase during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Dramatic decreases in numbers of acute abdominal pathologies detected by ED CT studies were observed early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, though these numbers rapidly rebounded. The proportions of CT cases with these pathologies did not increase, which suggests patients deferred care during the first pandemic peak. NLP can help automatically track findings in ED radiology reporting.","output":"Automated tracking of emergency department abdominal CT findings during the COVID-19 pandemic using natural language processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood platelets are formed by fragmentation of long membrane extensions from bone marrow megakaryocytes in the blood flow. Using lattice-Boltzmann/immersed boundary simulations we propose a biological Rayleigh-Plateau instability as the biophysical mechanism behind this fragmentation process. This instability is akin to the surface tension-induced breakup of a liquid jet but is driven by active cortical processes including actomyosin contractility and microtubule sliding. Our fully three-dimensional simulations highlight the crucial role of actomyosin contractility, which is required to trigger the instability, and illustrate how the wavelength of the instability determines the size of the final platelets. The elasto-hydrodynamic origin of the fragmentation explains the strong acceleration of platelet biogenesis in the presence of an external flow, which we observe in agreement with experiments. Our simulations then allow us to disentangle the influence of specific flow conditions: While a homogeneous flow with uniform velocity leads to the strongest acceleration, a shear flow with a linear velocity gradient can cause fusion events of two developing platelet-sized swellings during fragmentation. A fusion event may lead to the release of larger structures which are observable as preplatelets in experiments. Together, our findings strongly indicate a mainly physical origin of fragmentation and regulation of platelet size in flow-accelerated platelet biogenesis.","output":"Flow-accelerated platelet biogenesis is due to an elasto-hydrodynamic instability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Stainless-steel crowns (SSCs) are recommended for restorative treatment of young teeth severely affected by caries, fractures or dental developmental disorders ( However, despite recommendations and clinical evidence, SSCs are not widely used by general dentists, who favour extraction and more conventional restorations. The present study aimed to investigate the views of and use of SSCs among Norwegian and Finnish dentists. METHODS: The present study was a cross-sectional survey among Norwegian and Finnish dentists. An electronic questionnaire was sent to Norwegian and Finnish dentists asking whether they used SSCs and on which indications. In addition, the questionnaire assessed reasons for non-use and dentists perceptions regarding advantages and challenges in the use of SSCs, as well as the need for additional training. Distributions of background characteristics, use of and views on SSCs were calculated, and statistical significance of the associations between respondents background and their answers were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 574 Norwegian and 765 Finnish respondents, only 12.0% and 12.9% reported to use SSCs, respectively. The most frequently reported barrier reported by those who did not use SSCs was lack of practical training. The most frequent challenge reported by those using SSCs was difficulties in crown adjustment followed by aesthetic issues, and the most frequently reported advantage was that SSCs maintain the function and occlusion. The majority of respondents reported a need for more information and practical training in the use of SSCs, with hands-on course as their most frequently preferred education type. CONCLUSION: Although the value of SSCs for restoring young molars is recognized by Norwegian and Finnish dentists, SSCs are rarely used by general dentists.

The day before the visit patients are contacted by telephone for the Covid-19 risk triage. In the presence of symptoms the visit is postponed. In the presence of other risk factors a IgG/IgM Rapid Test for Covid-19 is performed on admission to the clinic. In the presence of fever, if an extraordinary rapid test cannot be performed, the visit must be postponed. Rapid test positive patients cannot be visited: they are placed in solitary confinement at their home waiting for a nasopharyngeal swab for Covid-19.

However, the development of novel but still conventional systemic antimicrobial agents, having only a single mode or site of action, will not alleviate the situation because it is probably only a matter of time until any such agents will also become ineffective. To continue to produce new agents based on this notion is unacceptable, and there is an increasing need for alternative approaches to the problem. By contrast, light-activated molecules called photoantimicrobials act locally via the in-situ production of highly reactive oxygen species, which simultaneously attack various biomolecular sites in the pathogenic target and therefore offer both multiple and variable sites of action. This non-specificity at the target circumvents conventional mechanisms of resistance and inhibits the development of resistance to the agents themselves. Photoantimicrobial therapy is safe and easy to implement and, unlike conventional agents, the activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials covers bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. However, clinical trials of these new, truly broad-spectrum, and minimally toxic agents have been few, and the funding for research and development is almost non-existent. Photoantimicrobials constitute one of the few ways forward through the morass of drug-resistant infectious disease and should be fully explored.

The COVID-19 incidence in the population of rare metabolic patients was lower than that of the general European population (72.9  100,000 vs. 117  100,000). However, patients experienced extensive disruption of care, with the majority of appointments and treatments cancelled, reduced, or postponed. Almost all HCPs (90%) were able to substitute face-to-face visits with telemedicine, about half of patients facing treatment changes switched from hospital to home therapy, and a quarter reported difficulties in getting their medicines. During the first weeks of emergency, when patients and families lacked relevant information, most HCPs contacted their patients to provide them with support and information. Since IMD patients require constant follow-up and treatment adjustments to control their disease and avoid degradation of their condition, the results of our surveys are relevant for national health systems in order to ensure appropriate care for IMD patients. They highlight strong links in an interconnected community of HCPs and PO, who are able to work quickly and effectively together to support and protect fragile persons during crisis.

The market for these devices has since expanded considerably. This evaluation of IRT performance may have significant implications for febrility screening worldwide. AIM: Perform controlled nonhuman trials of IRT devices to identify and quantify deviations in the human temperature range. APPROACH: We compared IRT readings of a temperature-controlled non-human subject with one FDA-cleared IRT and one FDA-cleared handheld NCIT. In individual trials for each device, the subject was measured between 35C and 40C at 0.25C increments. RESULTS: The IRT device measurements were consistently normalized around the human mean (a??37  C). Temperatures were decremented as they approached the febrile range, and systematically reported as normal across all seven devices. This effect does not appear to be explained by a fixed offset or any known approach to estimating body temperature, or by random error. CONCLUSION: The IRTs in this study generated human temperature measurements that were systematically biased to the mean human temperature. Given that these devices are utilized for sentinel detection of possible infectious disease transmission, and are now globally employed, the implications for reduced detection of febrility are a widespread false sense of security.

The latter protein is an orthologue of mammalian CIP29. The nuclear export mechanism for viral mRNAs has not been described in plants. To understand this process, we investigated the export of mRNAs of the pararetrovirus CaMV in Arabidopsis and demonstrated that it is inhibited in plants deficient in ALY, MOS11 and/or TEX1. Deficiency for these factors renders plants partially resistant to CaMV infection. Two CaMV proteins, the coat protein P4 and reverse transcriptase P5, are important for nuclear export.

METHODS: We searched the Web of Science database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) of Pneumonia from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2015. The only document types we studied were original articles and reviews, analyzing descriptive indicators by five-year periods and the scientific production by country, adjusting for population, economic, and research-related parameters. RESULTS: A total of 22,694 references were retrieved. The number of publications increased steadily over time, from 981 publications in 2001 to 1977 in 2015 (R(2) = 0.956). The most productive country was the USA (38.49%), followed by the UK (7.18%) and Japan (5.46%). Research production from China increased by more than 1000%. By geographical area, North America (42.08%) and Europe (40.79%) were most dominant. Scientific production in low- and middle-income countries more than tripled, although their overall contribution to the field remained limited (< 15%). Overall, 18.8% of papers were the result of an international collaboration, although this proportion was much higher in sub-Saharan Africa (46.08%) and South Asia (23.43%). According to the specific MeSH terms used, articles focused mainly on Pneumonia, Bacterial (19.99%), followed by Pneumonia, Pneumococcal (7.02%) and Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated (6.79%). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia research increased steadily over the 15-year study period, with Europe and North America leading scientific production. About a fifth of all papers reflected international collaborations, and these were most evident in papers from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

METHODS: This study adopted a qualitative design. A logical framework based on the theoretical underpinning of public health functions of the government in the prevention and control of a major public health crisis was constructed. We compared the public health functions of the Chinese government and the effectiveness of these functions for COVID-19. RESULTS: The defects of the public health functions of the Chinese government in the prevention and control of COVID-19 include a lack of crisis prediction, initiative and timeliness in crisis early warning functions; weak crisis security functions; and a lack of functions for handling the aftermath. The Chinese government should improve its crisis early warning functions, strengthen its crisis security functions, and establish functions for handling the aftermath. CONCLUSION: The defects of the public health functions of the Chinese government in the prevention and control of COVID-19 can provide referential value for other countries. Especially, by continuously improving the construction of standard pandemic early warning procedures and regulations, optimizing the pandemic treatment system, and strengthening the fairness and accessibility of medical services, countries with severe pandemic situations may be able to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on public health more efficiently.","output":"Analysis of the Public Health Functions of the Chinese Government in the Prevention and Control of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our lives in many ways, including how we choose to spend our time and deal with unprecedented circumstances.

Further, pulmonary complication rates have risen during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This study explored the potential cost-effectiveness of administering preoperative chlorhexidine mouthwash versus no-mouthwash at reducing postoperative pneumonia among abdominal surgery patients. METHODS: A decision analytic model taking the South African healthcare provider perspective was constructed to compare costs and benefits of mouthwash versus no-mouthwash-surgery at 30 days after abdominal surgery. We assumed two scenarios: (i) the absence of COVID-19; (ii) the presence of COVID-19. Input parameters were collected from published literature including prospective cohort studies and expert opinion. Effectiveness was measured as proportion of pneumonia patients. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of parameter uncertainties. The results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were presented using cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: In the absence of COVID-19, mouthwash had lower average costs compared to no-mouthwash-surgery, $3,675 (R 63,770) versus $3,958 (R 68,683), and lower proportion of pneumonia patients, 0.029 versus 0.042 (dominance of mouthwash intervention). In the presence of COVID-19, the increase in pneumonia rate due to COVID-19, made mouthwash more dominant as it was more beneficial to reduce pneumonia patients through administering mouthwash. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves shown that mouthwash surgery is likely to be cost-effective between $0 (R0) and $15,000 (R 260,220) willingness to pay thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Both the absence and presence of SARS-CoV-2, mouthwash is likely to be cost saving intervention for reducing pneumonia after abdominal surgery. However, the available evidence for the effectiveness of mouthwash was extrapolated from cardiac surgery; there is now an urgent need for a robust clinical trial on the intervention on non-cardiac surgery.","output":"Preliminary model assessing the cost-effectiveness of preoperative chlorhexidine mouthwash at reducing postoperative pneumonia among abdominal surgery patients in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A recombinant vaccinia virus producing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was used to express foreign genes in eukaryotic cells. Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the lacZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic mRNAs.","output":"Enhancement of the vaccinia virus/phage T7 RNA polymerase expression system using encephalomyocarditis virus 5'-untranslated region sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early clinical experience with COVID-19 vaccination suggests that approved COVID-19 vaccines cause a notably higher incidence of axillary lymphadenopathy on breast MRI compared with other vaccines. Guidelines are needed to appropriately manage unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy detected by MRI in the era of COVID-19 vaccination and to avoid biopsies of benign reactive nodes. This article examines the available data on vaccine-related lymphadenopathy and offers a basic strategy for assessing axillary lymphadenopathy on MRI and guiding management. At our institution, we are adding questions regarding the date(s) and laterality of administration of COVID-19 vaccination to the intake form given to patients before all breast imaging examinations. We consider MRI-detected isolated unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to the vaccination arm to most likely be related to the COVID-19 vaccine if it develops within 4 weeks of administration of either dose. In these cases, we assess the lymphadenopathy as BI-RADS 3 and recommend that follow-up ultrasound be performed within 6-8 weeks after administration of the second dose. These guidelines may be refined as we acquire further data on the expected time course of axillary lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination.

One such protein is SARS-CoV nsp1, which is processed from the N-terminus of both pp1a and pp1ab. The mature SARS-CoV protein is present in cells several hours post-infection and co-localizes to the viral replication complex, but its function in the viral life cycle remains unknown. Furthermore, nsp1 sequences are highly divergent across the CoV family, and it has been suggested that this is due to nsp1 possessing a function specific to viral interactions with its host cell or acting as a host specific virulence factor. In order to initiate structural and biophysical studies of SARS-CoV nsp1, a recombinant expression system and a purification protocol have been developed, yielding milligram quantities of highly purified SARS-CoV nsp1.

For spaces regularly, or consistently, occupied by the same group of people, e.g. an open-plan office or a school classroom, we establish protocols to assess the absolute risk of airborne infection of this regular attendance at work or school. We present a methodology to easily calculate the expected number of secondary infections arising from a regular attendee becoming infectious and remaining pre/asymptomatic within these spaces. We demonstrate our model by calculating risks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored data recorded within a small naturally ventilated office. In addition, by inferring ventilation rates from monitored CO2, we show that estimates of airborne infection can be accurately reconstructed, thereby offering scope for more informed retrospective modelling should outbreaks occur in spaces where CO2 is monitored. Well-ventilated spaces appear unlikely to contribute significantly to airborne infection. However, even moderate changes to the conditions within the office, or new variants of the disease, typically result in more troubling predictions.","output":"Predictive and retrospective modelling of airborne infection risk using monitored carbon dioxide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus was declared a pandemic on March 10, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has massively burdened healthcare systems with cases exponentially rising throughout the United States and the rest of the world. Since implementing precautions to reduce the spread of this disease, emergency departments have seen a decrease in the number of traumas. By evaluating the differences in the number of trauma admissions in different subgroups of patients, we can assess where to target messaging to increase compliance with these precautions. In this study, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on trauma admissions. Methodology This was a retrospective review of the trauma database at our institution, a level 2 trauma center in Southern California, to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of traumas. The inclusion criteria were patients activated as traumas, regardless of age. Patients were excluded from the study if they did not have complete information in the trauma database. Data were stratified by date into two groups: (a) COVID period (January to April 2020) and (b) pre-COVID period (January to April 2019). The primary endpoint of this study was to determine whether there was a significant change in the number of patients presenting as trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. This difference was analyzed and divided into subgroups based on age and trauma type. Results In our review, an average of 279 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April in 2019, and an average of 222 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April 2020 (p = 0.049). We found a significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with the chief complaint of fall and vehicular accident, but a nonsignificant difference in patients presenting as assaults or pedestrian accidents. There was also a significant decrease in the number of traumas in the 18-39 and 65+ age groups and a nonsignificant decrease in the 40-64 age group. It was also noted that the number of trauma admissions in May 2020 increased to 253 compared to 269 in 2019. This increase was most notable in the 18-39 and 40-64 age groups. Discussion As seen in the data, the most notable year-over-year difference was seen in March and April. In California specifically, a stay-at-home order was set in place in March, which was in conjunction with the WHO's declaration of a pandemic. An interesting finding was the significant decrease in patients with traumas in the age groups of 18-39 and 65+ from 2019 to 2020. There was a smaller, nonsignificant decrease in patients aged 40-64. This would be a good group to target with future messaging to increase compliance with health advisories. There was also a notable increase in the number of traumas in May 2020, signaling an end to the cooperation of the majority of people, also indicating that further measures needed to be enacted in all groups. Conclusions COVID-19 has disrupted social structures worldwide. As the pandemic continued, even the observers of stay-at-home and social distancing measures, the 18-39 age group, became fatigued with the guidelines and ventured out into the warming weather and summer activities. This difference in trauma admission due to COVID-19 between subsequent years can highlight the behavioral changes in our patient population and can be further extrapolated to target additional messaging to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Using the Decrease in Trauma Admissions During the COVID-19 Pandemic to Evaluate Compliance With Stay-at-Home and Social Distancing Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be life-threatening, and specific antiviral drugs are currently not available. However, first studies indicated that convalescent plasma treatment might improve the clinical outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment in eight COVID-19 patients. All the patients were critically ill, and seven of them were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive when starting treatment. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the S1 protein (Euroimmun), and the neutralizing titers were determined with a cell-culture-based neutralization assay. Plasma treatment started between 4 and 23 days after the onset of symptoms. The patients were usually treated by three plasma units, each containing 200-280 ml, which was applied at day 1, 3, and 5. RESULTS: Donor sera had on average lower IgG antibody ratios and neutralizing titers than the COVID-19 patients before the onset of treatment (median ratio of 5.8 and neutralizing titer of 1:320 vs. 7.5 and 1:640, respectively). Nevertheless, we observed an increase of antibody ratios in seven and of neutralizing titers in five patients after treatment; which did, however, not correlate with patient survival. Plasma treatment was effective in three patients, but five deceased despite treatment. Patients who deceased had a later treatment onset than survivors and finally died from multiple organ failure.

Immigration waves from countries in Africa and in East Europe may have changed the local landscape of women diagnosed with HIV-1. Here, we aimed to assess viral and demographic characteristics of HIV-1-positive women identified in Israel between 2010 and 2018. METHODS All > 16 year-old, HIV-1-infected women, diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018, (n = 763) registered in the National HIV reference laboratory were included in this cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the database. Viral subtypes and transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) were determined in 337 (44.2%) randomly selected samples collected from treatment-naive women. RESULTS Median age at diagnosis was 38 years. Most (73.3%) women were immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) (41.2%, 314) or sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (32.2%, 246) and carried subtype A (79.7%) or C (90.3%), respectively. Only 11.4% (87) were Israeli-born women. Over the years, the prevalence of women from SSA decreased while that of women from FSU increased significantly (p < 0.001). The median CD4+ cell count was 263 cells/mm3, and higher (391 cells/mm3) in Israeli-born women. TDRM were identified in 10.4% of the tested samples; 1.8, 3 and 7.1% had protease inhibitors (PI), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) TDRM, respectively. The prevalence of women with NNRTI TDRM significantly increased from 4.9% in 2010-2012 to 13.3% in 2016-2018. Israeli-born women had the highest prevalence (16.3%) of NNRTI TDRM (p = 0.014). NRTI A62 (5.6%), NNRTI E138 and K103 (5.6 and 4.2%, respectively) were the most prominent mutated sites. CONCLUSIONS Most HIV-1-positive women diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018 were immigrants, with the relative ratio of FSU immigrants increasing in recent years. The high proportion of women diagnosed with resistance mutations, particularly, the yearly increase in the frequency of NNRTI mutations, support the national policy of resistance testing at baseline.","output":"HIV-1 infection among women in Israel, 2010-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures are likely to have a marked effect on mental health. It is important to use longitudinal data to improve inferences. AIMS: To quantify the prevalence of depression, anxiety and mental well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, to identify groups at risk of depression and/or anxiety during the pandemic. METHOD: Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) index generation (n = 2850, mean age 28 years) and parent generation (n = 3720, mean age 59 years), and Generation Scotland (n = 4233, mean age 59 years). Depression was measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire in ALSPAC and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in Generation Scotland. Anxiety and mental well-being were measured with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 and the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. RESULTS: Depression during the pandemic was similar to pre-pandemic levels in the ALSPAC index generation, but those experiencing anxiety had almost doubled, at 24% (95% CI 23C26%) compared with a pre-pandemic level of 13% (95% CI 12C14%). In both studies, anxiety and depression during the pandemic was greater in younger members, women, those with pre-existing mental/physical health conditions and individuals in socioeconomic adversity, even when controlling for pre-pandemic anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for increased anxiety in young people that is coincident with the pandemic.

With regard to the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (? = 0.855; P < 0.001), while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (? = 0.729 and ? = -0.456; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: As a practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool in facing COVID-19-related mental distress.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and mental distress in multiple sclerosis: implications for clinical management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this scoping review is to provide a synthesis of the available literature on implementation science in critical care settings. Specifically, we aimed to identify the evidence-based practices selected for implementation, the frequency and type of implementation strategies used to foster change, and the process and clinical outcomes associated with implementation. DATA SOURCES: A librarian-assisted search was performed using three electronic databases. STUDY SELECTION: Articles that reported outcomes aimed at disseminating, implementing, or sustaining an evidence-based intervention or practice, used established implementation strategies, and were conducted in a critical care unit were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full text of articles to determine eligibility. Data extraction was performed using customized fields established a priori within a systematic review software system. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 1,707 citations, 82 met eligibility criteria. Studies included prospective research investigations, quality improvement projects, and implementation science trials. The most common practices investigated were use of a ventilator-associated pneumonia bundle, nutritional support protocols, and the Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium Monitoring/Management, and Early Exercise/Mobility bundle. A variety of implementation strategies were used to facilitate evidence adoption, most commonly educational meetings, auditing and feedback, developing tools, and use of local opinion leaders. The majority of studies (76/82, 93%) reported using more than one implementation strategy. Few studies specifically used implementation science designs and frameworks to systematically evaluate both implementation and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The field of critical care has experienced slow but steady gains in the number of investigations specifically guided by implementation science. However, given the exponential growth of evidence-based practices and guidelines in this same period, much work remains to critically evaluate the most effective mechanisms to integrate and sustain these practices across diverse critical care settings and teams.","output":"A Scoping Review of Implementation Science in Adult Critical Care Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Information pertaining to the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa remains sparse. In Nigeria, it is limited to few isolated reports and case series confined to the early phase of the outbreak. The objective of this study is to describe the presenting characteristics, co-morbidities and outcomes of Nigerian patients managed over a 3-month period in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving the total population of patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria from March 31 to June 30, 2020. Data was collected using a review of patients' records. Analysis was by IBM SPSS version 25.0. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients with mean age (SD) 50.7 20.1 years were managed. One hundred and five (60.7%) were males and the commonest age group was 20-39 years (34.7%). The commonest presenting symptoms were fever, cough and malaise found in 103 (71.5%), 101 (70.1%) and 63 (43.8%) patients respectively. Twenty-five (14.5%) patients had severe disease; 60 (34.7%) had underlying medical conditions mostly hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Outcome analyses showed 117 (67.6%) discharges, 45 (26.0%) deaths, 10 (5.8%) discharges against medical advice, and 1 (0.6%) transfer to another facility.

Exercise has been shown to improve health generally, but it is uncertain whether exercise may be effective in reducing the occurrence, severity, and duration of ARIs. This is an update of our review published in 2015. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise for altering the occurrence, severity, or duration of acute respiratory infections. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2020, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to March week 1, 2020), Embase (1974 to 05 March 2020), CINAHL (1981 to 05 March 2020), LILACS (1982 to 05 March 2020), SPORTDiscus (1985 to 05 March 2020), PEDro (searched 05 March 2020), OTseeker (searched 05 March 2020), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 05 March 2020). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (method of allocation that is not truly random, e.g. based on date of birth, medical record number) of exercise for ARIs in the general population. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials using a standard form. One review author entered data, which a second review author checked. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. There were sufficient differences in the populations trialed and in the nature of the interventions to use the random-effects model (which makes fewer assumptions than the fixed-effect model) in the analysis. MAIN RESULTS We included three new trials for this update (473 participants) for a total of 14 trials involving 1377 adults, published between 1990 and 2018. Nine trials were conducted in the USA, and one each in Brazil, Canada, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey. Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 419 participants, aged from 18 to 85 years. The proportion of female participants ranged from 52% to 100%. Follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 36 weeks (median = 12 weeks). Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (walking, bicycling, treadmill, or a combination) was evaluated in 11 trials, and was most commonly prescribed at least three times a week for 30 to 45 minutes. There was no difference between exercise and no exercise in the number of ARI episodes per person per year (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.30; 4 trials; 514 participants; low-certainty evidence); proportion of participants who experienced at least one ARI over the study period (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.08; 5 trials; 520 participants; low-certainty evidence); and the number of symptom days per episode of illness (mean difference (MD) -0.44 day, 95% CI -2.33 to 1.46; 6 trials; 557 participants; low-certainty evidence). Exercise reduced the severity of ARI symptoms measured on the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) (MD -103.57, 95% CI -198.28 to -8.87; 2 trials; 373 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and the number of symptom days during follow-up period (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.50 to -0.98; 4 trials; 483 participants; low-certainty evidence). Excercise did not have a significant effect on laboratory parameters (blood lymphocytes, salivary secretory immunoglobulin, and neutrophils), quality of life outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and exercise-related injuries. There was no difference in participant dropout between the intervention and control groups. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low, downgraded mainly due to limitations in study design and implementation, imprecision, and inconsistency. Seven trials were funded by public agencies; five trials did not report funding; and two trials were funded by private companies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Exercise did not reduce the number of ARI episodes, proportion of participants experiencing at least one ARI during the study, or the number of symptom days per episode of illness. However, exercise reduced the severity of ARI symptoms (two studies) and the number of symptom days during the study follow-up period (four studies). Small study size, risk of bias, and heterogeneity in the populations studied contributed to the uncertainty of the findings. Larger trials that are designed to avoid risk of bias associated with participant selection, blinding of outcomes assessors, and with adequate reporting of all outcomes proposed for measurement in trials, would help to provide more robust evidence.","output":"Exercise versus no exercise for the occurrence, severity, and duration of acute respiratory infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is associated with myocardial injury caused by ischemia, inflammation, or myocarditis. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the noninvasive reference standard for cardiac function, structure, and tissue composition. CMR is a potentially valuable diagnostic tool in patients with COVID-19 presenting with myocardial injury and evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Although COVID-19Crelated myocarditis is likely infrequent, COVID-19Crelated cardiovascular histopathology findings have been reported in up to 48% of patients, raising the concern for long-term myocardial injury. Studies to date report CMR abnormalities in 26% to 60% of hospitalized patients who have recovered from COVID-19, including functional impairment, myocardial tissue abnormalities, late gadolinium enhancement, or pericardial abnormalities. In athletes postCCOVID-19, CMR has detected myocarditis-like abnormalities. In children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome may occur 2 to 6 weeks after infection; associated myocarditis and coronary artery aneurysms are evaluable by CMR. At this time, our understanding of COVID-19Crelated cardiovascular involvement is incomplete, and multiple studies are planned to evaluate patients with COVID-19 using CMR. In this review, we summarize existing studies of CMR for patients with COVID-19 and present ongoing research.

While amplicon methods are fast, low-cost, and have curated reference databases, they can suffer from amplification bias and are limited in genomic scope. In contrast, shotgun metagenomic methods sample more genomic regions with fewer sequence acquisition biases, but are much more expensive (even with moderate sequencing depth) and computationally challenging. Here, we develop a set of 16S rRNA sequence capture baits that offer a potential middle ground with the advantages from both approaches for investigating microbial communities. These baits cover the diversity of all 16S rRNA sequences available in the Greengenes (v. 13.5) database, with no sequence having <78% sequence identity to at least one bait for all segments of 16S. The use of our baits provide comparable results to 16S amplicon libraries and shotgun metagenomic libraries when assigning taxonomic units from 16S sequences within the metagenomic reads. We demonstrate that 16S rRNA capture baits can be used on a range of microbial samples (i.e., mock communities and rodent fecal samples) to increase the proportion of 16S rRNA sequences (average > 400-fold) and decrease analysis time to obtain consistent community assessments. Furthermore, our study reveals that bioinformatic methods used to analyze sequencing data may have a greater influence on estimates of community composition than library preparation method used, likely due in part to the extent and curation of the reference databases considered. Thus, enriching existing aliquots of shotgun metagenomic libraries and obtaining modest numbers of reads from them offers an efficient orthogonal method for assessment of bacterial community composition.","output":"Improved Microbial Community Characterization of 16S rRNA via Metagenome Hybridization Capture Enrichment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Congestive heart failure (CHF) is one of the most common diseases of the elderly patient. The underlying pathophysiology varies considerably and approximately 50% of the patients suffer from CHF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Mortality in the perioperative period is increased in patients with CHF and this holds true for both minor and major surgeries. This review will summarize recent literature in the field of CHF and perioperative outcome in patients undergoing surgery with a special emphasis on actual guidelines, preoperative assessment and appropriate perioperative therapy. RECENT FINDINGS In the past 18 months, new insights in the short and long-term effects of CHF in the perioperative period have been published. The role of left ventricular ejection fraction has been studied in noncardiac surgical patients and it has been demonstrated that an ejection fraction less than 30% is associated with a significant increase in mortality and myocardial infarctions. Moreover, in 25% of patients, acute exacerbation of heart failure takes place in the perioperative period. The European Society of Anesthesiology published new guidelines on the preoperative evaluation of patients with CHF. The role of adequate preoperative evaluation and preparation of patients with CHF is discussed widely. It becomes clear that parameters like brain natriuretic peptide play a crucial role in risk stratification and prediction of outcome. Also, the treatment of patients with low cardiac output was a topic, and it became clear that established therapies including the use of -mimetics and PDE-III inhibitors should only be initiated in very selected patient groups. However, adequately powered studies in patients with CHF are still missing and the majority of knowledge is based on patient undergoing cardiac surgery. SUMMARY CHF is a source of considerable perioperative morbidity and mortality and in contrast to coronary artery disease, knowledge is very limited and additional research urgently needed.","output":"The patient with chronic heart failure undergoing surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, many viruses that are associated with human infectious diseases have been detected in healthy bats, including the Rabies virus, Ebola virus (EBoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus(SARS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) Unlike other mammals, bats do not appear to show overt clinical signs of infection Therefore, people can learn new knowledge to fight against the viruses by studying the immune system in bats Here we review recent studies on innate immune system in bats, and highlight the unique charateristics of their innate immunity Among all mammalian groups, bats are the only group capable of flight, which may have led to a suite of unique antiviral response mechanisms in bats Meanwhile, bats have evolved novel mechanisms to limit virus-induced inflammatory responses Notably, bats have a rich species diversity with more than 1 400 species across the globe, which accounts for more than 20% of all mammal species We call for in-depth studies on the diversity of immune genes in bats, which would facilitate a deep understanding of the unique immune functions in bats Together, learning from bats about their immune systems would be fundamentally important for humans to control infectious diseases and develop animal husbandry ? 2020, Science Press All right reserved","output":"Research progress on antiviral innate immunity in bats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), constituted significant public health concerns and impacted the human populations with massive economic and social burdens worldwide The disease is known to infect people of all ages, including children, adults, and the elderly Although several reports about pediatric COVID-19 were seen in the literature, we believe that the epidemiology and pathology of the infection described in these reports are not conclusive Therefore, in this scientific communication, a narrative review study was performed to shed some light on the characteristic epidemiological features and clinical phenotypes of pediatric COVID-19 In this report, we had compiled and presented the different epidemiological features of the disease related to the age of infection, virus acquisition, explanations of the low infectivity rates, and consequences of infections The discriminatory clinical manifestations of the disease in children were also addressed and discussed in this review The search included the data published from the date of the start of the pandemic in December 2019 up to October 2020 Our literature search revealed that children of all ages, including neonates, had been infected by the virus Despite the fact that pediatric COVID-19 is less common to occur, as compared to the disease in adults, the infected children usually manifest the disease symptomatology in benign form Asymptomatic and symptomatic adult patients are the primary source of the virus to the children Intrauterine transmission of the virus and breastfeeding infections to the neonates were hypothesized in some studies but ruled out since they were not confirmed Intensive review and discussion warranting the low infection rates and benign conditions of COVID-19 in children were also made in this study As documented in many studies, the infectivity, morbidity, and mortality rates of the disease among the children populations are much lower than those in adults They also seem to be lower than those observed during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics The described clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 in children do not differ much from those of adults, and complications of the disease seem to be associated with comorbidities","output":"Salient Conclusive Remarks on Epidemiology and Clinical Manifestations of Pediatric COVID-19: Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective In the era of competency-based medical education (CBME), the collection of more and more trainee data is being mandated by accrediting bodies such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

Cofilin is an important binding protein for these filaments; it increases their elasticity in terms of flexion and torsion and also severs them. The activity of cofilin is spatiotemporally inhibited via phosphorylation by the LIM domain kinases 1 and 2 (LIMK1 and LIMK2). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the phospho-regulation of cofilin has evolved as a mechanism controlling the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during complex multicellular processes, such as those that occur during embryogenesis.

Two major infections, smallpox and rinderpest, have been eradicated. Global coverage of vaccination against many important infectious diseases of childhood has been enhanced dramatically since the creation of WHO's Expanded Programme of Immunization in 1974 and of the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization in 2000. Polio has almost been eradicated and success in controlling measles makes this infection another potential target for eradication. Despite these successes, approximately 6.6 million children still die each year and about a half of these deaths are caused by infections, including pneumonia and diarrhoea, which could be prevented by vaccination. Enhanced deployment of recently developed pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines should, therefore, result in a further decline in childhood mortality. Development of vaccines against more complex infections, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, has been challenging and achievements so far have been modest. Final success against these infections may require combination vaccinations, each component stimulating a different arm of the immune system. In the longer term, vaccines are likely to be used to prevent or modulate the course of some non-infectious diseases.

This information may be used to guide resuscitation efforts and may carry relevant early prognostic information. METHODS We prospectively investigated non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients on scene. NIRS was started either during CPR or shortly after (<2 min) return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) by emergency medical service (EMS). Outcome was determined at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and 6 months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS A total of 29 OHCA patients were included. In 23 patients NIRS was started during CPR and in 6 patients immediately after ROSC. 18 (62.1%) patients did not reach ROSC. Initial rSO2 during CPR was very low (<50% in all 23 patients, < 30% in 19 of 23 patients) with no significant difference between patients achieving ROSC and those who did not. Of five patients with ROSC, in whom NIRS was recorded during CPR, two reached a good six-months outcome (initial rSO2 22%) and three died during the ICU stay (initial rSO2 15, 16 and 46%). In six patients with NIRS started immediately after ROSC (<2 min), rSO2 was substantially higher (54-85 %) than in patients during CPR (p = 0.006). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Initial frontal brain rSO2 determined by NIRS during CPR was generally very low and recovered rapidly after ROSC. Very low initial rSO2 during CPR was compatible with good neurological outcome in our limited cohort of patients. Further studies are needed to assess in larger cohorts and more detail the implications of very low initial rSO2 during CPR on scene.","output":"Good neurological outcome despite very low regional cerebral oxygen saturation during resuscitation--a prospective preclinical trial in 29 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonverbal communication is integral to the success of psychotherapy and facial expression is an important component of nonverbal communication.

Novel mRNA-based vaccines confer protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, but whether immunity is immediately effective and how long it will remain in recipients are uncertain. We sought to assess the effectiveness of a two-dose regimen since the boosts are often delayed concerning the recommended intervals. Methods A longitudinal cohort of healthcare workers (HCW, N = 46;30.4% men;69.6% women;mean age 36.05  2.2 years) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection as documented by negative polymerase chain reaction was immunophenotyped in PBMC once a week for 4 weeks from the prime immunization (Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2) and had received 2 doses, to study the kinetic response. Results We identified three risk groups to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection IgG+-based (late responders, R-;early responders, R+;pauci responders, PR). In all receipts, amplification of B cells and NK cells, including IL4-producing B cells and IL4-producing CD8+ T cells, is early stimulated by the vaccine. After the boost, we observed a growing increase of NK cells but a resistance of T cells, IFN-producing CD4+T cells, and IFN-producing NK cells. Also, hematologic parameters decline until the boost. The positive association of IFN-producing NK with IFN-producing CD4+T cells by the multiple mixed-effect model, adjusted for confounders (p = 0.036) as well as the correlation matrix (r = 0.6, p < 0.01), suggests a relationship between these two subsets of lymphocytes.

The utility of telepsychiatry is relevant now more than ever as the world endures the COVID-19 global pandemic. This paper describes the prior state and the changes that the COVID-19 outbreak brought to telepsychiatry in a selected group of Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We invited twelve early-career psychiatrists from different Arab nations to share information related to telepsychiatry in their respective countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information was collected using a semi-structured guide. This was complemented by a search for relevant articles in five search engines using terms such as COVID-19, telepsychiatry, and Arab world. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, digital mental health services were provided in several Arab countries, mainly through hotlines and messaging services. The COVID-19 pandemic has marked a major shift in digital psychiatric services in the Arab MENA world, through the transformation of many clinics and some hospitals into digital mental health systems. Many non-governmental organizations also started remote initiatives for psychological support and psychiatric counseling. Three main barriers of patient-related, healthcare-related, and system-related hurdles of using telepsychiatry emanated from the analysis. CONCLUSION: The use of digital mental health services varies between different Arab countries. Even though some nations have laws that regulate the provision of such services, most struggle with multifactorial barriers. As affordable and attainable solutions cannot only rely on training and recruiting more psychiatrists, telepsychiatry would help meet the exceeding demands in the Arab world, particularly after the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Telepsychiatry in the Arab World: A Viewpoint Before and During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent data have suggested the presence of a reciprocal relationship between COVID-19 and kidney function. To date, most studies have focused on the effect of COVID-19 on kidney function, whereas data regarding kidney function on the COVID-19 prognosis is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between eGFR on admission and the mortality rate of COVID-19. METHODS: We recruited 336 adult consecutive patients (male: 57.1%, mean age: 55.016.0 years) that were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a tertiary care university hospital. Data were collected from the electronic health records of the hospital. On admission, eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI formula. Acute kidney injury was defined according to the KDIGO criteria. Binary logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between eGFR on admission and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: Baseline eGFR was under 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) in 61 patients (18.2%). Acute kidney injury occurred in 29.2% of the patients. In-hospital mortality rate was calculated as 12.8%. Age-adjusted and multivariate logistic regression analysis (p: 0.005, odds ratio: 0.974, CI: 0.956C0.992) showed that baseline eGFR was independently associated with mortality. Additionally, age-adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed a higher mortality rate in patients with an eGFR under 60 mL/min/1.73m(2). CONCLUSIONS: On admission eGFR seems to be a prognostic marker for mortality in patients with COVID-19.

Preventable deaths were calculated assuming a 72% vaccine efficacy over an 8-month period. Finally, benefit-risk ratio of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination was calculated as the ratio between preventable COVID-19 deaths and vaccine-related deaths, using Monte-Carlo simulations. We found that among subjects aged 20-29 years the benefit-risk [B-R] ratio was not clearly favorable (0.70; 95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 0.27-2.11). However, in the other age groups the benefits of vaccination largely exceeded the risks (for age 30-49, B-R ratio: 22.9: 95%UI: 10.1-186.4). For age 50-59, B-R ratio: 1577.1: 95%UI: 1176.9-2121.5). Although many countries have limited the use of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the benefits of using this vaccine clearly outweigh the risks in people older than 30 years. The use of this vaccine should be a strategic and fundamental part of the immunization campaign considering its safety and efficacy in preventing COVID-19 and its complications.","output":"A quantitative risk-benefit analysis of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among people under 60 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many organizations created COVID-19 dashboards to communicate epidemiologic statistics or community health capabilities with the public.

Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent their spread. OBJECTIVES To review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA In this update, two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full papers of 215 studies, to include 66 papers of 67 studies. We included physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, hand hygiene) to prevent respiratory virus transmission. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohorts, case-controls, before-after and time series studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used a standardised form to assess trial eligibility. We assessed RCTs by randomisation method, allocation generation, concealment, blinding and follow up. We assessed non-RCTs for potential confounders and classified them as low, medium and high risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS We included 67 studies including randomised controlled trials and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias. A total number of participants is not included as the total would be made up of a heterogenous set of observations (participant people, observations on participants and countries (object of some studies)). The risk of bias for five RCTs and most cluster-RCTs was high. Observational studies were of mixed quality. Only case-control data were sufficiently homogeneous to allow meta-analysis. The highest quality cluster-RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Benefit from reduced transmission from children to household members is broadly supported also in other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. Nine case-control studies suggested implementing transmission barriers, isolation and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. Surgical masks or N95 respirators were the most consistent and comprehensive supportive measures. N95 respirators were non-inferior to simple surgical masks but more expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to skin. Adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease transmission remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, led to a non-significant marginal delay in spread. There was limited evidence that social distancing was effective, especially if related to the risk of exposure. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Simple and low-cost interventions would be useful for reducing transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. Routine long-term implementation of some measures assessed might be difficult without the threat of an epidemic.","output":"Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a first step toward the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools to fight the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is important to characterize CD8+ T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome that can trigger adaptive immune responses.

DESIGN: Tissue samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using immunofluorescence and for viral RNA by in situ hybridisation. A set of 387 oropharyngeal swabs that had been submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the viral genome revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and this human virus contained eight SNPs compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. An analysis of the viral genome of cat 2 together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared cat-specific mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease. Given the ability of the new coronavirus to infect different species, it will be important to monitor for human-to-cat, cat-to-cat and cat-to-human transmission.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples from cats in the UK associated with human-to-cat transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to the prioritization of healthcare resources towards the COVID-19 pandemic, routine cancer screening and diagnostic have been disrupted, potentially explaining the apparent COVID-era decline in cancer cases and mortality. In this study, we identified temporal trends in public interest in cancer-related health information using the nowcasting tool Google Trends. METHODS: We used Google Trends to query search terms related to cancer types for short-term (September 2019-September 2020) and long-term (September 2016-September 2020) trends in the US. We compared average relative search volumes (RSV) for specified time ranges to detect recent and seasonal variation. RESULTS: General search interest declined for all cancer types beginning in March 2020, with changes in search interest for \\"Breast cancer,\\" \\"Colorectal cancer,\\" and \\"Melanoma\\" of - 30.6%, - 28.2%, and - 26.7%, respectively, and compared with the mean RSV of the two previous months. In the same time range, search interest for \\"Telemedicine\\" has increased by + 907.1% and has reached a 4-year peak with a sustained increased level of search interest. Absolute cancer mortality has declined and is presently at a 4-year low; however, search interest in cancer has been recuperating since July 2020. CONCLUSION: We observed a marked decline in searches for cancer-related health information that mirrors the reduction in new cancer diagnoses and cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients and methods We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional survey, between June and September 2020 involving 10 public dialysis units randomly selected in eight regions of Senegal. After seeking their consent, we included 303 patients aged 18 years and hemodialysis for 3 months. Clinical symptoms and biological parameters were collected from medical records. Patients blood samples were tested with Abbott SARS-CoV-2 Ig G assay using an Architect system. Statistical tests were performed with STATA 20. Results: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 21.1% (95% CI= 16.7%-26.1%). We noticed a wide variability in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence between regions ranging from 5.6% to 51.7%.

Omicron has a high number of mutations in the spike gene, some of which are associated with greatly increased transmissibility and immune evasion. The BA.1 sublineage has been most prevalent but there is recent evidence that the BA.2 sublineage is increasing in proportion in many countries. Genome sequencing is the gold standard for Omicron identification but is relatively slow, resource intensive, of limited capacity and often unavailable. We therefore developed a simple, rapid reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method for sensitive and specific detection of the Omicron variant, including both the BA.1 and BA.2 sublineages. The assay targets a total of 5 nucleotide mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike gene that give rise to 4 amino acid substitutions at G339D, S371L, S373P and S375F. The forward primer was designed as a double-mismatch allele specific primer (DMAS) with an additional artificial mismatch located four nucleotides from the 3' end to enhance binding specificity. Assay specificity was confirmed by testing a wide range of previously-sequenced culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples including the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants and 'wild type' SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A were also tested. The assay can be run in singleplex format, or alternatively as a multiplex RT-PCR to enable Omicron and Delta variants to be detected and distinguished within the same reaction by means of probes labelled with different fluorescent dyes. Sublineages BA.1 and BA.2 can be differentiated if required. The methods presented here can readily be established in any PCR laboratory and should provide valuable support for epidemiologic surveillance of Omicron infections, particularly in those regions that lack extensive sequencing facilities.","output":"Development of highly specific singleplex and multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR assays for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and Delta variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study examined the influence of a customized mouthguard on body alignment and balance performance in professional basketball players. Twenty-three professional male basketball players, aged 25.8  8.6 years old, were voluntarily assigned to participate in three treatments, including no treatment (no mouthguard), acute treatment (wearing a mouthguard), and repeated treatments (8 weeks follow-up). Body alignment status, such as spinal and pelvic posture and balance performance, were measured at each time point using a 3D Formetric III (Germany) and a postural control device (Posturomed 202, Germany), respectively. A repeated MANOVA analysis with a Bonferroni post hoc test was applied, and the adjusted p-value was set at 0.02. No significant treatment effect was observed in body alignment (p = 0.302).

Polymeric nanocapsules and LNCs were prepared using emulsification/nanoprecipitation technique where the effect of poly(-caprolactone (PCL) and lipid matrix concentrations with respect to MN were assessed. The resulted nanocapsules were examined for their average particle size, zeta potential, %EE, and in vitro drug release. Optimum formulation in both polymeric and lipidic nanocapsules was further subjected to anti-fungal activity and ex vivo permeation tests. Based on the previous results, nanoencapsulation strategy into polymeric and LNCs created formulations of MN with slow biphasic release, high %EE, and improved stability, representing a good approach for the delivery of MN. PNCs were best fitted to Higuchis diffusion while LNCs followed Baker and Lonsdale model in release kinetics. The encapsulated MN either in PNCs or LNCs showed higher cell viability in WISH amniotic cells in comparison with free MN. PNCs showed less ex vivo permeation. PNCs were accompanied by high stability and more amount drug deposition (32.2  3.52 g/cm(2)) than LNCs (12.7  1.52 g/cm(2)).

Complementary exchanges of the respective cysteine-rich domains (CRD) between the ELR1 and murine HveA proteins revealed CRD1 as the predominant determinant of functional gp90 binding to ELR1 and also to a chimeric murine HveA protein expressed on the surface of transfected Cf2Th cells. Mutations of individual amino acids in the CRD1 segment of ELR1 and murine HveA indicated the Leu70 in CRD1 as essential for functional binding of EIAV gp90 and for virus infection of transduced Cf2Th cells. The specificity of the EIAV SU binding domain identified for the ELR1 receptor is fundamentally identical to that reported previously for functional binding of feline immunodeficiency virus SU to its coreceptor CD134, another TNFR protein.

The first model included patients undergoing routine VA assessment, DFEs, OCT imaging, and intravitreal injections. The second model eliminated the routine VA assessment and DFE, while utilizing OCT imaging through an undilated pupil followed by the intravitreal injection. The two models incorporated both bevacizumab and aflibercept. The number of patients per clinic day, the cost per visit, and the daily revenues were compared between the two models. RESULTS: Optimized schedules with and without VA assessments and DFEs allowed for 48 and 96 patients to be injected per day, respectively. Excluding drug costs, the cost per encounter for the visits with and without a DFE were $39.33 and $22.63, respectively.

Four machine learning techniques-Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Na?ve Bayes-were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance. Conclusion: Findings present machine learning models that can predict individual household preferences from ESP. These models can be used to design customised ESPs that can effectively manage the financial burden of low-income households.","output":"COVID-19 impact: Customised economic stimulus package recommender system using machine learning techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Viewpoint calls for a greater understanding of the role that water plays in the transmission of anti-microbial resistance and covid-19 in protracted urban armed conflict, in order to develop a 'pathogen-safe' practice.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated this. Mental health first aid (MHFA) is an internationally recognized training program that has been operating in Bangladesh since 2015. It offers a potential way to reduce the mental health treatment gap and skills shortage by training laypeople to help support individuals with mental health issues. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of MHFA training in Bangladesh. MethodsAn online modified Delphi study was conducted consisting of two rounds of a self-administered survey and a consensus workshop. A five-step logic framework was used to develop questionnaire statements (n=111) that consisted of 'general,' 'I,' and 'social impact' statements around the seven MHFA aims. The statements were constructed in English and adapted in Bangla. The expert panel consisted of 20 participants trained in the MHFA program. Participants anonymously stated their opinion on 111 round-1 statements and then on 27 low agreement statements in round-2. The consensus workshop facilitated a group discussion where participants explained their views on the low consensus items. ResultsThe consensus ranged from 61.5% (Aim 3: Promote recovery of good mental health) to 100% (Aim 7: To improve own health and well-being) with an overall consensus of 83.8%. 'Social impact' items produced the most (50%) disagreements. Participants' comments reflected 12 themes of MHFA's effectiveness in fostering and promoting mental health individually and socially. There were nine themes of disagreement reflecting individual, sociocultural, and political barriers to the implementation of MHFA in Bangladesh. Participants made recommendations for the MHFA and mental health initiatives in Bangladesh to increase mental health awareness, acceptance, and support in society.Conclusion?MHFA training offers Bangladesh and other low-and-middle-income countries a potential solution to tackle mental health burden at individual and societal levels and the additional challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to mental health.","output":"Evaluation of Mental Health First Aid training program in Bangladesh: A modified Delphi study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the effect of the COVID- 19 pandemic and related events on the use of e-learning, as well as other key determinants of it. The data were collected from 1039 university students in Sri Lanka. To examine the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was viewed through the lens of precipitating events, on the intentionCbehaviour relationship, we employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the inclusion of a moderating variable. While the findings indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic had clearly increased the usage of e-learning, we found no evidence to establish a moderating impact on the intentionCbehaviour relationship. The empirical model, however, was well fitted to the data, and the key components of the TAM were likewise adequately described by the relevant predictors. Furthermore, attitudes toward e-learning and perceived ease of use emerged as the most important factors in explaining behavioural intention, whereas relevance and experience were shown to be more significant in relation to perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Our work is significant because it adds to the existing empirical evidence on e-learning and supports the relevance of TAM in understanding the usage of e-learning even in extreme situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

This retrospective cohort study was performed in three hospitals in Babol, northern Iran, between February and March 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Clinical and paraclinical data of the patients were collected from their medical records. CT severity score (CSS) was calculated by a senior radiologist. Disease severity was determined based on the World Health Organization criteria. RESULTS: In total, 742 patients were included, of whom 451 (60.8%) were males and 291 (39.2%) were females. The mean age was 56.59  14.88 years old. Also, 523 (70.5%) were RT-PCR-positive. Ground glass opacity was directly associated with RT-PCR positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.07). Also, RT-PCR-positive cases had significantly a higher CSS than RT-PCR-negative cases (p = 0.037). In patients confirmed with COVID-19, peribronchovascular distribution of lesions, number of zones involved, and CSS were associated with increased risk of ICU admission (OR = 2.93, OR = 2.10, and OR = 1.14, respectively), mortality (OR = 2.30, OR = 1.35, and OR=1.08, respectively), severe disease (OR = 2.06, OR = 1.68, and OR = 1.10, respectively), and critical disease (OR = 4.62, OR = 3.21, and OR = 1.23, respectively).

Amongst all pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), poses a significant mortality risk because of its toxicity and extensive human exposure. During COVID-19 lockdowns, numerous studies have reported a reduction in ambient PM(2.5) concentrations due to decreased anthropogenic activities. Therefore, potential health benefits are plausible during this period. In this pursuit, the current study aims to estimate the potential deaths that might have been avoided due to the reductions in PM(2.5) levels during COVID-19 lockdowns in India's 12 states. For the same, concentrationCresponse functions are developed, and the changes in PM(2.5) levels were calculated. Overall, PM(2.5) levels in the analysed states decreased by an average of 19.61 g/m(3) (SD = 10.34 g/m(3)) during the months of AprilCJune 2020 compared to the previous year. The concentrationCresponse coefficient () obtained for the Indian states is 0.02272 (0.01063C0.03481, 95% Confidence Interval). Upon using these values in the calculation, our analysis estimates that nearly 73,853C92,116 mortalities might have been avoided in the 12 analysed Indian states for the period of AprilCJune 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Given the high levels of PM(2.5) in India with its well-known associated health risks and the results of this study, it is likely that the number of lives potentially saved during the COVID-19 lockdown due to reduced concentrations of PM(2.5) might surpass the COVID-19 deaths in the country.

In light of this paradigm shift, it is critical that individuals take steps to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In the United States, the CDC recommends that individuals wear face coverings in public places, such as grocery stores. As lockdowns are being phased out around the world, authorities are requiring the use of such masks in public places while maintaining social distance. Individuals (including healthcare professionals outside of their clinical settings) and manufacturers are following the CDCs recommendation. But, many currently available masks are not form-fitting, are not customizable, and are uncomfortable with even short-term use, thereby undercutting their effectiveness. Moreover, because cotton absorbs and retains the moisture found in an exhaled breath masks made of cotton have the potential to increase the wearers risk of infection. Thus, as we shift to harm reduction and social distancing measures relax, it is imperative that these shortcomings in fabric masks are addressed and that is the motivation for this research. The overall objective of the research is to design, develop, and test a fabric mask that is effective while being comfortable during continuous use over long periods of time. As the first step in the design process, we reviewed the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. We analyzed a medical mask and a fabric mask in the market and identified their shortcomings. We carried out an in-depth analysis of user needs and developed the performance requirements of the proposed mask. We defined the architecture of the mask comprising the following principal components: Barrier, Form-Fitting, Positioning, and Fastening. We tested and evaluated candidate materials for the components and developed the design specifications and construction details for the mask. We produced the mask and carried out subjective testing on a user in a typical workplace setting; we demonstrated that the mask was form-fitting, customizable, washable, and could be worn continuously and routinely over extended periods of time by individuals and therefore could serve as an effective means to reduce the harm from SARS-CoV-2.","output":"From containment to harm reduction from SARS-CoV-2: a fabric mask for enhanced effectiveness, comfort, and compliance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on several aspects of human existence including primary care research activities in resource-limited settings.

The mechanisms, and in vitro and animal models provide biological plausibility for microbiota use. Probiotics have been investigated as adjuvants in farm conditions and as models to understand their potential in human vaccinations with promising results. In human studies, although probiotics were effective in ameliorating seroconversion to vaccines for influenza, rotavirus and other micro-organisms, the results for clinical use are still controversial, especially in particular settings, such as during the last trimester of pregnancy. Conclusion. Although this topic remains controversial, the use of probiotics as adjuvant factors in vaccination represents a strategic key for different applications. The available data are deeply influenced by heterogeneity among studies in terms of strains, timing and duration of administration, and patients.

We obtained a highly curated list of genetic variants from the literature to obtain each participants genetic risk for glaucoma. Participants will undergo comprehensive ophthalmic screening. The primary outcome is the relative risk of glaucoma given a high genetic risk compared to a low genetic risk. DISCUSSION: If genetic pre-screening is successful, it will increase the yield of a glaucoma screening program by focusing on high-risk individuals.

Medium to large selectivity differences between regioisomers, were observed on the acidic, neutral and basic SFC phases. For individual substituted ortho-, meta- and para-isomers, the same elution order was observed irrespective of the nature of the stationary phase. The acidic silica stationary phases yielded longer retention of the diphenidines via electrostatic attraction, whereas the basic phases resulted in shorter retention via electrostatic repulsion. SFC effected baseline separation of seven of the eight substituted groups of ortho-, meta- and para-diphenidines evaluated on a range of stationary phases. A simple silica phase achieved baseline separation of six of the regioisomeric substituted diphenidines. As the size of the halo-substituent increased, the resolution between ortho-/meta-isomers decreased, resulting in co-elution of the ortho- and meta-bromodiphenidines. Fluphenidines and chlorodiphenidines generated an elution order of meta- < ortho- < para- whereas an elution order switch was observed for the iodophenidines.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are predisposed to several cardio-metabolic risk factors which increase the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and also exhibit increased likelihood of impaired mental health wellbeing. Therefore, these women who usually receive care from multiple primary and specialist healthcare services may be disproportionately impacted by this pandemic and the related restrictions. This study aimed to explore the lived experience of the first UK national lockdown as a woman with PCOS. Methods: As part of a larger cross-sectional study, 12 women with PCOS living in the UK during the first national COVID-19 lockdown were recruited to a qualitative study. Telephone interviews were conducted in June/July of 2020, and data collected were subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified. My PCOS Journey describes participants experiences of diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management of their PCOS. Living Through Lockdown describes the overall experience and impact of the lockdown on all aspects of participants lives. Self-care and Managing Symptoms describe multiple challenges to living well with PCOS during the lockdown, including lack of access to supplies and services, and disruption to weight management. Healthcare on Hold describes the uncertainty and anxiety associated with delays in accessing specialised healthcare for a range of PCOS aspects, including fertility treatment. Exacerbating Existing Issues captures the worsening of pre-existing mental health issues, and an increase in health anxiety and feelings of isolation. Conclusion: For the women with PCOS in this study, the COVID-19 pandemic and the first national lockdown was mostly experienced as adding to the pre-existing challenges of living with their condition. The mental health impact experienced by the study participants was increased due to lack of access to their normal support strategies, limitations on healthcare services and uncertainty about their risk of COVID-19.","output":"Uncertainty, Anxiety and Isolation: Experiencing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown as a Woman with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Emergency response relies on the assumption that essential health care services will continue to operate and be available to provide quality patient care during and after a patient surge. The observed successes and failures of health care systems during recent mass-casualty events and the concern that these assumptions are not evidence based prompted this review. METHOD The aims of this systematic review were to explore the factors associated with the intention of health care personnel (HCP) to respond to uncommon events, such as a natural disaster or pandemic, determine the state of the science, and bolster evidence-based measures that have been shown to facilitate staff response. RESULTS Authors of the 70 studies (five mixed-methods, 49 quantitative, 16 qualitative) that met inclusion criteria reported a variety of variables that influenced the intent of HCP to respond. Current evidence suggests that four primary factors emerged as either facilitating or hindering the willingness of HCP to respond to an event: (1) the nature of the event; (2) competing obligations; (3) the work environment and climate; and (4) the relationship between knowledge and perceptions of efficacy.

Four different samples were prepared by a two-step procedure using sodium borohydride and ascorbic acid as reducing agents and characterized by UVCVis absorption spectra, scanning transmission electron microscopy. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the AgNPs were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) against clinical isolates multidrug-resistant and strains of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). An assay was performed to determine the MICs during 20 successive bacteria exposures to AgNPs to investigate whether AgNPs induce tolerance in bacteria. The antibiofilm activities of AgNPs were also evaluated by determining the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC). The spherical AgNPs present diameters ranging from 9.3 to 62.4 nm, and some samples also have rod-, oval-, and triangle-shaped nanoparticles. The MIC and MBC values ranged from 0.8 to 25 g/mL and 3.1 to 50 g/mL, respectively. Smaller and spherical AgNPs exhibited the highest activity, but all the AgNPs developed in this study exhibit bactericidal activity. There was no significant MIC increase after 20 passages to the AgNPs. Regarding the antibiofilm activity, MBICs ranged from 12.5 to 50 g/mL. Again, smaller and spherical nanoparticles presented the best results with phenotypic inhibition of production of slime or exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix. Thus, it was concluded that AgNPs have a promising potential against resistant bacteria and bacteria that grow on biofilms without inducing tolerance.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Chest CT scans of patients with clinicallyCepidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 were retrieved from an open-source MosMedData data set, randomised, and independently assigned COVID-RADS and CO-RADS grades by an abdominal radiology fellow, thoracic imaging fellow and a consultant cardiothoracic radiologist. The inter- and intraobserver agreement of the two systems were assessed using the Fleiss and Cohens  coefficients, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 200 studies were included in the analysis. Both systems demonstrated moderate interobserver agreement, with  values of 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46C0.56] and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.50C0.59) for COVID-RADS and CO-RADS, respectively. When COVID-RADS and CO-RADS grades were dichotomised at cut-off values of 2B and 4 to evaluate the agreement between grades representing different levels of clinical suspicion for COVID-19, the interobserver agreement became substantial with  values of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66C0.82) for COVID-RADS and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65C0.81) for CO-RADS. The median intraobserver agreement was considerably higher for CO-RADS reaching 0.81 (95% CI: 0.43C0.76) compared with 0.60 (95% CI: 0.43C0.76) of COVID-RADS. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-RADS and CO-RADS showed comparable interobserver agreement, which was moderate when grades were compared head-to-head and substantial when grades were dichotomised to better reflect the underlying levels of suspicion for COVID-19. The median intraobserver agreement of CO-RADS was, however, considerably higher compared with COVID-RADS.

Our study aims to find the viral peptides of SARS-COV-2 by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) in order to predict its novel structure and find an inhibitor for each viral peptide. For this reason, we calculated the mass of amino acid sequences translated from the SARS-CoV2 whole genome and identify the peptides that may be a target for inhibition. Molecular peptide docking with Moringa oleifera, phytochemicals (aqueous and ethanolic) leaf extracts of flavonoids (3.56  0.03), (3.83  0.02), anthraquinone (11.68  0.04), (10.86  0.06) and hydroxychloroquine present therapy of COVID-19 in Pakistan for comparative study. Results indicate that 15 peptides of SARS-CoV2 have been identified from PMF, which is then used as a selective inhibitor. The maximum energy obtained from AutoDock Vina for hydroxychloroquine is -5.1 kcal/mol, kaempferol (flavonoid) is -6.2 kcal/mol, and for anthraquinone -6 kcal/mol.

Our aim was to compare the visualization of neurointerventional procedures and treatment devices using a 194-m pixel flat panel detector mode and a 76-m pixel complementary metal oxide semiconductor detector mode (high definition) of a new-generation x-ray detector system using a blinded-rater study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Deployment of flow-diversion devices for the treatment of internal carotid artery aneurysms was performed under flat panel detector and high-definition-mode image guidance in a neurointerventional phantom simulating patient cranium and tissue attenuation, embedded with 3D-printed intracranial vascular models, each with an aneurysm in the ICA segment. Image-sequence pairs of device deployments for each detector mode, under similar exposure and FOV conditions, were evaluated by 2 blinded experienced neurointerventionalists who independently selected their preferred image on the basis of visualization of anatomic features, image noise, and treatment device. They rated their selection as either similar, better, much better, or substantially better than the other choice. Inter- and intrarater agreement was calculated and categorized as poor, moderate, and good. RESULTS Both raters demonstrating good inter- and intrarater agreement selected high-definition-mode images with a frequency of at least 95% each and, on average, rated the high-definition images as much better than flat panel detector images with a frequency of 73% from a total of 60 image pairs.

However, participatory, evidence-informed decision-making processes to identify and weigh these factors are often not possible- especially, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While evidence-to-decision frameworks are not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, they can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered. OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges of decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We employed the 'best fit' framework synthesis technique and used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework as a starting point. First, we adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to case studies. Next, we conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide policymakers on the phasing out of applied lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we developed the WICID (WHO-INTEGRATE COVID-19) framework version 1.0. RESULTS: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were analysed. The revised framework consists of 11+1 criteria, supported by 48 aspects, and embraces a complex systems perspective. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental human rights, acceptability and equity considerations, societal, environmental and economic implications, as well as implementation, resource and feasibility considerations. DISCUSSION: The proposed framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key stakeholder groups across the society.

We have previously shown that encapsidation of DNA expressing the model antigen M/M2 from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HPV pseudovirions (PsV) is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally. Because the HPV capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium, they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles. In this study we asked: 1) whether HPV16 VLP administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to HPV16 and 2) whether HPV16 PsV-encapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both HPV and the antigen delivered by the transgene. Mice immunized with HPV16 VLP coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from HPV16 challenge. Microneedle arrays coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-F protein (genes of RSV) were then tested and dose-dependent HPV and F-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization, and M/M2-specific T-cell responses were detected post RSV challenge, respectively. HPV16 PsV-F immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with HPV16 PsV and had reduced RSV viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal RSV challenge. In summary, HPV16 PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against HPV and primed for antibody and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids. Although the immunogenicity of the DNA component was just above the dose response threshold, the HPV-specific immunity was robust. Taken together, these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized HPV PsV could provide a practical, thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation.","output":"Vaccination with Human Papillomavirus Pseudovirus-Encapsidated Plasmids Targeted to Skin Using Microneedles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bangladesh is in the rising phase of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We also highlight promising therapeutic effects of NO donors allied to nanomaterials to combat COVID-19 and other human coronavirus infections. Nanomaterials can be designed to deliver sustained, localized NO release directly at the desired application site, enhancing the beneficial effects of NO and minimizing the side effects. Challenges and perspectives are presented to open new fields of research.","output":"Nitric oxide (NO) and nanoparticles - Potential small tools for the war against COVID-19 and other human coronavirus infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) for controlling and preventing the COVID-19 would have sharply increased during the pandemic. To evaluate their post-pandemic environmental impacts, five categories of drugs were detected in lakes and WWTP-river-estuary system near hospitals of Jinyintan, Huoshenshan and Leishenshan in the three regions (J, H and L) (Regions J, H and L) in Wuhan, China. The total amount of PPCPs (ranging from 2.61 to 1122 ng/L in water and 0.11 to 164 ng/g dry weight in sediments) were comparable to historical reports in Yangtze River basin, whereas the detection frequency and concentrations of ribavirin and azithromycin were higher than those of historical studies. The distribution of concerned drugs varied with space, season, media and water types: sampling sites located at WWTPs-river-estuary system around two hospitals (Regions L and J) usually had relatively high waterborne contamination levels, most of which declined in autumn; lakes had relatively low waterborne contamination levels in summer but increased in autumn. The potential risks of detected PPCPs were further evaluated using the multiple-level ecological risk assessment (MLERA): sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin were found to pose potential risks to aquatic organisms according to a semi-probabilistic approach and classified as priority pollutants based on an optimized risk assessment. In general, the COVID-19 pandemic did not cause serious pollution in lakes and WWTPs-river-estuary system in Wuhan City. However, the increased occurrence of certain drugs and their potential ecological risks need further attention. A strict source control policy and an advanced monitoring and risk warning system for emergency response and long-term risk control of PPCPs is urgent.","output":"Occurrence and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) against COVID-19 in lakes and WWTP-river-estuary system in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current global home confinement situation due to the COVID-19 outbreak, most individuals are exposed to an unprecedented stressful situation of unknown duration. This may not only increase daytime stress, anxiety and depression levels, but also disrupt sleep. Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning. In this paper, we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioural therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and home-schooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.","output":"Dealing with sleep problems during home confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak: Practical recommendations from a task force of the European CBT-I Academy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic affected large part of Italy since February 2020; we, therefore, aimed to assess the impact of 2020 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on telemedicine management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Italy.

OBJECTIVES: To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI). METHODS: We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011C2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value < 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value < 0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort. CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity.

DesignEcological, observational study at the zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) level from March to August 2020. SettingChicago, New York City and Philadelphia. ParticipantsAll populated ZCTAs in the three cities. MeasuresOutcomes were ZCTA-level COVID-19 testing, positivity, incidence, monthly from pandemic onset through the end of August, and ZCTA-level COVID-19 mortality cumulatively through the end of August. Predictors were the CDC social vulnerability index and its four domains, obtained from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. We examined spatial clusters of COVID-19 outcomes using local Morans I and estimated associations using negative binomial models. ResultsWe found spatial clusters of high and low positivity, incidence and mortality, co-located with clusters of low and high social vulnerability. We also found evidence for the existence of spatial inequities in testing, positivity, incidence and mortality for the three cities. Specifically, neighborhoods with higher social vulnerability had lower testing rates, higher positivity ratios, incidence rates and mortality rates. Inequities in testing and incidence changed over time in the three cities, and inequities in positivity stayed consistent over time.

Framed from the perspective of role theory and the relational nature of providing and receiving care, study objectives were as follows: (1) to capture caregivers understanding of the process of taking on the role of main caregiver, (2) to conceptualize their understanding of the functions that they assume while being the main caregivers, and (3) to understand how they experienced the consequences they confronted. METHODS: The research team employed the methodological strategy of descriptive thematic analysis using a semi-structured interview guide. The sample consisting of 33 family caregivers was recruited using purposeful and snowball sampling strategies in 2020. Interview data was analyzed using content-driven inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The data analysis revealed four main themes that structure the process of becoming the main care giver of a terminally ill family member and the meaning of the caregiver role: (1) inaccessibility and mistrust of public care services for persons with terminal illness, (2) moral obligations and responsibilities of immediate family and friends, (3) cultural traditions, (4) the caregiver feels responsible for everything. The themes describe the social role of family caregiver in social context, address the process of taking on the role of caregiver and living with systemic corruption. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of caregiving experiences is essential in planning better systems, in direct practice and in confronting corruption. The study suggests the need for open communication, accessibility of quality services, and the recognition of caregivers as care-team members. The larger implication is that the increasing numbers of distressed caregivers and aging populations can be considered as public health populations, and thus addressable through public health methods.","output":"What does it mean to be the main caregiver to a terminally ill family member in Lithuania?: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression is considered to be one of the most common health threats during pregnancy and postpartum, affecting not only the woman herself but also the offspring and the whole family system.

However, clinical and radiographic predictors of incomplete aneurysm occlusion are poorly defined. In this study, predictors of incomplete occlusion at last angiographic follow-up after PED treatment were assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive aneurysms treated with the PED between 2009 and 2016, at 3 academic institutions in the United States, was performed. Cases with angiographic follow-up were selected to evaluate factors predictive of incomplete aneurysm occlusion at last follow-up. RESULTS We identified 465 aneurysms treated with the PED; 380 (81.7%) aneurysms (329 procedures; median age, 58 years; female/male ratio, 4.8:1) had angiographic follow-up, and were included. Complete occlusion (100%) was achieved in 78.2% of aneurysms. Near-complete (90%-99%) and partial (<90%) occlusion were collectively achieved in 21.8% of aneurysms and defined as incomplete occlusion. Of aneurysms followed for at least 12 months (211 of 380), complete occlusion was achieved in 83.9%. Older age (older than 70 years), nonsmoking status, aneurysm location within the posterior communicating artery or posterior circulation, greater aneurysm maximal diameter (21 mm), and shorter follow-up time (<12 months) were significantly associated with incomplete aneurysm occlusion at last angiographic follow-up on univariable analysis. However, on multivariable logistic regression, only age, smoking status, and duration of follow-up were independently associated with occlusion status. CONCLUSIONS Complete occlusion following PED treatment of intracranial aneurysms can be influenced by several factors related to the patient, aneurysm, and treatment. Of these factors, older age (older than 70 years) and nonsmoking status were independent predictors of incomplete occlusion. While the physiologic explanation for these findings remains unknown, identification of factors predictive of incomplete aneurysm occlusion following PED placement can assist in patient selection and counseling and might provide insight into the biologic factors affecting endothelialization.","output":"Predictors of Incomplete Occlusion following Pipeline Embolization of Intracranial Aneurysms: Is It Less Effective in Older Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New York City (NYC) was an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States during spring 2020 (1).

We meta-analyzed standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies to estimate global seroprevalence. Objectives/MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, preprints, and grey literature for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies aligned with the WHO UNITY protocol published between 2020-01-01 and 2021-10-29. Eligible studies were extracted and critically appraised in duplicate. We meta-analyzed seroprevalence by country and month, pooling to estimate regional and global seroprevalence over time; compared seroprevalence from infection to confirmed cases to estimate under-ascertainment; meta-analyzed differences in seroprevalence between demographic subgroups; and identified national factors associated with seroprevalence using meta-regression. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634. ResultsWe identified 396 full texts reporting 736 distinct seroprevalence studies (41% LMIC), including 355 low/moderate risk of bias studies with national/sub-national scope in further analysis. By April 2021, global SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 26.1%, 95% CI [24.6-27.6%]. Seroprevalence rose steeply in the first half of 2021 due to infection in some regions (e.g., 18.2% to 45.9% in Africa) and vaccination and infection in others (e.g., 11.3% to 57.4% in the Americas high-income countries), but remained low in others (e.g., 0.3% to 1.6% in the Western Pacific). In 2021 Q1, median seroprevalence to case ratios were 1.9:1 in HICs and 61.9:1 in LMICs. Children 0-9 years and adults 60+ were at lower risk of seropositivity than adults 20-29. In a multivariate model using data pre-vaccination, more stringent public health and social measures were associated with lower seroprevalence. ConclusionsGlobal seroprevalence has risen considerably over time and with regional variation, however much of the global population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. True infections far exceed reported COVID-19 cases. Standardized seroprevalence studies are essential to inform COVID-19 control measures, particularly in resource-limited regions.","output":"Global epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of standardized population-based seroprevalence studies, Jan 2020-Oct 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing the greater public with the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines is time-consuming and research-intensive; intermediately, some essential ways to reduce the transmission include social distancing, personal hygiene, testing, contact tracing, and universal masking.

Viral transmissibility and pathogenesis depend on recognition by a receptor in the host, protease cleavage of the host membrane and fusion. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor. Here, we discuss the general characteristics of the virus, its mechanism of action and the way in which the mechanism correlates with the comorbidities that increase the death rate. We also discuss the currently proposed therapeutic measures and propose the use of antioxidant drugs to help patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Oxidizing agents come from phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils that invade tissue. Free radicals promote cytotoxicity thus injuring cells. They also trigger the mechanism of inflammation by mediating the activation of NFkB and inducing the transcription of cytokine production genes. Release of cytokines enhances the inflammatory response. Oxidative stress is elevated during critical illnesses and contributes to organ failure. In corona virus disease-19 there is an intense inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm that could be mediated by oxidative stress. Although antioxidant therapy has not been tested in corona virus disease-19, the consequences of antioxidant therapy in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are known. It improves oxygenation rates, glutathione levels and strengthens the immune response. It reduces mechanical ventilation time, the length of stay in the intensive care unit, multiple organ dysfunctions and the length of stay in the hospital and mortality rates in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome and could thus help patients with corona virus disease-19.","output":"Is Antioxidant Therapy a Useful Complementary Measure for Covid-19 Treatment?

However, we found strong evidence of in-group favouritism among both mask and non-mask wearers when information about the other partner's mask usage was known. Non-mask wearers were 23 percentage points less likely to cooperate than mask wearers when facing a mask-wearing partner, and 26 percentage points more likely to cooperate than mask wearers when facing a non-mask-wearing partner.

Among these, a particular influence appears associated with the different airflows typical of male and female subjects. Focusing on a typical cough event, we investigate this aspect by means of highly-resolved direct numerical simulations of the turbulent airflow in combination with a comprehensive Lagrangian particle tracking model for the droplet motion and evaporation. We observe and quantify major differences between the case of male and female subjects, both in terms of the droplet final reach and evaporation time. Our results can be associated with the different characteristics in the released airflow and thus confirm the influence of the subject gender (or other physical properties providing different exhalation profiles) on both short-range and long-range airborne transmission.","output":"Transport and evaporation of virus-containing droplets exhaled by men and women in typical cough events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study examined if living alone is associated with self-perceptions of aging (SPA).

METHODS This was an analysis of prospectively collected continuous quality-improvement data during the 6-year period from February 1, 2009 to January 31, 2015, when both the C-MAC and Macintosh DL (Mac DL) were clinically available in our ED. This analysis included adult patients who underwent rapid sequence intubation by an emergency medicine resident in the ED with a C-MAC initially used as a DL or a Mac DL. The primary outcome measure was the first pass success (FPS). RESULTS When the C-MAC was used as a DL, the initial DL attempt was successful in 199 of 346 (57.6%) cases. When the attempt could not be completed using the C-MAC as a DL, the operator utilized the video monitor and successfully completed the intubation using VL in 104 of 134 (77.6%) cases, thus achieving an overall FPS of 303 of 346 (87.6%).

In recent years, numerous observations have been reported and various methods of measurement have been employed. The present paper introduces a novel wearable sensor in intelligent clothing for human body temperature measurement. The objective is the integration of optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based sensors into functional textiles to extend the capabilities of wearable solutions for body temperature monitoring. In addition, the temperature sensitivity is 150 pm/C, which is almost 15 times higher than that of a bare FBG. This study combines large and small pipes during fabrication to implant FBG sensors into the fabric. The law of energy conservation of the human body is considered in determining heat transfer between the body and its clothing. The mathematical model of heat transmission between the body and clothed FBG sensors is studied, and the steady-state thermal analysis is presented. The simulation results show the capability of the material to correct the actual body temperature. Based on the skin temperature obtained by the weighted average method, this paper presents the five points weighted coefficients model using both sides of the chest, armpits, and the upper back for the intelligent clothing. The weighted coefficients of 0.0826 for the left chest, 0.3706 for the left armpit, 0.3706 for the right armpit, 0.0936 for the upper back, and 0.0826 for the right chest were obtained using Cramer's Rule. Using the weighting coefficient, the deviation of the experimental result was  0.18 C, which favors the use for clinical armpit temperature monitoring. Moreover, in special cases when several FBG sensors are broken, the weighted coefficients of the other sensors could be changed to obtain accurate body temperature.","output":"Wearable sensors in intelligent clothing for measuring human body temperature based on optical fiber Bragg grating."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic COVID-19 gave a big impact worldwide either in terms of the medical condition, economy, education, or working mode.

Specifically, we use a taxonomy cross-validation by identity framework to compare classification performance between a global database comprised of all available sequences and a curated database that only includes sequences of fishes from the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We demonstrate that the regional database provides higher assignment accuracy than the comprehensive global database. We also document a tradeoff between accuracy and misclassification across a range of taxonomic cutoff scores, highlighting the importance of parameter selection for taxonomic classification. Furthermore, we compared assignment accuracy with and without the inclusion of additionally generated reference sequences. To this end, we sequenced tissue from 597 species using the MiFish 12S primers, adding 252 species to GenBank's existing 550 California Current Large Marine Ecosystem fish sequences. We then compared species and reads identified from seawater environmental DNA samples using global databases with and without our generated references, and the regional database. The addition of new references allowed for the identification of 16 additional native taxa representing 17.0% of total reads from eDNA samples, including species with vast ecological and economic value.

However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019. METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical Improvement System Data that reports ICU information in China. Data collection consisted of a) information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffing, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes. RESULTS: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP, CRBSI, and CAUTI were 5.58 (1.55, 11.67) per 1000 ventilator days, 0.63 (0, 2.01) per 1000 catheter days, and 1.42 (0.37, 3.40) per 1000 catheter days, respectively. Mortality was significantly lower in public hospitals ( = ? 0.018 (? 0.031, ? 0.005), p = 0.006), hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% ( = ? 0.027 (? 0.034, -0.019), p < 0.001) and higher in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0.5:1 ( = 0.009 (0.001, 0.017), p = 0.027). The incidence of VAP was lower in public hospitals ( = ? 0.036 (? 0.054, ? 0.018), p < 0.001). The incidence of CRBSIs was lower in public hospitals ( = ? 0.008 (? 0.014, ? 0.002), p = 0.011) and higher in secondary hospitals ( = 0.005 (0.001, 0.009), p = 0.010), while the incidence of CAUTIs was higher in secondary hospitals ( = 0.010 (0.002, 0.018), p = 0.015).

Mathematics with working objects is not easy to learn online. So, an excellent self-regulated learning ability is required. So far, many efforts have been made to improve self-regulated learning in mathematics learning. However, there are still gaps in improving students' self-regulated learning ability in online mathematics learning, especially in relation to the integration of GeoGebra into the Flipped Learning approach. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of integrating GeoGebra into the Flipped Learning approach to improve students' self-regulated learning ability in learning mathematics online during the Covid-19 pandemic. This research is a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest control group design to compare the effectiveness of a GeoGebra-integrated Flipped Learning approach.

Pretest and posttest results were quantitatively analyzed using Normalized Gain (N-Gain) Score, Cohen's d effect size, and statistical descriptive. The analysis results revealed that GeoGebra-integrated Flipped Learning is more effective in increasing students' self-regulated learning level in online mathematics learning than the other two approaches.

Latent growth modeling results suggest that videoconferences at different times of the day are related to deviations in employee fatigue beyond what is expected based on typical fatigue trajectories. Results from multilevel modeling of 279 videoconference meetings indicate that turning off the microphone and having higher feelings of group belongingness are related to lower postvideoconference fatigue.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is extremely heterogeneous in terms of severity, clinical phenotype and, importantly, global distribution. Although the majority of affected patients recover from the acute infection, many continue to suffer from late sequelae affecting various organs, including the lungs. The role of the pulmonary vascular system during the acute and chronic stages of COVID-19 has not been adequately studied. A thorough understanding of the origins and dynamic behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the potential causes of heterogeneity in COVID-19 is essential for anticipating and treating the disease, in both the acute and the chronic stages, including the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension. Both COVID-19 and chronic pulmonary hypertension have assumed global dimensions, with potential complex interactions. In this Review, we present an update on the origins and behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and discuss the potential causes of the heterogeneity of COVID-19. In addition, we summarize the pathobiology of COVID-19, with an emphasis on the role of the pulmonary vasculature, both in the acute stage and in terms of the potential for developing chronic pulmonary hypertension. We hope that the information presented in this Review will help in the development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the pulmonary vasculature: a global perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditionally, applications that are used in large and small enterprises were deployed on\\"bare metal\\"servers installed with operating systems. Recently, the use of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical server was adopted due to cost reduction and flexibility. Nowadays, containers have become popular for application deployment due to smaller footprints than the VMs, their ability to start and stop more quickly, and their capability to pack the application binaries and their dependencies in standalone units for seamless portability. A typical container ecosystem includes a code repository (e.g., GitHub) where the container images are built from the codes and libraries and then pushed to the image registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for subsequent deployment as application containers. However, the pervasive use of containers also leads to a wide-range of security breaches, such as stealing credentials and sensitive data from image registry and code repository, carrying out DoS attacks, and gaining root access to the underlying host. In this paper, we first perform threat modeling on the containers ecosystem using the popular threat modeling framework, called STRIDE. Using STRIDE, we identify the vulnerabilities in each system component, and investigate potential security threats and their consequences. Then, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the existing countermeasures designed against the identified threats and vulnerabilities. In particular, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the existing mitigation strategies designed against such threats. We believe that this work will help researchers and practitioners to gain a deeper understanding of the threat landscape in containers and the state-of-the-art countermeasures. We also discuss open research problems and future research directions in containers security, which may ignite further research to be done in this area.","output":"Threat Modeling and Security Analysis of Containers: A Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innovation follows discovery.

ALG, KGM and ALG/KGM blended (50:50) films were produced by casting and treated with calcium ions (Ca2+) (ALG films) and a combination of Ca2+, alkali, and ethanol (KGM and ALG/KGM films). Vinasse addition tended to reduce transparency and water resistance of the films and had less effect on their mechanical properties. Crosslinking of ALG films resulted in enhanced mechanical properties and reduced moisture content, water solubility, swelling, water vapor permeability, and flexibility. KGM films were less impacted by crosslinking/deacetylation but showed improved water resistance while maintain a high degree of swelling (290% and 185% for KGM and KGM/VIN films respectively). Blended films exhibited characteristic properties of the two biopolymers and adequate compatibility indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and morphologies.

Firstly, we must reassess deceased donor safety (for the recipient) especially in communities with a relatively high incidence of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). With respect to elective live donors, if one decides to do them at all, similar considerations must be made that may impose undue hardship on the donor. Recipient selection is also problematic since there is clear evidence of a much higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 for patients older than 60 and those with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and lung disease. Unfortunately, many, if not most of dialysis patients fit that mold. We may and indeed must reassess our allocation policies, but this must be done based on data rather than conjecture. Follow-up routines must be re-engineered to minimize patient travel and exposure. Reliance on technology and telemedicine is paramount. Making this technology available to patients is extremely important. Modifying or changing immunosuppression protocols is controversial and not based on clinical studies.

These virions have different abundance, structure, location and roles in the virus life-cycle. Here, the formation and function of these virions are considered with emphasis on the EEV form and its precursors, IEV and CEV. IMV is the most abundant form of virus and is retained in cells until lysis; it is a robust, stable virion and is well suited to transmit infection between hosts. IEV is formed by wrapping of IMV with intracellular membranes, and is an intermediate between IMV and CEV/EEV that enables efficient virus dissemination to the cell surface on microtubules. CEV induces the formation of actin tails that drive CEV particles away from the cell and is important for cell-to-cell spread. Lastly, EEV mediates the long-range dissemination of virus in cell culture and, probably, in vivo. Seven virus-encoded proteins have been identified that are components of IEV, and five of them are present in CEV or EEV. The roles of these proteins in virus morphogenesis and dissemination, and as targets for neutralizing antibody are reviewed. The production of several different virus particles in the VV replication cycle represents a coordinated strategy to exploit cell biology to promote virus spread and to aid virus evasion of antibody and complement.","output":"The formation and function of extracellular enveloped vaccinia virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate determinations of the time of intubation (TOI) are critical for retrospective electronic health record (EHR) data analyses.

A potentially promising tool for addressing poor compliance is eHealth. OBJECTIVE: This review investigates the effects of eHealth interventions on medication adherence in patients with COPD or asthma. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases of Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase for studies with publication dates between January 1, 2000, and October 29, 2020. We selected randomized controlled trials targeting adult patients with COPD or asthma, which evaluated the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention on medication adherence. The risk of bias in the included studies was examined using the Cochrane Collaborations risk of bias tool. The results were narratively reviewed. RESULTS: In total, six studies focusing on COPD and seven focusing on asthma were analyzed. Interventions were mostly internet-based or telephone-based, and could entail telemonitoring of symptoms and medication adherence, education, counseling, consultations, and self-support modules. Control groups mostly comprised usual care conditions, whereas a small number of studies used a face-to-face intervention or waiting list as the control condition. For COPD, the majority of eHealth interventions were investigated as an add-on to usual care (5/6 studies), whereas for asthma the majority of interventions were investigated as a standalone intervention (5/7 studies). Regarding eHealth interventions targeting medication adherence for COPD, two studies reported nonsignificant effects, one study found a significant effect in comparison to usual care, and three reported mixed results. Of the seven studies that investigated eHealth interventions targeting medication adherence in asthma, three studies found significant effects, two reported nonsignificant effects, and two reported mixed effects. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed results on the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in improving treatment adherence for asthma and COPD are presumably related to the type, context, and intensity of the interventions, as well as to differences in the operationalization and measurement of adherence outcomes.

Data are lacking on the clinical features of and the prognostic criteria for this disorder. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving patients with suspected VITT who presented to hospitals in the United Kingdom between March 22 and June 6, 2021. Data were collected with the use of an anonymized electronic form, and cases were identified as definite or probable VITT according to prespecified criteria. Baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the patients, risk factors, treatment, and markers of poor prognosis were determined. RESULTS: Among 294 patients who were evaluated, we identified 170 definite and 50 probable cases of VITT. All the patients had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and presented 5 to 48 days (median, 14) after vaccination. The age range was 18 to 79 years (median, 48), with no sex preponderance and no identifiable medical risk factors. Overall mortality was 22%. The odds of death increased by a factor of 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.2) among patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50% decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for every increase of 10,000 fibrinogen-equivalent units in the baseline d-dimer level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50% decrease in the baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently associated with death; the observed mortality was 73% among patients with platelet counts below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality associated with VITT was highest among patients with a low platelet count and intracranial hemorrhage.

METHODS: A total of 310 patients were included and stratified into severe and non-severe COVID-19 groups. Cross-sectional CT features across different time periods (T0: pre-discharge, T1: 1C4 weeks after discharge, T2: 5C8 weeks after discharge, T3: 9C12 weeks after discharge, T4: > 12 weeks after discharge) were compared, and the longitudinal variations of CT findings were analyzed and compared in both groups. RESULTS: The cumulative absorption rate of fibrosis-like findings in the severe and non-severe groups at T4 was 24.3% (17/70) and 52.0% (53/102), respectively. In both groups, ground-glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation showed a clear decreasing trend at T1, after which they maintained similar lower levels.

There are limited studies addressing acute respiratory illness (ARI) in urban Indigenous children, particularly those that address the upper airway microbiome and its relationship to disease. We aimed to describe the prevalence of upper airway viruses and bacteria in symptomatic and asymptomatic urban-based Australian Indigenous children aged less than 5 years. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline in an ongoing prospective cohort study of urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children registered with a primary health care service in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, Australia. Clinical, demographic and epidemiological data and bilateral anterior nasal swabs were collected on enrolment. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasal swabs to detect 17 respiratory viruses and 7 bacteria. The primary outcome was the prevalence of these microbes at enrolment. Logistic regression was performed to investigate differences in microbe prevalence between children with and without acute respiratory illness with cough as a symptom (ARIwC) at time of specimen collection. RESULTS: Between February 2013 and October 2015, 164 children were enrolled. The median age at enrolment was 18.0 months (IQR 7.2C34.3), 49.4% were boys and 56 children (34.2%) had ARIwC. Overall, 133/164 (81%) nasal swabs were positive for at least one organism; 131 (79.9%) for any bacteria, 59 (36.2%) for any virus and 57 (34.8%) for both viruses and bacteria. Co-detection of viruses and bacteria was more common in females than males (61.4% vs 38.6%, p = 0.044). No microbes, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with the presence of ARIwC. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of upper airways microbes in asymptomatic children is similar to non-Indigenous children with ARIwC from the same region. Determining the aetiology of ARIwC in this community is complicated by the high prevalence of multiple respiratory pathogens in the upper airways.

Faculty members of the universities were asked to share the survey with their students. Moreover, using a snowball sampling technique, students were requested to share the survey with their friends. SPSS Statistics (Version 21) was employed to do preliminary data analysis, AMOS (Version 21) software was used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis using a maximum likelihood estimation, and Hayes' PROCESS model was used to examine proposed hypotheses. The results show that only cognitive problem solving mediates the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and students' social presence in online learning in Malaysian samples. In Pakistan, cognitive problem solving and psychological motivation mediate the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and students' social presence in online learning. The study found that developing cognitive problem-solving skills and providing psychological motivation could enhance their engagement with online learning.","output":"Online Learning and Students' Fear of COVID-19: Study in Malaysia and Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), in December 2019 in Wuhan, People's Republic of China, has developed into an unprecedented pandemic with enormous pressure on health-care providers around the world. A higher mortality rate has been described in older infected individuals. Patients with hip fracture are a particularly vulnerable population during this pandemic because older age is associated with a higher mortality rate. Our aim was to describe the early mortality rate and demographic variables in a hip fracture sample population in Spain during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from 13 major hospitals in Spain from the beginning of the national state of alarm (declared on March 14, 2020, by the Spanish government) until the end of our study period on April 4, 2020. All patients who were &#8805;65 years of age, presented to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals during this period with a diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture, and had a minimum follow-up of 10 days were included in the cohort. In addition to mortality, demographic and other potential prognostic variables were also collected. RESULTS: In this study, 136 patients with a hip fracture were included. Of these patients, 124 underwent a surgical procedure and 12 were managed nonoperatively. The total mortality rate was 9.6%. Sixty-two patients were tested for COVID-19, with 23 patients being positive. The mortality rate for these 23 patients was 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) at a mean follow-up of 14 days. The mortality rate was 10.3% (4 of 39) for patients who had been tested and had a negative result and 2.7% (2 of 74) for patients who had not been tested. Of the 12 patients who were managed nonoperatively, 8 (67%) died, whereas, of the 124 patients who were surgically treated, 5 (4%) died. Results differed among centers. CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher mortality rate in patients with a hip fracture and an associated positive test for COVID-19. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level IV.

The molecules, which have no inversion symmetry, show orientational head-to-tail disorder. In the average structure, the methyl group is disordered and found on both ends of the molecule with an occupancy of 0.5 each. The disorder and the local structure were investigated using various ordered structural models. All models were analysed by three approaches: Rietveld refinement, structure refinement to the pair distribution function (PDF) and lattice-energy minimization. All refinements converged well. The Rietveld refinement provided the average structure and gave no indication of a long-range ordering. The refinement to the PDF turned out to be very sensitive to small structural details, giving insight into the local structure. The lattice-energy minimizations revealed a significantly preferred local ordering of neighbouring molecules along the [0bar 11] direction. In conclusion, all methods indicate a statistical orientational disorder with a preferred parallel orientation of molecules in one direction.

In this study we aimed to provide surgical neuro-oncologists with practice guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic based on objective data from a high-volume brain tumor surgeon at the current COVID-19 epicenter. METHODS: All outpatient visits and surgeries performed by the senior author during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared between the initial quarantine (3/23/20-5/4/20), the plateau period following quarantine (5/5/20-6/27/20), and the second peak (6/28/20-7/20/20). In-person and telemedicine visits were evaluated for crossovers. Surgeries were subdivided based on lesion type and evaluated across the same time period. RESULTS: From 3/23/20-7/20/20, 469 clinic visits and 196 surgeries were identified. After quarantine was lifted, face-to-face visits increased (P < 0.01) yet no change in telehealth visits occurred. Of 327 telehealth visits, only 5.8% converted to in-person during the 4-month period with the most cited reason being patient preference (68.4%). Of the 196 surgeries performed during the pandemic, 29.1% occurred during quarantine, 49.0% during the plateau, and 21.9% occurred in the second peak. No COVID negative patients developed symptoms at follow-up. 55.6% were performed on malignant tumors and 31.6% were benign with no difference in case volumes throughout the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Despite exceptional challenges, we have maintained a high-volume surgical neuro-oncology practice at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Regulators, blood centres and hospitals worldwide worked quickly to get CCP to the bedside. Although response was admirable, several areas have been identified to help improve future pandemic management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, multinational subgroup from the ISBT Working Group on COVID-19 was tasked with drafting a manuscript that describes the lessons learned pertaining to procurement and administration of CCP, derived from a comprehensive questionnaire within the subgroup. RESULTS: While each country's responses and preparedness for the pandemic varied, there were shared challenges, spanning supply chain disruptions, staffing, impact of social distancing on the collection of regular blood and CCP products, and the availability of screening and confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 testing for donors and patients. The lack of a general framework to organize data gathering across clinical trials and the desire to provide a potentially life-saving therapeutic through compassionate use hampered the collection of much-needed safety and outcome data worldwide. Communication across all stakeholders was identified as being central to reducing confusion. CONCLUSION: The need for flexibility and adaptability remains paramount when dealing with a pandemic. As the world approaches the first anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic with rising rates worldwide and over 115 million cases and 255 million deaths, respectively, it is important to reflect on how to better prepare for future pandemics as we continue to combat the current one.","output":"Lessons learned in the collection of convalescent plasma during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Working with The International Society of Nephrology (ISN), Kim Solez and J Stewart Cameron created the Video Legacy Project (VLP) in 1990 to document the lives of the key figures that founded Kidney Medicine and highlight the history of Kidney Medicine within the medical community These recordings were made on VHS tapes, but it became obvious that digitization of the material was essential, and this also was undertaken as the 21st century began Transplantation and transplant pathology were important parts of the project It is hard to imagine a medical subspecialty without any video history at all, but that fate almost befell kidney medicine when funding was removed from the ISN Video Legacy Project in 2007 During the ISN council meeting of 2006, the idea of making the interviews freely available on the Internet was proposed but this did not actually happen A major feature of the project was not to impose a standard format but allow subjects to talk in an unscripted manner and for as long they wanted For a time, 3 of the 45 video interviews were accessible on the ISN website, but then the site was restructured and for 8 years none of the videos were accessible We need to be reminded of the inconsistency of a rolling present through understanding of how present hypotheses, concepts and treatment recommendations came about Despite a strong movement amongst professional historians to downgrade the role of great men in the progress of ideas, these ideas in sum came from an endless series of talented individuals Hearing directly on video from this series of such men and women, almost all of whom have now passed away, not only gives a vivid idea of their characters but also an insight into how their minds worked Methods: The videotapes recorded between 1990 and 2007 were kept in temperature-controlled storage until the difficult Canadian winter of 2017-18 when they languished in the senior author's unheated garage Conventional wisdom held that the information on the tapes was fugitive and that by this time they would all be unreadable On a whim, we submitted them for conversion to mp4 video files in April-June 2018 and every tape was readable!

We hypothesize that changes in habits and medical care during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown might have worsened the clinical course of migraine. DESIGN: Retrospective survey study collecting online responses from migraine patients followed-up by neurologists at three tertiary hospitals between June and July 2020. METHODS: We used a web-based survey that included demographic data, clinical variables related with any headache (frequency) and migraine (subjective worsening, frequency, and intensity), lockdown, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. RESULTS: The response rate of the survey was 239/324 (73.8%). The final analysis included 222 subjects. Among them, 201/222 (90.5%) were women, aged 42.5  12.0 (meanSD). Subjective improvement of migraine during lockdown was reported in 31/222 participants (14.0%), while worsening in 105/222 (47.3%) and was associated with changes in migraine triggers such as stress related to going outdoors and intake of specific foods or drinks. Intensity of attacks increased in 67/222 patients (30.2%), and it was associated with the subjective worsening, female sex, recent insomnia, and use of acute medication during a headache. An increase in monthly days with any headache was observed in 105/222 patients (47.3%) and was related to symptoms of post-traumatic stress, older age and living with five or more people. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half the migraine patients reported worsening of their usual pain during the lockdown.

In the present work, we evaluated the antiviral activity of polydatin, an RV precursor, and a mixture of polyphenols and other micronutrients, named A5+, against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. To this end, we infected Vero E6 cells and analyzed the replication of both respiratory viruses in terms of viral proteins synthesis and viral titration. We demonstrated that A5+ showed a higher efficacy in inhibiting both influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to polydatin treatment alone. Indeed, post infection treatment significantly decreased viral proteins expression and viral release, probably by interfering with any step of virus replicative cycle. Intriguingly, A5+ treatment strongly reduced IL-6 cytokine production in influenza virus-infected cells, suggesting its potential anti-inflammatory properties during the infection.

RESULTS: Over 40% of the adolescent girls who had sex below 17 years had given birth i.e, current age 15C17 years (40.9%) and <15 years (44.9%) had given birth. In addition, 70.7% of the married adolescents had given birth compared to 8.1% of the unmarried adolescents. Moreover, 65.1% of the adolescents who were using contraceptives had given birth compared to only 9% of the adolescents who were not using a contraceptive. Approximately 29.4% of the adolescents who had no education had given birth compared to 9.1% who had attained secondary education. Age at first sex (18C19 years: OR: 0.221, 95% CI: 0.124C0.392; 15C17 years: OR: 0.530, 95% CI: 0.379C0.742), current age (18C19 years: OR: 4.727, 95% CI: 3.318C6.733), current marital status (Not married: OR:0.212, 95% CI: 0.150C4.780), and current contraceptive use (Using: OR 3.138, 95% CI: 2.257C4.362) were associated with adolescent fertility. CONCLUSION: The study established that age at first sex, current age, marital status, and contraceptive use are the main determinants of adolescent childbearing. The stated determinants should be targeted by the government to control the adolescent birth rate in Kenya. Consequently, delaying the age at first sex, discouraging adolescent marriage, and increasing secondary school enrollment among adolescent girls are recommended strategies to control adolescent fertility in Kenya.","output":"Adolescent fertility and its determinants in Kenya: Evidence from Kenya demographic and health survey 2014"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Siamenoside I is a rare mogroside in Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle and has become one of the target ingredients in natural sweetener production.

The major druggable targets of SARS-CoV-2 include 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike (S) protein. Molecular docking studies have highlighted that quercetin, a natural polyphenol belonging to the flavonol class, inhibits 3CLpro, PLpro and S proteins. Biophysical technics have then very recently confirmed that quercetin is reasonably a potent inhibitor of 3CLpro. The likely antiviral properties of quercetin are anyway challenged by its very poor oral bioavailability profile and any attempt to overcome this limit should be welcome. A phospholipid delivery form of quercetin (Quercetin Phytosome?) has been recently tested in humans to evaluate a possible improvement in oral bioavailability. After hydrolysis of the conjugated form (mainly glucuronide) of quercetin found in human plasma, the pharmacokinetics results have demonstrated an increased bioavailability rate by about 20-fold for total quercetin. It has been also observed that the presence of specific glucuronidase could yield free systemic quercetin in human body. Taking also into considerations its anti-inflammatory and thrombin-inhibitory actions, a bioavailable form of quercetin, like Quercetin Phytosome?, should be considered a possible candidate to clinically face COVID-19.","output":"Quercetin Phytosome? as a potential candidate for managing COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The substantial literature in political economy and sociology has shown that the increasing importance of financial activities (financialisation) exhibits significant effects on many socioeconomic conditions.

However, this approach is unable to capture more subtle topological features hidden in data, especially if those features are further masked by data transforms or significant batch effects or donor-to-donor variations in clinical data. We present that persistent homology, a mathematical structure that summarizes the topological features, can distinguish different sources of data, such as from groups of healthy donors or patients, effectively. Analysis of publicly available cytometry data describing non-na?ve CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls shows that systematic structural differences exist between single cell protein expressions in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. We identify proteins of interest by a decision-tree based classifier, sample points randomly and compute persistence diagrams from these sampled points. The resulting persistence diagrams identify regions in cytometry datasets of varying density and identify protruded structures such as elbows. We compute Wasserstein distances between these persistence diagrams for random pairs of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients and find that systematic structural differences exist between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the expression data for T-bet, Eomes, and Ki-67. Further analysis shows that expression of T-bet and Eomes are significantly downregulated in COVID-19 patient non-na?ve CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that canonical effector CD8+ T cells are less prevalent in COVID-19 patients than healthy controls.

Concise, persuasive messaging is crucial, particularly given substantial levels of vaccine hesitancy in the UK. Our aim was to test which types of written information about COVID-19 vaccination, in addition to a statement of efficacy and safety, might increase vaccine acceptance. METHODS: For this single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we aimed to recruit 15 000 adults in the UK, who were quota sampled to be representative. Participants were randomly assigned equally across ten information conditions stratified by level of vaccine acceptance (willing, doubtful, or strongly hesitant). The control information condition comprised the safety and effectiveness statement taken from the UK National Health Service website; the remaining conditions addressed collective benefit, personal benefit, seriousness of the pandemic, and safety concerns. After online provision of vaccination information, participants completed the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (outcome measure; score range 7-35) and the Oxford Vaccine Confidence and Complacency Scale (mediation measure). The primary outcome was willingness to be vaccinated. Participants were analysed in the groups they were allocated. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. The study was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN37254291. FINDINGS: From Jan 19 to Feb 5, 2021, 15 014 adults were recruited. Vaccine hesitancy had reduced from 269% the previous year to 169%, so recruitment was extended to Feb 18 to recruit 3841 additional vaccine-hesitant adults. 12 463 (661%) participants were classified as willing, 2932 (156%) as doubtful, and 3460 (184%) as strongly hesitant (ie, report that they will avoid being vaccinated for as long as possible or will never get vaccinated). Information conditions did not alter COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in those willing or doubtful (adjusted p values >070). In those strongly hesitant, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was reduced, in comparison to the control condition, by personal benefit information (mean difference -149, 95% CI -216 to -082; adjusted p=00015), directly addressing safety concerns about speed of development (-091, -158 to -023; adjusted p=00261), and a combination of all information (-086, -153 to -018; adjusted p=00313). In those strongly hesitant, provision of personal benefit information reduced hesitancy to a greater extent than provision of information on the collective benefit of not personally getting ill (-097, 95% CI -164 to -030; adjusted p=00165) or the collective benefit of not transmitting the virus (-101, -168 to -035; adjusted p=00150). Ethnicity and gender were found to moderate information condition outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In the approximately 10% of the population who are strongly hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines, provision of information on personal benefit reduces hesitancy to a greater extent than information on collective benefits. Where perception of risk from vaccines is most salient, decision making becomes centred on the personal. As such, messaging that stresses the counterbalancing personal benefits is likely to prove most effective. The messaging from this study could be used in public health communications. Going forwards, the study highlights the need for future health campaigns to engage with the public on the terrain that is most salient to them.

However, these markers are insufficient to capture the biological complexity of AKI and not necessarily inform on future risk of kidney and clinical events. Methods: Data from ASSESS-AKI was obtained and analyzed to uncover different clinical and biological signatures within AKI. We utilized a set of unsupervised machine learning algorithms incorporating a comprehensive panel of systemic and organ-specific biomarkers of inflammation, injury, and repair/health integrated into electronic data. Furthermore, the association of these novel biomarker-enriched subphenotypes with kidney and cardiovascular events and death was determined. Clinical and biomarker concentration differences among subphenotypes were evaluated via classic statistics. Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence curves were obtained to evaluate longitudinal outcomes. Results: Among 1538 patients from ASSESS-AKI, we included 748 AKI patients in the analysis. The median follow-up time was 4.8 years. We discovered 4 subphenotypes via unsupervised learning. Patients with AKI subphenotype 1 (injury cluster) were older (mean age +/- SD): 71.2 +/- 9.4 (p<0.001), with high ICU admission rates (93.9%, p<0.001) and highly prevalent cardiovascular disease (71.8%, p<0.001). They were characterized by the highest levels of KIM-1, troponin T, and ST2 compared to other clusters (P<0.001). AKI subphenotype 2 (benign cluster) is comprised of relatively young individuals with the lowest prevalence of comorbidities and highest levels of systemic anti-inflammatory makers (IL-13). AKI Subphenotype 3 (chronic inflammation and low injury) comprised patients with markedly high pro-BNP, TNFR1, and TNFR2 concentrations while presenting low concentrations of KIM-1 and NGAL. Patients with AKI subphenotype 4 (inflammation-injury) were predominantly critically ill individuals with the highest prevalence of sepsis and stage 3 AKI. They had the highest systemic (IL-1B, CRP, IL-8) and kidney inflammatory biomarker activity (YKL-40, MCP-1) as well as high kidney injury levels (NGAL, KIM-1). AKI subphenotype 3 and 4 were independently associated with a higher risk of death compared to subphenotype 2. Moreover, subphenotype 3 was independently associated with CKD outcomes and CVD events. Conclusion: We discovered four clinically meaningful AKI subphenotypes with statistical differences in biomarker composites that associate with longitudinal risks of adverse clinical events. Our approach is a novel look at the potential mechanisms underlying AKI and the putative role of biomarkers investigation.","output":"Molecular and clinical signatures in Acute Kidney Injury define distinct subphenotypes that associate with death, kidney, and cardiovascular events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zebrafish embryos are highly sensitive to toxicant exposure and have been used to evaluate the potential eco-toxicity caused by organic pollutants in the aquatic environment.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Any study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population. RESULTS: 59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure. Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes. These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis. Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed. Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity.

The analyzed cross-sectional data were collected in winter 2019 in facilities of the Diocesan Caritas Association in Germany. A sum score formed from variables measuring residents abilities to independently organize their everyday life and maintain social contacts functioned as the dependent variable. A multi-level regression analysis was performed. The results revealed that the ability of residents without dementia was significantly associated with the staff-to-resident ratio of registered nurses. This was not true for residents with dementia. For the latter, however, whether the facility offers a segregated care unit turned out to be significant. Additional and longitudinal research is indispensable to explain the inequality between the two groups analyzed.","output":"Everyday Life and Social Contacts of Dementia and Non-Dementia Residents over 80 Years in Long-Term Inpatient Care: A Multi-Level Analysis on the Effect of Staffing"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/4.md","filePath":"drive/4.md"}'),R={name:"drive/4.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
