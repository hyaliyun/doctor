These enticing pluripotent stem cells (comprising both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells) have been successfully used to generate a wide array of hematopoietic cells in vitro, from primitive hematoendothelial precursors to mature myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid lineage cells. However, to date, PSC-derived cells have demonstrated only limited potential for long-term multilineage hematopoietic engraftment in vivo - the test by which putative HSCs are defined. Successful generation and characterization of HSCs from hPSCs not only requires an efficient in vitro differentiation system that provides insight into the developmental fate of hPSC-derived cells, but also necessitates an in vivo engraftment model that allows identification of specific mechanisms that hinder or promote hematopoietic engraftment. In this chapter, we will describe a method that utilizes firefly luciferase-expressing hPSCs and bioluminescent imaging to noninvasively track the survival, proliferation, and migration of transplanted hPSC-derived cells.

METHODS: To describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with comorbid respiratory diseases, who have been primarily hospitalized in the pulmonology department of Strasbourg University Hospital, France. In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological findings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60%) were male. Overall, 40% of patients (n=50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=15, 12%) and asthma (n=19, 15%). Twenty-eight patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and six patients died in our unit. CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a significantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6% vs. 5.5%, P<0.05) in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD.

Specifically, we create a graph where nodes correspond to a country's regions and the edge weights denote human mobility from one region to another. Then, we employ graph neural networks to predict the number of future cases, encoding the underlying diffusion patterns that govern the spread into our learning model. Furthermore, to account for the limited amount of training data, we capitalize on the pandemic's asynchronous outbreaks across countries and use a model-agnostic meta-learning based method to transfer knowledge from one country's model to another's. We compare the proposed approach against simple baselines and more traditional forecasting techniques in 3 European countries.

Methods: All adult patients who were placed on ECMO for ARDS due to COVID -19 between April 2020 and June 2020 (during the first wave of COVID-19) were identified. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients were analyzed with a specific focus on the differences between patients who survived to hospital discharge and those who did not. Results: 20 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. All patients were placed on veno-veno ECMO. Comparing between survivors and non-survivors, older age was associated with hospital mortality (p=0.02). The following complications were observed: renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (35%, n=7), bacteremia during ECMO (20%, n=4),coinfection with bacterial pneumonia (15%, n=3), cannula site bleeding (15%, n=3), stroke (10%, n=2), gastrointestinal bleeding (10%, n=2), and liver failure (5%, n=1). The complications associated with patient mortality were culture positive septic shock (p=0.01), culture-negative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (p=0.01), and renal failure (p=0.01). The causes of death were septic shock (44%, n=4), culture-negative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (44%, n=4), and stroke (11%, n=1). Conclusions: Based on our experience, ECMO can improve refractory ARDS due to COVID-19 in select patients.

Twenty-eight preadolescent female gymnasts were examined. Self-esteem tests were used to analyze body image perception. Preworkout eating habits were examined by short food frequency questions (FFQ) validated for children. The biomarker of the bone resorption C-terminal telopeptide region of collagen type 1 (CTX) was measured in the urine (fasting, postmeal and postworkout). Gymnasts reported higher satisfaction with their body appearance compared to sedentary peers. Of the gymnasts, 30% did not have a preworkout meal regularly, and the timing of the consumption was variable. Bone resorption was decreased by the HCM, consumed 90 min before the training, with respect to the HPM.

RECENT FINDINGS The global pandemic, a result of the widespread implications of SARS-CoV-2, remains a significant burden to current healthcare systems. Fever, dyspnea, and tussive symptoms have primarily been recognized as the most common presenting signs/symptoms. During the past one year our scope of practice has transcended beyond the management of the respiratory system to incorporate other varying systemic manifestations such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The outcomes reported by recent studies suggest an association between the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and important clinical factors such as delay in presentation, disease severity, and mortality. SUMMARY We provide a summarization of the most recent in-depth investigations of coronavirus disease 2019 with gastrointestinal manifestations and their conclusions. Although the pathophysiology remains an area of evolving interest, a better understanding of this disease process may allow for early recognition, efficient triage, and improved prognostication for those presenting with gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Gastrointestinal manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine how well comorbid depression is described, defined, and measured in the rehabilitation literature that pertains to TBI and depression.Method: Scoping review of the rehabilitation sciences literature.

However, the physical and biological properties of this compound as an antioxidant or antiaging agent have not been reported yet. Methods: In addition to in vitro assays, we monitored antioxidative and antiaging signals in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (yeast) and mouse melanoma B16F10 cells. Results: A. lavenia water and chloroform fractions showed antioxidant properties in vitro. The A. lavenia extracts and 11OH-KA conferred resistance to H2O2to S. pombe and B16F10 cells and extended the yeast lifespan in a concentration-dependent manner. These materials maintained the yeast mitochondrial activity, even in a high-glucose medium, and induced an antioxidant gene program, the transcriptional factor pap1+and its downstream ctt1+. Accordingly, 11OH-KA activated the antioxidative transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2, NRF2, the mammalian ortholog of pap1+, in B16F10 cells, which was accompanied by enhanced hemeoxygenase expression levels. These results suggest that 11OH-KA and A. lavenia extracts may protect yeast and mammalian cells from oxidative stress and aging.

At the end of the quarantine, the patients were asked to complete a questionnaire in order to reveal whether they felt safe or alone, their anxiety status, and their preferred method of communicating with the team. In addition, volume status, biochemical parameters, blood pressure and medications in December 2019 were reviewed and compared with those in June 2020. Results: A total of 60 patients, 32 of whom were female, with a mean age of 53.416 years were included in the study. While there were 24 (40%) patients who underwent remote controlled outpatient peritoneal dialysis (RK-APD), there were 36 (60%) patients who underwent continuous APD (CAPD). According to the survey results, 15 (25%) patients did not experience any anxiety, while 45 patients stated that they had varying degrees of anxiety. 85% of the patients reported that they were very pleased that they could continue their dialysis treatment at home. While 69.4% of the patients who underwent CAPD were worried that they could not be followed as closely during the quarantine, 70.8% of the patients who underwent RK-APD stated that they felt safe because their treatment was monitored by the team through the system. While there was only an increase in the daily amount of ultrafiltration in RK-APD patients (December 2019 and June 2020;1,365 vs 1,514 mL, p=0.026), no difference was observed in CAPD patients.

This work provides a practical mechanism for prioritizing geographic areas for insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution campaigns in settings with limited resources. METHODS: A GIS-based weighted approach was adopted to categorize and rank administrative units based on data that can be applied in various country contexts where Plasmodium falciparum transmission is reported. Malaria intervention and risk factors were used to rank local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria for prioritization during mass ITN distribution campaigns. Each factor was assigned a unique weight that was obtained through application of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The weight was then multiplied by a value based on natural groupings inherent in the data, or the presence or absence of a given intervention. Risk scores for each factor were then summated to generate a composite unique risk score for each LGA. This risk score was translated into a prioritization map which ranks each LGA from low to high priority in terms of timing of ITN distributions. RESULTS: A case study using data from Nigeria showed that a major component that influenced the prioritization scheme was ITN access. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that changes to the methodology used to quantify ITN access did not modify outputs substantially. Some 120 LGAs were categorized as extremely high or high priority when a spatially interpolated ITN access layer was used. When prioritization scores were calculated using DHS-reported state level ITN access, 108 (90.0%) of the 120 LGAs were also categorized as being extremely high or high priority. The geospatial heterogeneity found among input risk factors suggests that a range of variables and covariates should be considered when using data to inform ITN distributions. CONCLUSION: The authors provide a tool for prioritizing regions in terms of timing of ITN distributions. It serves as a base upon which a wider range of vector control interventions could be targeted. Its value added can be found in its potential for application in multiple country contexts, expediated timeframe for producing outputs, and its use of systematically collected malaria indicators in informing prioritization.

Hence there is a marked knowledge gap that requires urgent attention. Therefore, in this systematic review, viability/stability of airborne SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses is discussed. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus to assess the stability and viability of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 on air samples. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The initial search identified 27 articles. Following screening of titles and abstracts and removing duplicates, 11 articles were considered relevant. Temperatures ranging from 20 C to 25 C and relative humidity ranging from 40% to 50% were reported to have a protective effect on viral viability for airborne SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. As no data is yet available on the conditions influencing viability for airborne SARS-CoV-2, and given the genetic similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, one could extrapolate that the same conditions would apply. Nonetheless, the effect of these conditions seems to be residual considering the increasing number of cases in the south of USA, Brazil and India, where high temperatures and humidities have been observed. CONCLUSION: Higher temperatures and high relative humidity can have a modest effect on SARS-CoV-2 viability in the environment, as reported in previous studies to this date. However, these studies are experimental, and do not support the fact that the virus has efficiently spread in the tropical regions of the globe, with other transmission routes such as the contact and droplet ones probably being responsible for the majority of cases reported in these regions, along with other factors such as human mobility patterns and contact rates.

Her father (Patient 1) developed a fever and respiratory system symptoms and was confirmed COVID-19-positive on February 4-5, 2020 at Zengcheng People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China. Seven close-contact family members of the patients were then screened for COVID-19 on February 5-6 at the hospital. The CT imaging manifestation and laboratory tests of this family cluster were investigated and reported. Results Five (62.5%) of the 8 family members were confirmed COVID-19-positive. Except for Patient 1, who had fever, cough, fatigue, and dizziness, the remaining four (4/5, 80%) COVID-19-positive family members (Patients 2-5) had no clinical symptoms. Among the 5 patients, 2 had leukopenia (2/5, 40%), 1 had low absolute neutrophil counts (1/5, 20%), and 2 had increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (2/5, 40%).

Given the high social, educational, psychological, and economic costs of NPIs, authorities tune them, alternatively tightening up or relaxing rules, with the result that, in effect, a relatively flat infection rate results. For example, during the summer in parts of the United States, daily COVID-19 infection numbers dropped to a plateau. This paper approaches NPI tuning as a control-theoretic problem, starting from a simple dynamic model for social distancing based on the classical SIR epidemics model. Using a singular-perturbation approach, the plateau becomes a Quasi-Steady-State (QSS) of a reduced two-dimensional SIR model regulated by adaptive dynamic feedback. It is shown that the QSS can be assigned and it is globally asymptotically stable. Interestingly, the dynamic model for social distancing can be interpreted as a nonlinear integral controller. Problems of data fitting and parameter identifiability are also studied for this model. The paper also discusses how this simple model allows for a meaningful study of the effect of population size, vaccinations, and the emergence of second waves.

SARS-CoV-1 E has 93.42% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 E and shared a conserved domain NS3/small envelope protein (NS3_envE). Amiloride analog hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) can inhibit SARS-CoV-1 E. Therefore, we performed molecular docking and dynamics simulations to explore whether amiloride analogs are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 E.

The association between the health domain concerns reported and age at consultation, cancer diagnoses, and time since diagnosis was analyzed using chi-square test of independence in SPSS. RESULTS: In our cohort of 1128 AYA, the median age at assessment was 28.2 years. The most common diagnoses were lymphoma (n = 251, 22.2%), leukemia (n = 207, 18.4%), and breast cancer (n = 162, 14.4%). The most common concerns reported were related to fertility (n = 882, 78.2%) and work/school (n = 472, 41.8%). Fertility concerns were most common in 25C34 age group (443/540, 82.0%) and work-/school-related concerns were highest in 18C24 age group (191/355, 53.8%). Diagnoses significantly affect majority of concerns reported. Fertility concerns were most common in AYA consulted near diagnosis, while body image-, exercise-, and diet-related concerns were more frequently reported, while on active treatments.

Thus, the role of student characteristics has in many ways been underappreciated in even highly sophisticated quantitative education research. Conversely, educational and institutional factors are not as prominent in studies focused on cognitive aptitudes, as these fields focus first on reasoning capacity, and secondarily on other factors.

In the first step, convolution sparse coding with the coordinate selection of samples and features is designed to learn speech structure from the source domain to replenish sample information of the target domain. In the second step, joint local structure distribution alignment is designed to maintain the neighbor relationship between the respective samples of the training set and test set, and reduce the distribution difference between the two domains at the same time. Two representative public PD speech datasets and one real-world PD speech dataset were exploited to verify the proposed method on PD speech diagnosis.

Furthermore, CT imaging appearances are correlated with patients presenting with different clinical scenarios, such as early versus advanced stages, asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients, and severe versus nonsevere situations. However, its role as a screening and diagnostic tool in COVID-19 remains to be clarified. This article provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature on chest CT imaging findings with the aim of highlighting the contribution and judicious use of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19. A search of PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Scopus was performed to identify studies reporting chest imaging findings in COVID-19. Chest imaging abnormalities associated with COVID-19 were extracted from the eligible studies and diagnostic value of CT in detecting these abnormal changes was compared between studies consisting of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. A random-effects model was used to perform meta-analysis for calculation of pooled mean values and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of abnormal imaging findings. Fifty-five studies met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. Pulmonary lesions more often involved bilateral lungs (78%, 95% CI: 45-100%) and were more likely to have a peripheral (65.35%, 95% CI: 25.93-100%) and peripheral plus central distribution (31.12%, 95% CI: 1.96-74.07%), but less likely to have a central distribution (3.57%, 95% CI: 0.99-9.80%). Ground glass opacities (GGO) (58.05%, 95% CI: 16.67-100%), consolidation (44.18%, 95% CI: 1.61-71.46%) and GGO plus consolidation (52.99%, 95% CI: 19.05-76.79%) were the most common findings reported in 94.5% (52/55) of the studies, followed by air bronchogram (42.50%, 95% CI: 7.78-80.39%), linear opacities (41.29%, 95% CI: 7.44-65.06%), crazy-paving pattern (23.57%, 95% CI: 3.13-91.67%) and interlobular septal thickening (22.91%, 95% CI: 0.90-80.49%).

It is reported that 51% of initial transurethral resection of bladder tumors (iTURBT) does not contain muscle, which results in higher rates of clinical upstaging on repeat transurethral resection (reTUR) and worse oncologic outcomes. Presence of muscle on iTURBT specimen and performing reTUR within 6 weeks in high-risk NMIBC aids in accurate staging and, therefore, guides proper treatment. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to assess and improve TURBT quality by making surgeons aware of their practice patterns and setting improvement goals. METHODS Patients who received TURBT for a newly diagnosed bladder mass were analyzed by retrospective chart review for 9 months prior to quality improvement (QI) intervention. Data were collected pertaining to muscle presence/absence on biopsy, pathology of the tumor, risk stratification, whether reTUR was indicated, and time to reTUR. The primary endpoints were the presence of muscle on initial TURBT, whether a reTUR was performed when clinically indicated, and time to reTUR. Tumors requiring reTUR were defined as being HGT1 or HGTa >3 cm. The QI intervention, physician education, was then implemented by presenting initial performance results to the physicians, and a second dataset was then collected by prospective analysis for another 9 months to assess for changes in practice patterns. A total of 101 patients receiving TURBT were reviewed, including 52 patients prior to and 49 patients following QI intervention. Patients with a history of, or treatment for, bladder cancer were excluded, along with those without assessment of muscle on pathological analysis. Fisher's exact test was utilized to determine differences in categorical data by comparing each of the following groups prior to and following QI intervention: percent of muscle presence on iTURBT, percent reTUR performed when indicated, and mean time to reTUR in days. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS After comparing the TURBT results before and after our QI intervention, we found a significant improvement in the number of patients receiving a reTUR when indicated, with 5/13 (38.5%) before compared to 15/19 (78.9%) after, p=0.03. The number of specimens on iTURBT with muscle present were not significantly different, with 38/52 (73.1%) before and 33/49 (67.3%) after, p=0.66. The average time to reTUR before (32.4 days; n=5; range, 21-50 days) and after (42.4 days; n=15; range, 11-77 days) QI intervention was also not significantly different, p=0.28. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that critical analysis of physician practice patterns followed by education and setting improvement goals can significantly impact clinical practices and improve quality of care.

PURPOSE: To longitudinally evaluate COVID-19 vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy on axillary US at various time intervals, in both mRNA and vector vaccine recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted between March 2021 and January 2022. The participants were asymptomatic women without breast cancer who had received COVID-19 vaccination. Serial follow-up US was performed in women manifesting lymphadenopathy. Following variables were assessed: cortical thickness, number of lymph nodes, morphology, and Doppler signal. Temporal changes in cortical thickness and number of lymph nodes during follow-up were assessed using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Ninety-one women with lymphadenopathy in the vaccinated arm had undergone a total of 215 serial US (mean age, 44 years 13). Fifty-one participants had received vector vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine) and 40 mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 vaccine [n=37] and mRNA-1273 vaccine [n=3]). Except for three women with follow-up loss, eighty-eight women underwent serial US and complete resolution of axillary lymphadenopathy at median 6 weeks interval (range, 4-7 weeks) was observed in 26% (23 of 88) of women. Of 49 women with follow-up US at median 12 weeks interval (range, 8-14 weeks), persistent lymphadenopathy was observed in 51% (25 of 49). During the follow-up period, the cortical thickness gradually decreased (P < .001) over time regardless of vaccine type; however, values were higher in recipients of the mRNA vaccine than in recipients of the vector vaccine (P = .02). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine-associated axillary lymphadenopathy frequently persisted over 6 weeks on US. Lymphadenopathy should be interpreted considering vaccine type and time elapsed since vaccination. Follow-up US examination at least 12 weeks after vaccination may be reasonable, particularly for recipients of the mRNA vaccine. ?

Many hospitals experienced severe bed shortages; some had to turn patients away. In Singapore, the widespread outbreak, especially among the dormitory-based population, created a pressing need for alternative care sites. PROGRAM The first massive-scale community care facility (CCF) was started in Singapore to address the pandemic. It served as a low-acuity primary care center that could isolate and treat COVID-19-positive patients with mild disease. This allowed decompression of the patient load in hospitals, ensuring that those with more severe disease could receive timely medical attention. IMPLEMENTATION Various groups from the private and public sectors, including health care, construction, security, hotel management, and project coordination, were involved in the setup and operations of the CCF. A large exhibition center was converted into the care facility and segregated into zones to reduce cross-contamination. State-of-the-art technological infrastructure for health management was used. Several paraclinical services were made available. EVALUATION The CCF was a timely and robust response that fulfilled several crucial functions, including cohort isolation, triage, basic medical care, and timely reviews and escalation of patients. It placed a unique focus on promoting patient ownership, responsibility, and mental well-being. It was largely successful, with a low hospital transfer rate of 0.37%.

Patients with olfactory dysfunction often describe life as living in 2D, with lasting effects on eating habits and relationships. The aim of this project was to establish a novel Post-Covid-19 smell clinic for patients, which monitored any changes relating to olfactory dysfunction and to provide advice on management of the condition for these patients with Long-Covid. METHOD: The smell clinic was set up based on BRS guidelines. Patients were asked to carry out the UPSIT smell test and eODQ questionnaire. Patients were then advised to carry out smell retraining for 4 months and pointed to appropriate resources. We analysed patients presentations to identify patterns that may identify patients who are likely to suffer long term olfactory dysfunction following Covid-19 infection. Parameters including prevalence of parosmia, cacosmia, dysgeusia, demographics were collected.

Because of this, it is important to investigate COVID-19 mortality and its predictors in one of the most densely populated regions of the country, Silesia Province. OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to assess in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19 and the impact of sex, age, and coexisting diseases on the risk of death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data analysis was based on discharge reports of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized between March and June 2020 in all hospitals in the region. Age, sex, hospital discharge status, and the presence of coexisting diseases were abstracted from the charts. RESULTS: In a group of 2830 in-patients with COVID-19, 325 died during hospitalization. COVID-19 deaths were associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.17-1.96), older age (OR, 6.11; 95% CI, 4.5-8.31), and the presence of 3 or more coexisting diseases (OR, 4.78; 95% CI, 3.52-6.49). The most prevalent comorbidities were chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated in-hospital fatality rate for COVID-19 was 11.5%, which is lower than the average COVID-19 fatality rate in other European countries.

We evaluated the epidemiological situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents of the biggest urban multiethnic indigenous community of the Amazonas state, Brazil. Blood samples of 280 indigenous people living in the surrounding area of Manaus were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA or IgG antibodies. The risk factors and sociodemographic information were assessed through an epidemiological questionnaire. We found a total positivity rate of 64.64% (95% CI 59.01C70.28) for SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgA and IgG were detected in 55.71% (95% CI 49.89C61.54) and 60.71% (95% CI 54.98C66.45) of the individuals, respectively. Over 80% of positive individuals were positive for both IgA and IgG.No significant difference in positivity rates between genders or age groups was observed. Moreover, the age group  60 years old showed the highest antibody ratios (IgA mean ratio = 3.080  1.623; IgG mean ratio = 4.221  1.832), while the age groups 13C19 and 20C29 showed the lowest IgA (mean ratio = 2.268  0.919) and IgG ratios (mean ratio = 2.207  1.246), respectively. Individuals leaving the home more frequently were at higher risk of infection (Odds ratio (OD) 2.61; 95% CI 1.00C1.49; p = 0.048). Five or more individuals per household increased fivefold the risk of virus transmission (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.09C6.01; p = 0.019). The disproportionate dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed among the study population might be driven by typical cultural behavior and socioeconomic inequalities.

It is unknown if these patients should be considered a vulnerable group in healthcare delivery and healthcare recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the following question: In which hospitalised patients with proven COVID-19 and with underlying CVD and cardiovascular risk factors should doctors be alert to a poor outcome? Relevant outcome measures were mortality and intensive care unit admission. Medline and Embase databases were searched using relevant search terms until 9 June 2020. After systematic analysis, 8 studies were included. RESULTS: Based on the literature search, there was insufficient evidence that CVD and cardiovascular risk factors are significant predictors of mortality and poor outcome in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Due to differences in methodology, the level of evidence of all studies was graded 'very low' according to the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. It is expected that in the near future, two multinational and multicentre European registries (CAPACITY-COVID and LEOSS) will offer more insight into outcome in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: This literature review demonstrated there was insufficient evidence to identify CVD and cardiovascular risk factors as important predictors of poor outcome in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. However, patients with CVD and cardiovascular risk factors remain vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks.

The lockdowns that took place in 2020, especially, have had a major impact on cities, transforming urban lifestyles, economic activities and mobility. Logistics became a priority activity. Faced with changed levels and types of consumption, freight and logistics operators in cities had to adapt, while logistics real estate developers had to face challenges related to building sites closed and regulatory and licensing processes delayed. Our main research in this paper is to characterize the way the urban freight and logistics system coped with the new situation. We focused on French cities, with Paris and the Paris metropolitan area as the main case. We implemented three surveys during and after the first lockdown in France (MarchCMay 2020), with the views of identifying challenges while characterizing stakeholders response to the challenges. The three surveys took different and complementary forms, covering various categories of stakeholders: freight carriers (from small to large); third party logistics providers; on-demand delivery platforms; policy-makers; and logistics real-estate developers. We found out that operators adapted quickly and overall successfully, one major difference being between delivery operators and property developers. The first group experienced higher levels of financial and economic challenges; the second group experienced difficult relationships with administrations and regulations, while enjoying a rather high level of activity. The ability of local governments to deal with urban logistics challenges during the lockdowns was diverse and took several unexpected forms.","output":"Response to COVID-19 lockdowns from urban freight stakeholders: An analysis from three surveys in 2020 in France, and policy implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, physicians in residency and fellowship training programs are serving as essential healthca","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physicians in Residency and Fellowship Programs: Results of an International Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Object: The pipeline embolization device (PED) has been used to treat non-saccular, unruptured, intradural vertebral artery aneurysms at some institutions. However, there is an absence of large controlled studies validating the feasibility of this treatment. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic feasibility of PED by comparing PED treatment with controlled stent-assisted coiling (SAC). Materials and Methods: Thirty-two PED procedures were matched in a 1:2 manner with 64 SAC procedures based on patient age, sex, aneurysm size, and aneurysm location. Technical factors, procedural complications, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were analyzed and compared. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in technical factors and procedural complications between the two groups (PED vs. SAC, 9.4 vs. 4.7%, P = 0.397). In multivariate analysis, smoking and therapeutic modality were identified as independent predictors of occlusion. Smoking was a risk factor for aneurysm obliteration [hazard ratio (HR) 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31-0.89; P = 0.018]. Aneurysms treated with PED were more likely to achieve obliteration over time compared with aneurysms treated with SAC (HR 2.97; 95% CI, 1.79-4.93; P < 0.001). The rate of favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS), 0-2) was similar between the two groups (PED vs. SAC, 100 vs. 96.9%, P = 0.551). In the SAC group, one patient had neurological deficit with an mRS of four at the latest follow-up. There was no mortality in either group. Conclusions: The PED and SAC groups showed similar technical factors, procedural complications, angiographic results, and favorable clinical outcomes. Aneurysms treated with PED were more prone to obliteration over time than aneurysms treated with SAC. These outcomes suggest, based on short-term follow-up, PED is a safe and feasible strategy for the treatment of non-saccular, unruptured, intradural vertebral artery aneurysms.","output":"Exploring the Feasibility of Pipeline Embolization Device Compared With Stent-Assisted Coiling to Treat Non-saccular, Unruptured, Intradural Vertebral Artery Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to significantly impact burns patients both directly through infective complications of an immunocompromised cohort, and indirectly through disruption of care pathways and resource limitations. The pandemic presents new challenges that must be overcome to maintain patient safety; in particular, the potential increased risks of surgical intervention, anaesthesia and ventilation. This study comprehensively reviews the measures implemented to adapt referral pathways and mitigate the risk posed by COVID-19 during the height of the pandemic, within a large Burns Centre. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was designed to assess patients treated at the Burns Centre during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020), following implementation of new safety measures. All patients were analysed for 30-day mortality. In addition, a prospective controlled cohort study was undertaken on all inpatients and a random sample of outpatients with telephone follow-up at 30 days. These patients were divided into three groups (operative inpatients, non-operative inpatients, outpatients). COVID-19 related data collected included test results, contact with proven cases, isolation status and symptoms. The implemented departmental service COVID-19 safety adaptations are described. RESULTS: Of 323 patients treated at the Burns Centre during the study period, no 30-day COVID-19 related deaths occurred (0/323).

The mode of action, the preparation methods, characterization of these carbohydrate-containing NPs and the corresponding vaccines are presented. EXPERT OPINION Several carbohydrate-containing NPs have entered the clinical stage or have been used in licensed vaccines for human use. Saponin-containing NPs are being evaluated in a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing the on-going worldwide pandemic. Vaccines with carbohydrate-containing NPs are in different stages of development, from preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials. A better understanding of the mode of action for carbohydrate-containing NPs as vaccine carriers and as immunostimulators will likely contribute to the design and development of new generation vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases.","output":"Carbohydrate-containing nanoparticles as vaccine adjuvants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences among refugees living in camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. Projections of the potential COVID-19 infection burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical to inform preparedness planning. Methods: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic disease transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the number and daily rate of infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected under each scenario. Findings: A large-scale outbreak is highly likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp across scenarios with 65-95% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 infections. Estimated infections range from 119-504 between low and high transmission scenarios in the first 30 days; and between 424,798 and 543,647 in 12 months. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 58-139 days between the low and high transmission scenarios. Estimated deaths range from 1,647-2,109 between low and high transmission scenarios. Interpretation: A COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring unrealistically large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.

Deprescribing (reducing or stopping medications for which potential harms outweigh potential benefits) may decrease their risk of adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of increasing patient and clinician awareness about the potential to deprescribe unnecessary or risky medications among patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic, patient-centered, 12-month cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, at 18 primary care clinics in a not-for-profit integrated health care delivery system. The study included 3012 adults aged 65 years or older with dementia or mild cognitive impairment who had 1 or more additional chronic medical conditions and were taking 5 or more long-term medications. INTERVENTIONS: An educational brochure and a questionnaire on attitudes toward deprescribing were mailed to patients prior to a primary care visit, clinicians were notified about the mailing, and deprescribing tip sheets were distributed to clinicians at monthly clinic meetings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The number of prescribed long-term medications and the percentage of individuals prescribed 1 or more potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: This study comprised 1433 individuals (806 women [56.2%]; mean [SD] age, 80.1 [7.2] years) in 9 intervention clinics and 1579 individuals (874 women [55.4%]; mean [SD] age, 79.9 [7.5] years) in 9 control clinics who met the eligibility criteria. At baseline, both groups were prescribed a similar mean (SD) number of long-term medications (7.0 [2.1] in the intervention group and 7.0 [2.2] in the control group), and a similar proportion of individuals in both groups were taking 1 or more PIMs (437 of 1433 individuals [30.5%] in the intervention group and 467 of 1579 individuals [29.6%] in the control group). At 6 months, the adjusted mean number of long-term medications was similar in the intervention and control groups (6.4 [95% CI, 6.3-6.5] vs 6.5 [95% CI, 6.4-6.6]; P = .14). The estimated percentages of patients in the intervention and control groups taking 1 or more PIMs were similar (17.8% [95% CI, 15.4%-20.5%] vs 20.9% [95% CI, 18.4%-23.6%]; P = .08). In preplanned subgroup analyses, adjusted differences between the intervention and control groups were C0.16 (95% CI, C0.34 to 0.01) for individuals prescribed 7 or more long-term medications at baseline (n = 1434) and C0.03 (95% CI, C0.20 to 0.13) for those prescribed 5 to 6 medications (n = 1578) (P = .28 for interaction; P = .19 for subgroup interaction for PIMs). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This large-scale educational deprescribing intervention for older adults with cognitive impairment taking 5 or more long-term medications and their primary care clinicians demonstrated small effect sizes and did not significantly reduce the number of long-term medications and PIMs. Such interventions should target older adults taking relatively more medications.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was most strongly associated with the overall critical condition (RR = 4.22, 95% CI = 3.12-5.69), followed by cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR = 3.00, 95% CI = 2.41-3.73), malignancy (RR = 2.91, 95% CI = 2.16-3.91), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (RR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.95-4.19), diabetes (RR = 2.10, 95% CI = 2.16-3.91), hypertension (RR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.82-2.23), and chronic kidney disease (RR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.36-2.94). The presence of comorbidities except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease significantly increased the risk of severe infection, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and cardiac injury in the subgroup analysis by types of critical conditions. Preexisting hypertension and diabetes additionally increased the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among comorbidities, COPD had the highest probability of leading to severe COVID-19, ICU admission, and liver injury, while malignancy was most likely to cause ARDS and cardiac injury.

This study aims to investigate the community pharmacists' preparedness and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and how efficiently they were prepared to contain and prevent the spread of infection. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Jordan through social media platforms. A scoring system was developed to measure their level of adherence to the preventive measures of the global infection. RESULTS: The total included responses were 800. Around 44% of the pharmacists reported spending less than 15 min/d reading about COVID-19 updates. Although more than half of them were reviewing official sites, 73% of them were also retrieving information through non-official channels. Additionally, almost 35% of them were directly contacting customers without physical barriers, 81% reported encountering infected customers, and 12% wore the same facial masks for more than a day. Moreover, 58% of the pharmacies reported the absence of door signs requesting infected customers to declare the infection, 43% of the pharmacies were not limiting the number of simultaneous customers, and 70% were not measuring customers' temperatures prior to entry. Collectively, the mean total score of applied protective measures was 10.12  2.77 (out of 17). CONCLUSION: The level of preparedness of the community pharmacies in these three Middle Eastern countries was not adequate for facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities in these countries should closely monitor their adherence to the protective guidelines.","output":"Community pharmacists' preparedness and responses to COVID-19 pandemic: A multinational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Restricting youth access to tobacco is an essential component of a comprehensive tobacco control policy.

Estimates show that, together with ancillary sectors, the tourism industry is expected to contribute approximately 6.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2025. These emissions are primarily a result of tourists favouring air travel and luxury experiences that require more energy outputs. Additionally, tourism continues to grow and has become a routine activity for the middle class who travel more regularly on an annual basis. With growing middle classes in many developing countries, the number of tourists who will be able to afford recreational travel is estimated to increase exponentially. The pressures and demands of increasing tourist numbers can strain vulnerable natural sites. These predictions show that changes within the tourism industry fabric are necessary. Against this backdrop, this research employs a combined methodology. A survey methodology was employed to explore tourist attitudes towards tourism sites and their behaviours and decision making with a top-down and bottom-up approach. Additionally, an interview methodology of tourism field experts was employed to investigate the attitudes of the industry and how consumer behaviours may be influenced. Findings from the survey and interview discussions were employed to inform four managerial aspects. First, the ticket price of the tourist experience should be proportional to the value proposition of the experience. Second, a government-led framework could guide businesses towards sustainable management and educate their tourists on greener practices. Third, businesses could integrate sustainability issues into their marketing and advertising to create awareness and ensure the longevity of the site.

We analysed whether anosmia predicts in-hospital mortality; and if patients with anosmia have a different clinical presentation, inflammatory response, or disease severity. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including all consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 from March 8th to April 11th, 2020. We determined all-cause mortality and need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We registered the first and worst laboratory parameters. Statistical analysis was done by multivariate logistic and linear regression. RESULTS: We included 576 patients, 43.3% female, and aged 67.2 years in mean. Anosmia was present in 146 (25.3%) patients. Patients with anosmia were more frequently females, younger and less disabled and had less frequently hypertension, diabetes, smoking habit, cardiac and neurological comorbidities. Anosmia was independently associated with lower mortality (OR: 0.180, 95% CI: 0.069-0.472) and ICU admission (OR: 0.438, 95% CI: 0.229-0.838, p = 0.013). In the multivariate analysis, patients with anosmia had a higher frequency of cough (OR: 1.96, 95%CI: 1.18-3.28), headache (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.66-4.03), and myalgia (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.12-2.71).

Objective To evaluate whether the goals of the EV-D68 pilot were met and to determine the benefits of and lessons learned from a rapid-response surveillance system for emerging pathogens. Methods An evaluation survey was created and administered via a secure online link. All provinces and territories (PTs) and federal partners involved in the pilot were invited to complete one survey per jurisdiction (N=17). Proportions were calculated for responses to closed-ended questions and recurring themes were identified for open-ended questions. Results Fifty four percent (7/13) of PTs and 50% (2/4) of federal partners completed the survey. All four goals of the pilot were met to some degree. All respondents agreed that there were important benefits to rapid surveillance initiatives for emerging pathogens including the capacity to: better understand the epidemiological and clinical features as well as the public health risk of emerging pathogens (66.7%); inform public health action (66.7%); collaborate and avoid duplication of work (11.1%); test and develop jurisdictional capacity (11.1%); and inform future response efforts (11.1%). Receiving timely case summaries (preferably weekly) was identified as important for 88% of respondents. In terms of lessons learned, more than half of respondents (66.7%) indicated that current processes needed to be improved in order to facilitate rapid surveillance initiatives within and across jurisdictions including the need to develop data-sharing agreements and have pre-existing protocols. Important factors identified for a surveillance data reporting platform included: ease of functionality, data security, jurisdictional control, web-based and flexibility to meet changing surveillance needs.

Abstract During a pandemic, the three basic principles are; to prioritise medical resources, ensure patient lockdown in order to avoid community transmission and prevent healthcare collapse, and keep the number of visits to an absolute minimum to avoid patient exposure and safeguard healthcare workers. Antenatal care must be maintained during a health crisis, regardless of the COVID-19 state of alert. Routine and specialist obstetric ultrasound scans are essential for clinical decision-making during pregnancy, as it has a direct impact on the management of mothers and the foetuses and on the perinatal outcome. In an attempt to minimise in-person visits, these will be organised according to the established ultrasound schedule. Based on scientific evidence, and on existing main national and international guidelines, this document has been prepared, in which proposals and options are provided for managing pregnant women in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It includes measured for how a Foetal Medicine Unit in this health crisis should be restructured, the safety measures that should be followed in the performance of obstetric scans and invasive procedures, and how the ultrasound rooms, equipment, and transducers, should be cleaned and disinfected. These recommendations should be adapted to different units, based on their resources and infrastructure.","output":"Cmo reestructurar una Seccin de Medicina Fetal en tiempos de pandemia COVID-19.

In a sense, consumers believe that if sugar does not appear as an ingredient on the product label, but is intrinsic in the food (and will appear as a nutrient), it is 'good'. As an ingredient, however, it is viewed as a 'bad chemical' associated with tooth decay and obesity. The reality is that unless processing induced modifications have occurred, the sugar molecule within a plant tissue is the same molecule structure as present in purified sugar. The same calorific value. However, there is an argument that humans eat too refined food and that if sugars were eaten in their natural context (e.g. within a fruit), their presence and concentration would be in harmony (where different nutrients complement and balance the sugar concentration) with the human body. This reflects the process of eating, satiety, presence of other nutrients (including water) and the associated impact of the indigestible components of plant foods on the transit/nutrient bioavailability control and thus benefits through the gut. The authors explore these issues in this article and seek to provide a scientific basis to different sides of the argument - sugar is good or bad depending on how (in which format and how much/how concentrated) it is consumed. More importantly perhaps, how should sugar consumption - an important nutrient - be managed to optimize the benefits but reduce the disadvantages? ? 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.","output":"Is sugar extracted from plants less healthy than sugar consumed within plant tissues?

These events pose serious threats to public health due to time lags in developing vaccines to activate the acquired immune system. The high variability of peoples symptomatic responses to viral infections, as illustrated in the current COVID-19 pandemic, indicates the potential to moderate the severity of morbidity from VRIs. Growing evidence supports roles for probiotic bacteria (PB) and prebiotic dietary fiber (DF) and other plant nutritional bioactives in modulating immune functions. While human studies help to understand the epidemiology and immunopathology of VRIs, the chaotic nature of viral transmissions makes it difficult to undertake mechanistic study where the pre-conditioning of the metabolic and immune system could be beneficial. However, recent experimental studies have significantly enhanced our understanding of how PB and DF, along with plant bioactives, can significantly modulate innate and acquired immunity responses to VRIs. Synbiotic combinations of PB and DF potentiate increased benefits primarily through augmenting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate. These and specific plant polyphenolics help to regulate immune responses to both restrain VRIs and temper the neutrophil response that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This review highlights the current understanding of the potential impact of targeted nutritional strategies in setting a balanced immune tone for viral clearance and reinforcing homeostasis. This knowledge may guide the development of public health tactics and the application of functional foods with PB and DF components as a nutritional approach to support countering VRI morbidity.","output":"Microbiota Modulating Nutritional Approaches to Countering the Effects of Viral Respiratory Infections Including SARS-CoV-2 through Promoting Metabolic and Immune Fitness with Probiotics and Plant Bioactives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experience with urban social protection programmes is relatively limited in the Global South. Extensions or duplicates of rural social assistance programmes do not reflect the distinct vulnerabilities of the urban poor, who face higher living costs and more precarious employment, and are not reached by social insurance schemes that are designed for formally employed workers. Neither the Sustainable Development Goals nor the New Urban Agenda reflect a specific focus on urban social protection. COVID-19 has exposed this major gap in coverage, given the disproportionate impact of lockdowns on the livelihoods of the urban poor. To build back better post COVID-19, we propose rights-based national social protection systems with two components: categorical social assistance for non-working vulnerable groups (children, older persons, persons with disability) and universal social insurance for all working adults (formal, informal or self-employed), financed out of general revenues rather than mandatory contributions by employees and employers. These ideas are explored in the case of South Africa, which has comprehensive social assistance but inadequate social insurance for urban informal workers.

The negative versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of decline whereas the positive versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of resilience. RESULTS: As expected, the exposure of older individuals to the negative-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly worse mental health (more anxiety and less peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition; in contrast, the positive-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly better mental health (less anxiety and more peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition. The findings were equally strong for the personified and enumerative conditions. Also as expected, the interventions, which were self-irrelevant to the younger participants, did not significantly impact their mental health. DISCUSSION: This is the first-known study to experimentally demonstrate that institutional ageism, and statistics that reflect stereotypes about older individuals, can impact mental health. The results demonstrate the need for media messaging aimed at empowering older individuals during the pandemic and beyond.","output":"Impact of Media-based Negative and Positive Age Stereotypes on Older Individuals' Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 hit strongly and hardly the entire globe for more than 1 year with a morbidity exceeding 139 million and a mortality approaching 3 million worldwide since its emergence in China in December 2019 until April 2021 Although being termed after its ancestor the acute respiratory syndrome corona virus that emerged in 2002 Yet, the current corona virus has its unique devastating presentations being pulmonary and extra pulmonary In the current review, a highlight on the role played by corona virus 2 on pathogenesis and outcome of stroke is presented with an attempt to point to the most approved ways through which the corona virus induce stroke being disturbance in renin angiotensin system and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors downregulation, endothelial cell damage with coagulopathy, cytokine storm, and platelet as well as outcome and risks in patients who are suffering stroke with modifiable vascular risk factors and catching the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Egyptian Journal of Neurology, Psychiatry & Neurosurgery is the property of Springer Nature and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A review on SARS-CoV-2 and stroke pathogenesis and outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A decline in cardiovascular hospitalizations was observed during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine the continuous effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in reducing cardiovascular hospitalization and associated mortality rates during the first year of the pandemic in Israel. Methods: We conduct a retrospective cohort study using the data of Clalit Health Services, the largest healthcare organization in Israel. We divide the Corona year into six periods (three lockdowns and three post-lockdowns) and compare the incidence rates of cardiovascular hospitalizations and 30-day all-cause mortality during each period to the previous three years. Results: The number of non-STEMI hospitalizations during the first year of the pandemic was 13.7% lower than the average of the previous three years (95% CI 11C17%); STEMI hospitalizations were 15.7% lower (95% CI 13C19%); CHF (Congestive heart failure) hospitalizations were 23.9% lower (95%, CI 21C27%). No significant differences in 30-day all-cause mortality rates were observed among AMI (acute myocardial infarction) patients during most of the periods, whereas the annual 30-day all-cause mortality rate among CHF patients was 23% higher. Conclusions: AMI and CHF hospitalizations were significantly lower during the first year of the pandemic relative to 2017C9. Mortality rates were higher in the case of CHF patients but not in the case of AMI patients, possibly due to a change in the clinical acuity of patients arriving at the hospitals. We conclude that targeted public health messaging should be implemented together with proactive monitoring, in order to identify residual disability in patients who may have received non-optimal treatment during the pandemic.","output":"Continuous Decline in Myocardial Infarction and Heart Failure Hospitalizations during the First 12 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) initiated a multifunctional modification route that leads to the generation of novel advanced materials and their applications. However, existing PDA deposition techniques still exhibit poor spatial control, have a very limited capability of micropatterning and do not allow to locally tune PDA topography. Herein, we demonstrate PDA deposition based on Multiphoton Lithography (MPL) that enables full spatial and temporal control with nearly total freedom of patterning design. Using MPL, we achieve 2D microstructures of complex design with pattern precision of 0.8 m without the need of a photomask or stamp. Moreover, this approach permits adjusting the morphology and thickness of the fabricated microstructure within one deposition step, resulting in a unique tunability of materials properties. The chemical composition of PDA is confirmed and its ability for protein enzyme immobilization is demonstrated. This work presents a new methodology for high precision and complete control of PDA deposition, enabling PDA incorporation in applications where fine and precise local surface functionalization is required.

Previous PPI prediction methods which were trained with non-disease general PPI data were not compatible to map the PPI network in cancer. Therefore, we established a novel cancer specific PPI prediction method dubbed NECARE, which was based on relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN) with knowledge-based features. It achieved the best performance with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) = 0.840.03 and an F1 = 912% compared with other methods. With NECARE, we mapped the cancer interactome atlas and revealed that the perturbations of PPIs were enriched on 1362 genes, which were named cancer hub genes. Those genes were found to over-represent with mutations occurring at protein-macromolecules binding interfaces. Furthermore, over 56% of cancer treatment-related genes belonged to hub genes and they were significantly related to the prognosis of 32 types of cancers. Finally, by coimmunoprecipitation, we confirmed that the NECARE prediction method was highly reliable with a 90% accuracy.

The aim of the present study was to perform morphological analyses and morphometry of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow of patients with severe COVID-19 and to correlate the findings to the clinical course of the disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the single-centre study at the University Hospital Jena bone marrow specimens of 15 deceased patients with severe course of COVID-19 were sampled from vertebral column during autopsy. Slides of bone marrow were stained with routine stains or immunohistochemistry and further examined for haemophagocytosis using light microscopy. To substantiate morphological findings additional slides were stained against CD163 and morphometry was performed. In all bone marrow samples, a relative increase in cellularity was found. Haemophagocytes with erythrophagocytosis were detectable in 67% of the deceased patients. In tissues with low number of haemophagocytes or ill-defined haemophagocytes, an increase in iron deposits was frequently seen. Next, morphological findings were correlated with several important clinical data and the H-Score was calculated to posthumously confirm the diagnosis secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Median duration of disease and hospitalisation time were shorter in patients with haemophagocytosis (n=10) compared to patients without haemophagocytosis (n=5). In addition, patients with haemophagocytes showed increased inflammatory parameters two to five days prior to death compared to patients without haemophagocytes.

In this setting, medical students in particular have limited opportunities for experiential learning. We report on a student-faculty collaboration that has successfully operated an annual, short-term surgical intervention in Haiti for the last three years. Medical students were responsible for logistics and were overseen by faculty members for patient care. Substantial planning with local partners ensured that trip activities supplemented existing surgical services. A case review was performed hypothesizing that such trips could provide effective surgical care while also providing a suitable educational experience. FINDINGS Over three week-long trips, 64 cases were performed without any reported complications, and no immediate perioperative morbidity or mortality. A plurality of cases were complex urological procedures that required surgical skills that were locally unavailable (43%). Surgical productivity was twice that of comparable peer institutions in the region. Student roles in patient care were greatly expanded in comparison to those at U.S. academic medical centers and appropriate supervision was maintained. DISCUSSION This demonstration project suggests that a properly designed surgical trip model can effectively balance the surgical needs of the community with an opportunity to expose young trainees to a clinical and cross-cultural experience rarely provided at this early stage of medical education.

Unfortunately, post-embolization follow-up angiographic images can be obscured by artifact. The dual-volume reconstruction technique was developed in order to reduce artifact and enhance the visualization of the aneurysm, the parent vessel and side branches, and endovascular devices. The purpose of this study was to compare the reliability of dual- vs single-volume reconstruction of 3D DSA in evaluation of follow-up images after endovascular embolization of intracranial aneurysms. METHOD Four cerebrovascular neurosurgeons independently and blindly reviewed 20 randomly selected dual-and single-volume reconstructions of 3D DSAs demonstrating cerebral aneurysms treated with primary coil embolization, stent-assisted coil embolization, or Pipeline embolization. Five images were repeated for each modality (single and dual volume) in order to assess intra-rater reliability. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated as a measure of the overall inter-rater agreement. Cohen's kappa value was used to assess repeat measurement consistency for each rater. RESULTS Overall inter-rater agreement using dual- and single-volume reconstruction was 0.81 and 0.75, respectively. Dual-volume reconstruction resulted in superior agreement in assessing location, occlusion status, position of aneurysm recanalization or residual, status of nearby branches, presence of coil migration and presence of intravascular devices (stent or Pipeline). CONCLUSION Three-dimensional reconstruction is an important complementary imaging technique in evaluating the angioarchitecture of aneurysms and recanalization after endovascular embolization.

In this context, the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been developed to treat different types of tumors. The Annona muricata plant is known for having anticancer activity. Its main compounds present in the leaves, stems and skin, allowing for its use as reducing agents. In this manuscript, AgNPs with leaf extract (AgNPs-LE) and fruit peel extract (AgNPs-PE) of A. muricata were biosynthesized obtaining an average nanoparticle diameter sizes smaller than 50 nm, being 19.63  3.7 nm and 16.56  4.1 nm, and with a surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) at 447 and 448 nm, respectively. The lactone functional group present in the LE and PE extracts was identified by the FTIR technique. The behavior and antiproliferation activity of AgNPs-LE and AgNPs-PE were evaluated in breast, colon and melanoma cancer cell lines. Our results showed that Annona muricata fruit peel, which is a waste product, has an antitumor effect more potent than leaf extract. This difference is maintained with AgNPs where the destruction of cancer cells was, for the first time, achieved using concentrations that do not exceed 3 g/mL with a better therapeutic index in the different tumor strains.

Knowledge of the spatial and temporal characteristics of influenza is important in evaluating and developing disease control programs. This study aims to describe an accurate spatiotemporal pattern of influenza at the prefecture level and explore the risk factors associated with influenza incidence risk in mainland China from 2005 to 2018. The incidence data of influenza were obtained from the Chinese Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System (CNIDRS). The Besag York Molli (BYM) model was extended to include temporal and space-time interaction terms. The parameters for this extended Bayesian spatiotemporal model were estimated through integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) using the package R-INLA in R. A total of 702,226 influenza cases were reported in mainland China in CNIDRS from 2005C2018. The yearly reported incidence rate of influenza increased 15.6 times over the study period, from 3.51 in 2005 to 55.09 in 2008 per 100,000 populations. The temporal term in the spatiotemporal model showed that much of the increase occurred during the last 3 years of the study period. The risk factor analysis showed that the decreased number of influenza vaccines for sale, the new update of the influenza surveillance protocol, the increase in the rate of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 among all processed specimens from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients, and the increase in the latitude and longitude of geographic location were associated with an increase in the influenza incidence risk. After the adjusting for fixed covariate effects and time random effects, the map of the spatial structured term shows that high-risk areas clustered in the central part of China and the lowest-risk areas in the east and west. Large space-time variations in influenza have been found since 2009. In conclusion, an increasing trend of influenza was observed from 2005 to 2018. The insufficient flu vaccine supplements, the newly emerging influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and expansion of influenza surveillance efforts might be the major causes of the dramatic changes in outbreak and spatio-temporal epidemic patterns. Clusters of prefectures with high relative risks of influenza were identified in the central part of China.

Many countries have launched COVID-19 mobile apps with a wide range in how these apps work. While it is hoped that these apps can assist in the fight against COVID-19, many are worried about user privacy. China implemented health code systems, which assigned neighborhoods and citizens a specific health code, meant to indicate their risk of having been exposed to COVID-19. The most widely used health code systems were hosted on the popular apps WeChat and Alipay, each with billions of users. Some experts argued that China's use of mobile applications was essential to its successful combat against COVID-19. Included in this study are a summary of mobile technology usage in China, a review of previous studies of mobile technology in healthcare, and a brief survey of some existing mobile applications for COVID-19 that were implemented. Also included are outcomes of interviews with healthcare and public safety experts and a public survey to understand how mobile applications were used in China's response to COVID-19. The interviews revealed four important themes: personal privacy, community involvement, government involvement, and situational specificity. It was found that a key concern was maintaining a balance between collecting and utilizing personal information, as well as protecting this information. In addition, close collaboration between local communities and the national government was essential. Mobile applications assisted in communication and coordination but did not replace the work of people such as delivery drivers and contact tracers. Our results also showed that there was room for improvement, especially accessibility for the elderly or those unfamiliar with technology. Similar results were obtained from our survey. It was interesting to find that the apps were mostly used for accessing information on COVID-19. In addition, respondents overwhelmingly identified information as the most valuable feature of COVID-19 apps. Both interview and survey results revealed the importance of providing information as a primary function of COVID-19 apps.

This qualitative study examines how parents support young learners' online learning of English during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on interviews with 30 parents of students in Grades 1C5 at a Chinese primary school. The study reveals a range of supportive practices: monitoring of learning emerged as the top priority for parents, followed by affective, academic and technology support. Most of these parental support strategies were mediated primarily by the children's grade level and/or parents' socioeconomic background. Parents also sought teachers' help and played bridging roles to enable teacher-student interaction, particularly when they were unable to provide direct help themselves.

There has been an increase in medical waste materials produced as a result of the extensive use of both disposable personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face shields and nose and face masks, and highly infectious waste materials, such as contaminated syringes, needles, and soiled bandages from diagnosed positive cases. Despite the huge volume in waste generation, a standardized evaluation framework is currently lacking in the management of medical wastes in Nigeria. This study has developed a novel assessment framework for managing medical wastes, which is curated from the technical guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). The applicability of the framework was examined on seven designated public and private-owned hospitals in Ota. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approaches of multi-criteria decision analysis were utilized in modelling an evaluation framework for the objective of medical waste management. Carefully designed interview questionnaires, observations, and site visits were carried out to obtain data from healthcare professionals in Ota. Results show that waste segregation was practiced more decisively in private hospitals than public hospitals. Waste segregation is established as a key determinant in implementing an effective waste management system in any healthcare facility. The success of waste segregation in healthcare institutions is highly dependent on good hospital management, organizational policies, efficient budget planning for waste management, and the operational running cost. Disposal methods investigated were mostly open burning and incessant dumping for most public health care centers. Deficient waste management practices were observed in waste disposal, waste transportation, storage, and organizational policies. While the awareness and capacity building on occupational safety practices and environmental public health is widely known by health workers and waste handlers, compliance and enforcement are critical challenges. The validation of results using fuzzy TOPSIS and a sensitivity analysis shows a high degree of the consistency, stability, and robustness of the model. Findings from the present study can aid decision making, as this will benefit policy makers and key stakeholders in developing more comprehensive and effective medical waste management guidelines in Nigeria.

By the fluorescent antibody tissue section technique the two Nebraska NCD viruses (reo-like and corona-like) were detected in the cytoplasm of many absorptive cells of the small intestine from a calf submitted for necropsy. Reo-like virus antigen was not detected in the absorptive and crypt cells of the colon but coronavirus-like antigen was. An adenovirus was also isolated from the small intestine of this calf. The disease was reproduced experimentally in a two day old colostrum deprived calf with a bacteria free intestinal homogenate obtained from the naturally infected calf. Both Nebraska NCD viruses were demonstrated in this experimental animal. However, the adenovirus was not re-isolated. Histological lesions observed in the small and large intestines of the naturally and experimentally infected calves were similar and because of their good correlation with the immunofluorescent findings, a combination of the two Nebraska NCD viruses was thought to be a major cause of the neonatal calf diarrhea problem afflicting this dairy herd.","output":"A case of viral neonatal calf diarrhea in a Quebec dairy herd."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Morbidly and super obese patients are a unique patient population that presents critical care transport providers with unique clinical and logistical challenges in the setting of respiratory distress and failure.

This requires specialized understanding of their respiratory mechanics as well as how to tailor standard treatment modalities, such as noninvasive ventilation, to meet their needs. Also, careful and deliberate planning is required to address the specific anatomic and physiologic characteristics of this population if intubation and mechanical ventilation are needed.

For instance, almost 98% of tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants, spas, and tourism facilities are closed to the public. With the intention that it brings a very harsh recession to the economy of the Balinese people themselves, involving the indigenous village in handling the COVID-19 outbreak in Bali is very appropriate. By involving theindigenous communities, in this case the indigenous village, it will directly touch up to the littlest area in Bali, the Banjar environment. With a more massive structure, it is also hoped that it can effectively break the chain of the spread of COVID-19 in Bali province. This writing uses the normative legal research method. The study of legislation and literature is used to formulate the authority of indigenous villages in the new era of Balinese culture tourism which will be faced after the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, it can be concluded that the position of the indigenous villages in assisting the higher tasks of the government is legally very strong, from the constitution to the legislation below recognizing the existence and role of the indigenous villages. On this basis, it is appropriate for the indigenous village to be given its own portion as an integral part of the structure both legally and administratively. Secondly, the authority of indigenous villages in carrying out their functions in the COVID Task Force for the prevention of COVID-19 in Bali province has been very clear and this can be the basis for further enhancing role of indigenous villages in the new era of cultural tourism in Bali which will be rebuilt after this pandemic. Finally, the optimization of the role of indigenous villages in the acceleration of COVID-19 prevention in Bali has been able to run well and can answer all doubts from various parties who during the pandemic might underestimate the magnificent role of this indigenous village, thus the Provincial Government of Bali should be able to consider an alternative management of indigenous village-based tourism going forward.

Sehingga ini membawa keterpurukan yang sangat hebat bagi perekonomian rakyat Bali sendiri, Melibatkan Desa Adat dalam menangani wabah COVID-19 di Bali ini sangat tepat. Peran komunitas masyarakat adat dalam hal ini Desa Adat langsung menyentuh hingga wilayah tersempit di Bali yakni lingkungan Banjar sehingga mampu untuk menjadi saluran informasi yang tepat terkait penanganan COVID-19. Dengan struktur yang lebih masif diharapkan pula dapat secara efektif memutus rantai penyebaran COVID-19 di Provinsi Bali. Penulisan ini menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normatif. Dimana dalam penulisan ini menggunakan studi perundangan dan kepustakaan untuk memformulasikan kewenangan desa adat dalam era baru kepariwisataan budaya Bali yang akan dihadapi pasca pandemi COVID-19 ini. Terakhir dapat disimpulkan bahwa bahwa kedudukan Desa Adat dalam pembantuan tugas Pemerintah yang lebih tinggi secara hukum sangat kuat, dari konstitusi hingga Peraturan Perundangan di bawahnya mengakui eksistensi dan peran dari Desa Adat. Atas dasar tersebut sudah sepantasnya Desa Adat diberikan porsinya tersendiri sebagai bagian yang utuh dari struktur baik secara hukum maupun administratif.

People are generally susceptible to COVID-19 because people lack immunity to this new virus. With the spread of this epidemic disease from Wuhan, a national outbreak soon appeared, and now many countries have this disease. Unfortunately, no effective drug for COVID-19 treatment has been found so far. METHODS: We designed a retrospective study based on patients admitted to The Affiliated Infectious Hospital of Soochow University from January 22, 2020, to February 25, 2020, with diagnosed COVID-19. We analyzed correlations between RT-PCR negative time and laboratory indicators, then divided all cases into 2 groups according to oxygenation index, data of RT-PCR negative time and related laboratory indicators of the two groups were com-pared. RESULTS: We collected 84 confirmed patients whose RT-PCR had turned negative, including 23 patients with the lowest oxygenation index &#8804; 300 mmHg and 61 patients had > 300 mmHg. There was a positive correlation between the RT-PCR negative time and age, WBC count, LDH, SCr. There were statistically significant differences in fever numbers, WBC count, lymphocyte count, CRP, ALT, AST, albumin, LDH, SCr, D-dimer, and fibrinogen between the two groups based on the oxygenation index.

The current study aimed to develop and validate a simple nomogram and a dynamic web-based calculator for predicting the risk of NV-HAP among older hospitalized patients. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was conducted on 15,420 consecutive older hospitalized patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in China between September 2017 and June 2020. The patients were randomly divided into training (n = 10,796) and validation (n = 4624) cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. Predictors of NV-HAP were screened using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method and multivariate logistic regression. The identified predictors were integrated to construct a nomogram using R software. Furthermore, the optimum cut-off value for the clinical application of the model was calculated using the Youden index. The concordance index (C-index), GiViTI calibration belts, and decision curve were analysed to validate the discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the model, respectively. Finally, a dynamic web-based calculator was developed to facilitate utilization of the nomogram. RESULTS: Predictors included in the nomogram were the Charlson comorbidity index, NRS-2002, enteral tube feeding, Barthel Index, use of sedatives, use of NSAIDs, use of inhaled steroids, and \\"time at risk\\". The C-index of the nomogram for the training and validation cohorts was 0.813 and 0.821, respectively. The 95% CI region of the GiViTI calibration belt in the training (P = 0.694) and validation (P = 0.614) cohorts did not cross the diagonal bisector line, suggesting that the prediction model had good discrimination and calibration. Furthermore, the optimal cut-off values for the training and validation cohorts were 1.58 and 1.74%, respectively. Analysis of the decision curve showed that the nomogram had good clinical value when the threshold likelihood was between 0 and 49%. CONCLUSION: The developed nomogram can be used to predict the risk of NV-HAP among older hospitalized patients. It can, therefore, help healthcare providers initiate targeted medical interventions in a timely manner for high-risk groups.

The complexity of COVID-19 is centred on the unpredictable course of the disease, which can rapidly develop from patients being asymptomatic to having life-threatening symptoms. The unpredictable disease severity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been a major problem facing the healthcare system during the pandemic. Identifying the laboratory biomarkers would help predict SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. This study focused on the previous literature regarding three laboratory biomarker profiles: haematological, inflammatory, and biochemical biomarkers. Methods: A retrospective study of COVID-19 patients was conducted between May 2020 and September 2020 to determine the predictors of hospitalization (severity) in COVID-19 patients. Patients were divided into two groups: those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU, severe) and those admitted to a non-ICU (stable). Patients' data were obtained from their medical records at Al Noor Specialist Hospital and East Arafat Hospital in Saudi Arabia. Results: A total of 487 patients with COVID-19, including 304 males and 183 females, were investigated in this study. A total of 217 patients were admitted to the ICU. Patients admitted to the ICU had a higher prevalence of chronic comorbidities than non-ICU patients. D-dimer, white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were more elevated in patients admitted to the ICU compared to non-ICU patients. Conclusion: Chronic comorbidities are a significant predictor for admission to the ICU.

To elucidate the overall perspective and keep abreast of emerging trends in procrastination research, this article presents a bibliometric analysis that investigates the panorama of overviews and intellectual structures of related research on procrastination. Using the Web of Science Database, we collected 1,635 articles published between 1990 and 2020 with a topic search on procrastination and created diverse research maps using CiteSpace and VOS viewer. Bibliometric analysis in our research consists of category distribution, keyword co-occurrence networks, main cluster analysis, betweenness centrality analysis, burst detection analysis, and structure variation analysis. We find that most research has focused on students' samples and has discussed the definition, classification, antecedents, consequences and interventions to procrastination, whereas procrastination in diverse contexts and groups remains to be investigated. Regarding the antecedents and consequences, research has mainly been about the relationship between procrastination and personality differences, such as the five-factor model, temperament, character, emotional intelligence, and impulsivity, but functions of external factors such as task characteristics and environmental conditions to procrastination have drawn scant attention. To identify the nature and characteristics of this behavior, randomized controlled trials are usually adopted in designing empirical research. However, the predominant use of self-reported data collection and for a certain point in time rather than longitudinal designs has limited the validation of some conclusions. Notably, there have been novel findings through burst detection analysis and structure variation analysis. Certain research themes have gained extraordinary attention in a short time period, have evolved progressively during the time span from 1990 to 2020, and involve the antecedents of procrastination in a temporal context, theoretical perspectives, research methods, and typical images of procrastinators.

As the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in all demographics across the world, infectious diseases carry substantial social, economic, and healthcare costs. Unlike previous global health crises, health experts now have access to more advanced tools and techniques to understand pandemics like COVID-19 better and faster;one such class of tools is artificial intelligence (AI) enabled disease surveillance systems. AI-based surveillance systems allow health experts to perform rapid mass infection prediction to identify potential disease cases, which is integral to understanding transmission and curbing the spread of the pandemic. However, while the importance of AI-based disease surveillance mechanisms in pandemic control is clear, what is less known is the state-of-the-art application of these mechanisms in countries across the world. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we aim to systematically review the literature to identify (1) how AI-based disease surveillance systems have been applied in counties worldwide amid COVID-19, (2) the characteristics and effects of these applications regarding the control of the spread of COVID-19, and (3) what additional disease surveillance resources such as database, AI-based tools and techniques that can be further added to the current toolbox in the fight against COVID-19.

In the infected animals, viral variants arose that harbored mutations in the spike (S) protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and these variants were transmitted back to humans. This raised concerns that mink might become a constant source of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with an increased threat to human health and resulted in mass culling of mink. Here, we report that mutations frequently found in the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from mink are mostly compatible with efficient entry into human cells and its inhibition by soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In contrast, mutation Y453F reduces neutralization by an antibody with emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy and sera/plasma from COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: The MCDA was applied in two main steps: specification of criteria for prioritizing COVID-19 patients (and levels within each criterion); and determination of weights for the criteria based on experts knowledge and experience in managing COVID-19 patients, via an online survey. Criteria were selected based on available COVID-19 evidence with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). RESULTS: The most important criteria (mean weights, summing to 100%), are: PaO(2) (16.3%); peripheral O(2) saturation (15.9%); chest X-ray (14.1%); Modified Early Warning Score-MEWS (11.4%); respiratory rate (9.5%); comorbidities (6.5%); living with vulnerable people (6.4%); body mass index (5.6%); duration of symptoms before hospital evaluation (5.4%); CRP (5.1%); and age (3.8%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients hospitalized from January 1, 2020, through May 8, 2020, who had COVID-19 testing by polymerase chain reaction assay were identified through electronic health records across multiple hospitals in the Mayo Clinic enterprise. Thrombotic outcomes (venous and arterial) were identified from the hospital problem list. RESULTS: We identified 3790 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 testing across 19 hospitals, 102 of whom had positive test results. The median age was lower in the COVID-positive patients (62 vs 67 years; P=.03). The median duration of hospitalization was longer in COVID-positive patients (8.5 vs 4 days; P<.001) and more required intensive care unit care (56.9% [58 of 102] vs 26.8% [987 of 3688]; P<.001). Comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy, were observed less frequently with COVID-positive admissions. Any venous thromboembolism was identified in 2.9% of COVID-positive patients (3 of 102) and 4.6% of COVID-negative patients (168 of 3688). The frequency of venous and arterial events was not different between the groups. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for COVID-positive-patients for any venous thromboembolism was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.19 to 2.02).

A significant fraction of individuals with COVID-19 have negative PCR test results; therefore, imaging studies coupled with epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data assist in decision making. With the newer variants of Covid-19 emerging, the burden on diagnostic laboratories has increased manifold. Therefore, it is important to employ beyond laboratory measures such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, one of the most dominant Machine Learning (ML) tools, to solve complex CXR image classification problems. Deep Learning (DL) entails training a CNN for a task such as classification using extensive datasets. However, the labelled data for COVID-19 is scarce, proving to be a prime impediment to applying DL-assisted analysis. The available datasets are either scarce or too diversified to learn effective feature representations; therefore Transfer Learning (TL) approach is utilized. TL-based ResNet architecture has a powerful representational ability, making it popular in Computer Vision. The aim of this study is two-fold- firstly, to assess the performance of ResNet models for classifying Pneumonia cases from CXR images and secondly, to build a customized ResNet model and evaluate its contribution to the performance improvement. The global accuracies achieved by the five models i.e., ResNet18_v1, ResNet34_v1, ResNet50_v1, ResNet101_v1, ResNet152_v1 are 91.35%, 90.87%, 92.63%, 92.95%, and 92.95% respectively.

It has caused the largest outbreaks in the pandemic, with increases in mortality and hospital hospitalizations. Early data on the spread of Omicron were captured in countries with relatively low case counts, so it was unclear how the arrival of Omicron would impact the trajectory of the pandemic in countries already experiencing high levels of community transmission of Delta. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to quantify and explain the impact of Omicron on pandemic trajectories and how they differ between countries who were or were not in a Delta outbreak at the time Omicron occurred. METHODS: We used SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and genetic sequence data to classify countries into two groups: those that were in a Delta outbreak (defined by at least ten novel daily transmissions per 100,000 population) when Omicron was first sequenced in the country, and those that were not. We used trend analysis, survival curves, and dynamic panel regression models to compare outbreaks in the two groups over the period from November 1, 2021 to February 11, 2022. We summarized the outbreaks in terms of their peak rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the duration of time the outbreaks took to reach the peak rate. RESULTS: Countries that were already in an outbreak with predominantly Delta lineages when Omicron arrived took longer to reach their peak rate and saw greater than a two-fold increase (2.04) in the average apex of the Omicron outbreak compared to countries that were not yet in outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high community transmission of Delta at the time of the first detection of Omicron was not protective, but rather precluded larger outbreaks in those countries. Outbreak status may reflect a generally susceptible population, due to overlapping factors including climate, policy, and individual behavior. In the absence of strong mitigation measures, arrival of a new, more transmissible variant in these countries is therefore more likely to lead to larger outbreaks. Alternately, countries with enhanced surveillance programs and incentives may be more likely to both exist in an outbreak status and detect more cases during an outbreak, resulting in a spurious relationship. Either way, these data argue against herd immunity mitigating future outbreaks with variants that have undergone significant antigenic shifts.

Considering that obesity is a chronic disease and the possible effect imposed by quarantine on weight gain with worsening rates of obesity and metabolic comorbidities, the creation of a protocol for a safe return to bariatric surgery became essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of new-onset severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) symptoms in patients who underwent bariatric procedures during the declining curve period. SETTING: Private practice METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted and included patients with indications for bariatric surgery during the decreasing curve period of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic who underwent surgery under a hospital security protocol. Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire and had a swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The primary outcome measure was the presence of 14-day and 30-day postoperative symptoms associated with COVID-19. Mortality was also analyzed. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with negative RT-PCR were operated on from May to June 2020. Seventeen patients had their surgery postponed because of a positive RT-PCR test or close contact. None of the patients developed new-onset SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection after 30 days of observation. No deaths were reported. Eleven had complications not related to SARS-CoV-2.

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Among other important risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes, obesity has emerged along with undernutrition-malnutrition as a strong predictor of disease risk and severity. Obesity-related excessive body fat may lead to respiratory, metabolic and immune derangements potentially favoring the onset of COVID-19 complications. In addition, patients with obesity may be at risk for loss of skeletal muscle mass, reflecting a state of hidden malnutrition with a strong negative health impact in all clinical settings. Also importantly, obesity is commonly associated with micronutrient deficiencies that directly influence immune function and infection risk. Finally, the pandemic-related lockdown, deleterious lifestyle changes and other numerous psychosocial consequences may worsen eating behaviors, sedentarity, body weight regulation, ultimately leading to further increments of obesity-associated metabolic complications with loss of skeletal muscle mass and higher non-communicable disease risk. Therefore, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies should be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients in the presence of obesity; lockdown-induced health risks should also be specifically monitored and prevented in this population.

First, we showed the absence of significant differences in the presentation of SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides by the most frequent HLA class I/II alleles and the corresponding HLA haplotypes. Then, the analysis was limited to the set of peptides originating from the Spike proteins of the considered SARS-CoV-2 variants. The major finding was the destructive effect of the Omicron mutations on PINLVRDLPQGFSAL peptide, which was the only tight binder from the Spike protein for HLA-DRB1*03:01 allele and some associated haplotypes. Specifically, we predicted a dramatical decline in binding affinity of HLA-DRB1*03:01 and this peptide after N211 deletion, L212I substitution and EPE 212-214 insertion. The computational prediction was experimentally validated by ELISA with the use of corresponding thioredoxin-fused peptides and recombinant HLA-DR molecules. Another finding was the significant reduction in the number of tightly binding Spike peptides for HLA-B*07:02 HLA class I allele (both for Omicron and Delta variants).

Generation of predictive factors to determine patients at greatest risk for emergent repair may prove helpful. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients undergoing elective versus emergent PEH repair and supplement this comparison with 3D volumetric analysis of hiatal defect area (HDA) and intrathoracic hernia sac volume (HSV) to determine risk factors for increased likelihood of emergent repair. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively enrolled, single-center hernia database was performed on all patients undergoing elective and emergent PEH repairs. Patients with adequate preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging were analyzed using volumetric analysis software. RESULTS: Of the 376 PEH patients, 32 (8.5%) were emergent. Emergent patients had lower rates of preoperative heartburn (68.8%vs85.1%, p = 0.016) and regurgitation (21.9%vs40.2%, p = 0.04), with similar rates of other symptoms. Emergent patients more frequently had type IV PEHs (43.8%vs13.5%, p < 0.001). Volumetric analysis was performed on 201 patients, and emergent patients had a larger HSV (805.6  483.5vs398.0  353.1cm(3), p < 0.001) and HDA (41.7  19.5vs26.5  14.7 cm(2), p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, HSV increase of 100cm(3) (OR 1.17 CI 1.02C1.35, p = 0.022) was independently associated with greater likelihood of emergent repair. Post-operatively, emergent patients had increased length of stay, major complication rates, ICU utilization, reoperation, and mortality (all p < 0.05). Emergent group recurrence rates were higher and occurred faster secondary to increased use of gastropexy alone as treatment (p > 0.05). With a formal PEH repair, there was no difference in rate or timing of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Emergent patients are more likely to suffer complications, require ICU care, have a higher mortality, and an increased likelihood of reoperation. A graduated increase in HSV increasingly predicts the need for an emergent operation.

After its first discovery in 2010 in France, this highly pathogenic virus rapidly spread to neighboring countries and has become the dominant strain, replacing the classical RHDV strains. RHDV2 was first reported in North America in 2016 in Mont-Joli, Quebec, Canada and it was reported again in 2018 and 2019 on Vancouver Island and the southwest mainland of British Columbia (BC). The whole genome sequence of the RHDV2 Quebec isolate resembled the 2011 RHDV2-N11 isolate from Navarra, Spain with 97% identity at the nucleotide level. The epidemiological investigation related to this outbreak involved three hobby farms and one personal residence in Quebec. In February 2018, high mortality was reported in a large colony of feral rabbits on the Vancouver Island University Campus, Nanaimo, BC. The virus identified showed only 93% identity to the Quebec RHDV2 isolate at the nucleotide level. Additional cases of RHDV2 on Vancouver Island and on the BC mainland affecting feral and captive domestic, and commercial rabbits were reported subsequently. Vaccination was recommended to control the outbreak and an inactivated bivalent vaccine was made available to the private veterinary practices.

Since such disease outbreaks are about life and death of the patients, the doctors' and biomedical scientists' time is crucial. Research documents are usually comprehensive, often consuming the readers' time. A solution to it would be to extract information from the research text resembling the most relevant parts of the original text so that their valuable time is saved. The problem of text summarization is to create a shortened piece of text that represents the most relevant information from a relatively larger piece of text. This paper aims to ease the burden of the doctors so won't have to read the extensive research documents by constructing a summary of the most relevant parts of a medical research paper. A text summarization algorithm always works by quantifying the sentences by some means and analyzing scores. We use the TF-IDF quantification which is a popular way to quantify sentences. We select sentences with a high score and exclude those with a lower score, compared to a threshold. In a medical research paper, several sentences might have a low score, but they might be important if they contain biomedical entities. We use a dataset which has been constructed upon biomedical and COVID-19 terminology to construct a much better summary than some existing tools.

AIMS: The aim of the to describe the spectrum of pediatric COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study involving pediatric COVID-19 patients across all Saudi regions. METHODS: All patients aged between 2 months and 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. The primary end point was the hospitalization. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive statistics were used to describe the baseline demographic data and clinical characteristics. Numerical data were explored using KolmogorovCSmirnov test and ShapiroCWilk test, while Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for categorical data. RESULTS: Among the 654 pediatric COVID-19 patients, 4.7% (n = 31) were hospitalized, with one patient only needing pediatric intensive care admission. Sex, breastfeeding, birth status, and the patients' living environment showed no significant association with hospitalization. Most children (80.3%, n = 525) were symptomatic, with two symptoms that were significantly associated with admission, namely, vomiting (P = 0.007) and nausea (P = 0.026). History of admission within the last year was identified in 10.4% (n = 68) children but had no association with worse outcome. The median duration of hospitalization for the entire group was 5.5 days, with longest hospital stay for age group 7C12 years (median 6 days).

OBJECTIVE: To examine feasibility of accelerating extinction learning in subjects with spider phobia using intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) rTMS of vmPFC. METHODS: In total, 17 subjects with spider phobia determined by spider phobia questionnaires [Spider Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ) and Fear of Spiders questionnaire (FSQ)] underwent ratings of fear of spiders as well as behavioral and skin conductance data during a behavioral avoidance test (BAT). Subjects then received a sequential protocol of in vivo spider exposure followed by iTBS for three sessions administered to either active or control treatment sites (vmPFC [n = 8] or vertex [n = 9], respectively), followed 1 week later by repetition of questionnaires and BAT. RESULTS: All subjects improved significantly regardless of group across both questionnaires (FSQ (2) = 0.43, p = 0.004; SPQ (2) = 0.39, p = 0.008) and skin conductance levels during BAT (Wald (2) = 30.9, p < 0.001). Subjects in the vmPFC group tolerated lower treatment intensity than in the control group, and there was a significant correlation between treatment intensity, BAT subjective distress improvement, and physiologic measures (all  > 0.5).

The availability of patient hospital records is crucial for linking the genomic sequence information to virus function during the course of infections.

From the assembled sequences, we estimate the SARS-CoV-2 effective population size and infection rate and outline the epidemiological dynamics of import and transmission events during this period in Saudi Arabia. We show that two consecutive mutations (R203K/G204R) in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein are associated with higher viral loads in COVID-19 patients. Our comparative biochemical analysis reveals that the mutant N protein displays enhanced viral RNA binding and differential interaction with key host proteins. We found hyper-phosphorylation of the adjacent serine site (S206) in the mutant N protein by mass-spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, analysis of the host cell transcriptome suggests that the mutant N protein results in dysregulated interferon response genes. We provide crucial information in linking the R203K/G204R mutations in the N protein as a major modulator of host-virus interactions and increased viral load and underline the potential of the nucleocapsid protein as a drug target during infection.","output":"Saudi Arabian SARS-CoV-2 genomes implicate a mutant Nucleocapsid protein in modulating host interactions and increased viral load in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Considering the unrelenting nature of the COVID-19 global crisis, there is an urgent need to identify modifiable factors that modulate susceptibility and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which is also relevant for vaccine response. Insufficient sleep, a highly prevalent and frequently overlooked lifestyle pattern, impairs formation of immunological memory and T cell responses to viral infection, which may influence immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesized that objectively monitored, mild sleep restriction (SR) for 6 weeks reduces T cell cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 compared with baseline in healthy individuals. Methods: Ten healthy participants (50% women;40% African-American, 30% White and 30% other), age 4217 y;BMI 26.85.3 kg/m2) with normal habitual sleep duration (7-8 h/night confirmed by 2-week actigraphy screening) underwent 6 weeks of mild SR (1.5 h less than their habitual sleep [HS]) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated using Ficoll-Paque density-gradient sedimentation from participants at baseline and after 6 weeks of SR. Mean (SD) sleep duration was 7 h 33 min  49 min during HS vs. 6 h  38 min during SR (p&lt;0.001). PBMC were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until stimulated with SARSCo-V-2 spike glycoprotein peptides (pool 1 = N-terminal and pooI 2 = C-Terminal) for 16 hours. Levels of SARSCoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ (OX40+CD137+) and CD8+ (CD69+CD137+) T cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Levels of cytokines released into supernatant after stimulation with spike peptide pools were quantified using human Th cytokine panel (12-plex) kit (Milipore Sigma). Results: Levels of SARS-CoV-2 spikespecific CD4+ T cells decreased after sleep restriction compared with baseline (pool 1: 0.120.02 vs. 0.300.08, p=0.04 and pool 2: 0.130.02 vs. 0.260.05, p=0.02). Similarly, SR reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD8+ T cells compared with baseline (pool 1: 0.080.01 vs. 0.170.04, p=0.07 and pool 2: 0.070.01 vs. 0.160.03, p=0.04).

The presentation of the disease ranges from asymptomatic manifestations through to acute respiratory distress syndrome with the necessity of mechanical ventilation. Cytokine storm and maladaptive responses to the viral spread in the body could be responsible for the severity of disease. Many patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI) during the course of their disease, especially in more severe cases. Many factors could cause kidney damage during infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is still unclear whether direct viral damage or the overexpression of cytokines and inflammatory factors are preeminent. According to autoptic studies, in most of the cases, AKI is due proximal tubular damage. However, cases of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were reported as well in the absence of signs of direct viral infection of the kidney. Considering that severe hypoxia is a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the involvement of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system is very likely, possibly influencing the inflammatory response and outcome in both the lungs and kidneys. Several bodies of evidence have shown a possible role of the HIF pathway during AKI in various kidney disease models. Similar observations were made in the setting of acute lung injury. In both organs, HIF activation by means of inhibition of the prolyl-hydroxylases domain (PHD) could be protective. Considering these promising experimental data, we hypothesize that PHD inhibitors could be considered as a possible new therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Hypoxia response and acute lung and kidney injury: possible implications for therapy of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple studies have been conducted to predict the impact and duration of the current COVID-19 epidemics. Most of those studies rely on parameter calibration using the published number of confirmed cases. Unfortunately, this number is usually incomplete and biased due to the lack of testing capacities, and varying testing protocols. An essential requirement for better monitoring is the evaluation of the number of undiagnosed infected individuals. This number is crucial for the determination of transmission prevention strategies and it provides statistics on the epidemic dynamics. To estimate the number of undiagnosed infected individuals, we studied the relation between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We simulated multiple models currently used to study the COVID-19 pandemic and computed the relation between these two fractions in all those models. Across most models currently used and for most realistic model parameters, the relation between the two fractions is consistently linear and model independent. This relation can be used to estimate the number of undiagnosed infected, with no explicit epidemiological model. We apply this method to measure the number of undiagnosed infected in Israel. Since the fraction of confirmed cases with a known source can be obtained from epidemiological investigations in any country, one can estimate the total number of infected individuals in the same country.","output":"Evaluation of the number of COVID-19 undiagnosed infected using source of infection measurements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kidney transplant recipients have been supposed vulnerable to severe Covid-19 infection, due to their comorbidities and immunosuppressive therapies.

This study was carried out in September 2020, the last month of the first state of national emergency. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated, including COVID-19 status and cancer treatment features. RESULTS: A total of 1472 patients were included; the median age was 55 years (range 19C97). Most patients (85.8%, n = 1263) had solid neoplasia, 13.5% (n = 198) hematologic neoplasia, and 0.7% (n = 11) others. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 8.6% (n = 126), 1.2% (n = 18) were probable, 1.6% (n = 24) suspected, and 88.6% (n = 1304) negative cases. Overall, 51.6% of patients (n = 759) had cancer treatment delays, 42.5% (n = 626) changed treatment delivery (endovenous to oral systemic therapy), and 12.6% (n = 185) of cases cancer therapy was discontinued. In total, 10.3% (n = 117) of patients whose disease was controlled or in remission, experienced progression of disease during the state of emergency. A total of 6.7% (n = 98) of patients died, of whom 73.5% (n = 72) died from disease progression; 18.4% (n = 18) from SARS-CoV-2 infection and 8.1% (n = 8) from undetermined causes.

The findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the country;although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the data was examined through the lens of the technology's maturity according to NASA's Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances;slightly modified robots made up 10%;and truly novel robots or novel use cases constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often and for broader purposes.

The goal of this study was to generate expert consensus on best evaluative practices for holistic CC assessments of ocean-based salmon aquaculture. To achieve this goal, a 3-round Delphi study was conducted with 21 aquaculture and carrying capacity experts from around the world. Experts emphasized that the holistic CC process should i) engage all stakeholders in the process, ii) consider the combination of social, political, ecological, and economic aspects, iii) respond to changes over time, iv) consider multiple spatial and temporal scales, and v) be understandable and clear to all stakeholders involved. Furthermore, the expert panel emphasized the need for a cyclical and dynamic process that allows for the incorporation of feedback in the planning stages, embracing adaptive management. Due to the early stages of truly holistic assessments, the experts recognized challenges related to knowledge uncertainties and lack of approaches to integrate socio-economic data with ecological and physical data, potential conflicts arising from a multi-stakeholder process, and ill-equipped governance structures. The proposed guidelines and framework could help address some of the conceptual and procedural barriers to implementing holistic assessments into decision-making and may position CC as a useful decision-support tool for governments seeking sustainable aquaculture management.","output":"Development of best practices for more holistic assessments of carrying capacity of aquaculture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Owing to the over-increasing demands in resisting and managing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, development of rapid, highly sensitive, accurate, and versatile tools for monitoring total antibody concentrations at the population level has been evolved as an urgent challenge on measuring the fatality rate, tracking the changes in incidence and prevalence, comprehending medical sequelae after recovery, as well as characterizing seroprevalence and vaccine coverage. To this end, herein we prepared highly luminescent quantum dot nanobeads (QBs) by embedding numerous quantum dots into polymer matrix, and then applied it as a signal-amplification label in lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). After covalently linkage with the expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RSSP), the synthesized QBs were used to determine the total antibody levels in sera by virtue of a double-antigen sandwich immunoassay. Under the developed condition, the QB-LFIA can allow the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies within 15 min with about one order of magnitude improvement in analytical sensitivity compared to conventional gold nanoparticle-based LFIA. In addition, the developed QB-LFIA performed well in clinical study in dynamic monitoring of serum antibody levels in the whole course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The automation of this process is important to maintain high quality along with the high manufacturing throughput. With recent developments in deep learning and computer vision technologies, it has become possible to detect various features from the images with near-human accuracy. However, many of these approaches are data intensive. Training and deployment of such a system on manufacturing floors may become expensive and time-consuming. The need for large amounts of training data is one of the limitations of the applicability of these approaches in real-world manufacturing systems. In this work, we propose the application of a Siamese convolutional neural network to do one-shot recognition for such a task. Our results demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used in quality control of steel by identification of defects on the steel surface. This method can significantly reduce the requirements of training data and can also be run in real-time.","output":"One-Shot Recognition of Manufacturing Defects in Steel Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Instead of the complete lockdown, since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Japan has been trying to control the infection by self-restraint request policy. It seems that the number of infected people has subsided, however, the increasing human activities again in the resumption of economy may lead to the second wave of infections. Here, we analyzed the major factors behind the success control of the first outbreak in Japan and the potential risk of the second wave. Methods Employing a localized stochastic transition model, we analyze the real data and the results of simulation in Tokyo from March 1 to July 31. In the model, population is divided into three compartments: susceptible, infected, and removed; and area into three zones: crowded, mid and uncrowded. Different zones have different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The flow of the infection simulation in one day consists of three steps: (I) intercity movement of population, (II) isolating infected people, and (III) zone shifting following group behavioral patterns. Results The major cause for the success of controlling the first outbreak in Tokyo is demonstrated through our simulation to be the early request of self-restraint as well as the early detection of infected people. Meanwhile, the observation that the increasing human activities again in the resumption of economy will lead to the second wave of infections is also found in the simulation with an extended period. Based on the analysis of intercity movement and behavioral pattern on Tokyo where normally about 2.9 million people come from the surrounding cities to the central area by using the public railway system every day, results showed that turning the workstyle of 55% of working people ranging in age from 20 to 64 years old into teleworking (remote work) may control the spread of infection without significant economic damage. Meanwhile, to keep about 75% of the normal activity level and to advocate the shift to telework are indispensable because a sudden resumption of activity from the lockdown sate can rapidly spread infection. Conclusions As a new normal in face of COVID-19 for Tokyo and other cities that with a high population density, shifting the workstyle of 55% of working people to teleworking and to reduce 25% time staying in the high infection risk area could be an effective measure to control the spread of infection while maintaining a certain level of economic activity.","output":"Shifting workstyle to teleworking as a new normal in face of COVID-19: analysis with the model introducing intercity movement and behavioral pattern."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS CoV-2 (COVID 19) is having a deep and lasting impact around the world.

We used detailed phylogenetic analysis, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and in situ molecular dynamics simulations to examine the Spike-RBDs functional evolution, finding that the common ancestral virus with RaTG13, dating to at least 2013, possessed high binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor.

Also, 500 individuals were selected to form the controls, all of whom had been disclosed to the same medical center in June 2019, before the onset of the outbreak. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated ABO histo-blood phenotypes are correlated with patients susceptibility to the infection. A higher rate of infection was observed among patients with the AB histo-blood group, while patients with the O histo-blood group have shown a lower rate of infection. The Rh blood group phenotype was not statistically significant in determining a patients vulnerability. CONCLUSION: Similar to several previous studies about other viral diseases association with ABO histo-blood groups, we have concluded that an individuals ABO histo-blood group phenotype and his/her susceptibility to COVID-19 are indeed connected. So far, only one research has been conducted about this association.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, cluster-randomised, blinded clinical trial will be conducted between 2021 and 2023. Six primary care centres will be randomly assigned to an advanced or a standard AMS programme. The advanced AMS programme will consist of a standard AMS programme combined with the possibility that general practitioners (GP) will discuss patients therapies with ID experts telephonically during working days and biweekly meetings. The main endpoint will be overall antibiotic consumption, defined as daily defined dose per 1000 inhabitants per day (DHD). Secondary end-points will be: (1) unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract or urinary tract infection, (2) adequacy of antibiotic prescription, (3) reattendance to GP or emergency room within 30 days after the initial GP visit and (4) hospital admissions for any reason within 30 days after the GP visit. Two secondary endpoints (unnecessary antibiotic therapy and adequacy of therapy) will be evaluated by blinded investigators.

Many studies have been conducted to target the structures of RBD-ACE2 binding and to design RBD-targeting vaccines and drugs. Nevertheless, mutations distal from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-RBD regions, suggesting the incomplete role of the RBD region in the spike protein-ACE2 binding. Here, in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms, we analyze complexes of ACE2 with the wild-type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance, via electrostatic interactions and hydration, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity. A negatively charged tetrapeptide (GluGluLeuGlu) is then designed to neutralize the positively charged arginine on the polybasic cleavage sites. We find that the tetrapeptide GluGluLeuGlu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lessening by 34% the RBD-ACE2 binding strength. This significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize RBD-ACE2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site.

RESULTS: We found PSWs faced a range of challenges related to COVID-19, including anxiety about contracting COVID-19, reduced work hours, taking leaves of absences, concerns about job security, and losing childcare. While the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the PSW workforce and their importance to the healthcare system (especially in the long-term care system), pre-existing poor work conditions of insecure jobs with no paid sick days and benefits exacerbated COVID-19Crelated challenges. Despite these hardships, PSWs were able to rely on their mental resilience and passion for their profession to cope with challenges. CONCLUSION: Significant changes need to be made to improve PSW working conditions. Better compensation, increased job security, decreased workload burden, and mental health supports are needed.

In January 2020, WHO approved the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting the presence of Covid-19 genetic material in individuals. Till date many diagnostic kits have arrived in the market for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In spite of being the gold standard method of Covid-19 detection, there are some drawbacks associated with RT-PCR which leads to false-negative results. Hence, in order to fulfil the need for an antibody testing kit for evaluating seroconversion and immunity acquisition in the population, an efficient, highly specific and sensitive assay, Chimera Soochak, an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) Kit has been developed. It works on the principle of detecting IgG antibodies developed specifically against the S1-RBD by employing a recombinant strain of S1-RBD produced in the HEK293 cell line. The developed kit was validated using different modes and methods to attain the utmost confidence on the samples collected from patients. The validation methodology included, validation with known samples, blind study, third-party validation, validation using WHO Reference Panel and comparison with FDA approved Surrogate virus neutralization kit. The kit was found successful in detecting IgG against the S1-RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The kit had been validated on multiple parameters.

RECENT FINDINGS: The control measures adopted for restarting the healthcare activity should be equitable and inclusive. Moreover, this pandemic has implied changes in treatments and strategies to be alert regarding the daily changing information. Finally, for ensuring a safe practice both for patients and staff, it is important to detect asymptomatic patients, so Reproductive Medicine centers must take special care with screening and testing procedures.

We derive exact analytic expressions for the early doubling time, late half decay time, and a half-early peak law, characterizing the dynamical evolution. We show, in particular, how the asymmetry of the first epidemic wave and its exponential tails are affected by the initial conditions;a feature that has no analogue in the all-time SIR model. We apply the approach to available data from different continents. Our analysis reveals that the immunity is very strongly increasing during the 2nd wave, while it was still at a very moderate level of a few percent in several countries at the end of the first wave. The wave-specific SIR parameters describing the infection and recovery rates we find to behave in a similar fashion, while their ratio k was decreasing only by a about 5% for most countries. Still, an apparently moderate change of k can have significant consequences for the relevant numbers like the final amount of infected or deceased population. As we show, the probability for an additional wave is however low in several countries due to the fraction of immune inhabitants at the end of the 2nd wave, irrespective the currently ongoing vaccination efforts.

In this study, four rapid methods (ACE2-RBD inhibition assay, S1-IgG detection, RBD-IgG detection, and N-IgG detection) were established and evaluated based on chemiluminescence technology. For the first time, a broadly neutralizing antibody with high affinity was used as a standard for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in human sera. Sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients (N = 119), vaccinated donors (N = 86), and healthy donors (N = 299) confirmed by microneutralization test (MNT) were used to evaluate the above methods. The result showed that the ACE2-RBD inhibition assay calculated with either ACE2-RBD binding inhibition percentage rate or ACE2-RBD inhibiting antibody concentration were strongly correlated with MNT (r  0.78, p < 0.0001) and also highly consistent with MNT (Kappa Value  0.94, p < 0.01).

The annulus walls kept at constant values of a zeta potential. The dimensionless governing equations have been solved with the help of the Laplace and finite Hankel transforms. The inversion of Laplace for the transformed functions is calculated numerically. The essential features of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) and the related thermal characteristics are clearly illustrated by the variations in the velocity, the flow rate, the temperature and the Nusselt number. Moreover, comparisons with other non-Newtonian fluids have been discussed.

This research aims to investigate the mechanisms that delivers value management as part of the re-invent strategy proposed by the Construction Leadership Council in the UK government to improve WLC for buildings. In addition to existing secondary data from the literature, primary data were attained using a focus group with six quantity surveyors from different cost consultancies in the UK to gather qualitative evidence using their experiences, perceptions, and key challenges they face when integrating VM. Findings revealed that value management is primarily being used as a cost-cutting tool, the majority of quantity surveyors lack knowledge of what it encompasses, hence the industry needs a more proactive strategy towards it. Analysis revealed that value management is primarily implemented as a cost-cutting solution, key stakeholders (e.g., facility managers) need to be integrated, and there is no standardised process to incorporate value management in projects. The study proposes a four-dimensional (governance and policies, sustainability, industrys best practice, and innovation and technology) strategy to facilitate more holistic considerations of value management post COVID-19.

Various antibodies targeting S-protein have been developed to combat COVID-19 pandemic; however, the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement and novel spike mutants-induced neutralization loss or antibody resistance still remain. Alternative preventative agents or therapeutics are still urgently needed. In this study, we designed series of peptides with either ACE2 protecting or Spike-protein neutralizing activities. Molecular docking predicted that, among these peptides, ACE2 protecting peptide AYp28 and Spike-protein neutralizing peptide AYn1 showed strongest intermolecular interaction to ACE2 and Spike-protein, respectively, which were further confirmed by both cell- and non-cell-based in vitro assays. In addition, both peptides inhibited the invasion of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 into HEK293T/hACE2 cells, either alone or in combination. Moreover, the intranasal administration of AYp28 could partially block pseudovirus invasion in hACE2 transgenic mice. Much more importantly, no significant toxicity was observed in peptides-treated cells. AYp28 showed no impacts on ACE2 function.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was carried out from February-April 2020. METHODS: A total of 1,005 nurses employed in different Italian hospital wards, during the COVID-19 pandemic, were recruited. Analyses were based on descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep disturbances, moderate anxiety and low self-efficacy was 71.4%, 33.23% and 50.65%, respectively. We found a positive correlation between anxiety and sleep quality (0.408; p < .0001) and negative correlations between self-efficacy and anxiety (-0.217; p < .0001) and sleep quality and self-efficacy (-0.134; p < .0001).

To study pulmonary involvement in detail, one of the most common resources is the use different lung imaging modalities (like chest radiography) to explore the possible affected areas. Methods: In this work, we performed a comprehensive analysis of sex and age factors in chest X-ray images. The study of these recurrent patient characteristics in pathologies of this type is crucial, since there is a clear scarcity of data that may lead to biases when trying to develop systems that are as representative as possible, as well as to gain knowledge of the disease itself. To identify possible biases, we analyzed 3 different computational approaches for automatic COVID-19 screening: Normal vs COVID-19, Pneumonia vs COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 vs COVID-19. The presented study was validated using two public chest X-ray datasets, allowing a reliable analysis to support the clinical decision-making process in the context of this dramatic global pandemic. Results: The obtained results for the sex-related imbalance analysis indicate that this factor slightly affects the system performance in the Normal VS COVID-19 and Pneumonia VS COVID-19 approaches, although the identified differences are not relevant enough to worsen considerably the systems response. Regarding the age-related imbalance analysis, this factor was observed to be again influencing the system in a more consistent way than the sex factor, as it was present in all the approaches. Once again, this worsening is not a major problem for our data and system, as it is not of great magnitude. Conclusions: Multiple studies have been conducted in other fields in order to determine if certain patient characteristics such as sex or age influenced these deep learning systems.

A retrospective electronic chart review of 989 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) positive pediatric patients was performed. The aim was to look at the existence of sustained positivity and SARS -CoV-2 reinfection in the pediatric population, as was reported in the adults. Results: We present our retrospective observational study on 989 SARS-CoV-2 positive pediatric patients; 172 of these had repeated multiple testings, 68 had multiple consecutive positive tests over time, and 27 qualified for sustained-positive status. We also report on four pediatric COVID-19 reinfections. Conclusion: This is the first report on pediatric SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, one of very few on pediatric SARS-CoV-2 sustained positivity and reinfection. These two phenomena occur in children also as reported in adults but have several differences. The reinfection is possible within one to three weeks of becoming negative as against adults who have been reported to become positive in a minimum of 45-90 days from becoming negative. More extensive reporting is essential to ascertain the accurate quarantine/isolation recommendation in children.","output":"Sustained Positivity and Reinfection With SARS-CoV-2 in Children: Does Quarantine/Isolation Period Need Reconsideration in a Pediatric Population?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some international pharmaceutical companies have succeeded in producing vaccines against COVID\\\\19.

Hence, the aim of this study was to determine whether bamlanivimab is equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 emerging VOC. The ability of bamlanivimab to neutralize five SARS-CoV-2 variants including B.1.1.7 (mutations include N501Y and del69/70), B.1.351 (mutations include E484K and N501Y) and P.2 (mutations include E484K in the absence of a N501Y mutation) was analyzed in infectious cell culture using CaCo2 cells. Additionally, we analyzed vaccine-elicited sera after immunization with BNT162b2, and convalescent sera for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. We found that the variant B.1.1.7, as well as two isolates from early 2020 (FFM1 and FFM7) could be efficiently neutralized by bamlanivimab (titer 1/1280, respectively), however, no neutralization effect could be detected against either B.1.135 or P.2, both harboring the E484K substitution. Vaccine-elicited sera showed slightly decreased neutralizing activity against B1.1.7, B.1.135 and P.2 Our in vitro findings indicate that, in contrast to vaccine-elicited sera, bamlanivimab may not provide efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring the E484K substitution. Confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 variant, including screening for E484K, may be needed before initiating mAb treatment with bamlanivimab to ensure both efficacious and efficient use of the antibody product.

Unfortunately, many lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease with an associated poor prognosis. Recently, the Chinese herb root extract Triptolide/Minnelide (TL) has shown significant promise as a therapeutic agent for NSCLC treatment both in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of action regarding TL-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC. We demonstrate that triptolide treatment of A549 and H460 NSCLC cells decreases Caveolin-1 (CAV-1) mRNA/protein expression, resulting in activation of the Akt/Bcl-2-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. CAV-1 down-regulation was triggered by Micro-RNA 204-5p (miR204-5p) up-regulation and could be significantly blocked by pre-treatment with both Sirt-1/Sirt-3 specific siRNA and SIRT-1/SIRT-3 enzyme inhibitors, EX-527 and nicotinamide. Overall, our results provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which TL exerts its cytotoxic effects on NSCLC via CAV-1 down-regulation.

Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody, has been repurposed for Covid-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in Covid-19 are lacking. Methods We conducted a phase 2 trial of low-dose tocilizumab in hospitalized adult patients with Covid-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) >= 40 mg/L who did not require mechanical ventilation. Dose cohorts were determined by a trial Operations Committee, stratified by CRP and epidemiologic risk factors. A range of doses from 40 to 200 mg (low-dose tocilizumab) was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24-48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Outcomes were compared with retrospective controls with Covid-19. Correlative studies evaluating host antibody response were performed in parallel. Findings A total of 32 patients received low-dose tocilizumab. This cohort had improved fever resolution (75.0% vs. 34.2%, p = 0.001) and CRP decline (86.2% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.001) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration, as compared to the retrospective controls (N=41). The probabilities of fever resolution or CRP decline did not appear to be dose-related in this small study (p=0.80 and p=0.10, respectively). Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (15.6%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (IQR, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (15.6%) patients. Correlative biological studies demonstrated that tocilizumab-treated patients produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies comparable to controls. Interpretation Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19.

PARTICIPANTS: Women in the reproductive age group (15C49 years) from the tribal groups in the district numbering 2495. OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY: Prevalence of contraceptive use and its determinants. SECONDARY: Knowledge regarding contraceptives in general, oral contraceptives and fertility intentions. RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 30.8 years (SD=9.8) and belonged to various tribal groups such as Paniya (59.2%), Kurichiyar (13.6%) and Adiya (10.9%). Current use of contraceptive was reported by about a fourth, 658 (26.4%) (95% CI 27.9 to 24.9) of women. Following logistic regression, belonging to Paniya tribe (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.67, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.77; p<0.001) and age at menarche >13 years (aOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.52; p<0.009) had significantly higher use of contraceptives whereas social vulnerability as indicated by staying in a kutcha house had a lesser likelihood of use of contraceptive (aOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.95; p<0.03). Oral contraceptive use was low (4.8%) among this population and no abuse was observed. Less than half (47%) of the respondents had an above average knowledge on contraception.

Although there are previous reviews on the use of robotic pets for older adults and people with dementia, none have included or had a focus on low-cost and familiarly and realistically designed pet robots. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to synthesize evidence on the delivery and impact of low-cost, familiarly and realistically designed interactive robotic pets for older adults and people with dementia. METHODS: The Arksey and OMalley framework was used to guide this review. First, the research question was identified. Second, searches were conducted on five electronic databases and Google Scholar. Studies were selected using a two-phase screening process, where two reviewers independently screened and extracted data using a standardized data extraction form. Finally, the results were discussed, categorized, and presented narratively. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were included in the review. Positive impacts related to several psychosocial domains, including mood and affect, communication and social interaction, companionship, and other well-being outcomes. Issues and concerns associated with its use included misperceptions of the robotic pets as a live animal, ethical issues of attachment, negative reactions by users, and other pragmatic concerns such as hygiene and cost.

A specific rubric was designed for the evaluation of student work. Moreover, student perceptions of VM as teaching and assessment method were assessed using online survey. Post examination psychometric analysis of VM OSPE was done and compared with previous OSPE results of the same batch of students. RESULTS: The average student score was 4.63  0.51 with no significant difference from previous student's scores. The net students' feedback was positive. Their average satisfaction on all items ranged from 3.7 to 4.25 on Likert scale. Students recorded the easy image access at any time and place with VM as the most distinctive feature. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that VM is not only an effective method in teaching histology but also it is an assessment method for measuring student performance during online assessment.","output":"Successful Use of Virtual Microscopy in the Assessment of Practical Histology during Pandemic COVID-19: A Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epithelial cell organoids have increased opportunities to probe questions on tissue development and disease in vitro and for therapeutic cell transplantation. Despite their potential, current protocols to grow these organoids almost exclusively depend on culture within three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions, introduces animal components, and results in heterogenous organoids (i.e., shape, size, composition). Here, we describe a method that relies on polymeric hydrogel substrates for the generation and expansion of lung alveolar organoids (alveolospheres). Using synthetic hydrogels with defined chemical and physical properties, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) self-assemble into alveolospheres and propagate in Matrigel-free conditions. By engineering pre-defined microcavities within these hydrogels, the heterogeneity of alveolosphere size and structure was reduced when compared to 3D culture while maintaining alveolar type 2 cell fate of human iAT2 and primary mouse tissue-derived progenitor cells. This hydrogel system is a facile and accessible culture system for the culture of primary and iPSC-derived lung progenitors and the method could be expanded to the culture of other epithelial progenitor and stem cell aggregates.","output":"Microstructured hydrogels to guide self-assembly and function of lung alveolospheres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We investigate the prevalence of the self-reported and objective sudden loss of smell (SLS) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Severe COVID-19 patients with self-reported SLS were recruited at hospitalization discharge. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected. The Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) was used to evaluate rhinological complaints. Subjective olfactory and gustatory functions were assessed with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES). Objective SLS was evaluated using psychophysical tests. Potential associations between olfactory evaluation and the clinical outcomes (duration of hospitalization; admission biology; one month serology (IgG), and chest computed tomography findings) were studied. Results: Forty-seven patients completed the study (25 females). Subjectively, eighteen (38.3%) individuals self-reported subjective partial or total SLS. Among them, only three and four were anosmic and hyposmic, respectively (38.9%). Considering the objective evaluation in the entire cohort, the prevalence of SLS was 21.3%. Elderly patients and those with diabetes had lower objective olfactory evaluation results than young and non-diabetic individuals. Conclusion: The prevalence of SLS in severe COVID-19 patients appears to be lower than previously estimated in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 forms. Future comparative studies are needed to explore the predictive value of SLS for COVID-19 severity.","output":"Objective olfactory findings in hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Macrolides have been reported to be associated with improved outcomes in patients with viral pneumonia related to influenza and other viruses, possibly because of their immune-modulatory effects. Macrolides have frequently been used in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This study investigated the association of macrolides with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (CoV) RNA clearance in critically ill patients with MERS. METHODS: This retrospective analysis of a multicenter cohort database included 14 tertiary-care hospitals in five cities in Saudi Arabia. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to determine the association of macrolide therapy with 90-day mortality, and the Cox-proportional hazard model to determine the association of macrolide therapy with MERS-CoV RNA clearance. RESULTS: Of 349 critically ill MERS patients, 136 (39%) received macrolide therapy. Azithromycin was most commonly used (97/136; 71.3%). Macrolide therapy was commonly started before the patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU) (51/136; 37.5%), or on day1 in ICU (53/136; 39%). On admission to ICU, the baseline characteristics of patients who received and did not receive macrolides were similar, including demographic data and sequential organ failure assessment score. However, patients who received macrolides were more likely to be admitted with community-acquired MERS (P = 0.02). Macrolide therapy was not independently associated with a significant difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] :0.47C1.51; P = 0.56) or MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted HR: 0.88; 95% CI:0.47C1.64; P = 0.68).

Compatible with this data, we report rapid consumption of FXII in COVID-19, but not in ARDS-influenza, plasma. Interestingly, the kaolin clotting time was not prolonged in COVID-19 as compared to ARDS-influenza. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we show that increased FXII activation rate, in conjunction with elevated fibrinogen levels, triggers formation of fibrinolysis-resistant, compact clots with thin fibers and small pores in COVID-19. Accordingly, we observed clot lysis in 30% of COVID-19 patients and 84% of ARDS-influenza subjects. Analysis of lung tissue sections revealed wide-spread extra- and intra-vascular compact fibrin deposits in COVID-19.

A recent study found that the rs2011404 variant of uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyl-transferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) is a marker of susceptibility to ATDH. The present study aimed to validate this relationship in an Eastern Chinese Han anti-TB treatment population. METHODS A 1:4 matched case-control study was conducted among anti-TB treatment patients in four regions of Jiangsu. ATDH was diagnosed based on the criteria from the Chinese Society of Hepatology and the updated Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between rs2011404 genotypes and the risk of ATDH using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and smoking, drinking, hepatoprotectant use and liver diseases as covariates. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A total of 202 ATDH cases and 808 controls were matched according to age, sex and treatment history. After correcting for potential confounding factors, conditional logistic regression analysis indicated no significant differences in genotypes between the two groups (CC vs. TC: OR = 0.933, 95% CI: 0.457-1.905, p = 0.849). Subgroup analysis suggested that patients carrying the CC genotype at rs2011404 in UGT1A4 were at a reduced risk of moderate or severe liver injury (OR = 0.293, 95% CI: 0.093-0.921, p = 0.036). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Based on a 1:4 individual matched case-control study, possessing the CC genotype at rs2011404 of the UGT1A4 gene reduces the risk of moderate or severe liver injury in Eastern Chinese Han patients receiving anti-TB treatment. Further research is warranted to explain the role of the UGT1A4 gene and its contribution to individual differences in susceptibility to ATDH.","output":"A validation study of the UGT1A4 rs2011404 variant and the risk of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity in an Eastern Chinese Han population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Those of us who can come to work every day and provide emotional and spiritual support to the patients, families, staff, and to each other despite all challenges.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the IgG antibody production against S and N antigens of the virus and their correlation with the time and severity of the disease. METHODS: The IgG antibodies against S and N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens of 72 symptomatic patients who tested real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the ELISA technique. Different antibody response was compared and the correlation with the time from disease onset and the severity was evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 72 (67%) patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while 24 (33%) did not have detectable antibodies. Comparison of antibody levels for N and S antibodies showed that they correlate with each other well (r= 0.81; P< 0.001). However, sensitivity of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG and anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 30% and 60%, during the first 7 days after symptom onset (r= 0.53; P= 0.111), but increased to 73% and 68% at more than 1-week post symptom onset (r= 0.89, P= 0.111), respectively.

The whole population, despite their social background, were confined inside their homes during this arduous situation. There are numerous articles that endorse the idea that their home conditions, the number of people with whom they coexist with, their employment, gender, amount of physical exercise, as well as their body mass index and their diagnosis in COVID-19 are characteristics that may represent an increased risk of suffering pain and changes in their quality of life. We proposed a study to determine the impact of the confinement on pain, quality of life and public health of the Spanish population due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS An observational study was carried out during April and May 2020 through an online survey. It was statistically analysed through descriptive analysis and inferential analysis by bivariate logistic regression, ordinal logistic and Pearson's chi square. RESULTS A total of 225 questionnaires were obtained between April and May 2020. For subjects suffering pain before confinement, significant relationships were drawn between experiencing pain and work-related activities (P=0.006), as well as, physical activity or the absence of it (P=0.033). In addition, an important association between experiencing pain and gender was discovered, both for people suffering pain before and during confinement (P=0.007 and P=0.011).

Likewise, tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs such as osimertinib used in lung cancer patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation are associated with heart failure or prolongation of the QT interval. Case report: 62-year-old woman diagnosed in September 2019 of lung adenocarcinoma stage IV with bilateral lung and lymph node involvement, carrier of an EGFR mutation (Ex19Del) on treatment with osimertinib. She attended emergency department for fever and hypotension 24 hours after administration of the third dose of Moderna? COVID-19 vaccine in the context of acute myocarditis with evidence of severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in cardiogenic shock. She required vasoactive support, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, corticotherapy, immunoglobulins and subsequent ventricular support with Impella, with improvement of the clinical picture after 3 days.

METHODS: We used multipronged approaches, including a. Situation analyses using a literature review, key personnel and stakeholders consultative meetings, and exploratory studies. A grounded theory approach was used for qualitative data collection from health facilities across three districts in Bangladesh. We conducted in-depth interviews with CHWs (Health Inspector; Community Health Care Provider; Health Assistant and Health Supervisor) (n = 4); key informant interviews with central level health policymakers/ managers (n = 15) and focus group discussions with CHWs (4 FGDs; total n = 29).

RESULTS: The CHWs in Bangladesh deliver a wide range of public health programs. They also provide several NCDs specific services, including screening, provisional diagnosis, and health education and counselling for common NCDs, dispensing basic medications, and referral to relevant health facilities. These services are being delivered from the sub-district health facility, community clinics and urban health clinics. The participants identified key challenges and barriers, which include lack of NCD specific guidelines, inadequate training, excessive workload, inadequate systems-level support, and lack of logistics supplies and drugs. Yet, the facilitating factors to engaging CHWs included government commitment and program priority, development of NCD related policies and strategies, establishment of NCD corners, community support systems, social recognition of health care staff and their motivation.

RESULTS: In this paper, we proposed a novel computation model for DDA predictions based on graph representation learning over multi-biomolecular network (GRLMN). More specifically, we firstly constructed a large-scale molecular association network (MAN) by integrating the associations among drugs, diseases, proteins, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. Then, a graph embedding model was used to learn vector representations for all drugs and diseases in MAN. Finally, the combined features were fed to a random forest (RF) model to predict new DDAs. The proposed model was evaluated on the SCMFDD-S data set using five-fold cross-validation. Experiment results showed that GRLMN model was very accurate with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 87.9%, which outperformed all previous works in terms of both accuracy and AUC in benchmark dataset. To further verify the high performance of GRLMN, we carried out two case studies for two common diseases. As a result, in the ranking of drugs that were predicted to be related to certain diseases (such as kidney disease and fever), 15 of the top 20 drugs have been experimentally confirmed.

The cytokine storm (systemic inflammation) present in COVID-19 causes organ failure by inflaming the vascular endothelium, leading to endothelial dysfunction and eventually death. Previous studies in the laboratory show that vascular injury leads to endothelial dysfunction that is associated with activation of p38 MAPK signaling and altered phosphorylation of Niban. Based on these findings, a cell permeant phosphomimetic peptide of Niban (NiPp) was developed and shows inhibitory activities on p38 MAPK and restores endothelial dysfunction after vascular injury. The effects of NiPp on endothelial dysfunction induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1), a cytokine that is increased during infections, were examined ex-vivo using intact rat aortic tissue (RA) and primary human endothelial cells (HCAEC). IL-1 treatment led to a reduction in endothelial-dependent relaxation (EDR) in RA, and inhibition of p38 MAPK by NiPp or BIRB796, a potent p38 MAPK inhibitor, improved EDR in IL-1 treated RA (Figure 1). Treatment of HCAEC with NiPp or BIRB reduced IL-1 induced activation of p38 MAPK and its downstream substrate, CREB (Figure 2). These data show that p38 MAPK and Niban signaling play a role in endothelial function, especially in response to inflammatory injury. Niban may be an endogenous regulator of p38 MAPK activation.

RESULTS: A total of 493 severe and 228 critical cases out of 753 COVID-19 cases were considered in this study. Among the critical cases, the death rate was 79.4%, and age was a risk factor for death. Compared to the severe disease group, the critical disease group had higher white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts and a decreased lymphocyte count at admission. Compared to early death cases (death within 1 week after admission), a more prolonged course of the disease was associated with a higher risk of hypoproteinemia, liver injury, thrombocytopenia, anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), coagulation disorders, acute kidney injury (AKI), and infection.

Notably, anticoagulation therapy was associated with an improved prognosis of critical cases in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Our results showed large differences between patients with severe and critical COVID-19. During the course of COVID-19 in the critical disease group, the incidence of hypoproteinemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders increased significantly, which highlighted the importance of medical care in the first week after admission. LDH could act as an independent predictor of early death in critical cases, and anticoagulation therapy was correlated with an improved prognosis of patients with critical COVID-19.

Due to the similarity of symptoms between the two disease states, patients can be incorrectly diagnosed with the other ailment in areas with limited health resources. There is a dearth of knowledge of co-infection between COVID-19 and malaria from healthcare providers perspective. Hence, this study assessed the ability of primary healthcare workers to diagnose malaria infection correctly from COVID-19 infection. MethodsA multistage sampling technique was used to select health care workers who were directly involved in malaria case management at 261 government-owned primary health facilities in Oyo State. Socio-demographic characteristics of respondents, knowledge & practices, COVID-19 differential diagnosis and challenges that healthcare workers face regarding malaria diagnosis were obtained using a standardized electronic structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted on data collected and significant results were interpreted at a 5% level of significance. ResultsA good percentage of the respondents (81.6%, 74.3%) had good knowledge about malaria and COVID-19 infection. However, the knowledge gained did not translate to practice, as majority (86.2%) of respondents had poor malaria diagnosis practices. Practices relating to COVID-19 differential diagnosis in 69.7% of respondents were also poor. Most of the respondents attributed poor practices to the unavailability of Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (mRDT), inadequate training and continuous capacity improvement. Only 12.3% of the respondents had any form of training on malaria diagnosis and treatment in the last five years. ConclusionHarmonization of regular trainings and continuous on-the job capacity building is essential to improve case identification, diagnosis and management of both ailments. Also, uninterrupted supplies of essential commodities such as mRDT in laboratories will reduce missed opportunities for malaria diagnosis.","output":"Assessing the knowledge and practices of primary healthcare workers on malaria diagnosis and related challenges in view of COVID-19 outbreak in a Nigerian Southwestern Metropolis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Media reports suggest the switch to online courses due to COVID-19 has demotivated undergraduates.

In this work, we study the characteristics of automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for automated contact tracing to work for the current pandemic. We display the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequately sample the population, which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold.

Because the development of new effective vaccines or treatments against the virus can take time, an urgent need exists for the rapid development and design of new drug candidates to combat this pathogen. Here, we obtained antiviral peptides obtained from the data repository of antimicrobial peptides (DRAMP) and screened their predicted tertiary structures for the ability to inhibit the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using multiple combinatorial docking programs, including PatchDock, FireDock, and ClusPro. The four best peptides, DRAMP00877, DRAMP02333, DRAMP02669, and DRAMP03804, had binding energies of ?1125.3, ?1084.5, ?1005.2, and ?924.2 Kcal/mol, respectively, as determined using ClusPro, and binding energies of ?55.37, ?50.96, ?49.25, ?54.81 Kcal/mol, respectively, as determined using FireDock, which were better binding energy values than observed for other peptide molecules. These peptides were found to bind with the active cavity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease; at Glu166, Cys145, Asn142, Phe140, and Met165, in addition to the substrate-binding sites, Domain 2 and Domain 3, whereas fewer interactions were observed with Domain 1. The docking studies were further confirmed by a molecular dynamics simulation study, in which several descriptors, including the root-mean-square difference (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), radius of gyration (Rg), and hydrogen bond formation, confirmed the stable nature of the peptideCmain protease complexes.

While the negative effects of school closure cannot be ignored, accumulating data suggested that it is necessary for reducing community transmission. Our study presents an optional strategy for safe school opening during a pandemic, implemented in selected Israeli high schools by a special task force constructed by the Sheba Medical Center (SMC). METHODS The study took place between November 2020 and April 2021. Three schools from different areas of Israel were enrolled. The participants were asked to undergo bi-weekly SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnostic antigen tests (Ag-RDT). Those who tested positive were requested to self-isolate, whereas their school contacts were tested daily by Ag-RDT. Participants with a previously documented SARS-CoV-2 infection or who were found to be SARS-CoV-2 seropositive upon enrollment were exempted from screening. RESULTS Of a total of 361 participants who enrolled in the study, 12.3% were found to be seropositive. Fourteen SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected (3.5%), 12 of them in one single school located in an endemic area for SARS-CoV-2. The 14 cases resulted in 84 days of COVID-19-related absence from school, comparing with 1775 potential days of COVID-19-related absence under a strategy implementing self-isolation instead of testing.

The picture fuzzy number (PFN) is an ordered value triple, including a membership degree, a neutral-membership degree, a non-membership degree, of a PFS. The PFN is a useful tool to study the problems that have uncertain information in real life. In this paper, the main aim is to develop basic foundations that can become tools for future research related to PFN and picture fuzzy calculus. We first establish a semi-linear space for PFNs by providing two new definitions of two basic operations, addition and scalar multiplication, such that the set of PFNs together with these two operations can form a semi-linear space. Moreover, we also provide some important properties and concepts such as metrics, order relations between two PFNs, geometric difference, multiplication of two PFNs. Next, we introduce picture fuzzy functions with a real domain that is also known as picture fuzzy functions with time-varying values, called geometric picture fuzzy function (GPFFs). In this framework, we give definitions about the limit of GPFFs and sequences of PFN. The important limit properties are also presented in detail.

Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of these oils against pathogens transmitted by this pest was also investigated. RESULTS The obtained results indicate the possibility of using Greek oregano EO with a high content of carvacrol as a feed additive in poultry nutrition. The use of the Greek oregano oil at 1% (w/w) dose showed stronger reduction of body weight gain of stage IV larvae. Their body mass was only 10.92% of the control. Moreover, EOs from O. vulgare strongly inhibited the growth of tested bacterial strains as well as Candida albicans.

The diverse range of infectious agents encompasses the gamut of microbes that can affect humans: bacteria [including rickettsiae and mycobacteria], viruses, fungi, parasites [protozoa, metazoan, and helminths], and prions. Infectious agents can be transmitted by animals by several different mechanisms: fecal-oral route with foodborne zoonoses or accidentally through contamination of drinking water or the unwashed hands, direct contact with or without bites or scratches, indirectly through various vectors [mosquitos, sandflies, fleas, and ticks], and incidentally by environmental contamination with animal pathogens, including aerosol of dried infected animal excrements.","output":"Animals and Mechanisms of Disease Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuropathological studies can elucidate the mechanisms of nervous system damage associated with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.

We retrieved quantitative data regarding demographic, clinical, and neuropathological findings. We carried out a Wilcoxon rank sum test or (2) test to compare patients' subgroups based on different clinical and brain pathology features. RESULTS: Neuropathological findings in COVID\\\\19 patients were microgliosis (52.5%), astrogliosis (45.6%), inflammatory infiltrates (44.0%), hypoxic\\\\ischemic lesions (40.8%), edema (25.3%), and hemorrhagic lesions (20.5%).

There are currently no antiviral therapies approved for the treatment or prevention of mild to moderate COVID-19 as remdesivir is only approved for severe COVID-19 cases. Here, we evaluated the antiviral potential of a Propylamylatin formula, which is a mixture of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates. The Propylamylatin formula was investigated in gaseous and liquid phases against 1 mL viral suspensions containing 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. Viral suspensions were sampled at various times post-exposure and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Propylamylatin formula vapors were effective at inactivating infectious SARS-CoV-2 to undetectable levels at room temperature and body temperature, but the decline in virus was substantially faster at the higher temperature (15 min versus 24 h). The direct injection of liquid Propylamylatin formula into viral suspensions also completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and the rapidity of inactivation occurred in an exposure dependent manner. The overall volume that resulted in 90% viral inactivation over the course of the direct injection experiment (EC90) was 4.28 ls. Further investigation revealed that the majority of the antiviral effect was attributed to the propionic acid which yielded an overall EC90 value of 11.50 ls whereas the isoamyl hexanoates provided at most a 10-fold reduction in infectious virus. The combination of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates was much more potent than the individual components alone, suggesting synergy between these components. These findings illustrate the therapeutic promise of the Propylamylatin formula as a potential treatment strategy for COVID-19 and future studies are warranted.","output":"Antiviral Activity of the PropylamylatinTM Formula against the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro Using Direct Injection and Gas Assays in Virus Suspensions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia started with 2 cases on March 2, 2020, and as of May 11, a total of 14 265 people were infected The government through Task Force for COVID-19 Rapid Response informs the progress of COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, but no one has provided a picture of the risk distribution in all provinces in Indonesia This research is intended to identify high-risk provinces based on risk factors in each province and to find COVID-19 hotspots This is an ecological study that used aggregate data We used a map to present the risk distribution in Indonesia, and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) to define the hotspot area of COVID-19 in Indonesia There are 6 provinces identified as high-risk areas of COVID-19 in Indonesia, and the hotspot provinces are Banten, DKI Jakarta, West Java, East Java, and Central Java","output":"The Risk Distribution of COVID-19 in Indonesia: A Spatial Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coxiella burnetii is globally distributed but evidence of zoonotic transmission in the Caribbean region is scarce.

These transitions present new stressors, including the stress associated with physical health, with the demands of social distancing placed on families, and with the possibility of losing a job or not being able to pay bills. Such stressors have the potential to disrupt basic functioning, such as sleep and daily energy levels. Furthermore, the impact of stress might have repercussions on parents capacities to be psychologically flexible, thus putting their psychological functioning at risk. Drawing upon a contextual behavioral science perspective, the current study sought to examine links between COVID-19-related stressors and psychological flexibility/inflexibility through such basic processes as parents perceived sleep quality and daily energy level. METHODS: A total of 1003 parents (97% from the US; 74% female; M = 40.9 years old, SD = 8.5) of children (ages 5-18) completed an online survey from the end of March to the end of April of 2020. RESULTS: Path analyses suggested that, after controlling health-related stress and the stress of work and parenting demands due to the pandemic directly predicting greater inflexibility and lower inflexibility, two mediation paths emerged. Specifically, higher levels of health-related stress were associated with lower levels of energy, which, in turn predicted lower levels of psychological flexibility. In addition, higher levels of health-related stress were associated with lower perceived sleep quality, which, in turn, was associated with higher levels of psychological inflexibility. In secondary analyses on the specific dimensions of flexibility and inflexibility, results suggested that lower energy levels indirectly linked health-related stress to lower levels of all 6 dimensions of flexibility and poorer sleep quality indirectly linked health-related stress to higher levels of self-as-content, fusion, and inaction. CONCLUSIONS: The stressors associated with COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to disrupt parents perceived sleep quality and daily energy levels, reducing their abilities to respond to difficult or challenging experiences in a flexible manner and instead promoting more reactive and inflexible responses.","output":"Mediators of the Association between COVID-19-Related Stressors and Parents Psychological Flexibility and Inflexibility: The Roles of Perceived Sleep Quality and Energy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extinction of species across the globe is accelerating directly or indirectly from human activities.

Candida is one of the most common pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs), affecting 6 to 10% of patients, and some studies have reported an increasing trend in the prevalence of candidemia. The literature data that we analysed showed that the most common types of fungal infection among patients with a severe course of COVID-19 were C. albicans, then C. auris, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, S. cerevisiae, C. krusei and Rhodotorula spp. Candida non-albicans species, in particular C. glabrata, C. auris, were the most common causes of death. The previous treatment regimens for patients with COVID-19 included antibiotics, but at present time corticosteroids are more often used, which have an immunosuppressive effect and, accordingly, predispose to the development of candidiasis. The epithelial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 also enables Candida to attach to the basement membrane, subsequently triggering the development of mucosal candidiasis. As the systemic and local candidiasis are conditioned by common immune mechanisms that are affected by coronavirus infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) may recur during COVID-19 therapy. The timely diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections in patients who underwent COVID-19 are crucial for achieving a positive clinical outcome. The article provides an algorithm for the management of patients with recurrent VVC, the principles of action of antifungal drugs, their acceptability and efficacy. ? 2021, Remedium Group Ltd.

Most experts endorse the view that the virus has a zoonotic origin with the final spillover being associated with wildlife trade. Besides human consumption, wild animals are also extensively traded as pets. Information on zoonotic diseases has been reported to reduce consumer demand for exotic pets. We conducted a global survey and collected 162 responses from international experts on exotic pet trade (traders, academics, NGOs, enforcement entities) to understand how the legal and illegal trade of exotic pets is expected to be affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Our results suggest that legal purchase of exotic pets is perceived as decreasing during the first pandemic wave due to: lower availability of animals for trade, suppliers inability to reach consumers and social distancing measures. The general perception is that in the future (i.e., next five years), both demand and supply of legally traded exotic pets are expected to either remain unchanged or decrease only temporarily. The consumer demand for illegal exotic pets is also expected to remain unchanged following the outbreak. The top two challenges reported by respondents, when considering the consequences of the pandemic for the exotic pet trade, are inadequate enforcement of national regulations and increased illegal trade. Our results suggest that the negative consequences of a zoonotic outbreak may not dissuade consumers of exotic pets. Worldwide, the transit/storing conditions and lack of health screenings of traded live animals are conducive to spreading diseases. Consumer demand is a key driver of trade, and enforcement of trade regulations will remain challenging, unless factors driving consumer demand are adequately incorporated in problem-solving frameworks. We emphasize the complexity of trade dynamics and the need to go beyond bans on wildlife trade. Stronger law enforcement, implemented along with initiatives dissuading consumption of wild exotic pets, are essential to sustainably satisfy the market demand.","output":"Impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the global demand for exotic pets: An expert elicitation approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long COVID is seen in a growing group of patients who experience a large number of symptoms after previous infection with SARS-CoV-2.

After hospitalization of approximately 2-4 days, these patients return home presenting a possible radiation hazard to the people around them. This work aims to estimate the possible radiation burden to people (co-travelers and cohabitants) which came in contact with the patients after their release from the hospital, analyzing data obtained during their hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from 1065 patients were used to estimate the possible radiation burden to family members and people that came in contact with the patients, grouping them according to their age, type of contact with the patient (co-traveler, cohabitant) and patient family status, assuming different exposure scenarios for each group and based on the written precautions given to all patients before discharge. Relations between the iodine effective half-life (Teff), estimated from patient dose rate measurements during hospitalization, patient age and the method used for thyroid preparation for ablation (thyroid hormone withdrawal-THW or administration of recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone-rhTSH) were also investigated. RESULTS Median absorbed dose to adult cohabitants was estimated to be 8.3Sv (0.1-117.2Sv), to babies (0-5yr) 15.7Sv (1.2-196.1Sv), to young children (5-10yr) 13.1Sv (0.8-100.7Sv), to children (10-18yr) 8.4Sv (0.5-116.8Sv) and to co-travelers 4.8Sv (0.2-114.9Sv). The highest doses to cohabitants were estimated in the few cases where the patient was a single parent of one or more children (median children dose 28.9Sv, range 11.2-279.4Sv). A statistically significant difference in median Teff between THW (15.1h) and rhTSH (13.9h) patient groups was found. CONCLUSION Provided necessary precautions are followed, radiation burden to the family members and co-travelers of DTC patients treated with radioiodine following thyroidectomy can be kept well below the corresponding dose limits and constraints.","output":"Absorbed dose estimation to cohabitants and co-travelers of patients treated with radioiodine for differentiated thyroid carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several factors ranging from environmental risks to the genetics of the virus and that of the hosts, affect the spread of COVID-19. The impact of physicochemical variables on virus vitality and spread should be taken into account in experimental and clinical studies. Another avenue to explore is the effect of diet and its interaction with the immune system on SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rate. Past year have witnessed extensive studies on virus and pathophysiology of the COVID-19 disease and the cellular mechanisms of virus spreading. However, our knowledge has not reached a level where we plan an efficient therapeutic approach to prevent the virus entry to the cells or decreasing the spreading and morbidity in severe cases of disease. The risk of infection directly correlates with the control of virus spreading via droplets and aerosol transmission, as well as patient immune system response. A key goal in virus restriction and transmission rate is to understand the physicochemical structure of aerosol and droplet formation, and the parameters that affect the droplet-borne and airborne in different environmental conditions. The lifetime of droplets on different surfaces is described based on the contact angle. Hereby, we recommend regular use of high-quality face masks in high temperature and low humidity conditions. However, in humid and cold weather conditions, wearing gloves and frequently hand washing, gain a higher priority. Additionally, social distancing rules should be respected in all aforementioned conditions. We will also discuss different routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and how multiple genetic factors play a role in the spread of the virus.

Preliminary evidence as of July 2020 supports a more optimistic assessment. To date, most low- and middle-income countries have a significantly lower death toll per capita than richer countries, a pattern that can be partially explained by younger populations and limited obesity. On the economic front, emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) have seen massive capital outflows and large price declines for certain commodities, especially oil and nonprecious metals, but net capital outflows are in line with earlier commodity price shocks. While there is considerable heterogeneity in how specific countries will be affected in the short and medium run, we are cautiously optimistic that financial markets in the largest EMDEs, especially those not reliant on energy and metal exports, could recover quickly-assuming the disease burden is ultimately not as dire in these countries. In the long run, the highest costs may be due to the indirect effects of virus containment policies on poverty, health, and education as well as the effects of accelerating deglobalization on EMDEs.

The study aims to assess the clinical instructors' perception, attitudes and subjective impression towards the various sessions of the faculty development programme for teaching ACGME competencies. METHODS: During 2009 and 2010, 134 clinical instructors participated in the programme to establish their ability to teach and assess PGY(1) residents about ACGME competencies. RESULTS: The participants in the faculty development programme reported that the skills most often used while teaching were learnt during circuit and itinerant bedside, physical examination teaching, mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) evaluation demonstration, training workshop and videotapes of how to teach ACGME competencies. Participants reported that circuit bedside teaching and mini-CEX evaluation demonstrations helped them in the interpersonal and communication skills domain, and that the itinerant teaching demonstrations helped them in the professionalism domain, while physical examination teaching and mini-CEX evaluation demonstrations helped them in the patients' care domain.

METHODS: : An online anonymous survey was conducted between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey included two self-administered questionnaires: one collected personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent epidemic area contact history, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). RESULTS: : A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSD among the Chinese public one month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p < 0.001), epidemic area contact history (p = 0.047), classification of population (p < 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001) could be regarded as predictors for PTSD. LIMITATIONS: : First, the majority of participants in this study were the general public, with confirmed or suspected patients constituted only a small part. Second, the measurement of PTSD in this study may be vulnerable to selection bias because of an online self-report study, such as participants recruitment. Third, the prevalence of PTSD in this study was estimated by an online questionnaire rather than a clinical interview.

METHODS We conducted a scoping literature review to search for English language articles published through July 15, 2019 to identify studies that reported the testing and/or evaluation of interventions to improve adherence to oral anti-neoplastic agents. RESULTS A total of 56 articles were selected for review. Of the studies evaluated, 14 were randomized trials. All interventions except two targeted adult patients. Thirty-three studies enrolled fewer than 100 patients. The majority of interventions were education and counseling-based and centered on provision of information about the drug and strategies to manage side effects. Only 8 studies used an mHealth tool and/or text messages to target non-adherence. Among studies with a comparison sample, fewer than half (44.7%) reported statistically significant improvements in adherence or persistence associated with the intervention; however, some pharmacist-directed programs, particularly those that integrated monitoring or routine follow-up with a provider, did demonstrate efficacy. CONCLUSION Although the development of adherence-promoting interventions for oral anti-neoplastic therapies has increased recently, few have been rigorously tested. The nascent literature suggests those that are pharmacist-directed and utilize regular monitoring show promise though additional prospective studies are needed.

The assembly of ubiquitin into polymeric chains by E3 ubiquitin ligases underlies the pleiotropic functions ubiquitin chains regulate. Ubiquitin chains assembled via the N-terminal methionine, termed Met1-linked ubiquitin chains or linear ubiquitin chains, have emerged as essential signalling scaffolds that regulate pro-inflammatory responses, anti-viral interferon responses, cell death and xenophagy of bacterial pathogens downstream of innate immune receptors. Met1-linked ubiquitin chains are exclusively assembled by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, and are disassembled by the deubiquitinases OTULIN and CYLD. Genetic defects that perturb the regulation of Met1-linked ubiquitin chains causes severe immune-related disorders, illustrating their potent signalling capacity. Here, we review the current knowledge about the cellular machinery that conjugates, recognises, and disassembles Met1-linked ubiquitin chains, and discuss the function of this unique posttranslational modification in regulating inflammation, cell death and immunity to pathogens.","output":"The Met1-linked ubiquitin machinery in inflammation and infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the confirmed COVIDs cases were raised in Iraq in the middle of Feb. 2021, the Iraqi government performed a closure approach to constrain mobility movements, factory operations and keeping private social distance.

In the absence of appropriate antiviral drugs or vaccines, developing a simple, rapid, and reliable assay for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: A novel molecular diagnosis technique, named multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, that has been linked to a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (mRT-LAMP-LFB) was applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and N genes, and the mRT-LAMP products were analyzed using nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor. The mRT-LAMP-LFB amplification conditions, including the target RNA concentration, amplification temperature, and time were optimized. The sensitivity and specificity of the mRT-LAMP-LFB method were tested in the current study, and the mRT-LAMP-LFB assay was applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus from clinical samples and artificial sputum samples. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 specific primers based on the RdRp and N genes were valid for the establishment of mRT-LAMP-LFB assay to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The multiple-RT-LAMP amplification condition was optimized at 63C for 30 min. The full process, including reaction preparation, viral RNA extraction, RT-LAMP, and product identification, could be achieved in 80 min. The limit of detection (LoD) of the mRT-LAMP-LFB technology was 20 copies per reaction. The specificity of mRT-LAMP-LFB detection was 100%, and no cross-reactions to other respiratory pathogens were observed.

Limited information exists in Tanzania on antimicrobial resistance surveillance to delineate the potential sources of multi-drug-resistant bacteria for specific mitigation strategies among orthopaedic patients. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza city between January and May 2020. It involved the collection of rectal swabs/stools, hand swabs, and environmental sampling to identify extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria. Participants ' data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analysed to determine factors associated with ESBL colonization among index orthopaedic patients and correlates with other ESBL sources using OR (95% CI) and a cut-off p-value of &lt;=0.05. Results: We found that 47.2% (125/265) of index patients, 77.8% (14/18) of neighbouring patients, 8.3% (2/24) of health-care workers, 72.2% (13/18) of non-medical caregivers, and 31.4% (27/86) of samples taken from the hospital environment had ESBL producers.

Modifications were made to accomplish many tasks, including minimizing gross aspiration, isolating a lung, providing a clear facial surgical field during general anesthesia, monitoring laryngeal nerve damage during surgery, preventing airway fires during laser surgery, and administering medications. In critical care management, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major concern, as it is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost. It is increasingly appreciated that the ETT itself is a primary causative risk for developing VAP. Unfortunately, contaminated oral and gastric secretions leak down past the inflated ETT cuff into the lung. Bacteria can also grow within the ETT in biofilm and re-enter the lung. Modifications to the ETT that attempt to prevent bacteria from entering around the ETT include maintaining an adequate cuff pressure against the tracheal wall, changing the material and shape of the cuff, and aspirating the secretions that sit above the cuff. Attempts to reduce bacterial entry through the tube include antimicrobial coating of the ETT and mechanically scraping the biofilm from within the ETT.

METHODS This cross-sectional study of the 2017 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments Database was exempt from Institutional Review Board Review. We calculated descriptive statistics of the frequency, type, and amount (medians) of general, research, and ownerships transactions made to EPs from industry, described regional differences of median payments to EPs, and characterized the drugs or devices most commonly associated with transactions. RESULTS In 2017, among 40,899 practicing U.S. EPs, 14,447 (35.4%) received 51,870 general payments from industry totaling $12,870,832. The median per-physician payment was $18.30 (interquartile range [IQR], $13.63-$60.90). The most frequent transaction was food and beverage (89.6%), though most payments by dollar amount were related to speaker and consulting fees (74.5%). Antithrombotics were the most frequently drug or device associated with transactions. Only 35 (0.08%) and 20 (0.05%) EPs had research and ownership relationships with industry, respectively. A significant difference was observed in median payments per physician across all U.S. Census regions (p < 0.01) except when comparing Northeast and West (p = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS Over one-third of U.S. EPs had general payments from industry in 2017, while <1% of EPs had either research and ownership payments during this time period.

Evidence suggests advanced age is associated with worse outcomes. To date, no large data sets exist describing outcomes in older individuals, and risk factor identification is lacking. METHODS: Retrospective data were obtained from the 2015 Medicare 100% sample. Included in the analysis were those aged &#8805;65 y with a primary diagnosis of an NSTI (gas gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis, cutaneous gangrene, or Fournier's gangrene). Risk factors for in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition were examined. Continuous variables were assessed using central tendency, t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Categorical variables were assessed using the chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS: 1427 patient records were reviewed. 59% of patients were male, and the overall mean age was 75.48.6 y. 1385 (97.0%) patients required emergency surgery for their NSTI diagnosis. The overall mortality was 5.3%. Several underlying comorbidities were associated with higher rates of mortality including cancer (OR: 3.50, P = 0.0009), liver disease (OR: 2.97, P = 0.03), and kidney disease (OR: 2.15, P = 0.01). While associated with high in-hospital mortality, these diagnoses were not associated with a difference in the rate of discharge to home compared with skilled nursing or rehab. Overall, patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities or rehab had higher rates of underlying comorbidities than patients who were discharged home (3 or more comorbid illness 84.3% versus 68.6%, P < 0.0001); however, no individual comorbid illness was associated with discharge location. CONCLUSIONS: In our Medicare data set, we identified several medical comorbidities that are associated with increased rates of in-hospital mortality. Patients with underlying cancers had the highest odds of increased mortality. The effect on outcomes of the potentially immunosuppressive cancer treatments in these patients is unknown. These data suggest that patients with underlying illnesses, especially cancer, kidney disease, or liver disease have higher mortalities and are more likely to be discharged to skilled nursing facilities or rehab. It is unclear why these illnesses were associated with these worse outcomes while others including diabetes and heart disease were not. These data suggest that these particular comorbid illnesses may have special prognostic implications, although further analysis is necessary to identify the causative factors.","output":"Analyzing Outcomes Among Older Adults With Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to assess dental care needs in Cluj region during the State of Emergency, declared due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the same period of the year 2019 A descriptive retrospective analysis was conducted, which retrieved patients seeking emergency dental services at the Emergency Department of County General Hospital and &ldquo;Iuliu Ha?ieganu&rdquo;University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, the only dental service available in April 2020 Recorded data cover the month of April 2020 and is compared with the same period of 2019 During April 2020, 724 patients received dental care, whereas only 160 patients were treated in April 2019 in the same facility The number of patients with acute apical periodontitis, abscess, and acute pulpitis was significantly higher in 2020 The percentage of patients receiving sedative filling for the treatment of acute pulpitis in 2020 was significantly higher than in 2019, while the proportion of patients receiving pulpectomy was higher in 2019 The percentage of patients receiving endodontic drainage for the treatment of acute periapical periodontitis in 2020 was higher This study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the use of medical care services and could further impact the oral health and quality of life of patients","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Dental Emergency Services in Cluj-Napoca Metropolitan Area: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The antiparasitic agent niclosamide has been demonstrated to inhibit the arthropod-borne Zika virus. Here, we investigated the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 infection in vitro and in vivo. PRINCIPLE FINDING: Niclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response. Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression. Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection. Similar to the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication.

METHODS We obtained clinical samples from nine normal eutopic endometrium tissues, eight ovarian endometriotic tissues, and 12 leuprolide acetate-treated endometriotic tissues. We compared the gene expression profiles of the three groups using Affymetrix GeneChip Human genome arrays and bioinformatic analysis, including molecular concept analysis. RESULTS Leuprolide acetate-treated endometriotic tissue showed downregulated genes associated with the biological functions of steroid hormone regulation, cell proliferation, inflammation, and intracellular signaling.

This study gives new insight into the effects of leuprolide acetate treatment. Further investigations with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry are needed to validate this study and to explore new therapeutic targets and biomarkers of endometriosis.","output":"Differential mRNA expression profiling in ovarian endometriotic tissue with versus without leuprolide acetate treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The electrochemical biosensors are a class of biosensors which convert biological information such as analyte concentration that is a biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) into current or voltage. Electrochemical biosensors depict propitious diagnostic technology which can detect biomarkers in body fluids such as sweat, blood, feces, or urine. Combinations of suitable immobilization techniques with effective transducers give rise to an efficient biosensor. They have been employed in the food industry, medical sciences, defense, studying plant biology, etc. While sensing complex structures and entities, a large data is obtained, and it becomes difficult to manually interpret all the data. Machine learning helps in interpreting large sensing data. In the case of biosensors, the presence of impurity affects the performance of the sensor and machine learning helps in removing signals obtained from the contaminants to obtain a high sensitivity. In this review, we discuss different types of biosensors along with their applications and the benefits of machine learning. This is followed by a discussion on the challenges, missing gaps in the knowledge, and solutions in the field of electrochemical biosensors. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for scientists and engineers entering the interdisciplinary field of electrochemical biosensors. Furthermore, this review provides insight into the type of electrochemical biosensors, their applications, the importance of machine learning (ML) in biosensing, and challenges and future outlook.","output":"Recent Advances in Electrochemical Biosensors: Applications, Challenges, and Future Scope"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A large proportion of people in need of care in Germany are cared for at home by relatives. Caregiving is associated with various burdens for family caregivers. The Covid-19 pandemic and the protective measures to restrict public life such as social distancing and the closure of services and educational institutions, add further challenges. Little is known about how they are perceived by family caregivers. Based on an analysis of social media posts, the aim of the present study was to explore the additional strains family caregivers experience during the pandemic. Methods The German-language versions of the social media sites Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube comments were systematically searched with regard to the pandemic-related burdens of family caregivers and examined using qualitative content analysis. The search was conducted from Nov 24, 2020 to Dec 8, 2020. A total of 237 social media posts were included in the data analysis. Results Seven main categories with varying numbers of subcategories were identified: Care and support (lack of care and support services, care in case of illness or quarantine), deterioration of the condition of the person being cared for, psychological challenges, financial challenges, infection control, access to protective equipment (questions and problems regarding infection control measures), and acknowledgement of family caregivers (consideration of relatives of children or people with disabilities, unequal treatment, and consideration in the context of protective measures). Conclusions Family caregivers are affected by additional burdens during the pandemic, which make it is necessary to develop support and relief services tailored to this population group. The results of the present study can contribute to the development of respective diversity-sensitive support services.","output":"Burdens of family caregivers during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany.

Our results reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein contributes to the viral activation of NF-B signaling. Nsp14 caused the nuclear translocation of NF-B p65. Nsp14 induced the upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8, which also occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. IL-8 upregulation was further confirmed in lung tissue samples from COVID-19 patients. A previous proteomic screen identified the putative interaction of Nsp14 with host Inosine-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) protein, which is known to regulate NF-B signaling. We confirmed the Nsp14-IMPDH2 protein interaction and found that IMPDH2 knockdown or chemical inhibition using ribavirin (RIB) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) abolishes Nsp14-mediated NF-B activation and cytokine induction. Furthermore, IMDPH2 inhibitors (RIB, MPA) efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that IMDPH2, and possibly NF-B signaling, is beneficial to viral replication. Overall, our results identify a novel role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 in causing the activation of NF-B.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 activates NF-B signaling and induces IL-8 upregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic, many hospitals imposed a no-visitation policy for visiting patients in hospitals to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among visitors and patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the no-visitation policy and delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: This was a single-center, before-after comparative study. Patients were admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU from September 6, 2019 to October 18, 2020. Because no-visitation policy was implemented on February 26, 2020, we compared patients admitted after this date (after phase) with the patients admitted before the no-visitation policy (before phase) was implemented. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium during the ICU stay. Cox regression was used for the primary analysis and was calculated using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Covariates were age, sex, APACHE II, dementia, emergency surgery, benzodiazepine, and mechanical ventilation use. RESULTS: Of the total 200 patients consecutively recruited, 100 were exposed to a no-visitation policy. The number of patients who developed delirium during ICU stay during the before phase and the after phase were 59 (59%) and 64 (64%), respectively (P = 0.127). The adjusted HR of no-visitation policy for the number of days until the first development of delirium during the ICU stay was 0.895 (0.613C1.306).

This study examined changes in smoking behavior during the COVID-19 state of emergency. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Osaka, Japan. To assess differences in smoking behavior among 5,120 current smokers before and after the declaration of a state of emergency, prevalence ratios (PRs) for two outcomes, increased smoking and quitting smoking, were calculated using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for potential covariates. RESULTS: We found 32.1% increased the number of cigarettes smoked and 11.9% quit smoking. After adjustment for all variables, we found risk factors for COVID-19 (men and older age group) had both significantly higher PR for quitting smoking (men: PR 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17C1.62) and participants aged 65 years: PR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.92C3.12) and significantly lower PR of increased smoking (men: PR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78C0.93 and participants 65 years: PR 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29C0.49). Additionally, respondents working from home or living alone had significantly higher PR for increased smoking (working from home: PR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17C1.41 and living alone: PR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10C1.38) and respondents who changed from cigarettes to heated tobacco products (HTPs) had significantly lower PR for quitting smoking (PR 0.150; 95% CI, 0.039C0.582). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest people who have high-risk factors for COVID-19 might change their smoking behavior for the better, while people who work from home or live alone might change their smoking behavior for the worse, during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Additionally, changing from smoking cigarettes to using HTPs makes smokers less likely to quit.","output":"Changes in Smoking Behavior Since the Declaration of the COVID-19 State of Emergency in Japan: A Cross-sectional Study From the Osaka Health App"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we aim to analyze the Italian social media communication about COVID-19 through a Twitter dataset collected in two months.

However, the serum antibody levels in vaccinated individuals gradually decrease over time, while SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing an evolution toward more transmissible variants, such as B.1.617.2, ultimately increasing the risk of breakthrough infections and further virus spread. This cross-sectional online study of adult Poles (n = 2427) was conducted in September 2021 (before a general recommendation to administer a booster COVID-19 vaccine dose in Poland was issued) to assess the attitude of individuals who completed the current vaccination regime toward a potential booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and identify potential factors that may influence it. Overall, 71% of participants declared willingness to receive a booster COVID-19 dose, with a low median level of fear of receiving it of 1.0 (measured by the 10-point Likert-type scale), which was increased particularly in those having a worse experience (in terms of severity of side effects and associated fear) with past COVID-19 vaccination. The lowest frequency of willingness to receive a booster dose (26.7%) was seen in the group previously vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S. The majority of individuals vaccinated previously with mRNA vaccines wished to receive the same vaccine, while in the case of AZD1222, such accordance was observed only in 9.1%. The main reasons against accepting a booster COVID-19 dose included the side effects experienced after previous doses, the opinion that further vaccination is unnecessary, and safety uncertainties. Women, older individuals (50 years), subjects with obesity, chronic diseases, and pre-vaccination and post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections, and those with a history of vaccination against influenza were significantly more frequently willing to receive a booster COVID-19 dose. Moreover, the majority of immunosuppressed individuals (88%) were willing to receive an additional dose.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper are to describe the full design process of an intervention for newly married women, their husbands, and mothers-in-law to improve maternal nutrition and gender norms, and findings from the feasibility and acceptability pilot. METHODS: In this paper we describe the three phases of the design of an intervention in rural Nepal. We first conducted a mixed methods formative phase which included in depth interviews with newly married women, their husbands and mothers-in-law (N=60) and a longitudinal study for 18 months with 200 newly married women. We then designed of a household level, group, intervention, in close partnership with community members. Finally, we conducted a pilot intervention with 90 participants and collected both pre/post survey data and in-depth qualitative interviews with a subset (N= 30). All participants from all phases of the study lived in Nawalparasi district of Nepal. Qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic analysis, with inductive and deductive themes and quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Our formative work highlighted lack of awareness about nutrition, and how women eating last, limited mobility, household and community inequitable gender norms and poor household-level communication contributed to low quality diets. Thus we designed Sumadhur, an intervention that brought groups of households (newly married wife, husband, and mother-in-law) together weekly for four months to strengthen relationships and gain knowledge through interactive content. We found Sumadhur to be highly feasible and acceptable by all respondents, with most (83%) attending 80% of sessions or more and 99% reporting that they would like it to continue. Pre/post surveys showed a decrease in the proportion of women eating last and increase in knowledge about nutrition in preconception and pregnancy. Qualitative interviews suggested that respondents felt it made large impacts on their lives, in terms of strengthening relationships and trust, understanding each other, and changing behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: We show how a designing an intervention in close partnership with the target recipients and local stakeholders can lead to an intervention that is able to target complicated and culturally held practices and beliefs, positively benefit health and wellbeing, and that is very well received.

Here, we describe public compliance to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) public health measures in Dar es Salaam during the early COVID-19 response and testing of the feasibility of an observational method. METHODS: a cross sectional study was conducted between April and May 2020 in Dar es Salaam City. At that time, Dar es Salaam was the epi centre of the epidemic. Respondents were randomly selected from defined population strata (high, medium and low). Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and through observations. RESULTS: a total of 390 subjects were interviewed, response rate was 388 (99.5%). Mean age of the respondents was 34.8 years and 168 (43.1%) had primary level education. Out of the 388 respondents, 384 (98.9%) reported to have heard about COVID-19 public health and social measures, 90.0% had heard from the television and 84.6% from the radio.

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 240 patients with T2DM. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and disease-related data on patients, and the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Diabetes Self-care Scale (DSCS), and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) were used to assess patients' depression status, self-management behavior, and social support, respectively. The Chinese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate cognitive function, with a score <26 set as the threshold for cognitive impairment. Results: The prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in middle-aged and elderly patients with T2DM was 52.5%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that older age, a history of hypoglycemia within 1 month, and depression were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. Education for >12 years, urban living, and a higher total score on the DSCS were independent protective factors against cognitive impairment. Conclusion: T2DM patients with high risk of cognitive impairment can be identified early from the bio-psycho-social perspective. Patients with T2DM who are older, less educated, living in rural areas, have hypoglycemia history, and have poor self-management of diabetes are at increased risk of cognitive impairment.

Drawing from the existing literature, we present a unified ethical principlesCpragmatic considerationsCpolicy indicators framework flexibly applicable across different countries and contexts to assess the ethical soundness of movement-restricting policies. Our framework consolidates 11 unique but related ethical principles (harm, justifiability, proportionality, least restrictive means, utility efficiency, reciprocity, transparency, relevance, equity, accountability, and cost and feasibility). We mapped each ethical principle to answerable questions or pragmatic considerations to subsequently generate 34 policy indicators. These policy indicators can help policymakers and health practitioners to decide the ethically substantiated initiation of movement restrictions, monitor progress and systematically evaluate the imposed restrictions. As an example, we applied the framework to evaluate the first two phases of the largest lockdown (MarchCMay 2020) implemented nationwide in India for its adherence to ethical principles.

Longitudinal studies of viral detections during asymptomatic periods surrounding ARI could facilitate interpretation of viral detections but are currently scant. METHODS We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyze respiratory samples from young Andean children for viruses during asymptomatic periods within 8-120 days of index ARI (cough or fever). We compared viral detections over time within children and explored reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction cycle thresholds (CTs) as surrogates for viral loads. RESULTS At least 1 respiratory virus was detected in 367 (43%) of 859 samples collected during asymptomatic periods, with more frequent detections in periods with rhinorrhea (49%) than those without (34%, P < 0.001). Relative to index ARI with human rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (AdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus detected, the same viruses were also detected during 32, 22, 10 and 3% of asymptomatic periods, respectively. RSV was only detected 8-30 days after index RSV ARI, whereas HRV and AdV were detected throughout asymptomatic periods. Human metapneumovirus and influenza were rarely detected during asymptomatic periods (<3%). No significant differences were observed in the CT for HRV or AdV during asymptomatic periods relative to ARI. For RSV, CTs were significantly lower during ARI relative to the asymptomatic period (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that influenza, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus and RSV detections in children with an ARI usually indicate a causal relationship.

The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry. RESULTS: At 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug. Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover. In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14). The Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P = 0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P = 0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P = 0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P = 0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration. CONCLUSIONS: These remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

Our objectives were to: 1) estimate monthly SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among children aged 0-17 years and 2) calculate ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infections to reported COVID-19 cases among children and adolescents in 14 U.S. states. Methods: Using data from commercial laboratory seroprevalence surveys, we estimated monthly SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among children aged 0-17 years from August 2020 through May 2021. Seroprevalence estimates were based on SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid immunoassays from February to May 2021. We compared estimated numbers of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 2021 to cumulative incidence of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases from case-based surveillance, and calculated infection: case ratios by state and type of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid immunoassay used for seroprevalence testing. Results: Analyses included 67,321 serum specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among children in 14 U.S. states. Estimated ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infections to reported confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases among children and adolescents varied by state and type of immunoassay, ranging from 0.8-13.3 in May 2021. Conclusions: Through May 2021, the majority of children in selected states did not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies. Case-based surveillance underestimated the number of children infected with SARS-CoV-2, however the predicted extent of the underestimate varied by state, immunoassay, and over time.

Identification of natural products with considerable inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial as a rapid and potent alternative with drug-likeness by comparison to de novo antiviral drug discovery approaches. Thereof, we carried out the structure-based screening of natural products from Echinacea-angustifolia, commonly used to prevent cold and other microbial respiratory infections, targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Four natural products namely, Echinacoside, Quercetagetin 7-glucoside, Levan N, Inulin from chicory, and 1,3-Dicaffeoylquinic acid, revealed significant docking energy (>-10 kcal/mol) in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro catalytic pocket via substantial intermolecular contacts formation against co-crystallized ligand (<-4 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the docked poses of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with selected natural products showed conformational stability through molecular dynamics. Exploring the end-point net binding energy exhibited substantial contribution of Coulomb and van der Waals interactions to the stability of respective docked conformations.

(3) Results: We showed that in the early stages of sepsis the innate immune system attempts to counteract infection, probably via neutrophils. Conversely, the adaptive immune system is not yet fully activated, either in septic or in septic shock patients. In addition, immunosuppressive responses and pro-coagulation signals are active in patients with septic shock.

The elucidation of the events associated with the intestinal epithelial response to PEDV infection has been limited by the absence of good in vitro porcine intestinal models that recapitulate the multicellular complexity of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we generated swine enteroids from the intestinal crypt stem cells of the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum and found that the generated enteroids are able to satisfactorily recapitulate the complicated intestinal epithelium in vivo and are susceptible to infection by PEDV. PEDV infected multiple types of cells, including enterocytes, stem cells, and goblet cells, and exhibited segmental infection discrepancies compared with ileal enteroids and colonoids, and this finding was verified in vivo. Moreover, the clinical isolate PEDV-JMS propagated better in ileal enteroids than the cell-adapted isolate PEDV-CV777, and PEDV infection suppressed interferon (IFN) production early during the infection course. IFN lambda elicited a potent antiviral response and inhibited PEDV in enteroids more efficiently than IFN alpha (IFN-). Therefore, swine enteroids provide a novel in vitro model for exploring the pathogenesis of PEDV and for the in vitro study of the interplay between a host and a variety of swine enteric viruses. IMPORTANCE PEDV is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that causes significant economic losses, and the lack of a good in vitro model system is a major roadblock to an in-depth understanding of PEDV pathogenesis. Here, we generated a porcine intestinal enteroid model for PEDV infection. Utilizing porcine intestinal enteroids, we demonstrated that PEDV infects multiple lineages of the intestinal epithelium and preferably infects ileal enteroids over colonoids and that enteroids prefer to respond to IFN lambda 1 over IFN-. These events recapitulate the events that occur in vivo. This study constitutes the first use of a primary intestinal enteroid model to investigate the susceptibility of porcine enteroids to PEDV and to determine the antiviral response following infection. Our study provides important insights into the events associated with PEDV infection of the porcine intestine and provides a valuable in vitro model for studying not only PEDV but also other swine enteric viruses.","output":"Porcine Intestinal Enteroids: a New Model for Studying Enteric Coronavirus Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection and the Host Innate Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information overload is a prevalent challenge in many high-value domains.

Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning framework was developed using 3D CT volumes for COVID-19 classification and lesion localization. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious; the COVID-19 lesions are localized by combining the activation regions in the classification network and the unsupervised connected components. 499 CT volumes were used for training and 131 CT volumes were used for testing. Our algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and discover lesion regions in chest CT without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

While there are multiple vaccines available to prevent COVID-19, a considerable proportion of Americans report some hesitancy to becoming vaccinated, including people with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a study to explore what factors may contribute to COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy among Americans with disabilities. METHODS: We used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to survey 439 people with disabilities (ages 18+) about their concerns of the COVID-19 disease, vaccines, and hesitancy toward vaccination to learn more about factors that influence vaccination hesitancy. Concerns about vaccines were analyzed as a composite variable representing different dimensions such as: side effects, too new, developed too quickly, influenced by politics, and effectiveness. RESULTS: Results from a logistic regression indicate that concern about vaccines was the most significant predictor of hesitancy, even after considering demographic, economic, and geographic factors. Concerns about getting COVID-19, getting tested for COVID-19, trust in experts, education, and being a Democrat were negatively associated with hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that some groups of individuals may be more vaccination hesitant because they are more concerned about vaccine safety than COVID-19 infection. Public health messaging that focuses on the risks of vaccines relative to the risks of COVID-19 might be one strategy to reduce hesitancy and increase vaccination uptake. Messaging should also be tailored to specific disabilities (i.e. physical, mental, sensory), written in plain language, and disseminated in accessible formats.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy among Americans with disabilities aged 18-65: An exploratory analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that mainly affects the lungs.

However, it is understood that SARS-CoV-2 is neurotoxic and neuro-invasive and could enter the central nervous system (CNS) via the hematogenous route or via the peripheral nerve route and causes encephalitis, encephalopathy, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the possibility of SARS-CoV-2-mediated Multiple Sclerosis (MS) development in the future, comparable to the surge in Parkinsons disease cases following the Spanish Flu in 1918. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a cytokine storm. This review highlights the impact of these modulated cytokines on glial cell interactions within the CNS and their role in potentially prompting MS development as a secondary disease by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is neurotropic and could interfere with various functions of neurons leading to MS development. The influence of neuroinflammation, microglia phagocytotic capabilities, as well as hypoxia-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration, are mechanisms that may ultimately trigger MS development.","output":"The Potential Role of COVID-19 in the Pathogenesis of Multiple SclerosisA Preliminary Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a destructive effect on the health and well-being of the global population.

We aimed to identify the prevalence, predictors, and impact on outcome of mild, moderate, and severe admission hyponatremia compared with normonatremia among coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study. SETTING: Four New York City hospitals that are part of the same health network. PATIENTS: Hospitalized, laboratory-confirmed adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted between March 1, 2020, and May 13, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hyponatremia was categorized as mild (sodium: 130-134 mmol/L), moderate (sodium: 121-129 mmol/L), or severe (sodium: &lt;= 120 mmol/L) versus normonatremia (135-145 mmol/L). The primary outcome was the association of increasing severity of hyponatremia and in-hospital mortality assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Secondary outcomes included encephalopathy, acute renal failure, mechanical ventilation, and discharge home compared across sodium levels using Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests. In exploratory analysis, the association of sodium levels and interleukin-6 levels (which has been linked to nonosmotic release of vasopressin) was assessed. Among 4,645 patient encounters, hyponatremia (sodium &lt; 135 mmol/L) occurred in 1,373 (30%) and 374 of 1,373 (27%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Mild, moderate, and severe hyponatremia occurred in 1,032 (22%), 305 (7%), and 36 (1%) patients, respectively. Each level of worsening hyponatremia conferred 43% increased odds of in-hospital death after adjusting for age, gender, race, body mass index, past medical history, admission laboratory abnormalities, admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, renal failure, encephalopathy, and mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43;95% CI, 1.08-1.88;p = 0.012). Increasing severity of hyponatremia was associated with encephalopathy, mechanical ventilation, and decreased probability of discharge home (all p &lt; 0.001). Higher interleukin-6 levels correlated with lower sodium levels (p = 0.017).

All patients underwent two-dimensional, colour, pulsed, and tissue Doppler, and 2D speckle tracking echocardiography examination at admission, 2 weeks, and 2 months after discharge. The MIS-C patient group was compared with the control group. Echocardiographic changes in MIS-C patients during follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 47 patients, 30 (63.8%) were male and 17 (36.2%) were female. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.1  4.3 (1.25-17) years. At admission, 25 patients had abnormal findings on conventional echocardiography. Among them, eight patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly lower in the patient group at admission compared to controls (p = 0.013, p = 0.010, respectively). While the ejection fraction was <55% in eight patients, and global longitudinal strain was lower than -2SD in 29 patients at admission.

METHODS This retrospective and descriptive study included patients who underwent LSG between November 2009 and July 2015 and developed PMVT. The following data were analyzed: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), thrombosis risk factors, surgical technique, thromboembolic prophylaxis, primary surgery outcomes, clinical features, treatment, thrombophilia testing results, and follow-up findings, including imaging and endoscopic findings. RESULTS A total of 1236 patients underwent LSG, and 5 (0.4 %) developed PMVT. The mean age was 34.4 years, and 3 patients were women. The mean BMI was 38.5 kg/m2. Two patients had received hormonal contraceptive treatment. Four patients had a history of smoking. All of the patients received anticoagulant treatment, and none required surgery. The mean hospitalization duration was 7.6 days. Two patients showed complete recanalization. One patient showed portal cavernomatosis on delayed images. Two patients had a positive thrombophilia test. No portal hypertension endoscopic findings were observed. CONCLUSIONS PMVT is a rare complication, for which smoking was identified as a predominant risk factor. Early diagnosis and prompt anticoagulant therapy could lead to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of intestinal infarction, mortality, and extrahepatic portal hypertension in the near future.

Unexpectedly, infection of farmed mink by SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the Netherlands in April 2020 and infections in three mink farms in Denmark were detected in June. Approximately 1140 mink farms were present in Denmark at the time, and a rapid increase in the number of farms with infected mink occurred from September onwards. Features of the infection on these farms were examined and potential routes of transmission between farms evaluated. It is apparent that the infection spread very easily between mink within a farm and can spread to and from people with close contact to the farmed mink. The infection spread between farms in close proximity to each other, but direct human contact is still the only identified route of virus transmission. ABSTRACT: SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of COVID-19 in humans. In April 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed mink (Neovision vision) occurred in the Netherlands. The first outbreaks in Denmark were detected in June 2020 in three farms. A steep increase in the number of infected farms occurred from September and onwards. Here, we describe prevalence data collected from 215 infected mink farms to characterize spread and impact of disease in infected farms. In one third of the farms, no clinical signs were observed. In farms with clinical signs, decreased feed intake, increased mortality and respiratory symptoms were most frequently observed, during a limited time period (median of 11 days). In 65% and 69% of farms, virus and sero-conversion, respectively, were detected in 100% of sampled animals at the first sampling. SARS-CoV-2 was detected, at low levels, in air samples collected close to the mink, on mink fur, on flies, on the foot of a seagull, and in gutter water, but not in feed. Some dogs and cats from infected farms tested positive for the virus. Chickens, rabbits, and horses sampled on a few farms, and wildlife sampled in the vicinity of the infected farms did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, mink are highly susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, but routes of transmission between farms, other than by direct human contact, are unclear.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in Danish Mink Farms: Course of the Epidemic and a Descriptive Analysis of the Outbreaks in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed an immense burden on healthcare systems worldwide.

METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with proven or clinicoradiological suspected COVID-19 were consented. Admission bloods were extracted from the clinical laboratory. A panel of biomarkers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), Krebs von den Lungen 6, troponin, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, B-type natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin) were performed in addition to routinely performed markers (C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio).

All biomarkers were tested in logistic regression against a composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission or death, with area under the curve (AUC) (figures calculated). RESULTS: 187 patients had 28-day outcomes at the time of analysis.

BA.2 differs from BA.1 by about 21 mutations in its spike. Human anti-spike monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. However, the capacity of therapeutic mAbs to neutralize BA.1 and BA.2 remains poorly characterized. Here, we first compared the sensitivity of BA.1 and BA.2 to neutralization by 9 therapeutic mAbs. In contrast to BA.1, BA.2 was sensitive to Cilgavimab, partly inhibited by Imdevimab and resistant to Adintrevimab and Sotrovimab. Two combinations of mAbs, Ronapreve (Casirivimab + Imdevimab) and Evusheld (Cilgavimab + Tixagevimab), are indicated as a pre-exposure prophylaxis in immunocompromised persons at risk of severe disease. We analyzed sera from 29 such individuals, up to one month after administration of Ronapreve and/or Evusheld. After treatment, all individuals displayed elevated antibody levels in their sera and neutralized Delta with high titers. Ronapreve recipients did not neutralize BA.1 and weakly impaired BA.2. With Evusheld, neutralization of BA.1 and BA.2 was detected in 19 and 29 out of 29 patients, respectively. As compared to Delta, titers were more severely decreased against BA.1 (344-fold) than BA.2 (9-fold). We further report 4 breakthrough Omicron infections among the 29 participants. Therefore, BA.1 and BA.2 exhibit noticeable differences in their sensitivity to therapeutic mAbs. Anti-Omicron activity of Ronapreve, and to a lesser extent that of Evusheld, is reduced in patients sera, a phenomenon associated with decreased clinical efficacy.","output":"Seroneutralization of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 in patients receiving anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis B is the most prevalent viral hepatitis worldwide, affecting approximately one-third of the world's population. Among HBV factors, the surface protein is the most sensitive biomarker for viral infection, given that it is expressed at high levels in all viral infection phases. The large HBV surface protein (LHBs) contains the integral pre-S1 domain, which binds to the HBV receptor sodium taurocholate co transporting polypeptide on the hepatocyte to facilitate viral entry. The accumulation of viral LHBs and its prevalent pre-S mutants in chronic HBV carriers triggers a sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) overload response, leading to ER stress-mediated cell proliferation, metabolic switching and genomic instability, which are associated with pro-oncogenic effects. Ground glass hepatocytes identified in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients harbor pre-S deletion variants that largely accumulate in the ER lumen due to mutation-induced protein misfolding and are associated with increased risks of cancer recurrence and metastasis. Moreover, in contrast to the major HBs, which is decreased in tumors to a greater extent than it is in peritumorous regions, LHBs is continuously expressed during tumorigenesis, indicating that LHBs serves as a promising biomarker for HCC in people with CHB. Continuing efforts to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which LHBs regulates pathological changes in CHB patients are important for establishing a correlation between LHBs biomarkers and HCC development.","output":"Association of the Hepatitis B Virus Large Surface Protein with Viral Infectivity and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-mediated Liver Carcinogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Access to washroom facilities and a place to dispose of menstrual waste are prerequisites for optimal menstrual hygiene management in schools. Like other low- and middle-income countries, Bangladeshi schools lack facilities for girls to change and dispose of their menstrual absorbents. We explored existing systems for disposing of menstrual absorbent wastes in urban and rural schools of Bangladesh and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of alternative disposal options. METHODS We explored how girls dispose of their menstrual products, identified girls' preferences and choices for a disposal system and piloted four disposal options in four different schools. We then implemented one preferred option in four additional schools. We explored girls', teachers', and janitors' perspectives and evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and potential for sustainability of the piloted disposal system. RESULTS Barriers to optimal menstrual hygiene management included lack of functional toilets and private locations for changing menstrual products, and limited options for disposal. Girls, teachers, and janitors preferred and ranked the chute disposal system as their first choice, because it has large capacity (765 L), is relatively durable, requires less maintenance, and will take longer time to fill. During implementation of the chute disposal system in four schools, girls, teachers, and janitors reported positive changes in toilet cleanliness and menstrual products disposal resulting from the intervention. CONCLUSIONS The chute disposal system for menstrual products is a durable option that does not require frequent emptying or regular maintenance, and is accepted by schoolgirls and janitors alike, and can improve conditions for menstrual hygiene management in schools. However, regular supervision, motivation of girls to correctly dispose of their products, and a long-term maintenance and management plan for the system are necessary.","output":"Piloting an acceptable and feasible menstrual hygiene products disposal system in urban and rural schools in Bangladesh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, we found that divalent calcium has no detectable effect on the assembly of Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsZ (MtbFtsZ), whereas it strongly promoted the assembly of Escherichia coli FtsZ (EcFtsZ). While looking for potential calcium binding residues in EcFtsZ, we found a mutation (E93R) that strongly promoted the assembly of EcFtsZ. The mutation increased the stability and bundling of the FtsZ protofilaments and produced a dominating effect on the assembly of the wild type FtsZ (WT-FtsZ). Although E93R-FtsZ was found to bind to GTP similarly to the WT-FtsZ, it displayed lower GTPase activity than the WT-FtsZ. E93R-FtsZ complemented for its wild type counterpart as observed by a complementation test using JKD7-1/pKD3 cells. However, the bacterial cells became elongated upon overexpression of the mutant allele. We modeled the structure of E93R-FtsZ using the structures of MtbFtsZ/Methanococcus jannaschi FtsZ (MjFtsZ) dimers as templates. The MtbFtsZ-based structure suggests that the Arg(93)-Glu(138) salt bridge provides the additional stability, whereas the effect of mutation appears to be indirect (allosteric) if the EcFtsZ dimer is similar to that of MjFtsZ. The data presented in this study suggest that an increase in the stability of the FtsZ protofilaments is detrimental for the bacterial cytokinesis.","output":"E93R substitution of Escherichia coli FtsZ induces bundling of protofilaments, reduces GTPase activity, and impairs bacterial cytokinesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused one of the worst pandemics that history has ever known SARS-CoV-2 can lead to multiple organ failure, which is life-threatening Viral RNA is found in the lung, intestine, testicle, kidney, etc , which suggests the virus can be transmitted also via routes besides respiratory droplets The aim of our study was to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in urethral swabs METHODS: We enrolled ten patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who attended the Infectious Diseases Unit of the A O U Federico II of Naples, from March 2020 to April 2020 One urethral swab and one rhino-oropharyngeal swab were collected from each patient during SARS-CoV-2 infection RESULTS: All ten patients had a negative urethral swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, whereas the rhino-oropharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA This finding demonstrates that, in our patients, the virus did not affect the urinary tract and therefore would not be found in the urine, and even more importantly, it would not be transmitted via urine This result was independent of the stage of the disease CONCLUSION: If confirmed in larger studies, this observation could be the key to understanding the role of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to the genitourinary system","output":"No Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on Urethral Swab in Patients with Positive Nasopharyngeal Swab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypercoagulable state is a one complication of COVID-19. The exact mechanism is still unclear however hyperfibrinogenemia is considered one of the mechanisms for COVID-19 coagulopathy. Objective: To analyze the parameters of coagulation factors of COVID-19 patients and its correlation with degree of oxygenation Methods: We conducted an observational analytic cross sectional single-center study including 25 laboratory-confirmed patients in Dr. Saiful Anwar General Hospital Malang Indonesia from April-Juni 2020. Statistical analysis performed to determine coagulation factors like fibrinogen D-dimer thrombocyte and its relationship to disease severity and correlation with degree of oxygenation measured by PaO2/FiO2. Result: Subjects consisted of 12 patients (48%) in the mild-moderate group and 13 patients (52%) in severe group. D-dimer with mean 130 mg/L (043 mg/L - 408 mg/L) increased in 11 patients (9167%) in mild-moderate group and 11 patients (8461%) in severe group with mean 1142 mg/L (034 mg/L  6630 mg/L).

This global pandemic has mandated dramatic changes in healthcare delivery with a particular focus on social distancing in order to reduce viral transmission. Heart failure patients are among the highest utilizers of health care and are at increased risk for COVID-related vulnerabilities. Effectively managing this complex and resource-intensive patient population from a distance presents new and unique challenges. Here, we review relevant data on telemedicine and remote monitoring strategies for heart failure patients and provide a framework to help providers treat this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes (i) dedicated pre-visit contact and planning (i.e. confirm clinical appropriateness, presence of compatible technology, and patient comfort); (ii) utilization of virtual clinic visits (use of telehealth platforms, a video-assisted exam, self-reported vital signs, and weights); and (iii) use of existing remote heart failure monitoring sensors when applicable (CardioMEMS, Optivol, and HeartLogic). While telemedicine and remote monitoring strategies are not new, these technologies are emerging as an important tool for the effective management of heart failure patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a \\"stay at home\\" order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. The model captures a range of age-dependent heterogeneities, reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections and produces a good fit to the key epidemic features over time. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020 on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures from 7th May onwards can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Our work confirms the effectiveness of stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. It also provides strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.","output":"Predictions of COVID-19 dynamics in the UK: Short-term forecasting and analysis of potential exit strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected millions of people worldwide.

High density of ACE2 receptor in vascular endothelial cells may explain why vascular complications related to endothelial dysfunction occur in COVID-19. However, in vivo assessment of vascular endothelial function during COVID-19 has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the vascular endothelial function and its temporal changes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this prospective blinded study, systemic endothelial function was assessed using plethysmography-derived peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT). The reactive hyperemia index (LnRHI), a measure of endothelium-mediated hyperaemia, and the augmentation index, a measure of arterial vascular stiffness, were measured in 102 individuals across three study groups using PAT: group 1 (active infection), constituted by 20 patients hospitalised due to acute COVID-19; group 2 (past infection), constituted by 52 patients who had recovered from COVID-19; and group 3 (controls), constituted by 30 healthcare workers not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, among group 1, PAT assessment was repeated in 14 patients several weeks after recovery from acute COVID-19. PAT studies were analysed at a blinded fashion with respect to the assigned study group. RESULTS: Lower resting PAT amplitude was found in acute COVID-19 patients compared to the other groups (ratio of arterial tone signal between hyperemia to resting condition was 1.5 [interquartile range, 1.1] in group 1, 1.3 [0.3] in group 2 and 1.2 [0.3] in group 3, p=0.041). On the contrary, no significant differences between groups were found with respect to the hyperemic PAT amplitude (867.9 [486.1] in group 1, 944.7 [748.1] in group 2 and 819.3 [639.6] in group 3, p=0.444). Due to the lower resting PAT amplitude, there was a paradoxically significantly increased LnRHI during acute COVID-19 compared to past infection and controls (0.73 [0.32] vs. 0.53 [0.31] vs. 0.44 [0.23], respectively; p=0.013) (Figure A). Furthermore, among group 1 patients, LnRHI normalised markedly from acute COVID-19 to past infection stage (0.73 [0.32] vs. 0.49 [0.28], respectively; p=0.005) (Figure B). Augmentation index was significantly higher during acute COVID-19 compared to past COVID-19 and controls (9.6 [19.1] in group 1, 6.97 [18.6] in group 2 and ?0.35 [20.53] in group 3; p=0.045 for COVID groups vs. controls). CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive assessment of systemic vascular endothelial function with PAT revealed significant differences between subjects with acute COVID-19, past COVID-19 and controls. Lower baseline PAT amplitude and high augmentation index suggest vasoconstriction at rest during the acute phase of COVID-19. These findings open new research opportunities to investigate the prognostic value of PAT in COVID-19 patients.

The current safety and reliability of these new automated triage systems remain unknown. METHODS: We tested six symptom checkers currently in use as triage tools at a national level against 52 cases simulating COVID-19 of various severities to determine if the symptom checkers appropriately triage time-critical cases onward to healthcare contact. We further analysed and compared each symptom checker to determine the discretionary aspects of triage decision-making that govern the automated advice generated. RESULTS: Of the 52 clinical presentations, the absolute rate of onward referral to any form of healthcare contact was: Singapore 100%, the USA 67%, Wales 65%, England 62%, Scotland 54% and Northern Ireland 46%.

Participants completed questionnaires and had up to five serial blood collections. RESULTS Of 124 enrolled patients, only two (1.6%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative patients developed newly detectable antibodies on subsequent blood draw(s), corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 0% (95% CI, 0.0 TO 4.1%) over 14.8 person-years of follow up, with a median of 13 health care visits per patient. CONCLUSION These results suggest that patients with cancer receiving in-person care at a facility with aggressive mitigation efforts have an extremely low likelihood of COVID-19 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seropositivity and Seroconversion in Patients Undergoing Active Cancer-Directed Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter emphasizes the unfinished nature of a form of late-modernity still hanging in the balance between frameworks of representation and legitimization regarding women and the roles they play within the public sphere in virtue of the emancipation that has taken place and the contradictions which emerge when trying to reconcile old and new models of femininity.

Several FDA authorized molecular diagnostic tests have been impacted by viral variation, while no reports of viral variation affecting antigen test performance have occurred to date. While determining the analytical sensitivity of the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2), we uncovered a high viral load specimen that repeatedly tested negative by this antigen test. Whole genome sequencing of the specimen uncovered two mutations, T205I and D399N, present in the nucleocapsid protein of the isolate. All six SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens available in our laboratory with a D399N nucleocapsid mutation and C(T) < 31 were not detected by the Sofia 2 but detected by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, while clinical specimens with the T205I mutation were detected by both assays. Testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with these variants demonstrated an approximate 1000-fold loss in sensitivity for the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test associated with the D399N mutation, while the BinaxNOW and Quidel Quickvue SARS Antigen tests were unaffected by the mutation. The D399N nucleocapsid mutation has been relatively uncommon to date, appearing in only 0.02% of genomes worldwide at time of writing.

A retrospective research design collected from 188 tinnitus patients, was used to compare the clinical characteristics of tinnitus between the patients in 2020 under pandemic pressure and those from the matching period in 2019. While anxiety was quantified using the Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the test of tinnitus loudness (TL). The assessments were repeated after the sound therapy plus educational counselling (STEC) for 38 patients in 2020 and 58 patients in 2019 and compared with EC alone therapy for 42 patients in 2020 and 17 patients in 2019. A large increase in anxiety was evident in 2020 in both case rate and SAS. The treatment of both methods was less effective in 2020. SAS, THI and TL were all deteriorated after the EC alone treatment in 2020, while an improvement was seen in 2019. This suggests that EC alone could not counteract the stress by COVID-19 at all, and the stress, if not managed well, can significantly increase the severity of tinnitus and associated anxiety. By using the EC subgroup in virtual control, we conclude that anxiety can serve as a promoting factor to tinnitus.

COVID-19 led to a decrease of anthropogenic activities in Turkey, largely due to lockdown. Changes in the air quality index (AQI) were assessed before and during coronavirus. In this study, the authors investigated the changes of AQI for 2.5 m particulate matter (PM(2.5)), a primary air pollutant, as well as ozone, a secondary air pollutant, in Turkey during December 2019, April 2020, and May 2020. Overall, the PM(2.5) index improved by 34.5% by the end of April 2020. However, the ozone index increased from 16.8 to 28.8 by the end of April. The increase in ozone is attributed to the reduction of PM levels, which increased sunlight penetration. Before COVID-19, the AQI for Turkey was categorized as unhealthy for sensitive groups (PM(2.5) = 103); however, during the pandemic, AQI fell to lower boundaries of the moderate category by May 2020 (PM(2.5) = 56.9). Changes in municipal wastewater were also assessed. Municipal wastewater quality and hospital waste generation did not change during the pandemic in Turkey. Therefore, we should not expect COVID-19 risks in treatment plant effluents. This study gives confidence to regulators that when strict measures are implemented, air quality can improve.

Optimal vitamin D status has been linked to immunological effects that may benefit critically ill patients. Therefore, we investigated whether admission 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25OHD) are associated with clinical outcomes in ARDS patients. METHODS We performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomized, controlled trial comparing oxygenation strategies in 549 patients with ARDS (NCT00000579). Baseline 25OHD was measured in stored plasma samples. We investigated the relationship between vitamin D status and ventilator-free days (VFD) as well as 90-day survival, using linear regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Analyses were adjusted for age, race, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score. RESULTS Baseline 25OHD was measured in 476 patients. 90% of these individuals had 25OHD <20 ng/ml and 40% had 25OHD <10 ng/ml. Patients with 25OHD <20 ng/ml were likely to be ventilated for 3 days longer than patients with levels 20 ng/ml (? 3.41; 95%CI 0.42-6.39: P = 0.02). Patients with 25OHD <10 ng/ml were likely to be ventilated for 9 days longer (? 9.27; 95%CI 7.24-11.02: P < 0.001) and to have a 34% higher risk of 90-day mortality (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.06-1.71: P = 0.02) compared to patients with levels >10 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS In patients with ARDS, vitamin D status is associated with duration of mechanical ventilation and 90-day mortality. Randomized, controlled trials are warranted to determine whether vitamin D supplementation improves clinical outcomes in ARDS patients.","output":"Vitamin D Status and Clinical Outcomes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Secondary Analysis From the Assessment of Low Tidal Volume and Elevated End-Expiratory Volume to Obviate Lung Injury (ALVEOLI) Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein emerged in early 2020 and quickly became the dominant circulating strain in Europe and its environs The variant was characterized by the higher viral load, which is not associated with disease severity, higher incorporation into the virion, and high cell entry via ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 Previous strains of the coronavirus and the current SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the selection of mutations as a mechanism of escaping immune responses In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energy analysis to provide insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and describe the neutralization mechanism of this variant Our results show that the D614G S-protein adopts distinct conformational dynamics which is skewed towards the open-state conformation more than the closed-state conformation of the wild-type S-protein Residue-specific variation of amino acid flexibility and domain-specific RMSD suggest that the mutation causes an allosteric conformational change in the RBD Evaluation of the interaction energies between the S-protein and neutralizing antibodies show that the mutation may enhance, reduce or not affect the neutralizing interactions depending on the neutralizing antibody, especially if it targets the RBD The results of this study have shed insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and provided a glimpse of the neutralization mechanism of this variant","output":"Molecular characterization of interactions between the D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and neutralizing antibodies: A computational approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) have been widely used worldwide, limited studies have measured specific metabolites of imidacloprid (IMI, the most commonly used NNI) in human urine.

Our clinic utilized existing community collaborations to implement protocols and extend outreach. We describe 3 patients with OUD who engaged with treatment through outreach with trusted community partners and low-threshold telemedicine. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Patient 1a 40-year-old man with severe OUD who injected heroin and was living outside. A weekend harm reduction organization volunteer the patient previously knew used her mobile phone to facilitate an audio-only intake appointment during clinic hours. He completed outpatient buprenorphine initiation. Patient 2a 48-year-old man with severe opioid and methamphetamine use disorders who injected both and was living in his recreational vehicle.

Damaneh-Daran aquifer is located at upstream of the Zayandehrood reservoir in west-central Iran. This aquifer has been highly contaminated by nitrate and is still rapidly being contaminated. Thus, its quality needs to be remediated. This paper is focused on the quantity-quality modeling to predict the average nitrate concentration of the aquifer. Several remediation scenarios are presented in a period beginning from fall 2019, ending in spring 2024. These scenarios address several ways to mitigate the injection of the major sources of contamination in the region, such as equipping the urban regions with wastewater collection and treatment plants and reducing the fertilizers' use. The decreased use of the fertilizers may be achieved through two strategies: directly reducing the amount of the fertilizers by several specific and predefined rates of reduction and indirectly decreasing the amount of the fertilizers used by crop pattern modification. The latter strategy is evaluated to replace all or a part of the areas allocated to the more fertilizer-demanding crops with those of the less fertilizer-demanding crops. Furthermore, some of these scenarios are hybridized to more mitigate groundwater quality degradation. The results of performing the proposed scenarios are once compared together and then compared with the trend scenario letting current case study conditions and facilities be held in the future. The results suggest that the scenario hybridizing the effects of the wastewater treatment plants-equipping scenario with those of the quality-enhancing crop pattern modification scenario is evaluated as the most effective and best-performing scenario, implementation of which offers 20% and 30% reduction of the nitrate concentration for the agricultural and urban areas, respectively.","output":"Assessment of the management scenarios for groundwater quality remediation of a nitrate-contaminated aquifer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was carried out to determine the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 in the elderly aged 65 years and over and their levels of adaptation to the \\"new normal.\\" This descriptive cross-sectional study was completed with 623 elderly individuals.

OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to understand recruitment from the point of view of trial staff and discover what they consider important. METHODS: We applied pluralistic ethnographic methods, including analysis of trial documents, observation, and focus groups, and explored the recruitment processes of the EMPOWER (Early Signs Monitoring to Prevent Relapse in Psychosis and Promote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery) feasibility trial, which is a digital app-based intervention for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. RESULTS: Recruitment barriers were categorized into 2 main themes: service characteristics (lack of time available for mental health staff to support recruitment, staff turnover, patient turnover [within Australia only], management styles of community mental health teams, and physical environment) and clinician expectations (filtering effects and resistance to research participation). Trial staff negotiated these barriers through strategies such as emotional labor (trial staff managing feelings and expressions to successfully recruit participants) and trying to build relationships with clinical staff working within community mental health teams.

Objective: To estimate the association of age with the likelihood of developing symptoms and the association of age with the likelihood of progressing to critical illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed quarantined case contacts, identified between February 20 and April 16, 2020, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Contacts were monitored daily for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, by either real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs or retrospectively via IgG serological assays. Close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected as those belonging to clusters (ie, groups of contacts associated with an index case) where all individuals were followed up for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were analyzed from February to June 2020. Exposure: Close contact with individuals with confirmed COVID-19 cases as identified by contact tracing operations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-specific estimates of the risk of developing respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 C and of experiencing critical disease (defined as requiring intensive care or resulting in death) in SARS-CoV-2-infected case contacts. Results: In total, 5484 case contacts (median [interquartile range] age, 50 [30-61] years; 3086 female contacts [56.3%]) were analyzed, 2824 of whom (51.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median [interquartile range] age, 53 [34-64] years; 1604 female contacts [56.8%]). The proportion of infected persons who developed symptoms ranged from 18.1% (95% CI, 13.9%-22.9%) among participants younger than 20 years to 64.6% (95% CI, 56.6%-72.0%) for those aged 80 years or older. Most infected contacts (1948 of 2824 individuals [69.0%]) did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 C. Only 26.1% (95% CI, 24.1%-28.2%) of infected individuals younger than 60 years developed respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 C; among infected participants older than 60 years, 6.6% (95% CI, 5.1%-8.3%) developed critical disease. Female patients were 52.7% (95% CI, 24.4%-70.7%) less likely than male patients to develop critical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions and Relevance: In this Italian cohort study of close contacts of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, more than one-half of individuals tested positive for the virus. However, most infected individuals did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever.

After baseline measurements, the animals were exposed to both norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions in incremental doses, with a stabilising period in between the infusions. The hypothesis of differences between norepinephrine and dobutamine with incremental doses was tested using repeated two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparisons post-test. RESULTS: At baseline, pulmonary artery-banded animals had increased right ventricular pressure (+ 39%, p = 0.04), lower cardiac index (? 23% p = 0.04), lower systolic blood pressure (? 13%, p = 0.02) and reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume (? 33%, p = 0.02). When incremental doses of norepinephrine and dobutamine were administered, the right ventricular arterio-ventricular coupling was improved only by dobutamine (p < 0.05). Norepinephrine increased both left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular contractility to a greater extent (p < 0.05) in pulmonary artery-banded animals. While the cardiac index was improved equally by norepinephrine and dobutamine treatments in pulmonary artery-banded animals, norepinephrine had a significantly greater effect on mean arterial pressure (p < 0.05) and diastolic arterial pressure (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: While norepinephrine and dobutamine improved cardiac index equally, it was obtained in different manners. Dobutamine significantly improved the right ventricular function and the arterio-ventricular coupling. Norepinephrine increased systemic resistance, thereby improving arterial pressures and left ventricular systolic function by maintaining left ventricular end-diastolic volume.","output":"Norepinephrine and dobutamine improve cardiac index equally by supporting opposite sides of the heart in an experimental model of chronic pulmonary hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an exploratory and theoretical reflection for future articles discussing the perceived green/health qualities of tunisian food as a tourist promotion argument, the article is based on the assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic would have more impact in countries whose population has an immune system weakened by food overtreated with pesticides, and that the Mediterranean food culture, which offers foods with little or no pesticide treatment, is the best diet to develop the necessary immunity to resist COVID-19 and, by extension, resist other pandemics. To demonstrate this, the thematic map technique was used to cross-reference several masses of official statistical data. The results suggest four main categories of countries in relation to the link between deaths from COVID-19 and the use of pesticides in agriculture. This study demonstrates, therefore, the weakness, if not the inaccuracy, of certain hypotheses which are circulating or have circulated in recent months and that attempt to explain each country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, assumptions such as the role of quarantine in containing the pandemic, the role of the BCG vaccine and the role of heat will prove unreliable. On the other hand, the hypothesis the paper will defend is that of the role of a healthy Mediterranean and flexitarian diet in strengthening the human immune system, which in turn counteracts the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This sanitary suitability would therefore be an argument for promoting and disseminating this culinary heritage throughout the world and thus contribute to its development as a tourist attraction.","output":"Pesticide use and COVID-19: An Indictment of Global Agriculture and An Advocacy of the Mediterranean Food Culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We characterize the precompact sets in spaces of vector valued continuous functions and use the resulting criteria to investigate asymptotic behaviour of such functions defined on a halfline.

Information regarding genetic differences was also important for the correct choice of parental material for the selection of high quality cultivars. Two elite and six obsolete cultivars of durum-wheat were characterized with 25-simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. All accessions were evaluated for 2-agronomic-traits (Yield (Y) and Thousand-Kernel-Weight (TKW)) and 11 grain quality-traits (grain protein content (GPC), grain moisture contents (H), carotene content (CT), sedimentation test (SDS), gluten content (GC), gluten index (GI), semolina color index (L*, a*, b*) and alveographic parameters (W and P/L)) under randomized complete block design with three replication for two crop seasons (2015-2017). Genetic characterization through SSR markers revealed 126 alleles with an average of 5.04 alleles locus-1 and had average 0.79 polymorphism information content (PIC). The comparisons revealed that elite accessions were more productive in terms of grain yield and TKW, whereas obsolete accessions showed high GPC and end-use quality-traits. The generated dendrogram based on SSR markers, agronomic, seed quality-traits clearly differentiate the genotypes in two main groups obsolete and elite accessions. Analysis of correlation revealed a significant association between the traits TKW, Y, b*, a*, GPC, GC, SDS and H. High genetic diversity found between elite and obsolete cultivars for parameters such as yield, end-use quality and their correlation with SSR markers could help breeders for an eventual breeding program on durum-wheat.","output":"SSR markers and seed quality traits revealed genetic diversity in durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we discuss ethical implications of the use of mobile phone apps in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact tracing is a well-established feature of public health practice during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. However, the high proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19 means that standard contact tracing methods are too slow to stop the progression of infection through the population. To address this problem, many countries around the world have deployed or are developing mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing. Informed by the on-going mapping of proximity events these apps are intended both to inform public health policy and to provide alerts to individuals who have been in contact with a person with the infection. The proposed use of mobile phone data for intelligent physical distancing in such contexts raises a number of important ethical questions. In our paper, we outline some ethical considerations that need to be addressed in any deployment of this kind of approach as part of a multidimensional public health response.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, and death among COVID-19 cases and to assess the impact of these events on the risks of hospitalisation and death. METHODS: We conducted a distributed network cohort study using primary care records from the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and the UK, and outpatient specialist records from Germany. The Spanish database was linked to hospital admissions. Participants were followed up from the date of a diagnosis of COVID-19 or positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (index date) for 90 days. The primary study outcomes were venous thromboembolic events, arterial thromboembolic events, and death, all over the 90 days from the index date. We estimated cumulative incidences for the study outcomes. Multistate models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between venous thromboembolism or arterial thromboembolism occurrence and risks of hospitalisation or COVID-19 fatality. FINDINGS: Overall, 909 473 COVID-19 cases and 32 329 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 on or after Sept 1, 2020, were studied. The latest index dates across the databases ranged from Jan 30, 2021, to July 31, 2021. Cumulative 90-day incidence of venous thromboembolism ranged from 02% to 08% among COVID-19 cases, and up to 45% for those hospitalised. For arterial thromboembolism, estimates ranged from 01% to 08% among COVID-19 cases, increasing to 31% among those hospitalised. Case fatality ranged from 11% to 20% among patients with COVID-19, rising to 146% for hospitalised patients. The occurrence of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of death (adjusted HRs 442 [307C636] for those not hospitalised and 163 [139C190] for those hospitalised), as was the occurrence of arterial thromboembolism (316 [265C375] and 193 [157C237]). INTERPRETATION: Risks of venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboembolism were up to 1% among COVID-19 cases, and increased with age, among males, and in those who were hospitalised. Their occurrence was associated with excess mortality, underlying the importance of developing effective treatment strategies that reduce their frequency.

METHODS From April 1986 to December 2006, 200 patients who underwent elective surgery with stage II and III right-sided colon cancer were analyzed. The period for group I referred back to the time when laparoscopic approach had not yet been introduced. The period for group II was designated as the time when first laparoscopic approach for right colectomy was carried out until we overcame its learning curve. The period for group III was the period after overcoming this learning curve. RESULTS When groups I and II, and groups II and III were compared, overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly whereas disease-free survival (DFS) in groups I and III were statistically higher than in group II (P = 0.042 and P = 0.050). In group III, laparoscopic surgery had a tendency to provide better long-term OS ( P = 0.2036) and DFS ( P = 0.2356) than open surgery. Also, the incidence of local recurrence in group III (2.6%) was significantly lower than that in groups II (7.4%) and I (12.1%) ( P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS Institutions should standardize their techniques and then provide fellowship training for newcomers of laparoscopic colon cancer surgery.

METHODS: A literature review was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Additional clinical trials were identified through the TrialsTracker project. RESULTS: We found conflicting evidence of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and remdesivir in COVID-19 despite promising early reports of in vitro antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Some of the current studies have demonstrated adverse drug reactions to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin. Widespread systemic inflammation and procoagulant/hypercoagulable state, including thrombotic microangiopathy, endothelial dysfunction, bleeding disorder, and thrombosis are increasingly being witnessed in COVID-19. Evidence of cardiac injury and stroke is mostly reported in hospitalized patients; however, large specialized studies that focus on cardiac or neuropathology are lacking. DISCUSSION: There is no convincing clinical evidence of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, and remdesivir use in COVID-19. As evidence of systemic inflammation is rapidly unfolding, there is a dire need to maximize our resources to find the best possible solutions to the current crisis while conclusive evidence from clinical trials emerges.","output":"Antimalarial and cytotoxic drugs on COVID-19 and the cardiovascular burden: Literature review and lessons to be learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, immunization practices of all age groups, especially routine childhood vaccines, have been interrupted.

The aim of this study was to describe the COVID-19 information sources used by immigrants with limited proficiency in Swedish as well as their opinions on how comprehensive the information has been, the importance of the recommendations and their possibility to follow them. A cross-sectional survey was conducted via introductory Swedish language classes in Region Uppsala (n = 855).

Most reported they knew where to find information; however, over two-fifths reported the recommendations from the authorities should be more extensive. The majority reported it is important to follow the recommendations, whereas the possibility to follow the recommendations was more mixed.

We identified risk factors, co-morbidities, and outcomes in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 with or without acute ischemic stroke and compared with patients without Coronavirus disease 2019 and acute ischemic stroke. Methods: We analyzed the data from 54 healthcare facilities using the Cerner de-identified Coronavirus disease 2019 dataset. The dataset included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with a discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated to suspicion of or exposure to Coronavirus disease 2019, or confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019. Results: A total of 103 (1.3%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 8,163 patients with Coronavirus disease 2019. Among all Coronavirus disease 2019 patients, the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure was significantly higher among those with acute ischemic stroke.

Despite the potential patient care and system utilization benefits of prehospital ultrasound, the financial burden of a \\"hands-on\\" training program for large numbers of paramedics remains a barrier to implementation. In this study, we conducted a prospective, observational, double-blinded study comparing paramedics to emergency physicians in their ability to generate usable abdominal ultrasound images after a 1-hour didactic training session. METHODS: Canadian aeromedical critical care paramedics were compared against emergency medicine physicians in their ability to generate adequate abdominal ultrasound images on five healthy volunteers. Quality of each scan was evaluated by a trained expert in POCUS who was blinded to the identity of the participant using a 5-point Likert scale and using the standardized QUICk Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) assessment tool. RESULTS: Fourteen Critical care paramedics and four emergency department (ED) physicians were voluntarily recruited. Of paramedics, 57% had never used ultrasound before, 36% has used ultrasound without formal training, and 7% had previous training. Physicians had a higher proportion of usable scans compared with paramedics (100% v. 61.4%, &#916;38.6%; 95% confidence interval, 19.3-50.28).

METHODS: A research consortium led by WHO Collaboration Centre for Research in Surgical Care Delivery in Low and Middle Income countries, India, conducted this retrospective cross-sectional study in 12 hospitals across the country. We compared the anaesthesia preferences during pandemic (April 2020) to a corresponding pre pandemic period (April 2019) RESULTS: A total of 636 out of 2,162 (29.4%) and 156 out of 927 (16.8%) surgeries were performed under GA in April 2019 and April 2020 respectively, leading to a fall of 13% in usage of GA. A 5% reduction in GA and a 12% increase in the usage of regional anaesthesia was observed for cesarean sections. There was no significant change in anesthesia for laparotomies and fracture surgeries. However, 14% increase in GA usage was observed in surgeries for local soft tissue infections and necrotic tissues. CONCLUSION: Though overall usage of GA reduced marginally, the change was mainly contributed by anesthesia for caesarean births. The insignificant change in anaesthesia for other surgeries may be attributed to the lack of facilities for spinal anaesthesia and may reflect the risk taking behaviour of healthcare professionals in COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"P43 Did COVID-19 Pandemic change Anaesthesia Practices in India: A Multi-centre Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To combat the spread of COVID-19, the UK Government implemented a range of lockdown measures.

The underlying causes of the variance remain unclear. Here, we proposed two scientific questions: (1) whether meteorological factors have a consistent influence on virus transmission after combining all the data from the studies; (2) whether the impact of meteorological factors on the COVID-19 transmission can be influenced by season, geospatial scale and latitude. We employed a meta-analysis to address these two questions using results from 2813 published articles. Our results showed that, the influence of meteorological factors on the newly-confirmed COVID-19 cases varied greatly among existing studies, and no consistent conclusion can be drawn. After grouping outbreak time into cold and warm seasons, we found daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures have significant positive influences on the newly-confirmed COVID-19 cases in cold season, while significant negative influences in warm season. After dividing the scope of the outbreak into national and urban scales, relative humidity significantly inhibited the COVID-19 transmission at the national scale, but no effect on the urban scale. The negative impact of relative humidity, and the positive impacts of maximum temperatures and wind speed on the newly-confirmed COVID-19 cases increased with latitude. The relationship of maximum and minimum temperatures with the newly-confirmed COVID-19 cases were more susceptible to season, while relative humidity's relationship was more affected by latitude and geospatial scale. Our results suggested that relationship between meteorological factors and the COVID-19 transmission can be affected by season, geospatial scale and latitude.

This feat is accomplished in part through the release of a diverse set of molecules that contribute to pathogenicity and immune suppression. Many of these molecules have been characterized in terms of their ability to influence the infectious capabilities of helminths across the tree of life. These include nematodes that infect insects, known as entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) and plants with applications in agriculture and medicine. In this review we will first discuss the nematode virulence factors, which aid parasite colonization or tissue invasion, and cause many of the negative symptoms associated with infection. These include enzymes involved in detoxification, factors essential for parasite development and growth, and highly immunogenic ES proteins. We also explore how these parasites use several classes of molecules (proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids) to evade the hosts immune defenses. For example, helminths release immunomodulatory molecules in extracellular vesicles that may be protective in allergy and inflammatory disease. Collectively, these nematode-derived molecules allow parasites to persist for months or even years in a host, avoiding being killed or expelled by the immune system.

Better knowledge of the virulence and immunomodulatory molecules from both entomopathogenic nematodes and soil-based helminths will allow for their use as beneficial agents in fighting disease and pests, divorced from their pathogenic consequences.","output":"The Two Faces of Nematode Infection: Virulence and Immunomodulatory Molecules From Nematode Parasites of Mammals, Insects and Plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accommodation is a fundamental part of tourism, and it plays an important role in the tourist experience The emerging economy and especially the peer-to-peer accommodations (P2P) have shaken up the conventional accommodations sector While most P2P accommodation studies have focused on the monetary platform, which includes Airbnb, there is little knowledge about the linkages of involvement and behavioral intentions on the non-profit accommodation users This empirical study applied a multiple-methods approach to investigate the positive impacts of involvement on couchsurfing, such as P2P accommodations on the destination image, familiarity, and the behavioral intentions The data was collected from 609 travelers who have used couchsurfing while traveling to Turkey from 2016 to 2017 The results revealed that involvement in couchsurfing improved the destination image, familiarity, the E-WoM, and the revisit intention of couchsurfers This study also discusses the practical implications","output":"Couchsurfing involvement in non-profit peer-to-peer accommodations and its impact on destination image, familiarity, and behavioral intentions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Acute-total and chronic-partial sleep deprivation increase the risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular function assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) is reduced after sleep deprivation. High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) improves postprandial FMD. Sleep-deprived individuals may practice HIIE followed by a high-fat breakfast. This study investigated the acute-partial sleep deprivation (APSD) and HIIE interaction on postprandial FMD. METHODS Fifteen healthy males (age 31  5 years) participated in: (a) reference sleep (~ 9.5 h) with no HIIE (RS), (b) RS and HIIE (RSX), and (c) APSD and HIIE (SSX). HIIE was performed in 3:2 min intervals at 90% and 40% of VO2 reserve. FMD was assessed the night before (D1), the morning of the next day (D2), 1 h (1hrPE) and 4 h post HIIE (4hrPE). RESULTS FMD% change was lower at RS compared to both RSX (F1,14 = 23.96, p < 0.001, 2 = 0.631) and SSX (F1,14 = 4.8, p = 0.47, 2 = 0.253) at 1hrPE. RSX and SSX did not differ at 1hrPE (F1,14 = 0.2, p = 0.889, 2 = 0.001), but SSX elicited greater FDM responses. Absolute FMD change was lower at RS compared to both RSX (F1,14 = 21.5, p < 0.001, 2 = 0.606) and SSX (F1,14 = 7.01, p = 0.019, 2 = 0.336) at 1hrPE.

However, to overcome the limitations of existing gene-delivery therapies, that is, poor stability and inefficient and delivery and accumulation of nucleic acids (NAs), safe drug-delivery systems (DDSs) allowing the prolonged circulation and expression of the administered genes in vivo are needed. In this review article, the development of DDSs over the past 70 years is briefly described. Since synthetic DDSs can be recognized and eliminated as foreign substances by the immune system, new approaches must be found. Using the bodys own cells as DDSs is a unique and exciting strategy and can be used in a completely new way to overcome the critical limitations of existing drug-delivery approaches.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. RESULTS: 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients. The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P<0.001). The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients. CONCLUSION: The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.","output":"Viral load dynamics and disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Zhejiang province, China, January-March 2020: retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) govern all aspects of cell function and, as such, are a major target for research and therapeutic intervention.

METHODS Between September 2015 to February 2016 a total of 20 patients underwent endovascular treatment assisted by TOBC of which 19 had 20 untreated aneurysms and 1 patient harboring a meningioma was submitted to balloon test occlusion (BTO). The TOBC was used to perform BAC and BTO for the treatment of vasospasms and to cross the neck of giant aneurysms (anchor technique). All data regarding the feasibility and safety of treatment with the device were collected prospectively. RESULTS All patients completed treatment according to the modality previously chosen. The balloon was employed solely for remodeling in 17 patients, for anchor technique in 2, for both remodeling and vasospasm angioplasty in 1 and for BTO in 1 patient. The balloon could be navigated to the target aneurysm in all cases. Evaluation of postoperative anatomical results indicated total occlusion in 13 (72.2 %) aneurysms, neck remnants in 4 (22.2 %) and residual sac filling in 1 (5.5 %). There were two (9.5 %) complications related to treatment, all thromboembolic. No technical complications were observed. CONCLUSION The TOBC was shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with BAC. In addition, it was successfully employed to perform angioplasty for vasospasm and BTO.

In this article we explore how a group of bereaved mothers experienced the process of participating in an online course in therapeutic writing for the integration of grief. Our research questions were: How do parents who have lost a child experience being part of an online course in therapeutic writing? What are the perceived benefits and challenges of writing in processing their grief? We followed an existential phenomenological approach and analyzed fieldwork notes (n = 13), qualitative data from the application and assessment surveys (n = 35; n = 21), excerpts from the journals of some participants (n = 3), and email correspondence with some participants (n = 5). We categorized the results in three meaning units: (1) where does my story begin? The both and of their silent chaos; (2) standing on the middle line: a pregnancy that does not end; (3) closures and openings: careful optimism and the need for community support. Participants experienced writing as an opportunity for self-exploration regarding their identities and their emotional world, as well as a means to develop and strengthen a bond with their children. They also experienced a sense of belonging, validation, and acceptance in the online group in a way that helped them make sense of their suffering. Online writing courses could be of benefit for bereaved parents who are grieving the unexpected death of a child, but do not replace other interventions such as psychotherapy.

However, to improve the health-related physical fitness components, any specific prescription should include intensity, volume, duration, and mode. Controversy persists about which is the best intensity of physical activity, while performing exercise at a moderate intensity could bring important benefits to asymptomatic people. High intensity or unaccustomed exercise should be restricted for older people, and for people of all ages with chronic diseases or compromised immune system, obesity, or upper respiratory tract infection with limited symptoms. Besides, physical activity guidelines should be particular to each population group, giving special consideration to those vulnerable to COVID-19 who are much more likely to suffer more self-isolation.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of anxiety in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers independently searched for cross-sectional community-based studies published between December 1, 2019 and August 23, 2020, using PubMed, WoS, Embase, and other sources (e.g., grey literature, manual search). RESULTS: Of 3049 records retrieved, 43 studies were included. These studies yielded an estimated overall prevalence of anxiety of 25%, which varied significantly across the different tools used to measure anxiety. Consistently reported risk factors for the development of anxiety included initial or peak phase of the outbreak, female sex, younger age, marriage, social isolation, unemployment and student status, financial hardship, low educational level, insufficient knowledge of COVID-19, epidemiological or clinical risk of disease and some lifestyle and personality variables. CONCLUSIONS: As the overall global prevalence of anxiety disorders is estimated to be 7.3% normally, our results suggest that rates of anxiety in the general population could be more than 3 times higher during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospective, structured questionnaire for all ICU directors in Australia and New Zealand was completed by 69 ICU directors after email invitation from ANZICS. The online questionnaire was accessible for three weeks during September 2020 and analysed by cloud-based software. Basic ICU demographics (private or public, metropolitan or rural) and location, purchasing, airway management practices, guideline uptake, checklist and cognitive aid use and staff training relevant to airway management during the COVID-19 pandemic were the main outcome measures. The 69 ICU directors reported significant simulation-based inter-professional airway training of staff (97%), and use of video laryngoscopy (94%), intubation checklists (94%), cognitive aids (83%) and PPE spotters (89%) during the airway management of patients with COVID-19. Tracheal intubation was almost always performed by a Specialist (97% of ICUs), who was more likely to be an intensivist than an anaesthetist (61% vs 36%). There was a more frequent adoption of specific airway guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients in public ICUs (94% vs 71%) and reliance on specialist intensivists to perform intubations in private ICUs (92% vs 53%).

Patients responded to a questionnaire which contained questions about their primary disease, comorbidities, medications, development of new symptoms, and medical services which they received, pertinent to COVID-19, during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. The data were analyzed using SPSS 16 software. Results: This investigation found 25 (7%) COVID-19 positive patients out of the 355 responders. 8 (40%) of them were hospitalized, out of which 2 (8%) required intensive care and later expired. COVID-19 incidence was significantly lower in the immunosuppressed group (2.2% vs 10% P-value 0.005). We didnt find a significant correlation between hydroxychloroquine consumption, and the incidence of COVID-19 in SLE patients. Fever, fatigue, dyspnea, and dry cough were the most common clinical symptoms. Conclusion: Our research has shown that COVID-19 prevalence was lower in immunosuppressed patients. However, broader studies should be conducted to clarify the role of immunosuppression in the development of COVID-19. More research is required.","output":"Lower Rate of COVID-19 in Lupus Patients Receiving Immunosuppressive Drug Regimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDDeveloped from positive psychology, Psychological Capital (PsyCap) entails a collection of intrinsic traits which may be optimized for productive and sustainable outcomes in life.

Therefore, the question arose whether these effects also occur when a fear stimulus, like the COVID-19 pandemic, affects otherwise healthy adolescents. Boredom is closely linked to symptoms of fear and anxiety, but the connection between PA, boredom and fear is partly unclear. Methods: A cross-sectional online study was conducted that involved 122 students. Participants were 13-19 years old (M &lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 15.83, SD = 1.73). The survey was available online from April 27th to May 3rd, 2020. At this time, schools in Germany had already been closed for 6 weeks. A self-report questionnaire was used to measure physical activity, boredom, and fear of COVID-19. A multiple linear regression model was conducted. Results: The reported fear of COVID-19 significantly correlates with total PA, quantity of strenuous PA, and boredom. Furthermore, a significant regression equation was found. The variables boredom, PA, and age contribute significantly to predicting the fear of COVID-19 [R 2 = 0.127, F(3,118) = 6.876, p &lt; 0.000], among adolescents. Conclusion: Our results indicate that there is an association between PA, boredom and the quarantine experience of adolescents.

After an incremental test and a familiarization visit, subjects were randomly submitted in visits 3 and 4 to a performance protocol preceded by intermittent bilateral cuff inflation (4  (5 min of blood flow restriction + 5 min reperfusion)) at either 220 mm Hg (IPC) or 20 mm Hg (control). To increase data reliability, each intervention was replicated, which was also in a random manner. In addition to the mean power output, the pulmonary oxygen uptake, blood lactate kinetics, and quadriceps electromyograms (EMGs) were analyzed during performance and throughout 45 min of passive recovery. After IPC, performance was improved by 2.1% compared with control (95% confidence intervals of 0.8% to 3.3%, P = 0.001), followed by increases in (i) the accumulated oxygen deficit, (ii) the amplitude of blood lactate kinetics, (iii) the total amount of oxygen consumed during recovery, and (iv) the overall EMG amplitude (P < 0.05).

This research employs a case study of a rapidly changing digital platform, within an Australian university. By drawing on the theories of coevolution and punctuated equilibrium as the combined theoretical lens, we theorize a number of mechanisms of coevolution, which explain the dynamic and mutually-shaping relationship between the organization's responses and digital platform's modules.

The aim is to address not only children, but more explicitly also their parents and the wider social environment, and to involve them in the planning and implementation of measures. The project is developing participative and demand-oriented offers in different institutions throughout Germany. Scientific monitoring aims to generate recommendations for action for participatory health research from these various experiences. METHODS: Access takes place via day care centres and family centres. The participatory research design starts with the Search Conference method. With this method, institution-specific needs are identified on a local level and goals are defined that determine the further processes. The participatory procedure is accompanied by interviews and focus group discussions which are analysed according to Mayring. RESULTS: Due to lockdown, access to the target groups via the institution is difficult. Families and network partners are hardly accessible and heavily burdened. Nevertheless, it has been possible to establish digital participation in some institutions. The evaluations show that parents have a great interest in the health of their children. On the one hand, the results indicate that the current conditions lead to a wait-and-see attitude on the part of the institutions, while at the same time the topic of health is gaining in importance among all those involved. CONCLUSIONS: Participatory methods pose a particular challenge during lockdown and must be adapted to the current situation. Especially when moving participation into the digital space, daycare centres (and similar institutions) play a key role as gatekeepers.

Comprehensive analysis of this unprecedented outbreak may help to fight against the disease and may play a pivotal role in decreasing the mortality rate linked with it. Papain like protease (PLpro), a multifunctional polyprotein facilitates the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and evades it from the host immunological response by antagonizing cytokines, interferons and may be considered as potential drug target to combat the current pandemic. METHODS Natural moieties obtained from medicinal plants were analysed for their potency to target PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular docking study and were compared with synthetic analogs named as remdesivir, chloroquine and favipiravir. The stability of complexes of top hits was analysed by MD Simulation and interaction energy was calculated. Furthermore, average RMSD values were computed and deepsite ligand binding pockets were predicted using Play Molecule. Drug like abilities of these moieties were determined using ADMET and bond distance between the ligand and active site was assessed to predict the strength of interaction. RESULTS Nimbocinol (-7.6 Kcal/mol) and sage (-7.3 Kcal/mol) exhibited maximum BA against PLpro SARS-CoV-2 as evident from molecular docking study which was found to be even better than remdesivir (-6.1 Kcal/mol), chloroquine (-5.3 Kcal/mol) and favipiravir (-5.7 Kcal/mol). Both nimbocinol-PLpro and sage-PLpro SARS-CoV-2 complex exhibited stable conformation during MD Simulation of 101ns at 310 K and potential, kinetic and electrostatic interaction energies were computed which was observed to be concordant with results of molecular docking study. RMSD average values were found to be 0.496  0.015 ? and 0.598  0.023 ? for nimbocinol and sage respectively thus revealing that both the deviation and fluctuations during MD Simulation were observed to be least. Deepsite prediction disclosed that both compounds occupied cryptic pockets in receptor and non-bond distance analysis revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds during ligand-receptor interaction.

Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of cells concomitantly expressing Nestin and Sox-2 (neural stem cells, aNSCs) and cells concomitantly expressing CD29 and CD44 (mesenchymal stem cells, aMSCs). Statistical analysis was by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (p < 0.05). RESULTS There was a statistically significant impact of gestational age on the proportions of both aMSCs (p = 0.01) and aNSCs (p < 0.01) in fetuses with isolated spina bifida.

It can exhibit its immunomodulatory effects by enhancing antigen processing and presentation, increasing leukocyte trafficking, inducing an anti-viral state, boosting the anti-microbial functions and affecting cellular proliferation and apoptosis. A complex interplay between immune cell activity and IFN- through coordinated integration of signals from other pathways involving cytokines and Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) such as Interleukin (IL)-4, TNF-, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Type-I Interferons (IFNS) etc. leads to initiation of a cascade of pro-inflammatory responses. Microarray data has unraveled numerous genes whose transcriptional regulation is influenced by IFN-. Consequently, IFN- stimulated cells display altered expression of many such target genes which mediate its downstream effector functions. The importance of IFN- is further reinforced by the fact that mice possessing disruptions in the IFN- gene or its receptor develop extreme susceptibility to infectious diseases and rapidly succumb to them.

Although many patients undergoing MPI receive repeat MPI testing, or additional procedures involving ionizing radiation, no data are available characterizing their total longitudinal radiation burden and relating radiation burden with reasons for testing. OBJECTIVES To characterize procedure counts, cumulative estimated effective doses of radiation, and clinical indications for patients undergoing MPI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A retrospective cohort study of 1097 consecutive patients undergoing index MPI during the first 100 days of 2006 (January 1-April 10) at Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, that evaluated all preceding medical imaging procedures involving ionizing radiation undergone beginning October 1988, and all subsequent procedures through June 2008, at the center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cumulative estimated effective dose of radiation, number of procedures involving radiation, and indications for testing. RESULTS Patients underwent a median of 15 (interquartile range [IQR], 6-32; mean, 23.9) procedures involving radiation exposure; of which 4 (IQR, 2-8; mean, 6.5) were high-dose procedures (3 mSv; ie, 1 year's background radiation), including 1 (IQR, 1-2; mean, 1.8) MPI study per patient.

Our objective was to assess the risks for DHPs providing dental care during the pandemic based on available scientific evidence. METHODS: We reviewed the best available evidence and estimated the annualized risk (p=das(1-1-p0p1(1-e)yn) for a DHP during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the following basic parameters: p0, the prevalence of asymptomatic patients in the local population; p1, the probability that a DHP gets infected by an asymptomatic patient; e, the effectiveness of the PPE; s, the probability of becoming symptomatic after getting infected from asymptomatic patient; da, the probability of dying from the disease in age group a; n, number of patients seen per day; and y, number of days worked per year. RESULTS: With the assumption that DHPs work fulltime and wear a N95 mask, the annualized probability for a DHP to acquire COVID-19 infection in a dental office, become symptomatic, and die from the infection is estimated at 1:13,000 (0.008 %) in a medium sized city in the US at the peak of the pandemic. The risk estimate is highly age-dependent. Risk to DHPs under the age of 70 is negligible when prevalence of asymptomatic cases is low in the local community. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of COVID-19 transmission in dental office is very low based on available evidence on effectiveness of PPE and prevalence of asymptomatic patients. Face shields and pre-procedure oral rinses may further reduce the risks.

The vulnerability of the elderly population, shared living and social spaces, suboptimal infection control practices, and prolonged contact between residents were identified as contributing factors to the rapid spread of the disease. The first known case of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in a U.S. inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit was also in King County, Washington, and occurred soon afterward on March 11th, 2020.

Nevertheless, detecting susceptible (also infected ones) may not be perfect due to the lack of information. Also, vaccines do not confer perfect immunity in reality. We incorporate these pragmatic hindrances in our analysis. We find that if vaccines are highly efficacious, and the detecting error is low, then it is possible to confine the disease spreadingby administering a less amount of vaccinationwithin a short period. In a situation where tracing susceptible seems difficult, then expanding the range for vaccination targets can be socially advantageous only if vaccines are effective enough.

In this study, deep learning is selected as a powerful tool for forecasting this epidemic in Isfahan. A combination of effective Social Determinant of Health (SDH) and the occurrences of COVID-19 data are used as spatiotemporal input by using time-series information from different locations.

Several complications have been observed in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19, one of those being bacterial superinfection. Based on prior evidence that dysregulated systemwide proteolysis is associated with death in bacterial septic shock, we investigated whether protease activity and proteolysis could be elevated in COVID-19-induced sepsis with bacterial superinfection. In particular, we sought to assess the possible implications on the regulation of protein systems, such as for instance the proteins and enzymes involved in the clotting cascade. Blood samples collected at multiple time points during the ICU stay of four COVID-19 patients were analyzed to quantify: a) the circulating proteome and peptidome by mass spectrometry; b) plasma enzymatic activity of trypsin-like substrates and five clotting factors (plasmin, thrombin, factor VII, factor IX, factor X) by a fluorogenic assay. Of the four patients, one was diagnosed with bacterial superinfection on day 7 after beginning of the study and later died. The other three patients all survived (ICU length-of-stay 11.25{+/-}6.55 days, hospital stay of 15.25{+/-}7.18 days).

We identify herein clinical and laboratory parameters from admission to discharge, or death, that distinguish between survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19, including those with independent ability to predict mortality. ABSTRACT: Independent predictors of mortality for COVID-19 patients have been identified upon hospital admission; however, how they behave after hospitalization remains unknown. The aim of this study is to identify clinical and laboratory parameters from admission to discharge or death that distinguish survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19, including those with independent ability to predict mortality. In a cohort of 266 adult patients, clinical and laboratory data were analyzed from admission and throughout hospital stay until discharge or death. Upon admission, non-survivors had significantly increased C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.0001, each), ferritin (p < 0.001), and AST (aspartate transaminase) (p = 0.009) compared to survivors. During the hospital stay, deceased patients maintained elevated CRP (21.7 mg/dL [admission] vs. 19.3 [hospitalization], p = 0.060), ferritin, neutrophil count and NLR. Conversely, survivors showed significant reductions in CRP (15.8 mg/dL [admission] vs. 9.3 [hospitalization], p < 0.0001], ferritin, neutrophil count and NLR during hospital stay. Upon admission, elevated CRP, ferritin, and diabetes were independent predictors of mortality, as were persistently high CRP, neutrophilia, and the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation during hospital stay. Inflammatory and clinical parameters distinguishing survivors from non-survivors upon admission changed significantly during hospital stay. These markers warrant close evaluation to monitor and predict patients outcome once hospitalized.","output":"Time-Dependent Changes of Laboratory Parameters as Independent Predictors of All-Cause Mortality in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a new pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, has continued to mutate and spread worldwide despite global vaccination efforts. In particular, the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa in late November 2021, has now overtaken the Delta variant and become the dominant strain worldwide. Compared to the original strain identified in Wuhan, Omicron features 50 genetic mutations, with 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for viral entry. However, it is not completely understood how these mutations alter the interaction and binding strength between the Omicron RBD and ACE2. In this study, we used a combined steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation and experimental microscale thermophoresis (MST) approach to quantify the interaction between Omicron RBD and ACE2. We report that the Omicron brings an enhanced RBD-ACE2 interface through N501Y, Q493K/R, and T478K mutations; the changes further lead to unique interaction patterns, reminiscing the features of previously dominated variants, Alpha (N501Y) and Delta (L452R and T478K).

In conclusion, our result could help explain the Omicron variants prevalence in human populations, as higher interaction forces or affinity for ACE2 likely promote greater viral binding and internalization, leading to increased infectivity.","output":"Binding of Human ACE2 and RBD of Omicron Enhanced by Unique Interaction Patterns Among SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In SARS-CoV-2, at the S1/S2 furin cleavage site, a four amino acid insert (P-R-R-A) not found in closely related corona viruses, has been shown to facilitate entry into respiratory epithelial cells and promote virus transmission, infectivity and virulence. By cupric aerosol treatment, complexation of these four amino acids (-P-R-R-A-), at the spike (S) protein site will lead to a conformational change possibly impeding SARS-CoV-2 replication process in the respiratory track. Since these four amino acids yield strong and stable copper complexes, subsequent to a steric hindrance, this complexation will disturb the furin-like protease cleavage at the spike protein site as it has been recently shown in vitro with copper gluconate. The compilation of stability constants for copper amino-acid complex formation, showing values of the same order of magnitude for all the twenty proteinogenic amino-acids demonstrate thermodynamically that copper amino-acid chelation for SARS-CoV-2 virus will not be affected by mutations leading to amino acid exchanges in the spike protein region. Given its low toxicity, and its very low stability formation constant, copper acetate is proposed rather than copper gluconate for possible cupric aerosol or nasal spray treatments aimed at impeding SARS-CoV-2 multiplication. It will open different medical perspectives, complementary to vaccination, in the fight against COVID 19 native virus, variants and future mutants.","output":"Copper acetate aerosols: a possible tool complementary to vaccination in fight against SARS-CoV-2 and variants replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted health care systems. However, to date, the trend of hospitalizations in the oncology patient population has not been studied, and the frequency of nosocomial spread to patients with cancer is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on inpatient oncology census and determine the nosocomial rate of COVID-19 in patients with cancer admitted at a large academic center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted were reviewed to evaluate the temporal trends in inpatient oncology census during pre-COVID-19 (January 2019 to February 2020), COVID-19 (March to May 2020), and post-COVID-19 surge (June to August 2020) in the region. In addition, nosocomial infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, the daily inpatient census was steady in 2019 (median, 103; range, 92-118) and until February 2020 (median, 112; range, 102-114). However, there was a major decline from March to May 2020 (median, 68; range, 57-104), with 45.4% lower admissions during April 2020. As the COVID-19 surge eased, the daily inpatient census over time returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline (median, 103; range, 99-111). One patient (1/231, 0.004%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 13 days after hospitalization, and it is unclear if it was nosocomial or community spread. CONCLUSION: In this study, inpatient oncology admissions decreased substantially during the COVID-19 surge but over time returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline. With aggressive infection control measures, the rates of nosocomial transmission were exceedingly low and should provide reassurance to those seeking medical care, including inpatient admissions when medically necessary. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the health care system, and cancer patients are a vulnerable population. This study observes a significant decline in the daily inpatient oncology census from March to May 2020 compared with the same time frame in the previous year and examines the potential reasons for this decline. In addition, nosocomial rates of COVID-19 were investigated, and rates were found to be very low. These findings suggest that aggressive infection control measures can mitigate the nosocomial infection risk among cancer patients and the inpatient setting is a safe environment, providing reassurance.","output":"Temporal Trends in Inpatient Oncology Census Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Rates of Nosocomial COVID-19 Among Patients with Cancer at a Large Academic Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data on firm-loan-level daily credit line drawdowns in the United States expose a corporate dash for cash induced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to assess the clinical effects of a home-based tele-rehabilitation exercise program following hospital discharge during the first lockdown in Greece, April to July 2020. METHODS A pre-and post-intervention design was applied in two stages. Firstly, patients were instructed to use a specially designed for COVID-19, e-book during four tele-health sessions. Afterwards, a 2-month home-based program consisted of self-practice exercise and one-hour supervised tele-rehabilitation exercise sessions every 10 days, was delivered. At baseline and at the end of the program, participants were interviewed about their physical, psychological status and quality of life (QoL) during the post-hospitalization period. The IPAQ-Gr, the HADS and the SF-36 questionnaires were used, respectively, and the participants were functionally assessed via teleconferences, using the 60 sec Sit to Stand Test (60secSTS), the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the 3 min Step Test (3MST). RESULTS Seventy-four patients, median age 52.5 (IQR: 43C61) years were included at the first stage. From those, only 22 patients, mean  SD age 50.1  13.2 years completed the 2-month exercise program.

Cadaver dissections were performed to identify and name important surgical landmarks in the suprahyoid area; a histopathologic analysis of surgical specimens was completed to determine the incidence and extent of microscopic disease; and clinical outcomes were compared to determine the efficacy of a specific anatomic dissection. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. METHODS Standardized dissections of four adult cadavers were performed. Consecutive surgical specimens were examined for evidence of microscopic TDGC disease in the suprahyoid region, measuring the greatest width and length of disease. A retrospective review of all consecutive TGDC procedures was completed. RESULTS The important surgical landmarks in the suprahyoid area were identified in all cadavers. Microscopic disease in the suprahyoid area was found in 79% (37 of 47) of surgical specimens. The mean greatest length and width of microscopic disease was 12.4 mm and 1.4 mm, respectively. Following identification of these landmarks, the incidence of recurrent or persistent disease decreased (P = .02) from 5% (8 of 159) to 0% (0 of 112). CONCLUSION The majority of pediatric patients with a TGDC will have microscopic disease in the suprahyoid area. The surgical landmark of the fascial plane between the geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles demarcates the anterior and lateral borders of resection in the suprahyoid area.

The impact of these measures has been inconsistent, with some regions rapidly nearing disease elimination and others seeing delayed peaks or nearly flat epidemic curves. Here we build a stochastic epidemic model to examine the effects of COVID-19 clinical progression and transmission network structure on the outcomes of social distancing interventions. Our simulations show that long delays between the adoption of control measures and observed declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur in many scenarios. We find that the strength of within-household transmission is a critical determinant of success, governing the timing and size of the epidemic peak, the rate of decline, individual risks of infection, and the success of partial relaxation measures. The structure of residual external connections, driven by workforce participation and essential businesses, interacts to determine outcomes. We suggest limited conditions under which the formation of household bubbles can be safe.

In the light of this, three advanced numerical and analytical algorithms are presented to obtain approximate solutions for different classes of logistical growth problems, including reproducing kernel algorithm, fractional residual series algorithm and successive substitutions algorithm. The first technique relies on the reproducing property that characterises a specific function of building a complete orthogonal system at desired Hilbert spaces. The RPS technique relies on residual error function and generalised Taylor series to reduce residual errors and generate a converging power series, while the last technique converts the fractional logistic model to Volterra integral equation based on Riemann-Liouville integral operator. To demonstrate consistency with the theoretical framework, some realistic applications are tested to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes.

This study aims to identify the main subject areas attracting research attention with regard to very old ( 80 years) populations. METHODS: Documents assigned with the medical subject heading Aged, 80 and over were retrieved from MEDLINE and the Web of Science. This dataset was used to determine publication output by disease, geographic region, country, and discipline. A co-word analysis was undertaken to identify thematic research clusters. RESULTS: Since the mid-2000s, there has been a boom in scientific output focusing specifically on very old populations, especially in Europe (43.7% of the documents) but also in North America (30.5%) and Asia (26%); other regions made only nominal contributions (0.5 to 4.4%). The USA produced the most research, while the most growth over the study period occurred in Japan, Spain, and China. Four broad thematic clusters were identified: a) geriatric diseases, health services for the aged, and social and psychological issues of aging; b) cardiovascular diseases; c) neoplasms, and d) bacterial infections & anti-bacterial agents. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific research in very old populations covers a wide variety of interrelated topics. In quantitative terms, the top subject areas have to do with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (including aortic valve stenosis and stroke), dementia, and neoplasms. However, other degenerative pathologies, geriatric syndromes, and different social and psychosocial aspects also attract considerable interest.

In this study, the content of AsA in the juice and leaves of four orange clonal selections, different in terms of maturity time and the presence/absence of anthocyanins, was correlated with the transcription levels of the main genes involved in the biosynthesis, recycling, and degradation pathways. Within each variety, differences in the above pathways and the AsA amount were found between the analysed tissues. Variations were also observed at different stages of fruit development and maturation. At the beginning of fruit development, AsA accumulation was attributable to the synergic action of l-galactose and Myo-inositol, while the l-gulose pathway was predominant between the end of fruit development and the beginning of ripening. In leaves, the l-galactose pathway appeared to play a major role in AsA accumulation, even though higher GalUr isoform expression suggests a synergistic contribution of both pathways in this tissue. In juice, the trend of the AsA content may be related to the decrease in the transcription levels of the GME, GDH, MyoOx, and GalUr12 genes. Newhall was the genotype that accumulated the most AsA.

However, emerging research has identified novel mediators such as DPP9, TYK2, and CCR2, all playing a critical role in inflammation. We evaluated the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in peripheral leukocytes (n=469), jejunum (n=30), and colon (n=37) of three independent cohorts by real-time PCR, RNA-sequencing, and microarray transcriptomics. We also performed HPCL-MS/MS lipidomics and metabolomics analyses to identify signatures linked to SARS-CoV-2 receptors. We found markedly higher peripheral leukocytes ACE2 expression levels in women compared to men, whereas the intestinal expression of TMPRSS2 was positively associated with BMI. Consistent lipidomics signatures associated with the expression of these mediators were found in both tissues and peripheral leukocytes involving n-3 long-chain PUFAs and arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, which play a key role in the regulation of inflammation and may interfere with viral entry and replication. Medium- and long-chain hydroxy acids, which have shown to interfere in viral replication, were also liked to SARS-CoV2 receptors.

Medications included immunotherapy (thymosin  1), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin), antibiotics (imipenem-cilastatin sodium and vancomycin), and methylprednisolone. Ventilatory support was provided using invasive mechanical ventilation. This was replaced by venous-venous ECMO 5 days postpartum. ECMO management focused on blood volume control, coagulation function adjustment, and airway management. OUTCOMES: The patient was successfully weaned for ECMO and the ventilator and made a good recovery. CONCLUSION: Special care, including blood volume control, coagulation function adjustment, and airway management, should be provided to postpartum patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 who require ECMO support.","output":"Postpartum extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of a woman with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although work stress, turnover intention, and work?family conflicts among police officers have been extensively investigated, no studies have explored these issues simultaneously under the context of the coronavirus pandemic.

Using survey data based on a representative random sample of 335 police officers in Hong Kong, this study examines the impacts of resource losses and gains across family and work domains on occupational stress and turnover intention amid the pandemic. A multiple regression indicates that both family-to-work and work-to-family conflicts lead to work stress and turnover intention among police officers. Among officers, supervisory support is negatively associated with turnover intention and moderates the impact of work-to-family conflicts on turnover intention.

The immune system initiates the autoimmune response, although the mechanisms of neuronal damage have not been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, in conjunction with other inflammatory cells and cytokines in active MS lesions. METHODS EAE animal models was established by plantar injections of MBP (200 g per rat). Purified CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood (EAE animals and control animals) via negative selection. To examine effects of presence of autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, we carried out ELISA, Western blot analysis and TUNEL. In addition, we examined the direct effects of various factors on neuronal cell death using MTT assay. RESULTS The data revealed that CD8+ T-cells were more toxic to neurons compared to CD4+ T-cells, in both the MBP and EAE conditions. Bax was greater increased when neurons were co-cultured with CD8+ T-cells in the MBP group. There is a significant increase in IL-17 secretion by CD4+ T-cells in both the MBP group and EAE group. Neuronal viability were affected by Perforin (1.5 g/mL). CONCLUSION The present study extends previous research by demonstrating the role of CD8+ T-cells in MS and supports perforin secretion by CD8+ T-cells as a potential therapeutic factor. Furthermore, we determined that CD4+ T-cells can enhance CD8+ T-cell neuronal cytotoxicity via induction of intense inflammation.","output":"Role of perforin secretion from CD8+ T-cells in neuronal cytotoxicity in multiple sclerosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing an unprecedented global pandemic in the form of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has ravaged all aspects of life, especially health systems.

Methods and procedures: A novel end-to-end system was developed including a portable device with CMOS camera integrated with optimized illumination and optics to capture the LFA images produced using high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) (concentration level < 5 mg/L). The images were transmitted via WiFi to a back-end server system for image analysis and classification. Unlike common image classification approaches which are based on averaging image intensity from a region-of-interest (ROI), a novel approach was developed which considered the signal along the samples flow direction as a time series and, consequently, no need for ROI detection. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were deployed for multilevel classification. The features based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and histogram bin counts (HBC) were explored for classification. Results: For the classification of hsCRP, the LSTM outperformed the traditional machine learning classifiers with or without DTW and HBC features performed the best (with mean accuracy of 94%) compared to other features. Application of the proposed method to human plasma also suggests that HBC features from LFA time series performed better than the mean from ROI and raw LFA data. Conclusion: As a proof of concept, the results demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework for quantitative analysis of LFA images and suggest the potential for early risk assessment of CVD. Clinical impact: The hsCRP levels < 5 mg/L were aligned with clinically actionable categories for early risk assessment of CVD. The outcomes demonstrated the real-world applicability of the proposed system for quantitative analysis of LFA images, which is potentially useful for more LFA applications beyond presented in this study.","output":"A Novel Method for Quantitative Analysis of C-Reactive Protein Lateral Flow Immunoassays Images via CMOS Sensor and Recurrent Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Psychological studies undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic rarely include people in their 60s or older.

However, the lack of detailed data on modes of transmission from the animal reservoir and between humans means that the drivers of MERS-CoV epidemics remain poorly characterized. Here, we develop a statistical framework to provide a comprehensive analysis of the transmission patterns underlying the 681 MERS-CoV cases detected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) between January 2013 and July 2014. We assess how infections from the animal reservoir, the different levels of mixing, and heterogeneities in transmission have contributed to the buildup of MERS-CoV epidemics in KSA. We estimate that 12% [95% credible interval (CI): 9%, 15%] of cases were infected from the reservoir, the rest via human-to-human transmission in clusters (60%; CI: 57%, 63%), within (23%; CI: 20%, 27%), or between (5%; CI: 2%, 8%) regions. The reproduction number at the start of a cluster was 0.45 (CI: 0.33, 0.58) on average, but with large SD (0.53; CI: 0.35, 0.78).

Earlier study reported that dry eye, blurred vision, foreign body sensation, tearing, itching, conjunctival secretion, conjunctival congestion, ocular pain, and photophobia are among the ocular symptoms that could be found in COVID-19 patients. However, there are only a few reports available regarding corneal involvement in this disease. Here we report a case of keratoconjunctivitis as the only symptom of COVID-19 infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old man who worked as an obstetrics and gynecology resident came to the outpatient clinic with the chief complaints of eye discomfort, foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperemia, lacrimation, and photophobia in his right eye for the past 3 weeks. Fluorescence test showed a small corneal lesion. The patient was then diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis. A week after the treatment, all symptoms were resolved. A month later, the patient came to the emergency room with the same eye complaints but with a more severe pain. The fluorescence test showed wider corneal lesion compared to last month. The result from the corneal swab is negative for bacterial or fungal infection, indicating a viral infection. Afterwards, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test from nasopharyngeal swab was performed and revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19.

Aortic occlusion may increase aortic pressure and increase the coronary perfusion pressure and the cerebral blood flow. Peripheral arterial blood pressure is often measured during or after CPR, however, changes in peripheral blood pressure after aortic occlusion is insufficiently described. This study aimed to assess changes in peripheral arterial blood pressure after REBOA in patients with out of hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: A prospective observational study performed at the helicopter emergency medical service in Trondheim (Norway). Eligible patients received REBOA as adjunct treatment to advanced cardiac life support. Peripheral invasive arterial blood pressure and end-tidal CO(2) (EtCO(2)) was measured before and after aortic occlusion. Differences in arterial blood pressures and EtCO(2) before and after occlusion was analysed with Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. RESULTS: Five patients were included to the study. The median REBOA procedural time was 11 min and median time from dispatch to aortic occlusion was 50 min. Two patients achieved return of spontaneous circulation. EtCO(2) increased significantly 60 s after occlusion, by a mean of 1.16 kPa (p = 0.043). Before occlusion the arterial pressure in the compression phase were 43.2 (range 12C112) mmHg, the mean pressure 18.6 (range 4C27) mmHg and pressure in the relaxation phase 7.8 (range ? 7 C 22) mmHg. After aortic occlusion the corresponding pressures were 114.8 (range 23C241) mmHg, 44.6 (range 15C87) mmHg and 14.8 (range 0C29) mmHg. The arterial pressures were significant different in the compression phase and as mean pressure (p = 0.043 and p = 0.043, respectively) and not significant in the relaxation phase (p = 0.223). CONCLUSION: This study is, to our knowledge, the first to assess the peripheral invasive arterial blood pressure response to aortic occlusion during CPR in the pre-hospital setting. REBOA application during CPR is associated with a significantly increase in peripheral artery pressures. This likely indicates improved central aortic blood pressure and warrants studies with simultaneous peripheral and central blood pressure measurement during aortic occlusion.

METHODS: Using population-based forecasting, we estimated the demand for a GBS vaccine; using a discounted cash flow model we estimated the financial viability for a vaccine developer. RESULTS: Demand for this vaccine can be significant if countries adopt policy recommendations for use, in particular, the largest ones, most of which have a burden that justifies use of the vaccine, and if financing for the vaccine is made available either by countries or by funding mechanisms such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests the potential for financial and commercial viability for a vaccine developer pursuing the commercialization of a GBS vaccine. Risks exists in relation to the clinical trial design and costs, the level of competition, countries ability to pay, the administration schedule, and the availability of policies that encourage use of the vaccine. To reduce those risks and ensure equitable access to a GBS vaccine, the role of donors or financers can prove very important, as can a coordinated operational research agenda that aims at clarifying those areas of uncertainty.","output":"A Financial and Global Demand Analysis to Inform Decisions for Funding and Clinical Development of Group B Streptococcus Vaccines for Pregnant Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Sub-Saharan Africa is poorly understood and to date has generally been characterised by a lower number of declared cases and deaths as compared to other regions of the world Paucity of reliable information, with insights largely derived from limited RT-PCR testing in high-risk and urban populations, has been one of the biggest barriers to understanding the course of the pandemic and informed policy-making Here we estimate seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Ethiopia during the first wave of the pandemic Methods: We undertook a population-based household seroprevalence serosurvey based on 1856 participants in Ethiopia, in the capital city Addis Ababa, and in Jimma, a middle-sized town in the Oromia region, and its rural surroundings (districts of Seka and Mana), between 22 July and 02 September 2020 We tested one random participant per household for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a high specificity rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and evaluated population seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance as well as age and sex of the participants Findings: In total, 2304 random households were visited, with 1856 individuals consenting to participate This produced a sample of 956 participants in Addis Ababa and 900 participants in Jimma IgG prevalence was estimated at 1 9% (95% CI 0 4C3 7%), and combined IgM/IgG prevalence at 3 5% (95% CI 1 7C5 4%) for Addis Ababa in early August 2020, with higher prevalence in central sub-cities Prevalence in Jimma town was lower at 0 5% (95% CI 0C1 8%) for IgG and 1 6% (95%CI 0C4 1%) for IgM/IgG, while in rural Jimma IgG prevalence was 0 2% and IgM/IgG 0 4% in early September Interpretation: More than four months after the first cases were detected in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa displayed a prevalence under 5% and likely as low as 2%, while rural Jimma displayed a prevalence of 0 2% A 2% seroprevalence figure for the capital translated to a number of cases at least five times larger than those reported for the country as a whole At the same time, it contrasts with significantly higher seroprevalence figures in large cities in Europe and America only two to three months after the first cases This population-based seroepidemiological study thus provides evidence of a slower spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Ethiopian population during the first wave of the pandemic and does not appear to support the notion that lower case numbers were simply a reflection of limited testing and surveillance Funding: Schmidt Family Foundation, Joachim Hertz Foundation, Nespresso, Peet's and Smuckers","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in urban and rural Ethiopia: Randomized household serosurveys reveal level of spread during the first wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We leverage the largest polio outbreak in US history, the 1916 polio epidemic, to study how epidemic-related school interruptions affect educational attainment.

Various factors have been found to influence parenting but the contribution of these factors toward parental nurturance within the first 1000 days is not yet known in the South African context. This paper describes a protocol for a project that aims to develop a logic model of change for the determinants of parental nurturance in the first 1000 days in the South African context. METHOD: This study will apply a mixed methods approach with a sequential design within an intervention mapping framework. The study will occur in two phases. The first phase will identify the problem, which will be done via a scoping review, a policy review and a needs assessment for parents and stakeholders. This phase will recruit approximately 35 participants (20 parents and 15 stakeholders) for the qualitative component and then approximately 398 participants for the quantitative component. Data will be collected via semi-structured interviews and with questionnaires (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory, the Depression and Anxiety Scale, and the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale). Data will be thematically analysed, and the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) will be used to determine descriptive statistics, both of which will inform the development of the model in phase 2. The second phase will be the development of a logic model of change for determinants for parental nurturance in the first thousand days. This phase will consist of one stage- a consensus workshop which will be attended by approximately 20 participants (5 parents, 5 pregnant woman/new mothers, and 10 stakeholders). The data collected in this stage will be thematically analysed and will contribute to the refinement of the model.

Recent findings: Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed.

DESIGN/SETTING: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019-February 2020) versus after (April 2020) lockdown. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 558 adults (&#8805; 16 years). MEASUREMENTS: The independent variable was the timing of the COVID-19 lockdown (before versus after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking, past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers), past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers) and use of evidence-based (e.g. prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support [telephone support/websites/applications (apps)] for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). FINDINGS: The COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence [17.0% (after) versus 15.9% (before), odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24], but was associated with increases in quit attempts [39.6 versus 29.1%, adjusted odds ratio (ORadj ) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.23-1.98], quit success (21.3 versus 13.9%, ORadj = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.33) and cessation (8.8 versus 4.1%, ORadj = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.69-4.09) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0 versus 51.5%, ORadj = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.72-1.68) but use of remote support increased (10.9 versus 2.7%, ORadj = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.56-8.23). Lockdown was associated with increases in high-risk drinking (38.3 versus 25.1%, OR = 1.85, CI = 1.67-2.06), but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5 versus 15.3%, ORadj = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.77-2.64). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2 versus 4.0%, ORadj = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.05-0.97) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9 versus 6.1%, ORadj = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.64-2.75). CONCLUSIONS: Following the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, smokers and high-risk drinkers in England were more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce alcohol consumption and rates of smoking cessation and use of remote cessation support were higher. However, high-risk drinking prevalence increased post-lockdown and use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers decreased with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","output":"Association of the COVID-19 lockdown with smoking, drinking and attempts to quit in England: an analysis of 2019-20 data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AJOL Abstract: Amongst the recent documents released by the Greek Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the one titled For the Life of the World, published before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, touches upon an important section of the life of the Orthodox Church, namely, the social one.

The comorbidities lead to the COVID-19 patient into a vicious infectious circle of life and are substantially associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The comorbid individuals must adopt the vigilant preventive measure and require scrupulous management. In this review, we rigorously focused on the impact of common morbidities in COVID-19 patients and recapitulated the management strategies with recent directions. We found limited resources describing the association of comorbidities in COVID-19; however, our review delineates the broader spectrum of comorbidities with COVID-19 patients.","output":"COVID-19 and comorbidities: Deleterious impact on infected patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Gestational SARS-Cov-2 infection can impact maternal and neonatal health. The virus has also been reported of causing sensorineural hearing loss. The objective of this study was to determine the possible effect of maternal SARS-COV-2 infection on neonatal hearing as identified during universal hearing screening. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study in two tertiary referral centers including all neonates born from November 2020 through April 1st, 2021 and undergoing the universal hearing screening program. Maternal Covid-19 infection was recorded (timing and severity) and the results of hearing screening of their neonates compared to the incidence of neonatal hearing loss results of the national universal screening program during the same period. RESULTS: A total of 984 neonates were included (508 males and 476 females). Sixty-three neonates were excluded due to comorbidities which could cause hearing loss. The incidence of failed responses in the community at large was 2.3%. Twenty-seven failed both steps of screening (2.9%; p < 0.2). There were 34 Covid-19 positive mothers (17 in the first trimester, 8 in the second and 9 in the third). Twenty-nine neonates failed the first screening (p < 0.00001) but on further testing only one neonate failed (2.9%). CONCLUSION: In this study, neonates born to Covid-19 positive mothers do not seem to have an increased risk of hearing loss. However longer follow-up of these neonates is mandatory to detect any possible delayed effects of the virus.","output":"Maternal COVID-19 and neonatal hearing loss: a multicentric survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a three-dimensional mathematical model to describe dynamical processes of membrane fission The model is based on a phase field equation that includes the Gaussian curvature contribution to the bending energy With the addition of the Gaussian curvature energy term numerical simulations agree with the predictions that tubular shapes can break down into multiple vesicles A dispersion relation obtained with linear analysis predicts the wavelength of the instability and the number of formed vesicles Finally, a membrane shape diagram is obtained for the different Gaussian and bending modulus, showing different shape regimes","output":"On Gaussian curvature and membrane fission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Novel Coronavirus or CoViD-19 has been spreading rapidly around the globe since 2019 and is causing a massive impact on humans;lakhs of people have died because of this virus.

METHODS: Fifty nine COVID\\\\19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and wards in our hospital between March and June 2020 and 19 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Participants were divided into mild, severe, and critical disease severity groups. Group mean values were analyzed with SPSS according to disease severity, mortality, and intubation status. RESULTS: Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly lower in the critical patient group (P < .0001) and deceased group (P < .0001). The red blood cell distribution width\\\\coefficient of variation (RDW\\\\CV) and ferritin values were significantly higher in the intubated (P = .001, P = .005) and deceased (P = .014, P = .003) groups. Ferritin values were positively correlated with disease severity (P < .0001). Serum iron levels were lower in the patient group compared with the reference range. (P < .0001). It was found that the transferrin saturation (TfSat) was lower in the patient group compared with the control group (P < .0001).

As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future.

Presenting symptomatology in the outpatient setting was poorly characterized, making it difficult for primary care physicians to predict which patients would require hospitalization. Purpose To characterize presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection and baseline patient characteristics and evaluate for correlation with disease severity, duration, and chronicity in the outpatient setting. Methods 107 adult, English speaking patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases at the three primary care practices of Stony Brook University Hospital were studied between March and December, 2020. Survey data was collected from patient telephone interviews and electronic medical record (EMR) ion. Potential risk factors assessed included participant demographics, medical comorbidities, and number and type of symptoms at illness onset. Outcome measures included symptom duration, hospitalizations, and persistence of symptoms at 12 weeks from study enrollment. Results Patient self-report survey elicited nearly twice as many symptoms described at illness onset vs. those recorded in the EMR (p<0.0001). Higher number of symptoms at illness onset was positively associated with symptom duration and chronicity. The presence of fever and hypoxia at the onset of illness were each positively associated with eventual hospitalization for COVID-19 disease. Conclusions Early in the setting of newly emerging infectious diseases, particularly those such as COVID-19 which involve multiple organ systems, patient self-report of symptoms using a complete review of systems, rather than EMR ion alone, may be key for accurate disease identification and characterization as well as prediction of eventual disease severity, duration and chronicity.","output":"Patient Self-Report Superior to Electronic Medical Record Abstraction for Identifying Positive COVID-19 Symptoms at Illness Onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T cells are involved in control of COVID-19, but limited knowledge is available on the relationship between antigen-specific T cell response and disease severity.

We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, associates with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB co-infection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response.

Design and setting: Prospective observational study in pediatric intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients: Twelve infants who were subjected to an uncomplicated diagnostic cardiac catheterization procedure were studied. All subjects were ventilated with a volume control mode, 0.3 FIO(2), 4 cmH(2)O PEEP, and 10 ml/kg tidal volume. Volatile (servoflurane) anesthetics were given. Measurements and results: Tracheal aspirates and blood samples were obtained before and after 2 h of mechanical ventilation. In tracheal aspirates and in supernatants of stimulated whole-blood cultures cytokine concentrations were measured. In the tracheal aspirates the immune balance was characterized by a proinflammatory response pattern, with a significant increase in TNF- and IL-6 concentrations; concentrations of anti-inflammatory mediators remained very low. The functional capacity of peripheral blood leukocytes to produce INF-, TNF-, and IL-6 in vitro was significantly decreased. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the killing activity of natural killer cells. Conclusions: Two hours of servoflurane and mechanical ventilation using a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg is associated with remarkable changes in the immune response in infants without preexisting lung pathology undergoing cardiac catheterization. In the lungs the immune balance favors a proinflammatory response pattern without detectable concentrations of anti-inflammatory mediators. The Th1 immune response by peripheral blood leukocytes was decreased. The observed change in Th1/Th2 balance in favor of Th2 cytokine activity may be a systemic adaptation to the proinflammatory milieu in the lung.","output":"Mechanical ventilation alters the immune response in children without lung pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Plusieurs cas de syndrome nphrotique secondaire  une nphropathie  lsions glomrulaires minimes (LGM) ont t rapports aprs vaccination, notamment contre la grippe.

The UAE reports one of the highest rates of non-communicable disease mortality and insufficient physical activity (PA) is a major underlying cause. Therefore, action is required to reduce physical inactivity using evidence-based strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a worksite exercise intervention on cardiometabolic health in the UAE. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a protocol for a pragmatic parallel randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio to the intervention group and delayed intervention group. A total of 150 participants will be recruited from a semigovernment telecommunications company in Dubai (UAE) after meeting the eligibility criteria. The intervention group will receive 2 hours of exercise per week during working hours for 12 weeks (maximum 1 hour/day). The intervention group will be assigned to attend personal trainer sessions in the workplace gym throughout the intervention period. After the intervention is completed, the delayed intervention group will also receive 2 hours of exercise time per week from working hours for 4 weeks. The main outcome measure is the change in the cardiometabolic risk components, that is, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline to the end of the intervention. The secondary outcome is to examine whether the workplace exercise intervention improves PA levels 4 weeks postintervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Dubai Scientific Research Ethics Committee (DSREC-SR-08/2019_02). The results will be disseminated as follows: at various national and international scientific conferences; as part of a PhD thesis in Public Health at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University; and in a manuscript submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.

Here, we demonstrated that TRIM47, an ubiquitin E3 ligase of tripartite protein family, is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and is up-regulated during TNF-induced endothelial activation. Knockdown of TRIM47 in endothelial cells prevents the transcription of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduces monocyte adhesion and the expression of adhesion molecules, and inhibits the secretion of IL-1 and IL-6 into the supernatant. By contrast, overexpression of TRIM47 promotes inflammatory response and monocyte adhesion upon TNF stimulation. TRIM47 modulates the activation of NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways during endothelial activation. Further experiment confirmed that TRIM47 interacts with TRAF2 and mediates K63-linked ubiquitination. In addition, TRIM47-deficient mice are more resistant to lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury and death, due to attenuated pulmonary inflammation. Taken together, our studies suggest that TRIM47 promotes pulmonary inflammation and injury at least partly through potentiating the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF2, which in turn activates NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways to trigger inflammatory response in endothelial cells.","output":"E3 ligase TRIM47 positively regulates endothelial activation and pulmonary inflammation through potentiating the K63-linked ubiquitination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuropsychiatric complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated While most studies have focussed on severely affected individuals during acute infection, it remains unclear whether mild COVID-19 results in neurocognitive deficits in young patients Here, we established a screening approach to detect cognitive deficiencies in post-COVID-19 patients In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 18 mostly young patients 20-105 days (median, 85 days) after recovery from mild to moderate disease who visited our outpatient clinic for post-COVID-19 care Notably, 14 (78%) patients reported sustained mild cognitive deficits and performed worse in the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status screening test for mild cognitive impairment compared to 10 age-matched healthy controls While short-term memory, attention and concentration were particularly affected by COVID-19, screening results did not correlate with hospitalization, treatment, viremia or acute inflammation Additionally, Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status scores did not correlate with depressed mood or fatigue In two severely affected patients, we excluded structural or other inflammatory causes by magnetic resonance imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses Together, our results demonstrate that sustained sub-clinical cognitive impairments might be a common complication after recovery from COVID-19 in young adults, regardless of clinical course that were unmasked by our diagnostic approach","output":"Frequent neurocognitive deficits after recovery from mild COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of more effective, accessible and easy to administer COVID-19 vaccines next to the currently marketed mRNA, viral vector and whole inactivated virus vaccines, is essential to curtain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A major concern is reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants, and therefore booster vaccinations to broaden and strengthen the immune response might be required. Currently, all registered COVID-19 vaccines and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered, targeting the induction of systemic immunity. Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well, thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines offer greater practicality in terms of cost and ease of administration. Currently, only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are administered intranasally. We developed an intranasal COVID-19 subunit vaccine, based on a recombinant, six proline stabilized, D614G spike protein (mC-Spike) of SARS-CoV-2 linked via the LPS-binding peptide sequence mCramp (mC) to Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) from Neisseria meningitidis. The spike protein was produced in CHO cells and after linking to the OMVs, the OMV-mC-Spike vaccine was administered to mice and Syrian hamsters via intranasal or intramuscular prime-boost vaccinations. In all animals that received OMV-mC-Spike, serum neutralizing antibodies were induced upon vaccination. Importantly, high levels of spike-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) antibodies in the nose and lungs were only detected in intranasally vaccinated animals, whereas intramuscular vaccination only induced an IgG response in the serum. Two weeks after their second vaccination hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs compared to the control groups vaccinated with OMV or spike alone. Histopathology showed no lesions in lungs seven days after challenge in OMV-mC-Spike vaccinated hamsters, whereas the control groups did show pathological lesions in the lung. The OMV-mC-Spike candidate vaccine data are very promising and support further development of this novel non-replicating, needle-free, subunit vaccine concept for clinical testing.","output":"An Intranasal OMV-based vaccine induces high mucosal and systemic protecting immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critical responses to the pandemic have divided between the need to control and defeat it and fears of a new medicalisation of human existence. In the short-term the first response is right, but in the long-term the second. The ideological division on this issue on the left roughly correlates with a relative stress on the power of the market on the one hand or the power of the state on the other. But these are two halves of the same picture: the mechanisation of human life and the artificial rendering of the natural scarce and threatening. The tendencies that give rise to pandemics and those which exult in increasing total control are the same. Resistance can only come from a resistance to liberal mechanising as such.

Italy has been one of the first and most affected countries with more than 30,000 deaths up to now. Public health measures as quarantine or national lockdown are necessary to limit the spread of infectious diseases, but it is unsurprising that depriving people of their liberty has negative psychological effects. This is especially the case for people with chronic diseases, including neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS). People with MS (PwMS) have a higher burden of neuropsychiatric comorbidities and are known to undertake maladaptive coping strategies in stress conditions. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on mental health of an Italian cohort of PwMS in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). Methods: A total of 60 PwMS and 50 HCs (chosen among patients' cohabitants) were asked to answer a Web-based survey. This survey inquired about the impact of COVID-19 on patient's quality of life, job, and daily routine. Mood, fatigue, and sleep quality were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), the Generalized Anxiety Disease 7 (GAD-7), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: Overall, patients had higher scores of BDI, FSS, and PSQI, and these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). When we looked at the subscores of the BDI, we detected a statistically significant difference for the neurovegetative partthat concerns with sleep, appetite, sex, and quality of sleep (p < 0.05). One out of five patients reported new symptoms or worsening of known symptom, in particular, sensory disturbances, and fatigue. However, no symptoms were severe enough to require hospitalization. When we looked for correlations among variables, we found that there was a significant relationship between unemployment and BDI total score, GAD-7, and PSQI in MS group. The presence of new symptoms or the worsening of symptoms positively related to FSS and to PSQI. Discussion: We identified that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic had a significant impact on the psychological status of patients with MS. Compared with the general population, PwMS presented a higher burden of depressive symptoms, a worse sleep quality and perceived an increase in fatigue level, one of the most disabling symptoms of MS.

The change to prone position is generally accompanied by a marked improvement in arterial blood gases, which is mainly due to a better overall ventilation/perfusion matching. Improvement in oxygenation and reduction in mortality are the main reasons to implement prone position in patients with ARDS. The main reason explaining a decreased mortality is less overdistension in non-dependent lung regions and less cyclical opening and closing in dependent lung regions.

We used logistic regression to model finding risk for 4 clinical impact factor (CIF) categories: Safety Reporting, Data Integrity, Consent and Protecting Endpoints. RESULTS: We could identify 15 interpretable factors influencing audit finding risk of 4 out of 5 CIF categories. They can be used to realistically predict differences in risk between 25 and 43% for different sites which suffice to rank sites by audit and inspection finding risk.

Very few prior studies have investigated the infant feeding choices of women with SMI, or the factors associated with this. Our aims were to examine antenatal infant feeding intentions and infant feeding outcomes in a cohort of women admitted for acute psychiatric care in the first postpartum year. We also aimed to examine whether demographic and clinical characteristics associated with breastfeeding were similar to those found in previous studies in the general population, including age, employment, education, BMI, mode of delivery, smoking status, and social support. Methods: This study was a mixed-methods secondary analysis of a national cohort study, ESMI-MBU (Examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of perinatal mental health services). Participants had been admitted to acute care with SMI in the first postpartum year. Infant feeding outcomes were retrospectively self-reported by women during a 1-month post-discharge interview. Free-text responses to questions relating to infant feeding and experience of psychiatric services were also explored using thematic analysis. Results: 144 (66.1%) of 218 women reported breastfeeding (mix feeding and exclusive breastfeeding). Eighty five percentage of the cohort had intended to breastfeed and of these, 76.5% did so. Factors associated with breastfeeding included infant feeding intentions, employment and non-Caucasian ethnicity. Although very few women were taking psychotropic medication contraindicated for breastfeeding, over a quarter (n = 57, 26.15%) reported being advised against breastfeeding because of their medication. Women were given this advice by psychiatry practitioners (40% n = 22), maternity practitioners (32.73% n = 18) and postnatal primary care (27.27% n = 15). Most women stopped breastfeeding earlier than they had planned to as a result (81.1% n = 43). Twenty five women provided free text responses, most felt unsupported with infant feeding due to inconsistent information about medication when breastfeeding and that breastfeeding intentions were de-prioritized for mental health care.

Contradictory and insufficient advice relating to breastfeeding and psychotropic medication indicates that further training is required for professionals caring for women at risk of perinatal SMI about how to manage infant feeding in this population.

In four studies with over 4,100 U.S. participants, we consistently found that people perceive the threat of COVID-19 to be substantially greater than that of several other causes of death to which it has recently been compared, including the seasonal flu and automobile accidents. Participants were less willing to help COVID-19 victims, who they considered riskier to help, more contaminated, and more responsible for their condition. Additionally, politics and demographic factors predicted attitudes about victims of COVID-19 above and beyond moral values; whereas attitudes about the other kinds of victims were primarily predicted by moral values. The results indicate that people perceive COVID-19 as an exceptionally severe disease threat, and despite prosocial inclinations, do not feel safe offering assistance to COVID-19 sufferers. This research has urgent applied significance: the findings are relevant to public health efforts and related marketing campaigns working to address extended damage to society and the economy from the pandemic. In particular, efforts to educate the public about the health impacts of COVID-19, encourage compliance with testing protocols and contact tracing, and support safe, prosocial decision-making and risk assessment, will all benefit from awareness of these findings.

With the impact being less than predicted, on May 26, 2020, elective surgeries and non-essential activities were permitted to resume. OBJECTIVES: To examine outcomes following elective aesthetic surgery and the impact on the Canadian health care system with the resumption of these services during the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. METHODS: Data was collected in a prospective manner on consecutive patients undergoing elective plastic surgery procedures in six accredited ambulatory surgery facilities. Data included patient demographics, procedural characteristics, COVID-19 PCR test status, airway management and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: 368 patients underwent elective surgical procedures requiring a general anesthetic. All 368 patients that underwent surgery were negative on pre visit screening. A COVID-19 PCR test was completed by 352 patients (95.7%) and all were negative. In the postoperative period, seven patients (1.9%) had complications, three patients (0.8%) required a hospital visit, and one patient (0.3%) required hospital admission. No patients or health care providers developed COVID-19 symptoms or had a positive test for COVID-19 within 30 days of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate screening and safety precautions, elective aesthetic plastic surgery can be performed in a manner that is safe for patients and health care providers and with a very low risk for accelerating virus transmission within the community.","output":"The Safe Resumption of Elective Plastic Surgery in Accredited Ambulatory Surgery Facilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has recently spread worldwide was declared a pandemic on March 11.

Through online self-report questionnaires, we aimed to discover the psychological effects of the pandemic and its associated risk factors for developing mental health symptoms in young people. We disseminated a mental health survey through online social media, WeChat, and QQ in the five Chinese provinces with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the late stage of the country-wide lockdown. We used a self-made questionnaire that queried children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 on demographic information, psychological status, and other lifestyle and COVID-related variables. A total of 17,740 children and adolescents with valid survey data participated in the study. 10,022 (56.5%), 11,611 (65.5%), 10,697 (60.3%), 6868 (38.7%), and 6225 (35.1%) participants presented, respectively, more depressive, anxious, compulsive, inattentive, and sleep-related problems compared to before the outbreak of COVID-19. High school students reported a greater change in depression and anxiety than did middle school and primary school students. Despite the fact that very few children (0.1%) or their family members (0.1%) contracted the virus in this study, the psychological impact of the pandemic was clearly profound. Fathers anxiety appeared to have the strongest influence on a childrens psychological symptoms, explaining about 33% of variation in the childs overall symptoms. Other factors only explained less than 2% of the variance in symptoms once parents anxiety was accounted for. The spread of COVID-19 significantly influenced the psychological state of children and adolescents in participants view.

In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed 2-fold higher rate for hospitalization and greater than 2-fold higher rate for death as compared with White Americans. The disparity seen with COVID-19 is consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared with White Americans. Root cause contributions for the disparity overlap between COVID-19 and cancer. While cancer is a genetic disease that is influenced by tissue microenvironment, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. However, socioeconomic disadvantages, level of education, lifestyle factors, health comorbidities, and limited access to medical care appear to fuel underlying risk for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities. In addition to African Americans demonstrating higher risk of acquiring and dying from either disease, they are underrepresented in clinical trials involving cancer or COVID-19. Long-term disparities are present with survivorship from cancer and may be likely with survivorship from COVID-19; both have revealed untoward effects on postdiagnosis economic viability for African Americans. Collaborative strategies that include community engagement, diverse participation in cancer and COVID-19 clinical trials, providing insurance for affected persons who lost employment due to either disease, and supporting safety-net and public hospitals for health care access will be critical to stem these disparities.","output":"Similarities in Risk for COVID-19 and Cancer Disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"nsP3 is one of the four RNA replicase subunits encoded by alphaviruses.

Two deletion variants of nsP3 with either reduced or undetectable phosphorylation were studied in the context of virus infection.

Current practices surrounding post-operative care involve admission and routine esophagogram prior to discharge. This study aims to establish the safety and feasibility of same-day discharge following POEM. METHODS Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for patients who underwent POEM between November 2013 and June 2019 at a single institution in Ontario, Canada. Patients were discharged home on the same day with controlled pain, when tolerating clear fluids. Patients were admitted if clinically indicated. Esophagography was initially a systematic practice prior to discharge, but later only performed when clinically indicated. Emergency department visits and hospital admissions within 90 days were assessed. RESULTS In total, 90 patients underwent a successful POEM procedure. A total of 72 patients (79.1%) were discharged on the same day, 14 patients (15.4%) were discharged home the following day, and 5 patients (5.5%) experienced longer admissions to hospital. One POEM was unsuccessful. 22 (24.2%) patients had adverse events, leading to 8 (8.8%) unplanned admissions, with one patient requiring prolonged admission for esophageal leak, identified clinically. Fifty-three patients underwent routine esophagography while part of our protocol, with no identified leak, which prompted our change in practice to only perform esophagography when clinically indicated. In the 90-day post-procedure, ten patients visited the emergency department, of which seven were re-admitted, five for POEM-related issues. Our mean Eckhardt score at 2 weeks was 2.1 from 7.2 preoperatively. CONCLUSION This study establishes that same-day discharge is both safe and feasible following POEM and suggests that esophagography should be performed only when clinically indicated. This represents a shift from the routine practice of admission and imaging for patients undergoing POEM, encouraging the transition to outpatient POEM procedures.","output":"Same-day discharge is safe and feasible following POEM surgery for esophageal motility disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we develop a nonlinear ordinary differential equation to study the dynamics of syphilis transmission incorporating controls, namely prevention and treatment of the infected males and females.

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered. METHODS: We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials-one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)-and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5aa1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (22aa1010 viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever &#8805;378C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005). FINDINGS: Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24a422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17a178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 667% (95% CI 574-740), with 84 (10%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (29%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (09%) of 12a282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (11%) of 11a962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 760% (593-859). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 066 [95% CI 059-074]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 813% [95% CI 603-912] at &#8805;12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 551% [330-699] at <6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18-55 years (GMR 232 [201-268]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.

CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case of a 33-year-old woman with recurrent broad ligament LMS metastasizing to pancreas and thigh. Previously, she was diagnosed with broad ligament LMS and underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The disease-free interval was 2.5 years until metastases were found. Computerized tomography (CT) of abdomen and thighs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thighs and whole-body 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) performed, revealed pancreatic and thigh metastasis. Ultrasonography-guided biopsy and histological examinations confirmed LMS at both the sites. Pancreatic metastasis was completely resected first. Then the patient underwent surgical resection of thigh metastasis when both chemotherapy and radiotherapy failed. She recovered well and remained free of disease recurrence in the 2 years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Though imaging lacks specificity, it is a valuable asset in assessing the burden of disease and characterizing lesions while histological examination with immunohistochemistry is helpful for the diagnosis of LMS. Complete surgical resection of all metastatic sites where-ever feasible should be strongly considered in a treated case of broad ligament LMS with a durable disease-free interval.","output":"Recurrent broad ligament leiomyosarcoma with pancreatic and thigh metastasis: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents reflections over an internship module in the master programme Leadership, Ethics and Counselling at the Faculty of Theology, University of Oslo in the spring of 2020 This newly established master (2019) is equipping groups of students with different religions and worldviews for chaplaincy and leadership The religiously and culturally plural learning environment that the master is aiming for doesn't just foster understanding of cross-religious and cross-cultural situations and contexts It also has ambitions of shaping and altering the learning perspectives in professional chaplaincy training towards acknowledging the importance of co-formation, not just formation, in order to emphasize the meaning of relationships in learning processes and not merely the enhancement of individual knowledge and skill acquirement This article will reflect on the learning situation of an internship module during the spring of 2020 in the master programme mentioned above, when social C or rather physical C distancing suddenly was the rule among the population due to the covid-19 pandemic How does one teach and learn the skills necessary for generic chaplaincy, existential care and religiously-/worldview-based leadership while being confined to home?

This was associated with a case fatality rate decrease from 9.33% to 2.97%. No decrease was seen in Mexico, a similar Latin American country that did not introduce multi-drug treatment protocols at that time. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study was to use statistical process control to assess the likelihood that the decrease in case fatality rate in Honduras was due to chance, using Mexico as a control country. METHODS: Fourteen day running average COVID-19 case fatality rates in Honduras and Mexico were used to create Shewhart control charts during the first 6 months of the epidemic. The date of implementation in Honduras of the inpatient and outpatient multi-drug COVID-19 protocols were plotted on control charts, with a Mexican COVID-19 case fatality control chart for comparison. RESULTS: The case fatality rate for COVID-19 in Honduras dropped below the lower control limit 9 days after implementation of an inpatient and outpatient multi-drug therapeutic protocol, from an average 9.33% case fatality rate to 5.01%. The Honduran COVID-19 case fatality rate again dropped below the lower control limit to 2.97%, 17 days after launching a substantial government program to make the protocol medications accessible to underserved areas. Shewhart control chart plots of case fatality rates in Honduras suggest a plausible temporal association between the implementation dates of both the initial protocol implementation on May 3, 2020, and the outreach effort on June 10, 2020, and statistically significant control chart anomalies.

The influence of immunomodulating drugs on the course of COVID-19 is unknown. To gather knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with IRD, we established a registry shortly after the beginning of the pandemic in Germany. METHODS: Using an online questionnaire (www.COVID19-rheuma.de), a nationwide database was launched on 30 March 2020, with appropriate ethical and data protection approval to collect data of patients with IRD infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this registry, key clinical and epidemiological parametersfor example, diagnosis of IRD, antirheumatic therapies, comorbidities and course of the infectionare documented. RESULTS: Until 25 April 2020, data from 104 patients with IRD infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported (40 males; 63 females; 1 diverse). Most of them (45%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, 59% had one or more comorbidities and 42% were treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Hospitalisation was reported in 32% of the patients. Two-thirds of the patients already recovered. Unfortunately, 6 patients had a fatal course. CONCLUSIONS: In a short time, a national registry for SARS-CoV2-infected patients with IRD was established. Within 4 weeks, 104 cases were documented. The registry enables to generate data rapidly in this emerging situation and to gain a better understanding of the course of SARS-CoV2-infection in patients with IRD, with a distinct focus on their immunomodulatory therapies. This knowledge is valuable for timely information of physicians and patients with IRD, and shall also serve for the development of guidance for the management of patients with IRD during this pandemic.","output":"National registry for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Germany (ReCoVery): a valuable mean to gain rapid and reliable knowledge of the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with IRD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers are at a high risk of violence all over the world. The hostility toward nurses, physicians, and hospital staff has reached the point that it can be considered a public health problem. In this paper, we focus on the harassment, aggression, and violence that many healthcare workers have encountered while treating unstable psychiatric patients in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a case with a history of violence toward mental health workers, review psychopathological and clinical aspects, and discuss how both the COVID-19 pandemic and current challenges in psychiatric hospital settings increase the frequency and severity of these attacks and how this affects the team on inpatient psychiatric units. We used the CARE guidelines to provide the most accurate and transparent information about the patient and relevant psychosocial aspects. We also pooled more than 20 unique sources to cover all aspects of violent behaviors in all psychiatric settings for all age groups. We concluded that a lack of nursing staff, the mental burden imposed by difficult patients, and poor communication between team members are some of the factors contributing to patient violence. An incomplete understanding of the problem creates barriers to change on both personal and systematic levels. Constant violence and abuse against healthcare workers cause stress, decreased productivity, and work dissatisfaction. To improve the safety of healthcare professionals, especially in inpatient psychiatric settings, several system-based changes should be implemented.","output":"Inpatient violence in a psychiatric hospital in the middle of the pandemic: clinical and community health aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chagas disease remains a neglected tropical disease, causing significant burden in the Americas and countries that receive immigrants from endemic nations. Current pharmaceutical treatments are suboptimal, not only varying drastically in efficacy, depending on the stage of disease, but also presenting significant risk of adverse events. The objective of this review is to provide a timely update on the efficacy and safety of current trypanocidals. Eligible studies published from January 2015 to December 2020 were retrieved by one reviewer from six electronic databases. Ana-lysis was done with review management software and risk of bias was assessed using tools appropriate for the type of study (i.e., experimental or observational). Thirteen studies (10 observational and three RCTs) were included in the analysis. All 13 studies tested Benznidazole (BNZ) or Nifurtimox (NFX), and two studies also tested Posaconazole (POS) or E1224 (Ravucanazole). BNZ was found to be the most efficacious trypanocidal drug compared to Nifurtimox, POS, and E1224; it also resulted in the highest percentage of adverse effects (AEs) and treatment discontinuation due to its toxicity. Adults experienced higher frequency of neurological AEs while taking BNZ or NFX compared to children. Children had a higher frequency of general AEs compared to adults while taking BNZ. Overall, BNZ is still the most efficacious, but development of new, less toxic drugs is paramount for the quality of life of patients. Studies testing combination therapies and shorter regimens are needed, as is the devising of better clinical parameters and laboratory biomarkers to evaluate treatment efficacy. Considering the variability in methodology and reporting of the studies included in the present analysis, we offer some recommendations for the improvement and replicability of clinical studies investigating pharmacological treatment of Chagas disease. These include full disclosure of methodology, standardization of outcome measures, and always collecting and reporting data on both the efficacy of trypanocidals and on safety outcomes.","output":"A Rapid Review on the Efficacy and Safety of Pharmacological Treatments for Chagas Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has recently been reported to elicit the unfolded protein response (UPR) via activation of the PERK/eIF2 (RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2) pathway. This study attempted to examine which viral protein might be involved in inducing UPR and whether this cellular event would lead to apoptosis of the cells expressing the viral protein. By transient expression, we found that both replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins of PCV2 could induce ER stress as shown by increased phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2-ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4)-CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) axis. Cap expression, but not Rep, significantly reduced antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and increased caspase-3 cleavage, possibly due to increased expression of CHOP. Since knockdown of PERK by RNA interference clearly reduced Cap-induced CHOP expression, caspase-3 cleavage, and apoptotic cell death possibly by partially rescuing Bcl-2 expression, we propose that there is connection between Cap-induced UPR and apoptosis via the PERK/eIF2/ATF4/CHOP/Bcl-2 pathway.

Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 646 patients who were admitted between December 2020, and February 2021, during the third wave of COVID-19 in Korea. Ag-RDT and RT-PCR were routinely performed on all patients who required admission, and low-dose chest CT was performed on high-risk patients with associated symptoms. Any patients with high-risk COVID-19 infection according to the Ag-RDT test were quarantined alone in a negative pressured room, and those with low-risk COVID-19 infection remained in the preemptive quarantine room with or without negative pressure. The diagnostic values of the Ag-RDT test and associated cycle threshold (Ct) values of the RT-PCR test were subsequently evaluated. Results: In terms of the diagnostic value, the Ag-RDT for COVID-19 had a sensitivity of 68.3%, specificity of 99.5%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 90.3%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.9%.

STUDY DESIGN: This meta-research study is part of the German CEOsys project, www.covid-evidenz.de. We searched PROSPERO entries registered between 1 January 2020 and 31 August 2020, and we searched COVID-19 L-OVE for published SRs (search date: 5 May 2021) focusing on measures to prevent COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The two samples were screened for eligibility and key characteristics were extracted and summarised. RESULTS: Of 612 PROSPERO registrations, 47 focused on prevention and were included. The preventive measures included public health interventions (20), followed by personal protective equipment (10), vaccinations (9) and others (8). In total, 13 of 47 (28%) PROSPERO registrations had been published as full SR (as preprint only (6), as peer-reviewed article only (6), as preprint and peer-reviewed article (1)). Median time between PROSPERO registration and publication was 5 months for peer-reviewed SRs and 2 months for preprints. Of the 2182 entries identified in COVID-19 L-OVE, 51 published SRs focused on prevention and were included. Similar to the PROSPERO sample, most published SRs focused on public health interventions (21). The number of included primary studies ranged between 0 and 64 (median: 7). Nine published SRs did not include any studies because of a lack of primary studies.

An unsupervised machine learning model based on GANomaly and 2 baselines were trained to learn medication order patterns from 10 years of data. Clinical pharmacists dichotomously (typical or atypical) labeled orders and pharmacological profiles (patients' medication lists). Confusion matrices, areas under the precision-recall curve (AUPRs), and F1 scores were calculated. RESULTS A total of 12 471 medication orders and 1356 profiles were labeled by 25 pharmacists. Medication order predictions showed a precision of 35%, recall (sensitivity) of 26%, and specificity of 97% as compared with pharmacist labels, with an AUPR of 0.25 and an F1 score of 0.30. Profile predictions showed a precision of 49%, recall of 75%, and specificity of 82%, with an AUPR of 0.60, and an F1 score of 0.59. The model performed better than the baselines. According to the pharmacists, the model was a useful screening tool, and 9 of 15 participants preferred predictions by medication, rather than by profile. DISCUSSION Predictions for profiles had higher F1 scores and recall compared with medication order predictions. Although the performance was much better for profile predictions, pharmacists generally preferred medication order predictions.

However, they failed to capture higher-order feature information of all objects based on the X-ray images because the topology of the X-ray images dimensions does not always come with some spatially regular locality properties, which makes defining a spatial kernel filter in X-ray images non-trivial.

We included patients whose assigned treatment was completed and who had at least one ultrasound examination after treatment. Restenosis was defined as any narrowing of the treated artery measuring 50% or more (at least moderate) or 70% or more (severe), or occlusion of the artery. The degree of restenosis based on ultrasound velocities and clinical outcome events were adjudicated centrally; assessors were masked to treatment assignment. Restenosis was analysed using interval-censored models and its association with later ipsilateral stroke using Cox regression. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN25337470. This report presents a secondary analysis, and follow-up is complete. FINDINGS Between May, 2001, and October, 2008, 1713 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated treatment (855 were assigned stenting and 858 endarterectomy), of whom 1530 individuals were followed up with ultrasound (737 assigned stenting and 793 endarterectomy) for a median of 40 years (IQR 23-50). At least moderate restenosis (50%) occurred in 274 patients after stenting (cumulative 5-year risk 407%) and in 217 after endarterectomy (296%; unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 143, 95% CI 121-172; p<00001). Patients with at least moderate restenosis (50%) had a higher risk of ipsilateral stroke than did individuals without restenosis in the overall patient population (HR 318, 95% CI 152-667; p=0002) and in the endarterectomy group alone (575, 180-1833; p=0003), but no significant increase in stroke risk after restenosis was recorded in the stenting group (203, 077-537; p=0154; p=010 for interaction with treatment). No difference was noted in the risk of severe restenosis (70%) or subsequent stroke between the two treatment groups. INTERPRETATION At least moderate (50%) restenosis occurred more frequently after stenting than after endarterectomy and increased the risk for ipsilateral stroke in the overall population. Whether the restenosis-mediated risk of stroke differs between stenting and endarterectomy requires further research.

We use only reported deaths in the two weeks after the first death to determine infection parameters, in order to make predictions of hidden variables such as the time dependence of the number of infections. Early deaths are sporadic and discrete so the use of network models of epidemic spread is imperative, with the network itself a crucial random variable. Location-specific population age distributions and population densities must be taken into account when attempting to fit these events with parametrized models. These characteristics render naive Bayesian model comparison impractical as the networks have to be large enough to avoid finite-size effects. We reformulated this problem as the statistical physics of independent location-specific \`balls' attached to every model in a six-dimensional lattice of 56448 parametrized models by elastic springs, with model-specific \`spring constants' determined by the stochasticity of network epidemic simulations for that model. The distribution of balls then determines all Bayes posterior expectations. Important characteristics of the contagion are determinable: the fraction of infected patients that die ($0.017\\\\pm 0.009$), the expected period an infected person is contagious ($22 \\\\pm 6$ days) and the expected time between the first infection and the first death ($25 \\\\pm 8$ days) in the US. The rate of exponential increase in the number of infected individuals is $0.18\\\\pm 0.03$ per day, corresponding to 65 million infected individuals in one hundred days from a single initial infection, which fell to 166000 with even imperfect social distancing effectuated two weeks after the first recorded death.

Owing to the lack of efficient vaccines, antiviral therapy and emerging resistance strains, many viruses are considered as a potential threat to public health. Therefore, researches have been developed to identify new drug candidates for future treatments. Among them, antiviral research based on natural molecules is a promising approach. Phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s) isolated from snake venom have shown significant antiviral activity against some viruses such as Dengue virus, Human Immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis C virus and Yellow fever virus, and have emerged as an attractive alternative strategy for the development of novel antiviral therapy. Thus, this review provides an overview of remarkable findings involving PLA(2)s from snake venom that possess antiviral activity, and discusses the mechanisms of action mediated by PLA(2)s against different stages of virus replication cycle. Additionally, molecular docking simulations were performed by interacting between phospholipids from Dengue virus envelope and PLA(2)s from Bothrops asper snake venom.

Those with greater perceived or actual life stress are vulnerable to develop or reinstate problematic behaviours characterised by addiction and compulsive mechanisms. Thus, we assessed how the COVID-19 pandemic and isolation measures affected alcohol consumption and internet use in the general population.MethodsWe developed an online international survey, entitled Habit Tracker (HabiT), completed by 1,346 adults (18 years), which measured changes in amount and severity of alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test;AUDIT),online gaming (Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form;IGDS9-SF), and pornography viewing (Cyber Pornography Addiction Test;CYPAT) before (post-hoc recall)and during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown. These measures were related to ten COVID-19-specific stress factors. Lastly, we assessed psychiatric factors widely recognized to be associated with problematic alcohol and internet use such as anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;HADS), and impulsivity (Short Impulsive-Behavior Scale;SUPPS-P).ResultsOf the sample, we observed an overall increase in online gaming and a decrease alcohol consumption and pornography viewing. Those who increased their amount and severity of alcohol use (36%) during lockdown reported stress associated with the pandemic itself, such as being an essential worker directly caring for those with or having a loved one become severely ill from COVID-19. Further, those residing in the United Kingdom- as opposed the United States or Canada- increased their weekly amount of alcohol consumption. Alternatively, those who increased online gaming (64%) and pornography viewing (43%)reported low frequency or poor quality social interactions resultant of lockdown measures. All three groups displayed higher levels of depression, anxiety, and urgency impulsivity.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the theoretical mechanism of negative emotionality underlying forms of compulsive behaviour driven by stress, depression, and anxiety;while highlighting distinct avenues by which these behaviours can manifest. Limitations include subjects being within varying phases of lockdown during the time of testing and a large degree of study dropout (n=1,515). We emphasise the relevance of identifying those in need of greater support services to mitigate negative health outcomes associated with problematic alcohol consumption and internet usage in the context of COVID-19 isolation.","output":"#3123 Assessing international alcohol and internet use patterns during COVID-19 isolation using an online survey: highlighting distinct stressors conferring risk to compulsive behaviours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne's disease, which is an economically and clinically relevant pathogen for commercial deer production. The purpose of this study was to develop a method that could be used to rapidly detect MAP infection in deer using the Actiphage Rapid blood test. This test has previously been used to detect MAP in cattle blood following the purification of buffy coat using Ficoll gradients, however this method is quite laborious and costly. The purpose of this study was to develop a simpler method of blood preparation that was also compatible with deer blood and the Actiphage test. Initially differential lysis of RBCs using Ammonium Chloride-Potassium (ACK) blood lysis buffer was compared with the Ficoll gradient centrifugation method using cattle blood samples for compatibility with the Actiphage reagents, and it was found that the simpler ACK method did not have an impact on the Actiphage test reagents, producing an equivalent sensitivity for detection of low levels of MAP. When the two methods were compared using clinical blood samples from farmed deer, the ACK lysis method resulted in a cleaner sample. When a blinded test of 132 animals from 4 different production groups was carried out, the majority of the positive test results were found to be from animals in just one group, with a small number identified in a second group. The test results were found to be reproducible when a small set of positive animals were tested again 1 month after their initial testing. Finally a set of negative animals which had been previously screened using an ELISA test, all animals gave a negative Actiphage result. This study shows that this improved sample preparation method and Actiphage blood testing can be used to test blood samples from deer, and the full diagnostic potential of the method can now be evaluated.","output":"Development of a Method to Detect Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in the Blood of Farmed Deer Using Actiphage?

The proliferation of prostate cancer cells is testosterone-driven, but clonal selection during androgen deprivation therapy promotes the development of androgen-independent (hormone-refractory) cells, which become phenotypically dominant. Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is capable of activating the androgen receptor pathway, even in the absence of the ligand. The detection of phenotypic changes associated with the development of androgen independence may influence patient management, suggesting the initiation of a second-line therapy. This study aimed to establish the level of HER2 expression in a number of prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3 and DU145) in order that they be used as models in further studies, and to evaluate the binding and cellular processing of [(111)In]-labeled trastuzumab and the anti-HER2 synthetic Affibody molecule ABY-025 in these cell lines. The expression of HER2 was demonstrated and quantified in all three tested prostate cancer cell-lines. Studies on cellular processing demonstrated that internalization of both conjugates increased continuously during the whole incubation. The internalization rate was approximately equal for both monoclonal antibodies and Affibody molecules. In both cases, internalization was moderately rapid. Such features would definitely favor the use of radiometal labels for trastuzumab and, most likely, for affibody molecules. The level of HER2 expression in these cell lines is sufficient for in vivo molecular imaging.","output":"Imaging agents for in vivo molecular profiling of disseminated prostate cancer: Cellular processing of [(111)In]-labeled CHX-ADTPA-trastuzumab and anti-HER2 ABY-025 Affibody in prostate cancer cell lines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The study of biological materials under a microscope is known as histology, which is one of the most challenging subjects for students.

So far, due to a scarcity of data and methodological shortcomings, these efforts have lacked the system-level view of treating sidewalks as a network. Here, we leverage sidewalk data from ten cities in three continents, to first analyse the distribution of sidewalk and roadbed geometries, and find that cities present an unbalanced distribution of public space, favouring automobiles at the expense of pedestrians. Next, we connect these geometries to build a sidewalk network Cadjacent, but irreducible to the road network. Finally, we compare a no-intervention scenario with a shared-effort heuristic, in relation to the performance of sidewalk infrastructures to guarantee physical distancing. The heuristic prevents the sidewalk connectivity breakdown, while preserving the road network's functionality. While public space is traditionally shared by pedestrian and cars, the distancing measures imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic have underlined the need for wider pedestrian spaces. Here, the authors take a complex network approach to analyze sidewalk data from cities across the world to evidence a strong unbalance in the space distribution between cars and pedestrian, and propose a strategy to improve urban walkability within a socially distancing context and without compromising road traffic.

Herein, the synthesis of novel isatin derivatives has been reported. The cytotoxic activities of the compounds were determined using cancer cell (MCF-7) and normal cell (MCF-10A and MRC-5) lines. In silico molecular docking experiments were conducted using AutoDock Vina. We have successfully predicted the binding energies and the number of hydrogen bonds present. We have also identified the residues involved in hydrogen bond formation. The target compounds were synthesized using Schiff base following cyclization and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. We have focused on the recyclable synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using the extracts obtained from Dipteryx odorata. The extracts were used to reduce silver ions for the production of AgNPs. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited excellent catalytic activities during the synthesis of isatin derivatives in ethanol. The formation of the target isatin derivatives has been confirmed using the Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis techniques. Compound 3e was found to be the most active compound when tested against the MCF-7 cancer cell line (I C 50 = 20.5  M). The activity was comparable to the activities of standard doxorubicin and other compounds. In silico molecular docking experiments were conducted to study the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LU7). Compound 3c exhibited high binding ability (?9.4 kcal/mol). The inhibition ability was studied using hydroxychloroquine as a standard. Results from docking studies revealed that the inhibition ability of compound 3c was higher than the inhibition abilities exhibited by other compounds.

The liver frailty index (LFI), composed of grip strength, chair stand and balance testing, is an accepted predictor of morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis. With the need for COVID-19 related social distancing, many appointments are being carried out virtually. The chair stand subcomponent of the LFI has the potential to be evaluated virtually, with a high reliability as compared to in-person testing noted in other disease populations. AIMS: To determine if the chair stand test is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: 822 adult patients with cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled from five centers (3 in Canada, 1 in the United States, and 1 in India). Inclusion criteria included adult patients with cirrhosis. 787 of these patients completed a chair stand test at baseline, measured as the time (seconds) a patient takes to rise from sitting with their arms folded across their chest five times (measured in-person). The times were divided into 3 categories: >15 seconds, between 10 and 15 seconds, and <10 seconds. Patients who could not complete 5 chair stands were classified in the >15 seconds category. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome was unplanned all-cause hospital admission. Fine-Gray proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the association between the chair stand time and the outcomes. We adjusted for baseline age, sex, and MELD score and accounted for liver transplantation as a competing risk. Cumulative incidence functions were used to create a graphical representation of the survival analysis. RESULTS: Patients were divided into three groups: group 1, <10 seconds (n = 276); group 2, 10C15 seconds (n = 290); and group 3, >15 seconds (n = 221). Mortality was increased in group 3 in comparison to group 1 (HR 3.21, 95% CI: 2.16C4.78, p<0.001). Similarly, the hazard of non-elective hospitalizations was higher in group 3 in comparison to group 1 (HR 2.24, 95% CI: 1.73C2.91, p<0.001). Overall, patients with chair stand times greater than 15 seconds had increased all-cause mortality (HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.01C3.83, p<0.001) and non-elective hospitalizations (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.48C2.29, p<0.001) when compared to patients with times less than 15 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: A time to complete 5 chair stands of >15 seconds predicts morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. This test shows promise as a frailty measure that could be evaluated over a virtual platform.

The factors, according to midwives, that affect EBF, with regard to the healthcare system, are related to training of healthcare professionals in breastfeeding and their support to women during pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care. Regarding public policies, midwives believe the maternity leave periods in Spain, together with a lack of laws and social policies to protect EBF are detrimental.

After the initial coronavirus surge in New York City, a 68-year-old man developed progressive lower extremity weakness and a defined sensory level at the lower abdomen. He had highly elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies despite an absence of preceding COVID-19 symptoms. Serial electrodiagnostic testing revealed absent lower extremity late responses, with otherwise normal distal sensorimotor conductions. Electromyography revealed active neurogenic changes and reduced motor unit recruitment in the L3-L4 myotomes. Treatment with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin was followed by minimal clinical improvement but re-emergence of the lower extremity late responses on electrodiagnostic testing. We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of suspected COVID-19-associated Elsberg syndrome, which expands the spectrum of neuromuscular manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and sheds light on ways to approach diagnostic and treatment options for these patients.","output":"A Case of Elsberg Syndrome in the Setting of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many examples of research excellence in Africa have been driven by partnerships led by the global North and have involved localised infrastructure improvements to support the best of international research practice. OBJECTIVE: In this article, we explore a possible mechanism by which local research networks, appropriately governed, could begin to support national African research programmes by allying research delivery to clinical service. SUMMARY: This article explores the concept that sustainable research effort needs a well-trained and mentored workforce, working to common standards, but which is practically supported by a much developed information technology (IT) infrastructure throughout the continent. CONCLUSIONS: The balance of investment and ownership of such a research programme needs to be shared between local and international funding, with the emphasis on developing global SouthCSouth collaborations and research strategies which address the environmental impact of medical research activity and mitigate the impact of climate change on African populations.

Furthermore, little is known regarding its impact on the health of young adults with chronic pain. We conducted a longitudinal study to compare pain, psychological functioning, and substance use before and during the pandemic of 196 young adults with chronic pain. Participants aged 18 to 24 years (M = 21.1 years; 79.6% females) reported on pain, anxiety, depression, and substance use before (October 2018-August 2019) and during the pandemic (October 2020-November 2020), in addition to the assessment of COVID-19 exposure and its impact. Before the pandemic, young adults experienced mild-to-moderate pain intensity (M = 3.75, SD = 2.33) and pain interference (M = 3.44, SD = 2.69). Findings were that pain intensity, pain interference, and depression symptoms remained stable during the pandemic. In contrast, anxiety symptoms increased significantly (M = 8.21, SD = 5.84 vs M = 8.89, SD = 5.95, P = 0.04). Tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use were unchanged. Mixed linear models revealed that COVID-19 exposure and impact were not associated with changes in pain intensity or interference, with female sex associated with increased pain intensity (? = 0.86, P = 0.02) and pain interference (? = 0.87, P = 0.02). Our findings indicated relative stability of pain symptoms experienced by young adults with chronic pain.

As a result of the pandemic, many older adults are now experiencing an increased and unprecedented amount of psychological stress. Physical activity has been found to be an evidence-based means of combating stress among older adults to promote their quality of life. Studies have demonstrated that those who are physically active experience fewer issues in regard to their mental health, specifically depression and anxiety disorders. Engagement in physical activity may exert a protective influence over stress inducing events and future mental health outcomes. Due to exercise being inexpensive, non-invasive, and effective even via incremental increases in activity level, physical activity interventions should be investigated as a therapy for reducing stress for older adults during the current pandemic. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and SportDiscus) will be searched to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity or exercise programs as a psychological stress management tool in adults 50 years of age or older. Only peer-reviewed and published journal articles will be reviewed. Post-intervention psychological stress measures in comparison to baseline stress will be the primary outcome of interest. All studies will be assessed for bias using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. A random effects meta-analysis will be investigated if sufficient evidence of homogenous research exists and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be tabulated. DISCUSSION: This review will determine the effectiveness of various physical activity interventions for the treatment of psychological stress among the older adult population. This knowledge will help inform care aides, clinicians, family members, and older adults themselves of the most effective physical activity interventions in dealing with stress which is relevant to the ongoing pandemic.

The gene coding for the 7nAChR, CHRNA7, can be partially duplicated, that is, CHRFAM7A, which is reported to impair the anti-inflammatory effect mediated via the 7nAChR. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described in both CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, however, the functional role of these SNPs for immune responses remains to be investigated. In the current study, we set out to investigate whether genetic variants of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A can influence immune responses. By investigating data available from the Swedish SciLifeLab SCAPIS Wellness Profiling (S3WP) study, in combination with droplet digital PCR and freshly isolated PBMCs from the S3WP participants, challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we show that CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A are expressed in human PBMCs, with approximately four times higher expression of CHRFAM7A compared with CHRNA7. One SNP in CHRFAM7A, rs34007223, is positively associated with hsCRP in healthy individuals. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO)-terms analysis of plasma proteins associated with gene expression of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A demonstrated an involvement for these genes in immune responses. This was further supported by in vitro data showing that several SNPs in both CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A are significantly associated with cytokine response. In conclusion, genetic variants of CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A alters cytokine responses. Furthermore, given that CHRFAM7A SNP rs34007223 is associated with inflammatory marker hsCRP in healthy individuals suggests that CHRFAM7A may have a more pronounced role in regulating inflammatory processes in humans than previously been recognized.","output":"Polymorphisms in alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene, CHRNA7, and its partially duplicated gene, CHRFAM7A, associate with increased inflammatory response in human peripheral mononuclear cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In this narrative review, we address the COVID-19 pandemic misCdis information crisis in which healthcare systems have been pushed to their limits, with collapses occurring worldwide. The context of uncertainty has resulted in skepticism, confusion, and general malaise among the population. Informing the public has been one of the major challenges during this pandemic. Misinformation is defined as false information shared by people who have no intention of misleading others. Disinformation is defined as false information deliberately created and disseminated with malicious intentions. Objective: To reach a consensus and critical review about misCdis information in COVID-19 crisis. Methods: A database search was conducted in PsychINFO, MedLine (Pubmed), Cochrane (Wiley), Embase and CinAhl. Databases used the MeSH-compliant keywords of COVID-19, 2019-nCoV, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2, misinformation, disinformation, information, vaccines, vaccination, origin, target, spread, communication. Results: Both misinformation and disinformation can affect the populations confidence in vaccines (development, safety, and efficacy of vaccines, as well as denial of the severity of SARS-CoV infection). Institutions should take into account that a great part of the success of the intervention to combat a pandemic has a relationship with the power to stop the misinformation and disinformation processes.

The Box-Behnken design was employed to optimize the HD and UAPE procedures. Moreover, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electronic nose (E-nose) were applied to identify the discrepancy of the extraction methods. The yield of EO extracted by UAPE (114.02 mg/g) was significantly higher than that by HD (85.67 mg/g) (p < 0.01) undergoing 40 min short time-consuming UPAE. A total of 28 compounds were extracted from the TC peels as terpenes were the predominant components. d-Limonene was the most vital compound in the T. citrus essential oil (TCEO), accounting for 86.38% of the total volatile concentration in HD and 86.75% in UAPE, respectively, followed by -pinene, sabinene, ?3-myrcene, and ?-phellandrene.

COVID-19 presents manifestations that can range from asymptomatic or mild infections up to severe manifestations that lead to hospitalization and death. A growing amount of evidence indicates that the virus may cause neuroinvasion. Postmortem brain study findings have included edema, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, atrophy, encephalitis, infarcts, swollen axons, myelin loss, gliosis, neuronal satellitosis, hypoxic-ischemic damage, arteriolosclerosis, leptomeningeal inflammation, neuronal loss, and axon degeneration. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing dangerous effects on the mental health of the world population, some of which can be attributed to its social impact (social distancing, financial issues, and quarantine). There is also a concern that environmental stressors, enhanced by psychological factors, are contributing to the emergence of psychiatric outcomes during the pandemic.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on activity at the cardiothoracic surgical care at the National Cardiothoracic Surgery and Transplant Centre. METHODS: A comparison was performed of cardiac surgery and transplant caseload for the first 4 months of 2019 and 2020 using data collected prospectively on a customised digital database. RESULTS: Cardiac surgery activity fell over the study period but was most impacted in March and April 2020. Operative activity fell to 49% of the previous years' activity for March and April 2020. Surgical acuity changed with 61% of all cases performed as inpatient transfers after cardiology admission in contrast with a 40% rate in 2019. Valve surgery continued at 89% of the expected rate; coronary artery bypass surgery was performed at 61% of the expected rate and major aortic surgery at 22%. Adult congenital heart cases were not performed in March or April 2020. One heart and one lung transplant were performed in this period.

Despite tremendous efforts and resources spent worldwide trying to explore antiviral drugs, there is still no effective clinical treatment for COVID-19 to date. Approximately 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, and patients with severe pneumonia may die from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis from SARS-CoV-2 infection further leads to ARDS, often resulting in irreversible impairment of lung function. If the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily causes an immune response or immune cell infiltration can be identified, it may be possible to mitigate excessive immune responses by modulating the infiltration and activation of specific targets, thereby reducing or preventing severe lung damage. However, the extent to which immune cell subsets are significantly altered in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients remains to be elucidated. This study applied the CIBERSORT-X method to comprehensively evaluate the transcriptional estimated immune infiltration landscape in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients and further compare it with the lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We found a variety of immune cell subtypes in the COVID-19 group, especially na?ve B cells were highly infiltrated. Comparison of functional transcriptomic analyses revealed that non-differentiated na?ve B cells may be the main cause of the over-active humoral immune response. Using several publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to validate the genetic differences in B-cell populations, it was found that the B-cells collected from COVID-19 patients were inclined towards na?ve B-cells, whereas those collected from IPF patients were inclined towards memory B-cells. Further differentiation of B cells between COVID-19 mild and severe patients showed that B cells from severe patients tended to be antibody-secreting cells, and gene expression showed that B cells from severe patients were similar to DN2 B cells that trigger extrafollicular response. Moreover, a higher percentage of B-cell infiltration seems associated with poorer clinical outcome. Finally, a comparison of several specific COVID-19 cases treated with targeted B-cell therapy suggests that appropriate suppression of na?ve B cells might potentially be a novel strategy to alleviate the severe symptoms of COVID-19.","output":"In silico immune infiltration profiling combined with functional enrichment analysis reveals a potential role for na?ve B cells as a trigger for severe immune responses in the lungs of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this manuscript, a qualitative analysis of the mathematical model of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) involving anew devised fractal-fractional operator in the Caputo sense having the fractional-order q and the fractal dimension p is considered The concerned model is composed of eight compartments: susceptible, exposed, infected, super-spreaders, asymptomatic, hospitalized, recovery and fatality Under the new derivative the existence and uniqueness of the solution for considered model are proved using Schaefers and Banach type fixed point approaches Additionally, with the help of nonlinear functional analysis, the condition for Ulams type of stability of the solution to the considered model is established For numerical simulation of proposed model, a fractional type of two-step Lagrange polynomial known as fractional Adams-Bashforth (AB) method is applied to simulate the results At last, the results are tested with real data from COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China from 4 January to 9 March 2020, taken from a source [42] The Numerical results are presented in terms of graphs for different fractional-order q and fractal dimensions p to describe the transmission dynamics of disease infection","output":"Qualitative Analysis of Fractal-Fractional order COVID-19 Mathematical Model with Case Study of Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates factors influencing veterinarians' antibiotic prescribing behaviors and their understanding of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

LIM and SH3 Protein 1 (LASP1) is a unique actin-binding protein that is expressed in a wide range of cells including neurons, but its roles in cellular motility and neuronal development are not well understood. We report that LASP1 is expressed in rat hippocampus early in development, and this expression is maintained through adulthood. High-resolution imaging reveals that LASP1 is selectively concentrated at the leading edge of lamellipodia in migrating cells and axonal growth cones. This local enrichment of LASP1 is dynamically associated with the protrusive activity of lamellipodia, depends on the barbed ends of actin filaments, and requires both the LIM domain and nebulin repeats of LASP1. Knockdown of LASP1 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons results in a substantial reduction in axonal outgrowth and arborization. Finally, loss of the Drosophila homolog Lasp from a subset of commissural neurons in the developing ventral nerve cord produces defasciculated axon bundles that do not reach their targets. Together, our data support a novel role for LASP1 in actin-based lamellipodial protrusion and establish LASP1 as a positive regulator of both in vitro and in vivo axon development.

RESULTS: In healthy population, BOT-8 mean scores for detection was 100%, memory/recognition was 94.5% (SD=1.07), and identification was 89.6% (SD=0.86). In OD patients was 86% (SD=32.8), 73.2% (SD=37.9) and 77.1% (SD=34.2), respectively. BOT-8 demonstrated good test-retest reliability with a 96.7% of observed agreement and a quadratic kappa of 0.84 (p<0.001).

Herein, we report a strategy to alleviate isothiazolone toxicity and improve antibacterial and antibiofilm potency by functionalization with a nitroxide moiety. Isothiazolone-nitroxide hybrids 6 and 22 were prepared over three steps in moderate yields (58 and 36%, respectively) from (Z)-3-(benzylsulfanyl)-propenoic acid. Hybrid 22 displayed better activity (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 35 M) than the widely used methylisothiazolinone (MIT 1, MIC = 280 M) against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Hybrid 22 was even more active against drug-resistant strains, such as vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA, MIC = 8.75 M) over MIT 1 (MIC = 280 M). The enhanced antibacterial activity of hybrid 22 over MIT 1 was retained against established MSSA and VRSA biofilms, with minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) values of 35 and 70 M, respectively, for 22 (the MBEC value for MIT 1 against both strains was 280 M).

A significant number of such displacements occur in regions with considerably higher areas of TB burden. Displacements may delay TB diagnosis and treatment, which will possibly lead to TB transmission among healthy individuals. In this study, we assessed the association of existing determinants after a protracted internal displacement of people with delay in TB diagnosis and treatment outcomes. A cross-sectional study was conducted on internally displaced TB patients (IDPs), registered at selected health facilities in three urban districts of Pakistan from March 2019 to February 2020. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the delay in diagnosis and treatment outcomes. IDPs with delay in initiation of treatment beyond 30 days were at high possibility of unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes (adjusted odds ratio AOR, 2.60; 95% CI 1.06C6.40). Furthermore, the multivariate regression analysis showed a statistically significant association (p > 0.05) between TB patients who were aged 55 to 65 years (AOR, 2.66; 95% CI 1.00C7.07), female patients (AOR, 2.42; 95% CI 1.21C4.81), visited non-formal health provider (AOR, 8.81; 95% CI 3.99C19.46), self-medication (AOR, 2.72; 95 % CI 1.37C5.37), poor knowledge of TB (AOR, 11.39; 95% CI 3.31C39.1), and perceived stigma (AOR, 8.81; 95% CI 3.99C19.4). Prolonged delay in treatment was associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes among IDPs. Migrants and IDPs are more likely to experience an interruption in care due to overall exclusion from social and health care services.

DIssA is a naturally occurring self-replicating DI RNA with nearly intact genes 1 and 7. DIssA interferes with most MHV-JHM-specific RNA synthesis, except for synthesis of mRNA 7, which encodes N protein; mRNA 7 synthesis is not inhibited by DIssA. Coinfection of MHV-JHM containing DIssA DI particles and an MHV-A59 RNA- temperature-sensitive mutant followed by subsequent passage of virus at the permissive temperature resulted in elimination of most of the MHV-JHM helper virus. Analysis of intracellular RNAs at the nonpermissive temperature demonstrated efficient synthesis of DIssA and mRNA 7 but not of the helper virus mRNAs. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis demonstrated that the structure of mRNA 7 was MHV-JHM specific and therefore must have been synthesized from the DIssA template RNA. Sequence analysis revealed that DIssA lacks a slightly heterogeneous sequence, which is found in wild-type MHV from the 3' one-third of gene 2-1 to the 3' end of gene 6. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of intracellular RNA species and virus-specific protein analysis confirmed the sequence data. Replication and transcription of another MHV DI RNA were supported in DIssA-replicating cells. Because the products of genes 2 and 2-1 are not essential for MHV replication, we concluded that expression of gene 1 proteins and N protein was sufficient for MHV RNA replication and transcription.","output":"Two murine coronavirus genes suffice for viral RNA synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against B. bovis and B. bigemina in calvesfrom the region of Araguana, State of Tocantins, Brazil.

An abrupt ending of lockdown can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore, carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.","output":"Modelling the role of media induced fear conditioning in mitigating post-lockdown COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives on India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic demanded a quick shift from presential to e-learning processes.

We used the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory score which assesses the different dimensions of burnout (personal (CBIP), professional (CBIPro), relational (CBIR)). Several questions evaluating impact on residents health and apprehension of the future were included. The survey lasted for 5 days. Comparison of parameters before and during the coronavirus crisis was made using paired samples t-test or Chi(2) test were.

It is unclear how the current COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in study conditions due to federal regulations affected mental well-being in the German student population. We examined university students' perceptions of study conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated associations between study conditions and depressive symptoms. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Germany in May 2020 at four universities (N = 5,021, 69% female, mean age: 24 years, SD: 5.1). Perceived study conditions, as well as sociodemographic information, were assessed with self-generated items and the CES-D 8 scale was used to determine depressive symptoms. Associations between perceived study conditions (academic stress and academic satisfaction), in general, and confidence to complete the semester, in particular, and depressive symptoms were analyzed using generalized linear regressions. Results: Fifty-four percent of survey participants felt that the university workload had significantly increased since the COVID-19 pandemic; 48% were worried that they would not be able to successfully complete the academic year; 47% agreed that the change in teaching methods caused significant stress. Regarding depressive symptoms, the mean score of the CES-D 8 scale was 9.25. Further, a positive association between perceived study conditions and depressive symptoms was found (p < 0.001), indicating that better study conditions were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Results of the generalized linear regression suggest that better student mental well-being was related to higher confidence in completing the semester.

The role of skeletal muscle mass in modulating immune response is well documented. Whilst obesity is well established as a key factor in COVID\\\\19 and outcome, no study has examined the influence of both sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and obesity, termed sarcopenic obesity on the risk of severe COVID\\\\19. METHODS: This study uses data from UK Biobank. Probable sarcopenia was defined as low handgrip strength. Sarcopenic obesity was mutually exclusively defined as the presence of obesity and low muscle mass [based on two established criteria: appendicular lean mass (ALM) adjusted for either (i) height or (ii) body mass index]. Severe COVID\\\\19 was defined by a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test result in a hospital setting and/or death with a primary cause reported as COVID\\\\19. Fully adjusted logistic regression models were used to analyse the associations between sarcopenic status and severe COVID\\\\19. This work was conducted under UK Biobank Application Number 52553. RESULTS: We analysed data from 490 301 UK Biobank participants (median age 70.0 years, 46% male); 2203 (0.4%) had severe COVID\\\\19. Individuals with probable sarcopenia were 64% more likely to have had severe COVID\\\\19 (odds ratio 1.638; P < 0.001). Obesity increased the likelihood of severe COVID\\\\19 by 76% (P < 0.001). Using either ALM index or ALM/body mass index to define low muscle mass, those with sarcopenic obesity were 2.6 times more likely to have severe COVID\\\\19 (odds ratio 2.619; P < 0.001). Sarcopenia alone did not increase the risk of COVID\\\\19. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenic obesity may increase the risk of severe COVID\\\\19, over that of obesity alone.

organizations such as hospitals, and they increases safety and improves the efficiency of hospitals and the community (environment) Because health and safety factors are closely related to ergonomic factors (E), attention to this factor has led to the evolution of HSE and the emergence of HSEE Much research has been done on HSE management, related evaluations, and other related issues However, due to the novelty of HSEE, such models have rarely been researched in HSEE In addition, in previous models, the weight of all factors was considered the same, and the evaluations were practically turned into checklists While in any organization or in any situation, the importance of observing some factors may be more or less than others, and at the same time the ergonomic factor should be considered in this model The purpose of this study is to provide a quantitative model for measuring the performance of organizational units based on the observance of the usual HSE criteria and consider the ergonomic factor (HSEE) Numerous studies have shown that ergonomics play a major role in increasing human performance in all areas Developing such a model can lead to more accurate information to managers and their better decision-making in order to reduce harm in the organization as well as organization environment It will also provide more accurate feedback to the organization's units for self-assessment and calculation of any points for them, and ultimately ranking the units Research Method: Since the result of this research is a model that can be used in practice by organizations (especially hospitals), this research is an applied research It is also a descriptive study because it explores the current situation and tries to describe and clarify it and present the result in the form of a quantitative model Finally, because the data in this study is collected through a questionnaire, it is a survey study In the first phase, studies related to the HSE and HSEE models were reviewed In each model, the main variables (health, safety, environment and ergonomics) were collected along with the following variables for each Then, by combining them into one large model, all variables entered the model and overlaps were eliminated Because this model is made for a hospital, the variables were redefined based on the characteristics of the hospital and the model was modified Finally, a model including the main variables of safety, health, environment and ergonomics and 12 sub-variables were designed and a research questionnaire was developed To calculate the reliability of this questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha method with 11 samples were used This sample was selected by emphasizing on people's familiarity with HSE and HSEE models The alpha value was calculated to be greater than 0 8 and the reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed In order to discover the relationship between the 4 main factors and 12 sub-factors, the DEMATEL method with 8 samples was used DEMATEL's method is a well-known method used to the models with independent variables Using the initial classification of factors as well as HSE(E), the decision tree

used to discover the weight of criteria simultaneously with ranking alternatives Because each of the ANP and DEMATEL questionnaires requires a lot of patience and concentration, the YungLan method was used to combine DEMATEL and ANP In this method, the data collection is required only once by he questionnaire and this data is reused in both models At this stage, the weight of 12 factors was calculated and the research model was completely architectural The designed model was implemented in ArabNia Hospital in Qom The goal is to determine how well each of the eight units in the hospital complies with HSEE ArabNia Hospital is the first hospital in Iran, Qom, where patients with COVID-19 were quarantined in February 2020 Because there was no information on how well each of the HSEE components were observed in the hospital, a simple questionnaire using the Likert's spectrum was designed to collect this information This questionnaire was published in a total of 8 units and 11 questionnaires were completed This data was entered into the model as input, and after analysis, hospital units were ranked based on compliance with safety, health, environmental and ergonomic criteria Results: The most important achievement of this research is a quantitative model including 4 areas of safety, health, environment and ergonomics with 12 sub-variables The results showed a correlation between the main domains as well as the research variables Identifying these connections revealed that the decision hierarchy is network type and the model governing the problem is ANP type However, in some research the AHP model was used for this purpose The premise of this model is that the variables are sufficiently independent of each other, which was rejected in this study The results of using this model in the study area also showed that ergonomic factor has the greatest impact on other macro factors, and employee factor has the greatest impact on other 11 sub-variables of research This model was used to evaluate all 8 units of the hospital The goal is to determine how well each of these units complies with HSEE If there is data related to the observance of each sub-variable by each unit in the hospital documents, the relevant data can be entered into the model and after analysis, the amount of HSEE observance by each unit can be determined Because many cases are not recorded in organizations, access to the necessary data is not possible through the hospital's databases Since the organization's staff are the only ones who have a lot of data and metadata in their mental history (albeit to some extent, vague and erroneous), a questionnaire was used to solve this problem For ease of response, the Likert range was used in qualitative measurements This questionnaire was distributed in 8 units and 11 questionnaires were completed and received The required data were analyzed by the research model and 8 hospital units were ranked based on HSEE compliance The results showed that, firstly, the weight of each of the 12 factors of the HSEE model is not the same, and secondly, there is a relationship between them, and finally, the ranking of the units is not the same Conclusion: The results proved the power of model differentiation Using the results obtained in this study, the extent to each components of the HSEE model is affected and differ from each other The use of the model in ArabNia Hospital in Qom showed that the medical, financial and administrative equipment units are ranked first to third in the field of HSEE, respectively With the development of the HSEE measurement model, including the determination of indicators, sub-indicators, their relationship and the weight of each of them, it was found that the weight of the employee invoice is higher than other sub-factors This study provides a framework for measuring hospital performance in terms of HSEE compliance This model can be used in other hospitals as well The point to keep in mind is that it is necessary to recalculate the weight of the variables and sub-variables, which is very simple This model can also be used in other organizations Provided that all sub-variables are redefined in accordance with the same organization and replaced in the model It should be noted that the main foundation and architecture of the model is fixed, but due to the difference in th nature of organizations, such a change in the details of the model is necessary In addition, the relationship between the factors and their weight must be recalculated The results of this study are consistent with many studies conducted in the field of HSE, Including the fact that the human factor is very important in establishing HSE in organizations and complying with the relevant rules and regulations The difference between the model presented in this study and other research is that the relationship between the factors in this model is considered Although this is not explicitly stated, the use of AHP in some studies is due to the fact that independent HSE variables have been considered and the relationship between them have not been considered Some recent research has shown that the combination of DEMATEL and ANP has been used in the HSE model, which indicates an increase in accuracy in such research However, ergonomic factors are absent in these studies In the present study, an attempt has been made to pay attention to all these aspects ? 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences All rights reserved","output":"Using the DEMATEL-ANP-HSEE model to evaluate

In Sri Lanka, the first case of COVID-19 was reported late January 2020 which was a Chinese national and the first local case was identified in the second week of March. Since then, the government of Sri Lanka introduced various sequential measures to improve social distancing such as closure of schools and education institutes, introducing work from home model to reduce the public gathering, introducing travel bans to international arrivals, and more drastically, imposed island wide curfew expecting to minimize the burden of the disease to the Sri Lankan health system and the entire community.

The difficulty at present, however, is that these concepts exist at a fairly level, whereas in order for them to have the tangible effects desired they need to become more concrete and specific. This article undertakes precisely this process of concretisation, mapping how the different concepts interrelate and what in particular they each require in order to move from being high-level aspirations to detailed and enforceable requirements. We argue that the key concept in this process is accountability, since unless an entity can be held accountable for compliance with the other concepts, and indeed more generally, those concepts cannot do the work required of them. There is a variety of taxonomies of accountability in the literature. However, at the core of each account appears to be a sense of answerability;a need to explain or to give an account. It is this ability to call an entity to account which provides the impetus for each of the other concepts and helps us to understand what they must each require.","output":"From transparency to accountability of intelligent systems: Moving beyond aspirations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to pose profound challenges on society.

Inadequately managed musculoskeletal pain can adversely affect quality of life and impose significant socioeconomic problems. This manuscript presents a comprehensive review of the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. It briefly explores the background, classifications, patient assessments, and different tools for management according to the recently available evidence. Multimodal analgesia and multidisciplinary approaches are fundamental elements of effective management of musculoskeletal pain. Both pharmacological, non-pharmacological, as well as interventional pain therapy are important to enhance patients recovery, well-being, and improve quality of life. Accordingly, recent guidelines recommend the implementation of preventative strategies and physical tools first to minimize the use of medications. In patients who have had an inadequate response to pharmacotherapy, the proper use of interventional pain therapy and the other alternative techniques are vital for safe and effective management of chronic pain patients.","output":"Management of Musculoskeletal Pain: An Update with Emphasis on Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that the current healthcare system in modern society can hardly cope with the increased number of patients.

Social distancing is of paramount importance to limit the spread of the disease, but to design social distancing rules on a scientific basis the process of dispersal of virus-containing respiratory droplets must be understood. Here, we demonstrate that available knowledge is largely inadequate to make predictions on the reach of infectious droplets emitted during a cough and on their infectious potential. We follow the position and evaporation of thousands of respiratory droplets by massive state-of-the-art numerical simulations of the airflow caused by a typical cough. We find that different initial distributions of droplet size taken from literature and different ambient relative humidity lead to opposite conclusions: (1) most versus none of the viral content settles in the first 1-2 m; (2) viruses are carried entirely on dry nuclei versus on liquid droplets; (3) small droplets travel less than [Formula: see text] versus more than [Formula: see text]. We point to two key issues that need to be addressed urgently in order to provide a scientific foundation to social distancing rules: (I1) a careful characterisation of the initial distribution of droplet sizes; (I2) the infectious potential of viruses carried on dry nuclei versus liquid droplets.","output":"Fluid dynamics of COVID-19 airborne infection suggests urgent data for a scientific design of social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"la COVID-19 se comporta como una enfermedad heterognea.

METHOD: Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted within the context of a tiered counselling intervention study for highly burdened family caregivers (N = 165) to assess their experience of burden, anxieties, worries and desires regarding care. RESULTS: A quarter of all caregivers (26%) reported high fear of becoming infected with SARS-CoV?2 and 50% feared their care recipient could get infected. Almost half of all caregivers reported (47%) that corona had a high impact on the care situation and increased the burden of caregiving (51%). A loss of professional support and less time for themselves were reported most often. The desire for additional support was frequently expressed. The level of care, the age of the caregiver and the previous use of care services were found to be predictors of the psychological distress experienced by care recipients.

This study examined the association between patients' HLA genotype and serum ferritin level modulation and also assessed the effect of serum ferritin levels on infection severity/mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and thirty-six COVID-19 Saudi patients were divided into two groups according to their ferritin levels: group 1 (<500 ng/mL, N = 67) and group 2 (>500 ng/mL, N = 69). HLA genotyping (class I and II) was carried out through the rPCR-SSO method. RESULTS High serum ferritin levels were associated with a significant increase in infection severity, as 75% of ICU patients showed high levels of ferritin compared to 43% of patients with moderate symptoms, p = .002. This elevation indicated a gender skew in that 56% of the infected male patients displayed high ferritin levels compared to 36.6% of the female patients, p = .03. In terms of mortality, 74% of patients with fatal outcomes had a high level of serum ferritin compared to 47% of recovered patients, p = .039. There was a significant difference in the HLA frequency between the two groups, with a predominance of HLA-A*01 in the low-ferritin group (19.4 vs. 6.5%, p = .002, pc = .016) and predominance of C*03 in the high ferritin group (10.9 vs. 3%, p = .047, pc = .27).

METHODS: The USS Ronald Reagan includes a crew of approximately 3000 Sailors and an embarked Air Wing of 2000 personnel. The PDS was conducted in 3 waves of 14-day strict quarantines during the months of April and May 2020. Sailors were cleared to board the ship with 2 negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) tests at days 14 and 16. The ship was sanitized before Wave 1 boarding. RESULTS: From March 1, 2020, through May 31, 2020, a total of 51 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were detected.

Yet, the impact of the enforcement and subsequent loosening of these policies on the spread of COVID-19 is not well understood. Accordingly, we measure the impact of NPIs on mitigating disease spread by exploiting the spatio-temporal variations in policy measures across the 16 states of Germany. While this quasi-experiment does not allow for causal identification, each policys effect on reducing disease spread provides meaningful insights. We adapt the SusceptibleCExposedCInfectedCRecovered model for disease propagation to include data on daily confirmed cases, interstate movement, and social distancing. By combining the model with measures of policy contributions on mobility reduction, we forecast scenarios for relaxing various types of NPIs. Our model finds that in Germany policies that mandated contact restrictions (e.g., movement in public space limited to two persons or people co-living), closure of educational institutions (e.g., schools), and retail outlet closures are associated with the sharpest drops in movement within and across states. Contact restrictions appear to be most effective at lowering COVID-19 cases, while border closures appear to have only minimal effects at mitigating the spread of the disease, even though cross-border travel might have played a role in seeding the disease in the population. We believe that a deeper understanding of the policy effects on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 allows a more accurate forecast of disease spread when NPIs are partially loosened and gives policymakers better data for making informed decisions.","output":"Preparing for a future COVID-19 wave: insights and limitations from a data-driven evaluation of non-pharmaceutical interventions in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of the pandemic, we observed that lithium carbonate had a positive effect on the recovery of severely ill patients with COVID-19.

Although they might be considered a high-risk group for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the reported impact of COVID-19 in these patients has been reassuring, while the differential susceptibility of distinct types of IEI remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the findings and outcomes of our known patients with IEI who were diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: In a retrospective study from March 2020 to February 2021, four centers in Mexico collected clinical, laboratory, and genetic data from pediatric and adult patients with known diagnoses of IEI who presented with COVID-19, based on compatible symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 testing or known household exposure. RESULTS: We report 31 patients with known IEI from Mexico who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seventy-four percent were male, 52% were pediatric, and 81% survived. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 56 years, with a median of 17 years. Sixty-five percent had predominant antibody deficiencies, 48% were hospitalized, and 26% required ICU. Pediatric patients had a higher hospital admission rate than adults. Inpatient mortality was 40%, and ICU mortality rate was 63%. Forty-eight percent developed pneumonia, while 36% had evidence of hyperinflammation (4 adults and 7 children). Predominant laboratory features were lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, seen in 70 and 44% of patients, respectively. The serum D-dimer median value was 2.6 (0.5-20.6) g/mL, and the median highest ferritin value was 1015 (32-10,303) ng/mL. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 80% of patients. Other treatments included macrolides (39%) and corticosteroids (29%). Six patients died from secondary infection or uncontrolled systemic inflammation. DISCUSSION: Although impaired immunity due to IEI may be a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19, most of our patients with IEI who acquired the SARS-CoV-2 infection developed a well-tolerated infection and survived, as have more than 80% of worldwide reported patients to date. An impaired immune or inflammatory response may be a predisposing factor for some and a protective factor for others. A systematic review of the literature could help identify those patients at risk of severe disease and complications.

Six (10.5%), 5(8.7%), 25(43.8%) 7(12.3%), and 30 (52.6%) patients had FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, TLC, and DLCO values less than 80% of predicted values, respectively. 28 (49.1%) and 13 (22.8%) patients had PImax and PEmax values less than 80% of the corresponding predicted values. Compared with non-severe cases, severe patients showed higher incidence of DLCO impairment (75.6%vs42.5%, p = 0.019), higher lung total severity score (TSS) and R20, and significantly lower percentage of predicted TLC and 6MWD. No significant correlation between TSS and pulmonary function parameters was found during follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: Impaired diffusing-capacity, lower respiratory muscle strength, and lung imaging abnormalities were detected in more than half of the COVID-19 patients in early convalescence phase. Compared with non-severe cases, severe patients had a higher incidence of DLCO impairment and encountered more TLC decrease and 6MWD decline.","output":"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on pulmonary function in early convalescence phase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe 5 children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, hemodynamic instability and suspected acute abdomen.

However, cleaning practice remains inadequate. An important component of effective cleaning is to obtain feedback on actual cleaning practice. This study aimed to evaluate the cleaning process quality from an implementation perspective. METHODOLOGY: An observational study was conducted in a tertiary public hospital in Wuhan, China and 92 cleaning processes of units housing patients with multidrug-resistant organism infections were recorded. The bed unit cleaning quality and floor cleaning quality were measured by six and five process indicators respectively. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the cleaning quality. RESULTS: For bed unit cleaning quality, the appropriate rates of cleaning sequence, adherence to cleaning unit principle, use of cloth, use of cloth bucket, separation of clean and contaminated tools, and disinfectant concentration were 35.9%, 71.7%, 89.7%, 11.5%, 65.4%, and 48.7%, respectively. For floor cleaning quality, the appropriate rates of adherence to cleaning unit principle, use of cloth, use of cloth bucket, separation of clean and contaminated tools, and disinfectant concentration were 13.4%, 50.0%, 35.5%, 11.0%, and 36.7%, respectively.

BACKGROUND: The use of telemedicine has rapidly expanded and evolved since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine eliminates the physical and geographic barriers to health care, preserves personal protective equipment, and prevents the spread of COVID-19 by allowing encounters to happen in a socially distanced way. However, few studies have assessed the patient perspective of telemedicine for headache care. METHODS: The American Migraine Foundation (AMF) designed a standardized electronic questionnaire to assess the patient experience of telemedicine for headache care between March and September 2020 to help inform future quality improvement as part of its patient advocacy initiative. The date parameters were identified as the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease and the declaration of a national emergency in the United States. The questionnaire was distributed electronically to more than 100,000 members of the AMF community through social media platforms and the AMF email database. RESULTS: A total of 1172 patients responded to our electronic questionnaire, with 1098 complete responses. The majority, 1081/1153 (93.8%) patients, had a previous headache diagnosis prior to the telemedicine encounter. A total of 648/1127 (57.5%) patients reported that they had used telemedicine for headache care during the study period. Among those who participated in telehealth visits, 553/647 (85.5%) patients used it for follow-up visits; 94/647 (14.5%) patients used it for new patient visits. During the telemedicine encounters, 282/645 (43.7%) patients were evaluated by headache specialists, 222/645 (34.4%) patients by general neurologists, 198/645 (30.7%) patients by primary care providers, 73/645 (11.3%) patients by headache nurse practitioners, and 21/645 (3.2%) patients by headache nurses. Only 47/633 (7.4%) patients received a new headache diagnosis from telemedicine evaluation, whereas the other 586/633 (92.6%) patients did not have a change in their diagnoses. During these visits, a new treatment was prescribed for 358/636 (52.3%) patients, whereas 278/636 (43.7%) patients did not have changes made to their treatment plan. The number (%) of patients who rated the telemedicine headache care experience as \\"very good,\\" \\"good,\\" \\"fair,\\" \\"poor,\\" and \\"other\\" were 396/638 (62.1%), 132/638 (20.7%), 67/638 (10.5%), 23/638 (3.6%), and 20/638 (3.1%), respectively. Detailed reasons for \\"other\\" are listed in the manuscript. Most patients, 573/638 (89.8%), indicated that they would prefer to continue to use telemedicine for their headache care, 45/638 (7.1%) patients would not, and 20/638 (3.1%) patients were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluating the patient perspective demonstrated that telemedicine facilitated headache care for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in high patient satisfaction rates, and a desire to continue to use telemedicine for future headache care among those who completed the online survey.","output":"Patient experience of telemedicine for headache care during the COVID-19 pandemic: An American Migraine Foundation survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging hemorrhagic fever acquired by tick bites. Whether mast cells (MCs), the body's first line of defense against pathogens, might influence immunity or pathogenesis during SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection remained unknown. Here, we found that SFTSV can cause MC infection and degranulation, resulting in the release of the vasoactive mediators, chymase, and tryptase, which can directly act on endothelial cells, break the tight junctions of endothelial cells and threaten the integrity of the microvascular barrier, leading to microvascular hyperpermeability in human microvascular endothelial cells. Local activation of MCs (degranulation) and MC-specific proteases-facilitated endothelial damage were observed in mouse models. When MC-specific proteases were injected subcutaneously into the back skin of mice, signs of capillary leakage were observed in a dose-dependent manner. MC-specific proteases, chymase, and tryptase were tested in the serum collected at the acute phase of SFTS patients, with the higher level significantly correlated with fatal outcomes. By performing receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, chymase was determined as a biomarker with the area under the curve value of 0.830 (95% CI = 0.745 to 0.915) for predicting fatal outcomes in SFTS. Our findings highlight the importance of MCs in SFTSV-induced disease progression and outcome. An emerging role for MCs in the clinical prognosis and blocking MC activation as a potential drug target during SFTSV infection was proposed. IMPORTANCE We revealed a pathogenic role for MCs in response to SFTSV infection. The study also identifies potential biomarkers that could differentiate patients at risk of a fatal outcome for SFTS, as well as novel therapeutic targets for the clinical management of SFTS. These findings might shed light on an emerging role for MCs as a potential drug target during infection of other viral hemorrhagic fever diseases with similar host pathology as SFTS.","output":"Mast Cell-Derived Proteases Induce Endothelial Permeability and Vascular Damage in Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kemajuan teknologi yang semakin dinamis diharapkan dapat dimanfaatkan dengan baik oleh pelaku bisnis konvensional.

The monkeys were euthanized, and blood, plasma, urine, feces and ten tissues were collected. All the samples were prepared by protein precipitation and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS detection. The population pharmacokinetics of HCQ in the plasma, red blood cells, and lung tissue was conducted and simulated via ADAPT program. Results demonstrated that the maximum concentration (C (max)) of HCQ was 292.33 ng/mL in blood and 36.90 ng/mL in plasma after single dose of 3 mg/kg. The value of area under curve (AUC(0C)) was determined as 5,978.94 and 363.31 h* ng/mL for the blood and plasma, respectively. The descending order of the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio was liver > spleen > kidney > lung > heart > subcutaneous fat > brain. The tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio and the tissue-to-blood concentration ratio for lung were found to be time-dependent with 267.38 and 5.55 at 120 h postdose, respectively. A five-compartment model with first-order oral absorption and elimination best described the plasma, blood, and lung tissue pharmacokinetics. The estimated elimination rate constant (ke) for a typical monkey was 0.236 h(?1). The volume of distribution in central (Vc/F) and other two peripheral compartments (Vb/F and Vl/F) were 114, 2.68, and 5.55 L, respectively. Model-based simulation with PK parameters from cynomolgus macaques showed that the ratio of the blood or plasma to lung tissue was a dynamic change course, which suggested that the rate of HCQ concentration decrease in the blood or plasma was faster than that in the lung tissue. HCQ was found to be accumulated in tissues, especially in the liver, kidney, lung, and spleen. Also, the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio increased over time.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could potentially offer advantages in providing tissue characterization of lung parenchyma and heart muscle in COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to describe data on heart and lung MRI in a cohort of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS AND RESULTS: n = 11 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia underwent a comprehensive MRI examinations including lung and heart tissue mapping, findings were compared to those of an age- and sex-matched cohort of n = 11 individuals. Lung native T1 and T2 mapping assessments were performed by drawing a circular region of interest (ROI) with diameter of 2 cm in the parenchyma visualized from the cardiac four chamber long axis-oriented slice; vessels and areas of pleural effusion were carefully excluded. Myocardial native T1 and T2 mapping were assessed by drawing a ROI within the midventricular left ventricular (LV) septum. No patients had previous history of cardiovascular disease (including known coronary artery disease, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation). As compared to controls, patients with COVID-19 had similar cardiac function, higher mid-septum myocardial native T1 (1028 ms vs. 985, P = 0.05) and significantly higher lung native T1 and T2 within affected areas (1375 ms vs. 1201 ms, P = 0.016 and 70 ms vs. 30 ms, P < 0.001 respectively), whereas non-significant differences were observed between remote lung areas of patients and controls (1238 ms vs. 1152 ms, P = 0.088 and 29 ms vs. 33 ms, P = 0.797 respectively). No significant associations were observed between cardiac and lung mapping findings. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients with COVID-19, T1 and T2 mapping lung MRI identified pneumonia related abnormalities as compared to healthy controls, likely representing oedema and ongoing inflammation at the lung site. Myocardial native T1 was elevated suggesting the presence of cardiac involvement.

EXPERT OPINION Some commonly used vaccines are being considered for their potentially beneficial role in preventing or improving the prognosis of COVID-19: influenza, pneumococcal and tuberculosis vaccines. These vaccines may have either direct effect on COVID-19 via different types of immune responses or indirect effects by reducing the burden of viral and bacterial respiratory diseases on individual patients and national healthcare system and by facilitating differential diagnoses with other viral/bacterial respiratory disease. The latter may ultimately allow a more rapid SARS-CoV-2 infected patient isolation and contact tracing. On the other hand, a large number of candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are currently in the pipeline and undergoing phase I, II and III clinical studies. As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are expected to be marketed through accelerated regulatory pathways, vaccinovigilance as well as planning of a successful vaccination campaign will play a major role.","output":"Potential effects of vaccinations on the prevention of COVID-19: rationale, clinical evidence, risks and public health considerations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March of 2020, an otherwise healthy 12-year-old boy developed a unilateral patch of reticulated erythema limited to his left lower extremity The child could not be examined in the clinic due to limited in-person appointments during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, so he was examined via a telemedicine visit The diagnosis of erythema ab igne was made as his mother verified that the child was spending approximately two hours per day playing video games in the cold basement of his house, with a space heater positioned close to his left leg Our case of erythema ab igne is unique due to the relatively young age of the affected child, and it provides an example of how this diagnosis can be made via a telemedicine visit Being able to recognize the classic appearance of erythema ab igne through the scrutiny of photographs and obtaining pertinent history can preclude the need for an in-person visit during times when home sequestration may be a necessity","output":"Erythema Ab Igne in a 12-Year-Old Boy Diagnosed via Telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In early 2020, many scientists are rushing to discover novel drugs and vaccines against the coronavirus, and treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), because, the disease which was named as COVID-19, a life-threatening viral disease affected first in china and quickly spread throughout the world OBJECTIVE: In the present article, in silico studies have been performed to explore the binding modes of chemical constituents for natural remedies such as pepper, ginger, and garlic against COVID-19 (PDB id-5R82) targeting coronavirus using Schrodinger suit 2019-4 METHODS: The docking studies are performed by Glide module, in silico ADMET screening was performed by qik prop module and binding energy of ligands was calculated using Prime Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area module RESULTS: From the results, the chemical constituents from pepper like Piperdardiine, Piperanine and from ginger like 8-Gingerol, 10-Gingerol, significantly active against COVID-19 with significant Glide score when compared to currently used drug Hydroxychloroquine (-5 47) The docking results of the compounds exhibited similar mode of interactions with COVID-19, and the residues SER46, MET49, HIE41, GLN189, ARG189, ASP187, MET165, HIE164, THR24, THR25, LEU27, ASN142, and GLY143 play a crucial role in binding with ligands CONCLUSION: The chemical constituents from pepper such as Piperdardiine, Piperanine, and from ginger like 8-Gingerol, 10-Gingerol are significantly active against COVID-19 which are useful for further development","output":"Activity of phytochemical constituents of black pepper, ginger, and garlic against coronavirus (COVID-19): an in silico approach.

This behavior is so complex that there are lots of uncertainties in both the data and in the process itself. We argue here that these uncertainties should be taken into account in the modeling strategy. Machine learning methods, and neural networks, in particular, are useful in modeling this sort of complex problems, although they generally lack of probabilistic interpretations. We thus present here a neural network method embedded in a Bayesian framework for modeling and predicting the number of cases of infectious diseases in areal units. A key feature is that our combined model considers the impact of human movement on the spread of the infectious disease, as an additional random factor to the also considered spatial neighborhood and temporal correlation components. Our model is evaluated over a COVID-19 dataset for 245 health zones of Castilla-Leon (Spain). The results show that a Bayesian model informed by a neural network method is generally able to predict the number of cases of COVID-19 in both space and time, with the human mobility factor having a strong influence on the model.","output":"A Bayesian Machine Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Prediction of COVID-19 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Clinicians considered DDS administration to treat SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome. DDS is helpful in the molecular regulation of Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3). Objective: To study the targeting of NLRP3 itself or up-/downstream factors of the NLRP3 inflammasome by DDS must be responsible for its observed preventive effects, functioning as a competitor. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We set out to use objective criteria of improvement. We treated the patients with standard Covid-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treatment with DDS. The RCT results were analyzed. Results: ARDS progression was blocked in 17 of 19 total patients at the first period. The 44 subjects were analyzed during the second period. It is significant at the ARDS onset stage. The mortality of ARDS-onset patients was 0% with DDS and 40% without DDS among the total of 65 cases. The t-value of RCT is -1.5, and the p-value is .075475. The result is significant at p < 0.10. ARDS onset with DDS prescribed group survived more 90% than ARDS onset without DDS group. The chi-square is 5.8108. The p-value is .015928.

Reliance on tacrolimus levels has become a cornerstone of management strategy to balance the immune response with the potential for rejection of the graft. How COVID-19 and its treatment affect tacrolimus metabolism in solid organ transplant is not well understood. Here we present a case of a heart transplant recipient with highly elevated tacrolimus levels following COVID-19 infection despite little to no tacrolimus administration and no other known drug-drug interactions. Case Presentation The patient is a 58-year-old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy; status post orthotopic heart transplantation 6/17/2018. The postoperative course was complicated by two occurrences of 2R cellular rejection within 1 year, RV dysfunction, calcineurin induced renal dysfunction, and relative bradycardia. In 7/2020, the patient presented to the ED with complaints of jaw pain, symptoms of urinary retention and 3 days of diarrhea. COVID-19 PCR returned positive. Before infection, the patient had been maintained on a steady dose of tacrolimus 0.5mg BID for 8 months with associated trough levels between the goal range of 4-8ng/mL. At the time of infection, the patient's tacrolimus was held to account for elevated trough levels, and he was then maintained on a dose of 0.5mg QAD for the next 8 months. Discussion Tacrolimus metabolism is represented in Graph 1 via trough:dose (T:D) ratio (T:D ratio measured in 48-hr intervals as the patient was on QAD dosing post-infection). T:D ratio remained stable on tacrolimus 0.5mg BID before COVID-19 infection. Following infection, the ratio sharply rose and remained elevated 8 months later despite reducing the dose to 0.5mg QAD. To our knowledge, this is the first case presented of a heart transplant recipient with altered tacrolimus metabolism status post COVID-19 infection without apparent drug-drug interaction. This suggests a relationship between SARS-COV-2 viremia with tacrolimus metabolism.","output":"The Effect Of COVID-19 Infection On Tacrolimus Metabolism In Heart Transplant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stringent government policies, in general, and strict containment and closure policies in particular including workplace closing, restrictions on gatherings, close of public transport, stay-at-home order, restrictions on internal movement, and international travel control are associated with a lower spread rate of COVID-19 cases.

Restrictions on international travel and the closing of public transport are two policies that stand out and have a consistent and slowing effect on the spread of COVID-19. The slowing effect of the containment and closure policies on the spread of COVID-19 becomes stronger one week after the policies have been implemented, consistent with the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pattern and the incubation period evolution. Furthermore, the slowing effect becomes stronger for culturally tight countries and countries with a higher population density.

Some of the organisations have established platforms to disseminate their data, making it available to researchers for the first time. These databases promise to increase the quality and quantity of research in various fields. In the late 2010s, specialist crowd counting organisations emerged with the sole purpose of counting crowds at protests and disseminating the results, sometimes in a purely partisan manner. Because of the contemporary relevance of protest behaviour, we frame our discussion within this context. For social scientists considering the utilisation of these new databases, it is essential that crowd numbers be linked to underlying human behaviour in a way that promises a chain of connections to investigate and explore. We use behavioural economics to show why relative crowd size may be important for human decision-makers. And we show how the significance of relative crowd size relates to other aspects of the human decision-making process, including risk preferences and probability assessments. Far from being a theory of protest behaviour, we present a behavioural economics-based primer for empirical researchers and social scientists engaging with newly available crowd counting data. The conclusions may apply in other contexts and might be extended to encompass specific types of behaviour, including aggression and violence. Indeed, the conclusions may guide the analysis of the emergence of the crowd counting organisations themselves.","output":"Crowd counting: a behavioural economics perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]about 100 years ago, the influenza pandemic of 1918C1920 cost more lives than World War I It took 15 years from the time of that pandemic to isolate the virus 3 Burnet, recipient of the Nobel prize for physiology and medicine in 1960 for his contribution to the elucidation of acquired immunological tolerance, and who is likely best known to rheumatologists for his clonal selection theory of antibody production,4 was the first to cultivate the influenza virus on developing hen eggs in 1935 5 With his continuing research,6 this achievement ultimately enabled developments that culminated in the production and successful application of influenza vaccines almost a decade later 7 8 Why is influenza mentioned here?

METHODS: We performed a case series of all PWH sequentially admitted with COVID-19 from 8 March 2020 to 23 April 2020 at three hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia. Sociodemographic, clinical and HIV-associated characteristics were collected. RESULTS: Of 530 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized during this period, 20 occurred among PWH (3.8%). The median age was 57 (Q1CQ3, 48C62) years, 65% were men, and 85% were non-Hispanic Black. Presenting median symptom duration was 5 (Q1CQ3, 3C7) days; cough (90%), fever (65%), malaise (60%) and dyspnea (60%) were most common. On admission, 40% of patients required oxygenation support and 65% had an abnormal chest radiograph. Median length of hospitalization was 5 (Q1CQ3, 4C12) days, 30% required intensive care, 15% required intubation, and 15% died. Median CD4(+) cell count prior to admission was 425 (Q1CQ3, 262C815) cells/l and 90% of patients had HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/ml. Half of the patients had at least five comorbidities; hypertension (70%), dyslipidemia (60%) and diabetes (45%) were most prevalent.

Considering a unique sample based on transport companies' annual reports, we find that, when reducing the costs of annual season tickets, day tickets and hourly tickets (by up to 29%, 6% and 20%, respectively), demand increases by, on average, over five years, about 10.6%. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show how the synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2010) can be used to assess such (for policy-makers) important price reduction effects in urban public transport. Furthermore, we propose an aggregate metric that inherits changes in public transport supply (e.g., frequency increases) to assess these demand effects, namely passenger trips per vehicle kilometre. This metric helps us to isolate the impact of price reductions by ensuring that companies' frequency increases do not affect estimators of interest. In addition, we show how to investigate the robustness of results in similar settings. Using a recent statistical method and a different study design, i.e., not blocking off supply changes as an alternate explanation of the effect, leads us to a lower bound of the effect, amounting to an increase of 3.7%. Finally, as far as we know, it is the first causal estimate of price reduction on urban public transport initiated by direct democracy.","output":"Do price reductions attract customers in urban public transport?

Therefore, conserved amino acids located on a protein surface may be successfully targeted by antibodies. The quantitative deep mutational scanning approach is an excellent technique to understand viral evolution, and the obtained data can be utilized to develop a vaccine. However, the application of the approach to all of the proteins in general is difficult in terms of cost. To address this need, we report the construction of a deep neural network-based program for sequence-based prediction of supersecondary structure codes (SSSCs), called SSSCPrediction (SSSCPred). Further, to predict conformational flexibility or rigidity in proteins, a comparison program called SSSCPreds that consists of three deep neural network-based prediction systems (SSSCPred, SSSCPred100, and SSSCPred200) has also been developed. Using our algorithms we calculated here shows the degree of flexibility for the receptor-binding motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the rigidity of the unique motif (SSSC: SSSHSSHHHH) at the S2 subunit and has a value independent of the X-ray and Cryo-EM structures. The fact that the sequence flexibility/rigidity map of SARS-CoV-2 RBD resembles the sequence-to-phenotype maps of ACE2-binding affinity and expression, which were experimentally obtained by deep mutational scanning, suggests that the identical SSSC sequences among the ones predicted by three deep neural network-based systems correlate well with the sequences with both lower ACE2-binding affinity and lower expression. The combined analysis of predicted and observed SSSCs with keyword-tagged datasets would be helpful in understanding the structural correlation to the examined system.","output":"SSSCPreds: Deep Neural Network-Based Software for the Prediction of Conformational Variability and Application to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This quantitative study (n = 370) compares the pandemic-related experiences of the family carers of older people living with dementia during the first wave of the pandemic, in two countries with different care regimes: Italy (Mediterranean) and Hungary (Eastern European).

(2) What factors significantly predicted negative changes in these experiences? (3) What were carers main difficulties during the first pandemic wave? Results have shown that carers in both samples reported a worsening in mental health (Italy/Hungary: M = 2.25/2.55, SD = 0.93/0.99), and Italian carers also in general health (M = 2.54, SD = 0.98) (on a scale of 1 to 5, with values under 3 representing deterioration).

However, the advantages and challenges of RDD for CT have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply RDD for CT. METHODS: Between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the 'diffusion of innovations' theory. Between May and June 2019, we distributed an online questionnaire among 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using different hypothetical scenarios, we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of RDD, and PHPs' intention to apply RDD for CT. RESULTS: Twelve interviews were held, and 70 PHPs completed the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using RDD for CT. Anticipated advantages of RDD were 'accommodating easy and autonomous participation in CT of index cases and contact persons', and 'reaching contact persons more efficiently'. Anticipated challenges were 'limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of CT', 'not being able to adequately convey measures to index cases and contact persons', and 'anticipated unrest among index cases and contact persons'. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD applicable for CT included index cases and contact persons being reluctant to share information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons being involved, and large scale CT. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD less applicable for CT included severe consequences of missing information or contact persons for individual or public health, involvement of complex or impactful measures for index cases and contact persons, and a disease being perceived as severe or sensitive by index cases and their contact persons. CONCLUSIONS: PHPs generally perceived RDD as a potentially beneficial method for public health practice, that may help overcome challenges present in traditional CT, and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close contact. The circumstances under which CT is performed, appear to strongly influence PHPs' intention to use RDD for CT.","output":"Online respondent-driven detection for enhanced contact tracing of close-contact infectious diseases: benefits and barriers for public health practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first case of a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection in a Sri Lankan was reported on March 11, 2020.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3 tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

Considerable debate remains regarding the design, comorbidity, suture material, and method. We investigated the risk factors for incisional hernia after laparoscopic colorectal surgery in the presence of limited surgery-related factors. Methods A retrospective study was designed with 541 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery performed by a single operator from January 2015 to December 2017. Due to open conversions, other abdominal operations, or follow-up loss, only 445 patients were included in the study. After propensity score matching, 266 patients were included. The study was based on diagnosis of incisional hernia on computed tomography at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results Of the 266 total patients, 133 underwent abdominal closure using PDS (Ethicon), while the remaining 133 underwent closure with Vicryl (Ethicon). Of these patients, nine were diagnosed with incisional hernia at the 12-month follow-up six (4.5%) in the Vicryl group and three (2.3%) in the PDS group (p = 0.309). The incidence of incisional hernia was significantly increased in females (odds ratio [OR], 15.233; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.905-121.799; p = 0.010), in patients with body mass index (BMI) of >25 kg/m2 (OR, 4.740; 95% CI, 1.424-15.546; p = 0.011), and in patients with liver disease (OR, 19.899; 95% CI, 1.614-245.376; p = 0.020).

The enzyme is a cysteine protease, with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145/His-41) in the active site. Aldehyde inhibitors can bind reversibly to the active-site sulfhydryl of SARS-CoV M(pro). Previous studies using peptidic substrates and inhibitors showed that the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV M(pro) requires glutamine in the P1 position and a large hydrophobic residue in the P2 position. We determined four crystal structures of SARS-CoV M(pro) in complex with pentapeptide aldehydes (Ac-ESTLQ-H, Ac-NSFSQ-H, Ac-DSFDQ-H, and Ac-NSTSQ-H). Kinetic data showed that all of these aldehydes exhibit inhibitory activity towards SARS-CoV M(pro), with K(i) values in the M range. Surprisingly, the X-ray structures revealed that the hydrophobic S2 pocket of the enzyme can accommodate serine and even aspartic-acid side-chains in the P2 positions of the inhibitors. Consequently, we reassessed the substrate specificity of the enzyme by testing the cleavage of 20 different tetradecapeptide substrates with varying amino-acid residues in the P2 position. The cleavage efficiency for the substrate with serine in the P2 position was 160-times lower than that for the original substrate (P2 = Leu); furthermore, the substrate with aspartic acid in the P2 position was not cleaved at all. We also determined a crystal structure of SARS-CoV M(pro) in complex with aldehyde Cm-FF-H, which has its P1-phenylalanine residue bound to the relatively hydrophilic S1 pocket of the enzyme and yet exhibits a high inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M(pro), with K(i) = 2.24  0.58 M. These results show that the stringent substrate specificity of the SARS-CoV M(pro) with respect to the P1 and P2 positions can be overruled by the highly electrophilic character of the aldehyde warhead, thereby constituting a deviation from the dogma that peptidic inhibitors need to correspond to the observed cleavage specificity of the target protease.","output":"Peptide aldehyde inhibitors challenge the substrate specificity of the SARS-coronavirus main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has exacerbated the opioid epidemic and transformed how programs treat opioid use disorder.

The individuals were divided into four age groups ( 5 years, 6C24 years, 25C59 years, and  60 years). The effective reproduction number (R(eff)), including infectivity (R(I)) and susceptibility (R(S)) was calculated to assess the transmissibility of different age groups. From 2005 to 2017, 130,768 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model fitted well with the reported data (P < 0.001). The highest transmissibility (R(eff)) was from  5 years to the 25C59 years (mean: 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34C1.17), followed by from the 6C24 years to the 25C59 years (mean: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.35C1.02), from the  60 years to the 25C59 years (mean: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.29C0.86), and from the 25C59 years to 25C59 years (mean: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.21C0.78).

The US Preventive Services Task Force endorses universal adolescent MDD screening in primary care; however, most adolescents lack preventive health care, resulting in worsening disparities in MDD screening and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of universal adolescent MDD screening in the school setting in an effort to reduce disparities and improve MDD identification and treatment initiation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial, conducted from November 6, 2018, to November 20, 2020, compared the usual school practice of targeted or selected screening based on observable behaviors of concern with universal MDD screening. Students within an identified school were randomized by grade to 1 of the 2 study groups. Study groups were compared using mixed-effects logistic regression. Participants included students in grades 9 through 12 enrolled at 1 of the 14 participating Pennsylvania public high schools. INTERVENTIONS: In targeted screening, students with behaviors prompting concern for MDD were referred to the Student Assistance Program (SAP), mandated in all Pennsylvania schools. The SAP determined follow-up recommendations. In universal screening, all students completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); students with positive scores proceeded to SAP. The universal screening group could also have targeted referral to SAP for concerning behavior independent of the PHQ-9. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was initiation of MDD treatment or services based on data collected by school SAP teams during the academic year. RESULTS: A total of 12 909 students were included (median age, 16 years [range, 13-21 years]; 6963 male [53.9%]), of whom 2687 (20.8%) were Hispanic, 2891 (22.4%) were non-Hispanic Black, 5842 (45.3%) were non-Hispanic White, and 1489 (11.5%) were multiracial or of other race or ethnicity. A total of 6473 students (50.1%) were randomized to universal screening, and 6436 (49.9%) were randomized to targeted screening. Adolescents in the universal screening group had 5.92 times higher odds (95% CI, 5.07-6.93) of being identified with MDD symptoms, 3.30 times higher odds (95% CI, 2.49-4.38) of SAP confirming follow-up needs, and 2.07 times higher odds (95% CI, 1.39-3.10) of initiating MDD treatment. No differences were identified in initiation for planned subgroup analyses by sex or race and ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, universal school-based MDD screening successfully increased identification of MDD symptoms and treatment initiation among adolescents, confirming the value of this approach to address this rising public health concern.

Objectives: The current study aimed to firstly assess the severity of anxiety and depression and perceived vulnerability to diseases, and secondly to investigate their association with the fear of COVID-19 among Nigerian HCWs. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, a purposefully selected sample of 413 HCWs from two tertiary healthcare institutions in Benin City, Edo State, South-South Nigeria, responded to the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale. Data was collected between October 2020 and February 2021. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize socio-demographic variables, while inferential statistics (t-test for independent samples, one-way ANOVA, and linear regression) were used to test hypotheses. Results: A high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and perceived vulnerability to diseases (PVD) was observed. Perceived infectability ( = 0.244, P = 0.000), germ aversion ( = 0.166, P = 0.000), and composite PVD ( = 0.96, P = 0.000) were identified as independent and significant predictors of fear of COVID-19, accounting for 7.5;3.3, and 9.9% variance in the severities of Fear of COVID-19, respec-tively.

Twenty-one indicators were used to construct a household vulnerability index to understand the vulnerability of the cities. The results have shown that the majority of the households fell under moderate to high vulnerability level across all the cities.

Although both strategies elevated the production of influenza-specific antibodies and protected mice from the transient weight loss that is caused by an influenza challenge infection, sterile immunity was not achieved. Helminth-infected vaccinated mice still had high virus burden in the lung while non-helminth-infected vaccinated mice rapidly cleared the virus. In summary we demonstrate that basic improvements of influenza vaccination regimen are not sufficient to confer sterile immunity on the background of helminth-induced immunosuppression, despite amelioration of pathology i.e. weight loss. Our findings highlight the risk of failed vaccinations in helminth-endemic areas, especially in light of the ongoing vaccination campaign to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Pre-existing helminth infection impairs the efficacy of adjuvanted influenza vaccination in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of telemedicine has grown immensely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine provides a means to deliver clinical care while limiting patient and provider exposure to the COVID-19. As such, telemedicine is finding applications in a variety of clinical environments including primary care and the acute care setting and the array of patient populations who use telemedicine continues to grow. Yet as telehealth becomes ubiquitous, it is critical to consider its potential to exacerbate disparities in care. Challenges accessing technology and digital literacy, for example, disproportionately impact older patients and those living in poverty. When implemented with the consideration of health disparities, telemedicine provides an opportunity to address these inequities. This manuscript explores potential mechanisms by which telemedicine may play a role in exacerbating or ameliorating disparities in care. We further describe a framework and suggested strategies with which to implement telemedicine systems to improve health equity.","output":"Digital disparities: designing telemedicine systems with a health equity aim"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Roughly 1 year after the first case of COVID-19 was identified and less than 1 year after the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with demonstrated safety and efficacy in phase III clinical trials are available. The most promising vaccines have targeted the surface glycoprotein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 and achieved an approximate 85%-95% reduction in the risk of symptomatic COVID-19, while retaining excellent safety profiles and modest side effects in the phase III clinical trials. The mRNA, replication-incompetent viral vector, and protein subunit vaccine technologies have all been successfully employed. Some novel SARS-CoV-2 variants evade but do not appear to fully overcome the potent immunity induced by these vaccines. Emerging real-world effectiveness data add evidence for protection from severe COVID-19.

With the growing burden of mental health problems among adolescents (suicide, depression) and their preferences to seek help from their peers, improving Mental Health Literacy (MHL) and behaviours for First Aid in Mental Health (MH-FA) becomes crucial to promote their mental health. METHODS: Schools are ideal settings for reaching the vulnerable adolescents. The proposed study evaluates the effectiveness of a classroom-based teacher-led integrated school mental health intervention called SUMS (MHP + MHL + MH-FA). The study will involve a pragmatic, cluster-randomised waitlist-controlled design to evaluate the effectiveness of SUMS intervention using schools as unit-of-randomisation. The study will be conducted in Srinivaspura taluka (Sub-district) of Kolar district (administrative unit of health) of Karnataka in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary expert team from NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences), Bangalore-India and Department of Education, Government of Karnataka, India. A total of 8 schools (400 students studying in 6C8 grade) from Srinivaspura taluka will be randomised into intervention and waitlist control group. The intervention group will receive SUMS intervention through 10C15 h of classroom sessions. The primary outcome is the improvement in positive mental health literacy, as measured by the Mental Health-Promoting Knowledge (MHPK-10) scale. Changes in MH-FA knowledge and intentions, Mental health stigma, help-seeking and resilience are assessed as secondary outcomes. Data will be collected at baseline, 6-weeks, 6-months and 12-months post-intervention. The waitlist-control schools will receive the interventions at the end of the 12-month follow-up assessment in intervention-schools. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to integrate Mental Health Literacy with Mental Health Promotion and behaviours for First Aid in Mental Health to promote mental health well-being among adolescent school children in India. With a need to build a more substantial evidence base on School Mental Health Promotion approaches in developing countries, the study findings will have implications for implementing and operationalising Health and Wellness Ambassador initiative in India.

Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have been evaluated rapidly by a few studies worldwide for its association with severe disease, but practically none have been conducted in the Indian population. This study was undertaken to examine the role of NLR and PLR in predicting severe disease in Indian patients. Objectives The objective was to study the association of NLR and PLR observed at the time of admission with maximum disease severity during hospitalization and to study their role in predicting disease severity. Material and Methods A total of 229 COVID-19 patients were admitted at the center during the study period. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 191 patients were included in the study. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory (complete blood count, NLR, and PLR) data of all patients were obtained at the time of admission. Maximum disease severity of all patients was assessed during hospitalization. Statistical Analysis Chi-square and MannCWhitney U tests were used to assess statistical significance. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted for NLR and PLR to estimate the cutoff values and sensitivity and specificity using Youdens index for predicting severe disease. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. Results Mean NLR and PLR were significantly higher in severe patients (NLR = 7.41; PLR = 204) compared with nonsevere patients (NLR = 3.30; PLR = 121). ROC analysis showed that NLR, in comparison to PLR, had a higher area under the curve (AUC) of 0.779, with a larger OR of 1.237 and cutoff of 4.1, and showed 69% sensitivity and 78% specificity in predicting severe disease. Cut off for PLR was 115.3, which showed 79% sensitivity and 62% specificity in predicting severe disease. Conclusion NLR and PLR, both showing acceptable AUCs, can be used as screening tools to predict disease severity. However, NLR was a better predictor of disease severity.","output":"Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Their Role as Predictors of Disease Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media may limit the exposure to diverse perspectives and favor the formation of groups of like-minded users framing and reinforcing a shared narrative, that is, echo chambers.

The Distress Thermometer is a short screening tool developed for use in oncology, to detect individuals who would benefit from further psychological assessment. However the optimal cut-off to detect indicative psychological morbidity in patients with advanced cancer receiving specialist palliative care is unclear. AIM To provide the first validation of the Distress Thermometer in an advanced cancer population receiving specialist palliative care in a UK hospice setting. DESIGN Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of cut-offs indicative of psychological morbidity on the Distress Thermometer in comparison to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Data were derived from 202 patients with advanced cancer who were approached on admission to inpatient or day hospice care, with 139 patients providing complete data on both measures. RESULTS The area under the curve was optimal using a Distress Thermometer cut-off score of ?6 for total distress and for anxiety, and a cut-off score of ?4 optimal when screening for depression. CONCLUSIONS The Distress Thermometer is a valid, accurate screening tool to be used in advanced cancer but with caution in relation to the lack of specificity. With little variation between the area under the curve scores, arguably a Distress Thermometer cut-off score of ?5 is most appropriate in screening for all types of psychological morbidity if sensitivity is to be prioritised.","output":"Validation of the Distress Thermometer in patients with advanced cancer receiving specialist palliative care in a hospice setting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complexity of brain tissue requires skillful technicians and expert medical doctors to manually analyze and diagnose Glioma brain tumors using multiple Magnetic Resonance (MR) images with multiple modalities.

Whereas undiluted CaHA is used to provide volume, hyperdilute CaHA is distributed across a much larger surface area in a more superficial plane to stimulate neocollagenesis and elastin formation over time. The absence of lymphocytic infiltrates and predominance of type 1 collagen in the tissue response to CaHA make hyperdilute CaHA a valuable tool for nonsurgical skin tightening. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide practical step-by-step guidance on patient selection, dilution practices, and optimal injection technique to facilitate incorporation of the technique into clinical practice.

The goal of Risk ID is to improve the detection and management of suicide risk by standardizing suicide risk screening and evaluation enterprise-wide. In order to ensure continuous quality improvement (QI), ongoing evaluation and targeted interventions to improve implementation of Risk ID are needed. Moreover, given that facilities will vary with respect to implementation needs and barriers, the dose and type of intervention needed may vary across facilities. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an adaptive implementation strategy to improve the uptake of suicide risk screening and evaluation in VHA ambulatory care settings. In addition, this study will examine specific factors that may impact the uptake of suicide risk screening and evaluation and the adoption of different implementation strategies. This protocol describes the stepped implementation approach and proposed evaluation plan. METHODS: Using a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, two evidence-based implementation strategies will be evaluated: (1) audit and feedback (A&F); (2) A&F plus external facilitation (A&F + EF). Implementation outcomes of interest include uptake of secondary suicide risk screening and uptake of comprehensive suicide risk evaluation (stages 2 and 3 of Risk ID). Secondary outcomes include rates of other clinical outcomes (i.e., safety planning) and organizational factors that may impact Risk ID implementation (i.e., leadership climate and leadership support). DISCUSSION: This national QI study will use a SMART design to evaluate whether an adaptive implementation strategy is effective in improving uptake of a mandated VHA-wide suicide risk screening and evaluation initiative. If this study finds that the proposed stepped implementation strategy is effective at increasing uptake and maintaining performance improvements, this approach may be used as an overarching QI strategy for other national suicide prevention programs.

METHODS We analyzed patients presenting with LVOs between June 2019 and October 2020. Thirty-one patients were treated between June 2019 and March 2020 (pre-app group). Thirty-three patients presented between March 2020 and October 2020 (post-app group). Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine variables that are not normally distributed. In a secondary analysis we analyzed interhospital time metrics between primary stroke centers and our comprehensive stroke center. RESULTS Baseline demographic and vascular risk factors were similar in both groups. Use of Rapid Mobile App resulted in 33 min reduction in DGPT (P=0.02), 35 min reduction in door to first pass time (P=0.02), and 37 min reduction in door to recanalization time (P=0.02) in univariate analyses when compared with patients treated pre-app. In a multiple linear regression model, utilization of Rapid Mobile App significantly predicted shorter DGPT (P=0.002).

The majority of respondents reported that recommendations from public health agencies were easy to understand, information on COVID-19 was easy to find, and they felt confident in keeping themselves safe from infection. Most also reported they would get tested for COVID-19 if they had been exposed to someone who tested positive.

Findings from this survey differ from other published studies and will be of interest to states with large rural, underserved, and minority populations as they tailor messaging for those most vulnerable. Findings also are now validated by Alabama's poor response to vaccine administration, which falls far short of the national vaccination rate, putting Alabamians at even greater risk.

However, data about digoxins impact in the setting of acute liver injury and sterile inflammation are still limited. Here, we investigated the potential effect of digoxin pretreatments (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, oral) on the severity of acute hepatotoxicity in mice challenged with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DN; 150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for 24 h. Our results indicated that digoxin pretreatments dose-dependently mitigated DN-induced rise of hepatocellular injury parameters and necroinflammation scores. Digoxin, particularly at dose of 0.5 mg/kg, boosted the number of PCNA positive hepatocytes, leading to improvement of the reparative potential in hepatocytes of DN-intoxicated livers. Digoxins ameliorative effect on DN-hepatotoxicity coincided with (i) lowering the increased hepatic production and release of the proinflammatory mediators IL-17A, IL-1 and TNF-, and (ii) impeding the attraction and infiltration of monocytes to the liver, as denoted by decreasing serum MCP-1 and F4/80 immunohistochemical expression. These effects were attributed to reducing DN-induced activation of NF-B and overexpression of CD98 in the liver. Meanwhile, DN elicited a decline in the hepatic production and release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-22 and IL-6, which was intensified by digoxin, especially at a dose 0.5 mg/kg. In conclusion, digoxin conferred liver protection against DN-insult by impairing the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and infiltration of inflammatory cells to the liver.","output":"Digoxin mitigates diethylnitrosamine-induced acute liver injury in mice via limiting production of inflammatory mediators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": Migration Health research has seen a recent surge of publications, but these are not evenly distributed across topics or countries. This is also seen in data on COVID19 and migrants in the past year. The Lancet Commission on Migration and Health (2018) calls for a paradigm shift in research and data available on migration and health. The COVID 19 pandemic has taught us that the availability of data or lack thereof has serious implications for policy and practise. Individual researchers often repeat small studies, fail to study important areas or identify gaps in particular related to policy and practise. There is a need to have a tool to identify the gaps in research, policy and practise at the country level. One such tool that has existed is MIPEX but it is dependent on external funding and collaboration between national and international researchers. The Joint Action on Health Equity Europe (JAHEE) aims to address inequities in health across all groups. Work Package 7 Migration and Health (WP7), includes 10 partner countries, focussing on equitable health for the migrant population. The project commenced with the development of a Policy framework for Action (PFA) forming the basis for exploring opportunities for appropriate actions in the three- year implementation period of the action. The PFA identified The Road Map, a 6-point summary of soft policy' instruments produced by international /governmental organisations since 2007. The PFA also discussed the state of the art in research on the causes of particular black spots', as well as the measures that can be taken to tackle them. The main objective of the JAHEE Country Assessment (CA) was to identify the best opportunities (entry points) for developing country specific actions (doable within the period with available resources). The purpose of the CA is to provide information that could enable each partner to make an informed choice about actions. To make this choice they need to know where the most serious inequities lie, what causes them, and what can be done about them. The Country assessment was developed based on the PFA, discussed and commented by the expert group and piloted in two countries Norway and Italy in March 2019. It was completed by 12 of the partners by end of 2019. It has guided the selection of feasible and complex actions in JAHEE that will be completed by end 2021. The main objective of this workshop is to share the experiences of the application of the country assessment tool and to review the possibility of using this tool in a larger regional/ global context. By harnessing experiences from the users of the tool and in discussion with potential users (WHO/IOM) we will be able to gather key lessons learnt and application of the tool in the future. We could mutually benefit from opening up channels of communication between potential users that could in turn contribute to the development of good-quality comparable country profiles on migration health. KEY MESSAGES: The Country Assessment Tool developed by WP7 JAHEE provides the basis for identifying inequity gaps for migrant health. Experiences from the use of the Country Assessment Tool indicate it could be used as a self- assessment tool but requires wider testing.","output":"6.H.

Other essays explore the pandemic from historical, sociological, and economic perspectives, particularly how triage policies have been found to be largely blind to structural healthcare disparities, while simultaneously unable to appropriately address those disparities. Central issues that need to be addressed in triage are not just whether a utilitarian response is the most just response, but what exactly is the greatest good for the greatest number? Together, the essays in this special issue of HEC Forum create a call for a more anthropological approach to understanding health and healthcare. The narrow approach of viewing health as resulting primarily from healthcare will continue to hinder advances and perpetuate disparities.

One of the major concerns regarding to IB is the emergence of new types of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs). The purpose of this study was to identify the IBVs isolated from Iranian broiler chickens with respiratory symptoms. Twenty-five broiler flocks around Ahwaz (southwest of Iran) were examined for IBV. The specimens including trachea, lung, liver, kidney, and ceacal tonsil, were collected from diseased birds and inoculated into chicken embryonated eggs. Harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers in order to amplify spike 1 (S1) gene of IBV. The RT-PCR products of four IBV isolates were sequenced. The results showed that from 25 examined flocks with respiratory disease, 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. In phylogenetic analysis, our isolates were closely related to the QX-like viruses such as PCRLab/06/2012 (Iran), QX, HC9, HC10, CK/CH/GX/NN11-1, CK/CH/JS/YC11-1, CK/CH/JS/2010/13, CK/CH/JS/2011/2 (China), QX/SGK-21, QX/SGK-11 (Iraq) with nucleotide homology up to 99.00%.

The major objective of the study was to see the microbes role in enhancement of agriculture production in the world. Total 13 articles were downloaded from the net and read many time. The abstract, Conclusion and recommendations were drawn. The analysis indicates that microbes play great role in agriculture production enhancement. Nitrogen fixation bacteria fix the nitrogen to the soil while the yeast and mold play great role in yogurts and wine making while some microbes decompose the organic matter. Algae provide protein to human being. Similarly some microbes create disease in the human and kill to them. The examples are the virus of small Pox and covid-2019 while some microbes spread the T.B in the human. Some virus destroys the leaves of the plant while the example is the mosaic virus in the tobacco. So many million microbes are present in this world and everyone has different duty. Some are beneficial while some are dangerous. These microbes cannot see with the help of common eye while with the help of microscope these microbes are seen. The scientists of microbiologist of the world try how to identify the useful microbes in this world for the beneficial of society but some time some dangerous microbes appear in this world which kill the person. The example is the corona virus, so the world microbiologists try how to invent the vaccine. For this purpose they work in the laboratory and invent the vaccines for controlling the diseases. The study concludes that microbes has great role in the development of agriculture and without microbes the development of agriculture is impossible. So every government of the world try how to identify the useful organism which play great role in agriculture development. Some time plant protectionists spray on plants for pest control while they have no knowledge about the useful microbes which play great role in the growth of the plant and through spray they kill the useful microbes which affect the growth of the plant negatively.So, now a day, more work on this project is run how to escape the useful microbes in this world. The study also explain that microbe improve the soil fertility while also play great role in yogurt and wine making. Without these microbes the product gaining is impossible. Now a day different technologies are used for the identification of the microbes. The well known microbes are the bacteria, Fungi and Virus. It is seen with the help of microscope. So with common eye its seen is impossible. The literature also indicates that it not only keep importance for agriculture purpose but also spread different disease in the world and kill the people.

Isolation of females from free social interactions first induces active contact-seeking, then depressive-like behavior, concurrent with a loss of Amylin mRNA expression in the MPOA. Reunion with peers induces physical contacts, activates both amylin- and Calcr-expressing neurons, and leads to a recovery of Amylin mRNA expression. Chemogenetic activation of amylin neurons increases and molecular knockdown of either amylin or Calcr attenuates contact-seeking behavior, respectively.

Financial accounting analyses were performed to determine the solvency, liquidity, profitability, and gearing capacity of 136 firms, with 680 economic entries, before CoVid-19 Outbreak. To scrutinise financial distress, the Altman Z-scores and financial zone of discriminations were generated through GB bankruptcy, and PLC bankruptcy model.

Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, there were no signs of declining profitability, economic collapse, or financial insolvency in the Philippines, according to the findings of the study. Individual components of financial distress and the overall z-score have no statistically meaningful association with financial performance and position markers. As a result, the solvency ratio has little predictive value in forecasting financial distress. The fact that a company has a higher solvency ratio does not also imply that it is less likely to go bankrupt. The findings go counter to classic accounting perspectives and pure managerial research that claim the solvency ratio is always a reliable predictor of financial distress.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively summarized the actions that were taken by our team, focusing on 18 battalions at the Israeli NC. These actions included promoting a series of organizational changes in terms of social distancing and medical regulations as well as working to strengthen medical leadership through designated video meetings with medical commanders across our organization. Meetings included relevant clinical education, updates, and leadership building. These actions and others were aimed to increase our influence on the decision-making processes. While we conducted real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests for soldiers who were suspected to have COVID-19 (those presenting with compatible signs and symptoms after having been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient), we were not able to screen healthy populations, nor did we have serum antibody serologic tests available during the study period.

This work aims to highlight the role that animals might play in the epidemiology of the disease. As knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 has progressed, most of the scientific information confirms that animals cannot transmit the virus to humans. There is evidence that people who have tested positive for COVID-19 can infect pets, farm animals, and wild animals. However, very recently, a SARS-Cov-2 variant related to minks has been found in mink workers in Denmark with a disease severity that is similar to those infected with non-mink-related variants. Further studies are therefore necessary. The concept of One Health recognizes the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health, and aims to improve public health outcomes through the understanding and prevention of risks that originate at the interfaces between humans, animals, and their environments. It is therefore important that veterinarians share information with public health officers to assess the risks of transmission from people infected with COVID-19 to animals, or to determine when animals could spread pandemic viruses. ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the Beta-coronavirus genus. It is 96.2% homologous to bat CoV RaTG13 and 88% homologous to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 is the infectious agent responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in the Hubei province of Wuhan, China, at the beginning of December 2019. Human transmission from COVID-19 patients or incubation carriers occurs via coughing, sneezing, speaking, discharge from the nose, or fecal contamination. Various strains of the virus have been reported around the world, with different virulence and behavior. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 shares certain epitopes with some taxonomically related viruses, with tropism for the most common synanthropic animals. By elucidating the immunological properties of the circulating SARS-CoV-2, a partial protection due to humanCanimal interactions could be supposed in some situations. In addition, differential epitopes could be used for the differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There have been cases of transmission from people with COVID-19 to pets such as cats and dogs. In addition, wild felines were infected. All These animals were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and recovered spontaneously. Experimental studies showed cats and ferrets to be more susceptible to COVID-19. COVID-19 positive dogs and felines do not transmit the infection to humans. In contrast, minks at farms were severely infected from people with COVID-19. A SARS-Cov-2 variant in the Danish farmed mink that had been previously infected by COVID-19 positive workers, spread to mink workers causing the first case of animal-to-human infection transmission that causes a moderate decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Thus, more investigations are necessary. It remains important to understand the risk that people with COVID-19 pose to their pets, as well as wild or farm animals so effective recommendations and risk management measures against COVID-19 can be made. A One Health unit that facilitates collaboration between public health and veterinary services is recommended.","output":"Do Animals Play a Role in the Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)?

At the frontlines of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple aspects of healthcare facilities have been significantly affected. To fill the information gap in the scientific literature, a small pilot study was conducted in this paper to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on service utilization and energy consumption in healthcare facilities. Monthly services utilization data including number of outpatients and emergency patients (NOEP), number of inpatients (NIP), and monthly total energy consumption (TEC) data of five Shanghai large-scale municipal hospitals have been utilized. The impacts were modeled using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with the normal period (January 2015-December 2019) and compared with COVID-19 period (January 2020-December 2020).

METHOD: A 58-item anonymous online survey was distributed during the period 30th April to 10(th) May via Qualtrics. The survey explored: a) demographic characteristics (age, sex, general health and where they were living during lockdown), b) changes in their contact lens use during lockdown, c) hygiene and contact lens compliance and d) concerns associated with contact lens wear and ways to support wearers during the pandemic. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty responses were analysed (38.8  11.4 years old, 75% female). Three-quarters of participants reported that they were self-isolating or rigorously following social distance advice. Sixty-seven percent of participants reported using their contact lenses less during the pandemic. Respondents were found to be compliant with handwashing prior to inserting and removing contact lenses (in both cases 97% doing this most times or every time). However, only 44% complied with the 20 second rule and 48% used a shared towel to dry their hands. A higher proportion of hydrogen peroxide users replaced the lens case monthly compared to multi-purpose users (64% vs.49%; p < 0.001). Twenty-four percent admitted wearing lenses whilst showering and 16% did not consider ceasing lens wear if feeling unwell with flu/cold symptoms. CONCLUSION: Eye care practitioners should continue to educate contact lens wearers to ensure safe contact lens wear to minimise the chance of developing contact lens related complications during the pandemic. Modifiable factors that need particular attention in Spain include: handwashing for at least 20 seconds before lens handling, drying hands with single use paper towels, including a rub-and-rinse step for reusable lenses, lens case cleaning and renewal, avoidance of water exposure and when to cease lens wear during the pandemic.","output":"Contact lens wear and care in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a rapid liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the direct detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in gargle solutions and saliva.

Validated methods that simultaneously address mind and body targets such as resilience may improve access and outcomes. We describe the development and implementation of the GRITT method and its impact on resilience, health care utilization (HCU), and opioid use in IBD. METHODS: Consecutive patients from an academic IBD center were evaluated for low resilience on the basis of provider referral. Low resilience patients were invited to participate in the GRITT program. Primary outcome was % reduction in HCU. Secondary outcomes were change in resilience and corticosteroid and opioid use. Patients were allocated into 2 groups for analysis: GRITT participants (GP) and non-participants (NP). Clinical data and HCU in the year before enrollment were collected at baseline and 12 months. One-way repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance evaluated group  time interactions for the primary outcome. Effect size was calculated for changes in resilience over time. RESULTS: Of 456 screened IBD patients 394 were eligible, 184 GP and 210 NP. GP had greater reduction in HCU than NP: 71% reduction in emergency department visits, 94% reduction in unplanned hospitalizations. There was 49% reduction in opioid use and 73% reduction in corticosteroid use in GP. Resilience increased by 27.3 points (59%), yielding a large effect size (d = 2.4).

For highly diverged sequences, such phylogenetic techniques sometimes estimate surprisingly recent divergence times. In the case of viruses, independent evidence indicates that the estimates of deep divergence times from molecular phylogenetics are sometimes too recent. This discrepancy is caused in part by inadequate models of purifying selection leading to branch-length underestimation. Here we examine the effect on branch-length estimation of using models that incorporate experimental measurements of purifying selection. We find that models informed by experimentally measured site-specific amino-acid preferences estimate longer deep branches on phylogenies of influenza virus hemagglutinin. This lengthening of branches is due to more realistic stationary states of the models, and is mostly independent of the branch-length-extension from modeling site-to-site variation in amino-acid substitution rate. The branch-length extension from experimentally informed site-specific models is similar to that achieved by other approaches that allow the stationary state to vary across sites. However, the improvements from all of these site-specific but time-homogeneous and site-independent models are limited by the fact that a protein's amino-acid preferences gradually shift as it evolves. Overall, our work underscores the importance of modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences when estimating deep divergence times---but also shows the inherent limitations of approaches that fail to account for how these preferences shift over time.","output":"Modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences deepens phylogenetic estimates of viral divergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The plasticity of responses to drugs is an ever-present confounding factor for all aspects of pharmacology, influencing drug discovery and development, clinical use and the expectations of the patient.

To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast, and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable of spreading the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticlesAuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope, and membrane)is red-shifted in few minutes when mixed with a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (C(t)) of a real-time PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of the real-time PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open a new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology, as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.","output":"Colorimetric Test for Fast Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasal and Throat Swabs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of yeast-containing probiotics is on the rise; however, these products occasionally cause fungal infections and possibly even fungemia among susceptible probiotic-treated patients. The incidence of such cases is probably underestimated, which is why it is important to delve deeper into the pathomechanism and the adaptive features of S. boulardii. Here in this study, the potential role of the gene heme oxygenase-1 (HMX1) in probiotic yeast bloodstream-derived infections was studied by generating marker-free HMX1 deletion mutants with CRISPR/Cas9 technology from both commercial and clinical S. boulardii isolates. The six commercial and clinical yeasts used here represented closely related but different genetic backgrounds as revealed by comparative genomic analysis. We compared the wild-type isolates against deletion mutants for their tolerance of iron starvation, hemolytic activity, as well as kidney burden in immunosuppressed BALB/c mice after lateral tail vein injection. Our results reveal that the lack of HMX1 in S. boulardii significantly (p < 0.0001) increases the kidney burden of the mice in most genetic backgrounds, while at the same time causes decreased growth in iron-deprived media in vitro. These findings indicate that even a single-gene loss-of-function mutation can, surprisingly, cause elevated fitness in the host during an opportunistic systemic infection. Our findings indicate that the safety assessment of S. boulardii strains should not only take strain-to-strain variation into account, but also avoid extrapolating in vitro results to in vivo virulence factor determination.","output":"Heme Oxygenase-1 (HMX1) Loss of Function Increases the In-Host Fitness of the Saccharomyces boulardii Probiotic Yeast in a Mouse Fungemia Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this research is to determine the Awareness Comprehend Interest Intention and Action levels of people in Banjarmasin City regarding the COVID-19 prevention and health protocol through advertisements.

Proton pump inhibitors, such as probenecid and niflumic acid, as well as a protonophore (carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone), markedly inhibited GL uptake by cultured cells, whereas vanadate exhibited a moderate inhibition. Furthermore, GL transport by G. glabra tonoplast vesicles is dependent not on a H(+)-electrochemical gradient but MgATP and is markedly inhibited by vanadate.

Tumours were subdivided into central (>3 cm from the capsule) (n = 22) and peripheral (<3 cm from the capsule) (n = 43). Imaging follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, then annually. Mean follow-up period was 18 months (range 1-55). Location of the lesion, age, sex, and underlying disease of the patients was analyzed and related with efficacy. RESULTS Technical success was obtained in all cases. Residual disease was registered in 21 lesions (32.3 %): 13 were peripheral and 8 were central. Twelve of them were retreated with percutaneous MWA. Local recurrence was recorded in 8 lesions (12.3 %): 5 were retreated with MWA. No significant difference in terms of effectiveness was observed in lesions located in a central position and those situated in the peripheral position.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our ability to obtain PFTs at recommended intervals, as patients were reluctant to come to the hospital and being advised to shelter in place to avoid unnecessary exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus. To obtain PFTs at our center during this time, we required negative Sars-CoV-2 testing for asymptomatic patients in the preceding 48C72 hours.We hypothesized that the extra trip away from home for viral testing affected our ability to adhere to the recommended PFT testing intervals.We sought to analyze the number of patients who did not have any PFTs completed since the start of the testing requirement. We also sought to analyze the positivity rate for Sars-CoV-2 associated with PFTs. Methods: All charts of CF patients ordered for PFTs and Sars-CoV-2 PCR testing from July 2020 to March 2021 were retrospectively queried for viral test results and either the subsequent completion or cancelation of a PFT appointment. Charts were ed for patient age, number of PFTs completed, and Sars-CoV-2 status. Results: Patient ages ranged from 6 years to 55 years. Of the 110 patients, 37 (34%)were under 18 years old. PFTswere ordered 134 times on 110 patients during the 9-month period, along with antecedent viral testing. Thirty-five patients (32%) did not have any PFTs completed in that time frame. None of the viral testing for Sars-CoV-2 prior to each PFT returned positive (0%). Nine patients (9%) tested positive independent of their PFT appointments and were tested due to symptoms, only 1 of whomwas a pediatric patient. Conclusion: At our single center of 121 patients, we found a 0% positivity rate of Sars-CoV-2 PCR in asymptomatic CF patients preparing for PFTs.We also found that since the implementation of this extra testing requirement, nearly one-third of our patients did not have any PFTs during the pandemic. With vaccination rates steadily increasing among both hospital staff and CF patients, we believe this low positivity rate argues for the removal of preprocedural viral testing in this population when asymptomatic, provided that we continue to utilize symptom screening questions, appropriate PPE, and appropriate room cleaning procedures as outlined by the American Thoracic Society.

One of the difficulties encountered in the virtual curriculum is the teaching of clinical competencies that would traditionally require students to undergo in-person simulations and patient encounters. We implemented a novel informed consent activity module, with standardized patients, to improve self-efficacy in communication within our core surgery clerkship. STUDY DESIGN: All medical students who participated in the virtual surgery clerkship were recruited to participate in a retrospective survey study regarding the novel informed consent module. These questions evaluated their perceived competence in 4 domains relating to informed consent: identifying the key elements, describing common challenges, applying the New Mexico Clinical Communication Scale (NMCCS), and documenting. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 90 students participated in the study (38% of the cohort). Respondents to the survey reported that their self-efficacy in communication skills related to informed consent improved as a result of their participation in the activity in each of the 4 domains surveyed (p < 0.01), with the majority of students identifying as satisfactory or above in each domain post-module. Students generally viewed the virtual informed consent activity positively, but noted that it was not the same as an in-person clinical experience. CONCLUSIONS: A virtual module of communication skills training, using standardized patients and faculty, improved students' belief in their self-efficacy in obtaining informed consent.

The purified Fc-RBDOmicron automatically formed a dimer depending on the nature of the Fc tag, thus assembling onto the nanoparticles by the Fc-protein A tag interaction (FNP-Fc-RBDOmicron). The results of hACE2-transgenic mice immunization showed that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron RBD-specific IgG titer induced by FNP-Fc-RBDOmicron was much higher than that by Fc-RBDOmicron. Consistently, the sera showed a higher neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 in the FNP-Fc-RBDOmicron immunized mice, indicating that immunization of a self-assembling ferritin-based nanoparticle vaccine offers a robust humoral immune response against Omicron variants. This study offers a great potential for the quick response of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and affords versatility to develop universal vaccines against other emerging and reemerging coronaviruses in the future.","output":"Development of a ferritin-based nanoparticle vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assembly of minimal genomes revealed many genes encoding unknown functions. Three overlooked functional categories account for some of them. Cells are prone to make errors and age. As a first key function, discrimination between proper and changed entities is indispensable. Discrimination requires management of information, an authentic, yet , currency of reality. For example proteins age, sometimes very fast. The cell must identify, then get rid of old proteins without destroying young ones. Implementing discrimination in cells leads to the second set of functions, usually ignored. Being , information must nevertheless be embodied into material entities, with unavoidable idiosyncratic properties. This brings about novel unmet needs. Hence, the buildup of cells elicits specific but awkward material implementations, kludges that become essential under particular settings, while difficult to identify. Finally, a third functional category characterizes the need for growth, with metabolic implementations allowing the cell to put together the growth of its cytoplasm, membranes, and genome, spanning different spatial dimensions. Solving this metabolic quandary, critical for engineering novel synthetic biology chassis, uncovered an unexpected role for CTP synthetase as the coordinator of nonhomothetic growth. Because a significant number of SynBio constructs aim at creating cell factories we expect that they will be attacked by viruses (it is not by chance that the function of the CRISPR system was identified in industrial settings).

Objectives The objectives were to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating efficacy, safety and satisfaction of medical abortion at  12 weeks' gestation. Data sources We searched PubMed, Popline, Embase, Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from January 2008 to May 2017. Study eligibility participants and interventions We included RCTs on medical abortion at  12 weeks' gestation using mifepristone and/or misoprostol. We excluded studies with spontaneous abortion, fetal demise and mechanical cervical ripening and those not reporting ongoing pregnancy (OP). Study appraisal and synthesis methods After extracting prespecified data and assessing risk of bias in accordance with the Cochrane handbook, we used Revman5 software to combine data and GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Results We included 43 of the 1894 references identified. Combination mifepristone-misoprostol had lower rates of OP [risk ratio (RR) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.35] vs. misoprostol only. A 24-h interval between mifepristone and misoprostol had lower OP rate at 24 h than simultaneous dosing (RR 3.13, 95% CI 1.23-7.94). Every 3-h dosing had lower OP rate at 48 h (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17-0.88). Limitations Direct comparisons of buccal misoprostol to sublingual or vaginal routes after mifepristone were limited. Evidence from clinical trials on how to best manage women with prior uterine incisions was lacking. Conclusion Our analysis supports the use of mifepristone 200 mg 1 to 2 days before misoprostol 400 mcg vaginally every 3 h at  12 weeks' gestation. Implications Where available, providers should use mifepristone plus misoprostol for second-trimester medical abortion. Vaginal misoprostol appears to be most efficacious with fewest side effects, but sublingual and buccal routes are also acceptable.","output":"Medical regimens for abortion at 12 weeks and above: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bioluminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized in situ using dithiol-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG(SH)(2)) as reducer and stabilizing agents. Hybrid Au/F(3)O(4) nanoparticles were also produced in a variation of synthesis, and both types of nanostructures had the polymer capping replaced by l-cysteine (Cys). The four types of nanoparticles, PEG(SH)(2)AuNPs, PEG(SH)(2)Au/F(3)O(4)NPs, CysAuNPs, and CysAu/F(3)O(4)NPs were associated with purified recombinant Pyrearinus termitilluminans green emitting click beetle luciferase (PyLuc) and Phrixotrix hirtus (RELuc) red-emitting railroad worm luciferase. Enzyme association with PEG(SH)(2) was also investigated as a control. Luciferases were chosen because they catalyze bioluminescent reactions used in a wide range of bioanalytical applications, including ATP assays, gene reporting, high-throughput screening, bioluminescence imaging, biosensors and other bioluminescence-based assays. The immobilization of PyLuc and RELuc promoted partial suppression of the enzyme luminescence activity in a functionalization-dependent way. Association of PyLuc and RELuc with AuNPs increased the enzyme operational stability in relation to the free enzyme, as evidenced by the luminescence intensity from 0 to 7 h after substrate addition. The stability of the immobilized enzymes was also functionalization-dependent and the association with CysAuNPs was the condition that combined more sustained luminescent activity with a low degree of luminescence quenching. The higher enzymatic stability and sustained luminescence of luciferases associated with nanoparticles may improve the applicability of bioluminescence for bioimaging and biosensing purposes.

As a result, these patients require regular monitoring of the complete blood counts (CBC) for optimal patient care. To reduce the strain on the patient, there is a need for a point-of-care (POC) hematology device that provides rapid and reliable results both in general and in cytopenic samples and is suitable for outpatient clinics. We evaluated the HemoScreen device for the most used CBC parameter both overall and at the lower range. METHODS: The HemoScreen was compared with the Sysmex XN-9000 in 206 routine venous samples and 79 capillary bedside samples focusing on white blood cells (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), red blood cells (RBC), PLT and HGB. RESULTS: The HemoScreen was less precise compared to the acceptance criteria set for larger and more advanced hematology instrument with a CV% 3.0-3.7 for WBCs, 3.6-8.4 for ANCs, 1.1-1.5 for RBCs, 2.5-4.4 for PLTs, and 1.7-2.3 for HGB. Correlation coefficient for all five parameters for the entire range was r >.95 and r >.90 at lower range for venous and capillary samples. Bias limits were within the CTCAE acceptance limits. CONCLUSIONS: The HemoScreen provides rapid and accurate test results, for evaluation of WBC, PLT, and HGB, as well as at low concentrations for guiding transfusions and postchemotherapy treatment.

However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease. In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity. METHODS: We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms. We followed up patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected &#8805;24 hours apart. We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4  3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3  2.2 bowel movements per day. Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom. Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0  7.7 vs 11.6  5.1 days, P < 0.001).

Over the last thirty years, improved understanding of multiple myeloma and therapeutic advancements have dramatically improved outcomes for patients. Recently, advances in immunotherapy have revolutionized standard-of-care therapies and provided therapeutic options for patients with heavily pretreated, relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving field, and this review encompasses the immunotherapies that are currently used to treat myeloma patients as well as recent advances that are poised to advance myeloma therapeutics in the coming years. ABSTRACT: Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease of malignant plasma cells and an ideal target for modern immune therapy. The unique plasma cell biology maintained in multiple myeloma, coupled with its hematological nature and unique bone marrow microenvironment, provide an opportunity to design specifically targeted immunotherapies that selectively kill transformed cells with limited on-target off-tumor effects. Broadly defined, immune therapy is the utilization of the immune system and immune agents to treat a disease. In the context of multiple myeloma, immune therapy can be subdivided into four main categories: immune modulatory imide drugs, targeted antibodies, adoptive cell transfer therapies, and vaccines. In recent years, advances in all four of these categories have led to improved therapies with enhanced antitumor activity and specificity. In IMiDs, modified chemical structures have been developed that improve drug potency while reducing dose limiting side effects. Targeted antibody therapies have resulted from the development of new selectively expressed targets as well as the development of antibody drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies. Adoptive cell therapies, particularly CAR-T therapies, have been enhanced through improvements in the manufacturing process, as well as through the development of CAR constructs that enhance CAR-T activation and provide protection from a suppressive immune microenvironment. This review will first cover in-class breakthrough therapies for each of these categories, as well as therapies currently utilized in the clinic. Additionally, this review will explore up and coming therapeutics in the preclinical and clinical trial stage.","output":"Keeping Myeloma in Check: The Past, Present and Future of Immunotherapy in Multiple Myeloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10 1371/journal pone 0249128 ]","output":"Correction: Is the heart rate variability monitoring using the analgesia nociception index a predictor of illness severity and mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19?

To better explore the infection mechanism and treatment, the three-dimensional structure of human bronchus has been employed in a better in-depth study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We downloaded a separate microarray from the Integrated Gene Expression System (GEO) on a human bronchial organoids sample to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGS) and analyzed it with R software. After processing with R software, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto PBMCs of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were analyzed, while a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to show the interactions and influence relationships between these differential genes. Finally, the selected highly connected genes, which are called hub genes, were verified in CytoHubba plug-in. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 966 differentially expressed genes, including 490 upregulated genes and 476 downregulated genes were used. Analysis of GO and KEGG revealed that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in pathways related to immune response and cytokines. We construct protein-protein interaction network and identify 10 hub genes, including IL6, MMP9, IL1B, CXCL8, ICAM1, FGF2, EGF, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and FN1. Finally, with the help of GSE150728, we verified that CXCl1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5, EGF differently expressed before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical patients.

The Pets for Life (PFL) program has partnered with the Penn Vet Shelter Medicine Program to provide veterinary appointments to clients, at no cost to the client, in underserved zip codes through virtual telehealth visits. These visits incorporated veterinary students as part of their clinical rotations through a service learning based model. Between January and August 2021, 31 PFL clients and nine veterinary students completed surveys to describe the role of telehealth in addressing barriers to accessing veterinary care, their perceptions of telehealth appointments, the human-animal bond, and changes in veterinary student empathy. PFL clients completed the survey immediately following their telehealth appointment, and veterinary students completed surveys prior to and following their participation in the PFL appointments during the rotation. Nearly 25% of clients reported that they would not have been able to secure transportation and 58% reported they would not have been able to afford an appointment at an in-person veterinary clinic. The population of clients who responded that cost was a significant barrier to accessing care did not entirely overlap with those who responded that transportation was a significant barrier to accessing care, indicating support for the use of telehealth in providing an alternative modality to address transportation challenges as a barrier to accessing veterinary care. Additional data suggests that both client and student experience was overwhelmingly positive, providing support for further service learning initiatives in veterinary student education.

Surgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms remained the definitive mode of treatment until Guglielmi detachable coils were introduced in the 1990s. This revolutionary innovation led to the recognition of neurointervention/neuroendovascular surgery as a bona fide option for intracranial aneurysms. Constant evolution of endovascular devices and techniques supported by several prospective randomized trials has catapulted the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms to its current status as the preferred treatment modality for most ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. We are slowly transitioning from the era of coils to the era of flow diverters. Flow-diversion technology and techniques have revolutionized the treatment of wide-necked, giant, and fusiform aneurysms, where the results of microsurgery or conventional neuroendovascular strategies have traditionally been dismal.

Using information about attitudes of respondents to the General Social Survey, we find evidence that experiencing the pandemic likely had permanent consequences in terms of individuals' social trust. Our findings suggest that lower social trust was passed on to the descendants of the survivors of the Spanish Flu who migrated to the United States. As trust is a crucial factor for long\\\\term economic development, our research offers a new angle from which to assess current health threats.","output":"Epidemics and trust: The case of the Spanish Flu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is transforming the global economy and significantly shifting workforce demand, requiring quick, adaptive responses.

METHODS The data came from the prospective national representative Sant et Itinraire Professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to measure MDE and GAD. Analyses were performed using weighted generalized estimation equations, and were stratified by gender. RESULTS No changes in MDE and GAD were observed for both genders among the working population. No differential changes were observed, except one: the prevalence of GAD increased among women working in the public sector while there was no change among women in the private sector. LIMITATIONS Two data collections over a 4-year period may not capture the effects of the crisis on mental disorders properly. CONCLUSION No changes in mental disorders between 2006 and 2010 were found but the increase in the prevalence of anxiety among women in the public sector may be of particular interest for prevention policies.

High lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on admission are associated with severity and mortality. Different degrees of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) abnormalities have been reported in these patients, its association with a mortality risk remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between LDH and in-hospital mortality in Mexican patients admitted with COVID-19.

To implement prevention strategies it is important to gain information on management and to point out risk factors. The objective of this internet based survey was to describe calf management practices on registered dairy breeding farms in Austria and to estimate differences in calf disease incidences depending on farm structure and management practices. RESULTS: A total of 1287 questionnaires were finally analysed (response rate 12.2 %). Herd characteristics and regional distribution of farms indicated that this survey gives a good overview on calf management practices on registered dairy farms in Austria. The median number of cows per farm was 20 (interquartile range 13C30). Significant differences regarding farm characteristics and calf management between small and large farms (20 vs >20 cows) were present. Only 2.8 % of farmers tested first colostrum quality by use of a hydrometer. Storing frozen colostrum was more prevalent on large farms (80.8 vs 64.2 %). On 85.1 % of the farms, whole milk, including waste milk, was fed to the calves. Milk replacer and waste milk were more often used on large farms. In accordance with similar studies from other countries, calf diarrhoea was indicated as the most prevalent disease. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that herd size was associated with calf diarrhoea and calf respiratory tract disease, with higher risk of disease on large farms. Furthermore, feeding waste milk to the calves was associated with increasing calf diarrhoea incidence on farm. In the final model with calf respiratory tract disease as outcome, respondents from organic farms reported less often a respiratory tract disease incidence of over 10 % compared with conventional farms [odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.21C0.75] and farmers that housed calves individually or in groups after birth significantly reported more often to have an incidence of respiratory tract disease >10 % compared with farms where all calves were housed individually (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.16C4.48).

Infection at the surgical site where mesh is present poses a formidable clinical problem. METHODS The current surgical literature was reviewed to formulate accepted approaches to the management of hernia repairs with infected mesh. RESULTS Prevention of mesh infection is best achieved by judicious use of systemic antibiotics. Topical antibiotics often are used without convincing evidence to support their value. Laparoscopic repairs have lower infection rates than open repairs. Evidence is lacking to support lower rates of infection with mesh of specific composition or with antibacterial agents that coat the mesh. The diagnosis of mesh infection is principally a clinical one. Repairs of infected mesh usually necessitate antibiotics and removal of the foreign material. Clinical judgment is required for attempts at salvaging portions of the mesh. Component separation or biological materials may be used in those circumstances for hernia repair in which large defects are created by removal of the infected synthetic material. CONCLUSIONS Prevention of mesh infections remains the best strategy. Clinical judgment is essential in determining the degree of mesh removal.

Stomach cancer Adjuvant Multi-Institutional group Trial (SAMIT) was a 22 factorial randomised phase III study in which patients with GC were randomised to Pac-S-1 (paclitaxel +S-1), Pac-UFT (paclitaxel +UFT), S-1 alone or UFT alone after curative surgery. DESIGN The primary objective of this study was to identify a gene signature that predicts survival benefit from paclitaxel chemotherapy in GC patients. SAMIT GC samples were profiled using a customised 476 gene NanoString panel. A random forest machine-learning model was applied on the NanoString profiles to develop a gene signature. An independent cohort of metastatic patients with GC treated with paclitaxel and ramucirumab (Pac-Ram) served as an external validation cohort. RESULTS From the SAMIT trial 499 samples were analysed in this study. From the Pac-S-1 training cohort, the random forest model generated a 19-gene signature assigning patients to two groups: Pac-Sensitive and Pac-Resistant. In the Pac-UFT validation cohort, Pac-Sensitive patients exhibited a significant improvement in disease free survival (DFS): 3-year DFS 66% vs 40% (HR 0.44, p=0.0029). There was no survival difference between Pac-Sensitive and Pac-Resistant in the UFT or S-1 alone arms, test of interaction p<0.001. In the external Pac-Ram validation cohort, the signature predicted benefit for Pac-Sensitive (median PFS 147 days vs 112 days, HR 0.48, p=0.022). CONCLUSION Using machine-learning techniques on one of the largest GC trials (SAMIT), we identify a gene signature representing the first predictive biomarker for paclitaxel benefit.

OBJECTIVES: To describe COVID-19 patients who presented with complications due to Candida bloodstream co-infection (candidemia) and their outcome in a single center in northern Israel (Emek Medical Center) during the second outbreak of COVID-19 in Israel (15 June 2020 to 20 September 2020). METHODS: A retrospective study of COVID-19 patients presenting with candidemia was conducted, including clinical and laboratory data. The incidence of candidemia among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was compared to a historical cohort of non-COVID-19 controls. RESULTS: Three COVID-19 patients complicated with candidemia were documented. All three patients died shortly after the detection of candidemia. Three different Candida sp. were isolated from the blood cultures: C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata. The incidence of candidemia among COVID-19 patients was 0.679 episodes per 1000 hospital days. CONCLUSIONS: Our small sample suggests a much higher incidence of candidemia among COVID-19 patients compared to a historical cohort of non-COVID-19 controls.

Therefore, mucosal immunity can efficiently inhibit viral colonization. Since vaccine material delivery into immune sites is important for efficient oral mucosal vaccination, the M cell-targeting approach is important for effective vaccination given M cells are vital for luminal antigen influx into the mucosal lymph tissues. In this study, we coupled M cell-targeting ligand Co1 to multi-epitope TB1 of FMDV to obtain TB1-Co1 in order to improve delivery efficiency of the multi-epitope protein antigen TB1. Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) was engineered to express heterologous antigens for applications as vaccine vehicles with the ability to elicit mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. We successfully constructed L. lactis (recombinant) with the ability to express multi-epitope antigen proteins (TB1 and TB1-Co1) of the FMDV serotype A (named L. lactis-TB1 and L. lactis-TB1-Co1). Then, we investigated the immunogenic potential of the constructed recombinant L. lactis in mice and guinea pigs. Orally administered L. lactis-TB1 as well as L. lactis-TB1-Co1 in mice effectively induced mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA) and IgG secretion, development of a strong cell-mediated immune reactions, substantial T lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen, and upregulated IL-2, IFN-, IL-10, and IL-5 levels. Orally administered ligand-conjugated TB1 promoted specific IgG as well as SIgA responses in systemic and mucosal surfaces, respectively, when compared to orally administered TB1 alone. Then, guinea pigs were orally vaccinated with L. lactis-TB1-Co1 plus adjuvant CpG-ODN at three different doses, L. lactis-TB1-Co1, and PBS. Animals that had been immunized with L. lactis-TB1-Co1 plus adjuvant CpG-ODN and L. lactis-TB1-Co1 developed elevated antigen-specific serum IgG, IgA, neutralizing antibody, and mucosal SIgA levels, when compared to control groups. Particularly, in mice, L. lactis-TB1-Co1 exhibited excellent immune effects than L. lactis-TB1. Therefore, L. lactis-TB1-Co1 can induce elevations in mucosal as well as systemic immune reactions, and to a certain extent, provide protection against FMDV. In conclusion, M cell-targeting approaches can be employed in the development of effective oral mucosa vaccines for FMDV.","output":"Immune Responses to Orally Administered Recombinant Lactococcus lactis Expressing Multi-Epitope Proteins Targeting M Cells of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the emergence of a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially characterized by fever, sore throat, cough, and dyspnea, mainly manifestations of respiratory system. However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new-onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.","output":"COVID-19 is a Real Headache!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To design and construct a new synthetic nanobody library using a structure-based approach that seeks to maintain high protein stability and increase the number of functional variants within the combinatorial space of mutations. RESULTS: Synthetic nanobody (Nb) libraries are emerging as an attractive alternative to animal immunization for the selection of stable, high affinity Nbs. Two key features define a synthetic Nb library: framework selection and CDR design. We selected the universal VHH framework from the cAbBCII10 Nb. CDR1 and CDR2 were designed with the same fixed length as in cAbBCII10, while for CDR3 we chose a 14-long loop, which creates a convex binding site topology. Based on the analysis of the cAbBCII10 crystal structure, we carefully selected the positions to be randomized and tailored the codon usage at each position, keeping at particular places amino acids that guarantee stability, favoring properties like polarity at solvent-exposed positions and avoiding destabilizing amino acids. Gene synthesis and library construction were carried out by GenScript, using our own phagemid vector. The constructed library has an estimated size of 1.75  10(8).

This balancing act raised critical questions in medical education as institutions reacted to changing guidelines. COVID-19 has punctuated already contentious areas of medical education and has forced institutions and organizations to take quick action. From the perspectives of a recent medical school graduate and current resident (ES) and a practicing clinician-educator (SHG), we examine the pandemics impact on undergraduate medical education through an ethical lens.

We next consider student choice and how shifts toward utilitarianism in healthcare during a pandemic may affect learning and career exploration. Then, we inquire how access to technology may impact the experience of medical students from diverse backgrounds and varied institutions during a rapid shift to socially distanced learning. We identify vulnerabilities for students at several phases of the journey: premedical, preclinical, clinical, and preparation for residency.

This study aimed to examine the impact of health- and social-inequality-related factors on well-being in order to further distinguish each of their effects during the pandemic. Methods: A nationally-representative sample of 5077 UK respondents aged 18 years or older was recruited through an online survey panel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their subjective well-being was measured using the 11-point Cantril Ladder of Life Scale. The impact of inequality-related health and social factors (pre-existing medical conditions, household size and occupation), as well as COVID-19-related risk factors (symptoms, confirmed infections, and social distancing behaviours) on well-being were analysed using multiple linear regression models. The associations between the COVID-19-related risk factors and well-being according to the respondents' household size and occupation were modelled in order to test the differences by their socioeconomic profile. Results: We identified inverted V-shaped associations between household size and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to single-person households, respondents from households of two to four persons showed better well-being (? = 0.57; CI (0.44, 0.72)), whereas living in crowded households of five persons or more was associated with decreased well-being (? = -0.48; CI (-0.71, -0.25)). Furthermore, lower-skilled occupations (elementary occupations: ? = -0.31; CI (-0.58, -0.03); logistics and transport services: ? = -0.37; CI (-0.74, -0.01)) and chronic medical conditions (cardiometabolic or respiratory diseases: ? = -0.25; CI (-0.41, -0.1); and mental health conditions: ? = -1.12; CI (-1.28, -0.96)) were factors associated with reduced well-being during the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: We describe the construction of machine-learning models for current-visit prediction (CVP), which can help physicians obtain more information for accurate diagnosis, and next-visit prediction (NVP), which can help physicians provide potential high-risk patients with advice to effectively prevent FLD. METHODS: The large-scale and high-dimensional dataset used in this study comes from Taipei MJ Health Research Foundation in Taiwan. We used one-pass ranking and sequential forward selection (SFS) for feature selection in FLD prediction. For CVP, we explored multiple models, including k-nearest-neighbor classifier (KNNC), Adaboost, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), Gaussian na?ve Bayes (GNB), decision trees C4.5 (C4.5), and classification and regression trees (CART). For NVP, we used long short-term memory (LSTM) and several of its variants as sequence classifiers that use various input sets for prediction. Model performance was evaluated based on two criteria: the accuracy of the test set and the intersection over union/coverage between the features selected by one-pass ranking/SFS and by domain experts. The accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated for both CVP and NVP for males and females, respectively. RESULTS: After data cleaning, the dataset included 34,856 and 31,394 unique visits respectively for males and females for the period 2009-2016. The test accuracy of CVP using KNNC, Adaboost, SVM, LR, RF, GNB, C4.5, and CART was respectively 84.28%, 83.84%, 82.22%, 82.21%, 76.03%, 75.78%, and 75.53%.

Resultados Comparando os perodos 2019/2020 e 2020/2021 observamos que houve uma reduo no nmero de candidatos  doao de 20,4% (11885 para 9455), mas a inaptid?o na triagem passou de 29,2% para 25,0%. O indicador de Tempo de Permanncia passou da mdia de 68,1 para 55,9 minutos. Discuss?o Com a implantao do agendamento de doadores percebemos, que apesar da reduo do nmero de candidatos  doao, houve uma melhora nos indicadores de inaptid?o na triagem e aumento das bolsas coletadas. A meta deste indicador em 2019/2020 era 30% e em 2020/2021 reduzimos para 26%. Neste primeiro perodo tivemos meses com perda de 28% e, com o agendamento, tivemos ms com apenas 14,7% de inaptid?o na triagem. A meta do indicador de tempo de permanncia reduziu-se de 80 para 60 minutos. Os motivos como repouso insuficiente, jejum prolongado e uso de medicamentos, que eram as primeiras causas de inaptid?o, reduziram em raz?o da orientao que cada doador recebia das funcionrias da recepo e captao na hora do agendamento. Com o agendamento por hora tambm evitamos o acmulo de atendimento em determinados dias e horrios o que reduziu o tempo de espera. Houve perodos em que o candidato  doao esperava at 150 minutos para passar por todo processo de doao e hoje, ele leva menos de 60 minutos para realizar todo este processo. Conclus?o Apesar da reduo do nmero de candidatos  doao, percebemos uma perda menor destes na triagem clnica em raz?o das orientaes individuais no momento do agendamento. O tempo de permanncia reduziu-se consideravelmente e percebemos a melhora na qualidade do atendimento ao candidato  doao. Com estes resultados, pensamos em manter o atendimento por agendamento aps o fim das restries adotadas pela pandemia de COVID-19, tendo conscincia, que num futuro prximo, deveremos nos adequar ao aumento da demanda de hemocomponentes com a liberao das cirurgias eletivas e aumento das emergncias.","output":"IMPACTO DA IMPLANTAO DO AGENDAMENTO DAS DOAES DE SANGUE EM PERODO DE EPIDEMIA DE COVID NOS INDICADORES DE QUALIDADE DO HEMONCLEO REGIONAL DE ARARAQUARA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) are critical for protecting essential personnel and limiting the spread of disease. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, FFR supplies are dwindling in many health systems, necessitating re-use of potentially contaminated FFR. Multiple decontamination solutions have been developed to meet this pressing need, including systems designed for bulk decontamination of FFR using vaporous hydrogen peroxide or ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation. However, the large scale on which these devices operate may not be logistically practical for small or rural health care settings or for ad hoc use at points-of-care. METHODS: Here, we present the Synchronous UV Decontamination System, a novel device for rapidly deployable, point-of-care decontamination using UV-C germicidal irradiation. We designed a compact, easy-to-use device capable of delivering over 2 J cm2 of UV-C radiation in one minute. RESULTS: We experimentally tested Synchronous UV Decontamination System' microbicidal capacity and found that it eliminates near all virus from the surface of tested FFRs, with less efficacy against pathogens embedded in the inner layers of the masks. CONCLUSIONS: This short decontamination time should enable care-providers to incorporate decontamination of FFR into a normal donning and doffing routine following patient encounters.","output":"UV-C tower for point-of-care decontamination of filtering facepiece respirators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) are known to be at increased risk for other conditions resulting from pathogenic changes (including metaplastic or anaplastic) in the lungs and other organs and organ systems, it is still unknown whether COVID\\\\19 affects childhood intelligence.

METHODOLOGY Eight infection-management instructors working in one of the eight Cambodian government hospitals in a large city were interviewed with the WHO Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework. RESULTS The mean Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework score across the eight hospitals was 177.81  56.73. The overall level of compliance with the multimodal hand hygiene improvement strategy across these eight hospitals was basic-two hospitals scored inadequate and six hospitals scored basic. The scores for the 5 factors of the Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework were as follows: 45.63  15.45 for system change, 33.13  16.89 for education and training, 27.81  21.65 for evaluation and feedback, 58.13  5.30 for reminders in the workplace, and 13.13  11.00 for institutional safety climate for hand hygiene CONCLUSIONS: The promotion of hand hygiene compliance requires the establishment of a basic infrastructure, reinforcement of the hand hygiene education system, and provision of diverse educational materials, as well as the fostering of a professional workforce for education.

The present study aims to conduct Polish adaptation and validation of the Authorized Bratman Orthorexia Self-Test (ABOST), through a comparison of dichotomous and continuous Likert response scales. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 472 people with mean age of 27 years (ranging between 18 and 78 years, M = 26.88, SD = 10.40). The survey included demographic questions and measures of orthorexia (the ABOST and ORTO-15), eating disorders (EAT-26), body mass index (BMI), obsessiveCcompulsive disorder (OCI-R), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9). The following statistical tests were performed to explore the psychometric properties of the ABOST: descriptive statistics, Students t-test, Pearsons correlation, Cronbachs  reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The ABOST using a five-point Likert scale for responses demonstrated good psychometric properties. The CFA goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the one-factor solution. Positive correlations were found between the ABOST and the ORTO-15, EAT-26, OCI-R, GAD-7, and PHQ-9. Women scored higher in the ABOST than men, while BMI was unrelated to the ABOST.

However, emerging evidence indicates that a small, but a growing number of COVID\\\\19 patients also manifest neurological symptoms, suggesting that SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 may infect the nervous system under some circumstances. SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 primarily enters the body through the epithelial lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but under certain conditions this pleiotropic virus may also infect peripheral nerves and gain entry into the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is shielded by various anatomical and physiological barriers, most notably the blood\\\\brain barrier (BBB) which functions to prevent harmful substances, including pathogens and pro\\\\inflammatory mediators, from entering the brain. The BBB is composed of highly specialized endothelial cells, pericytes, mast cells and astrocytes that form the neurovascular unit, which regulates BBB permeability and maintains the integrity of the CNS. In this review, we briefly discuss potential routes of viral entry and the possible mechanisms utilized by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 to penetrate the CNS, either by disrupting the BBB or infecting the peripheral nerves and using the neuronal network to initiate neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we speculate on the long\\\\term effects of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection on the brain and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases known to be associated with other human coronaviruses. Although the mechanisms of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 entry into the CNS and neurovirulence are currently unknown, the potential pathways described here might pave the way for future research in this area and enable the development of better therapeutic strategies.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\\\\2 may be an underappreciated pathogen of the central nervous system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the way psychiatry is taught.

Nucleos(t)ide analogs and interferons are the current standards of care due to their suppression of HBV replication, but the treatments rarely eradicate HBV from individuals. Similar to current treatments for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, improved HBV therapies will require the combination of multiple drugs which target distinct steps of the HBV life cycle. In this study, we tested the potential of a cyclophilin inhibitor, CRV431, to affect HBV replication in transgenic mice. We found that oral treatment with CRV431 (50 mg/kg/day) for a period of 16 days significantly reduced liver HBV DNA levels and moderately decreased serum HBsAg levels. We observed an additive inhibitory effect on liver HBV DNA levels in mice treated with a combination of low doses of CRV431 (10 mg/kg/day) and the nucleotide prodrug, tenofovir exalidex (TXL), (5 mg/kg/day). No toxicity was observed in CRV431-treated mice. Although it is well known that CRV431 neutralizes the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of cyclophilins, its anti-HBV mechanism(s) of action remains unknown.

However, there are limited examples of serial testing with correlated clinical metadata, especially in the outpatient setting. Method: We developed a method to collect serial saliva samples on ordinary white printer paper, which can be subsequently analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using established polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures. The collection systems consisted of a biological diary (CoronaCal) where subjects dab their saliva onto ovals printed onto paper. The dried samples are covered with a sticker that includes a symptom checklist to create a biological diary. Each sheet of letter paper can accommodate up to 14 serial samples. Results: In a pilot study, ten subjects used CoronaCals for durations of nine to 44 days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted and detected in CoronaCals from nine of nine people with either Covid-19 symptoms or exposure to someone with Covid-19, and in zero of one asymptomatic person. The CoronaCals were stored for up to 70 days at room temperature during collection and then frozen for up to four months before analysis, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is stable once dried onto paper. Interestingly, the temporal pattern of symptoms was not well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serial daily collections for up to 44 days. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was discontinuous over time in most cases but persisted for up to 24 days. Conclusions: We conclude that sampling of saliva on simple paper CoronaCals may provide a useful method to study the natural history and epidemiology of Covid-19. The CoronaCal collection and testing method we developed is also easy to implement, inexpensive, non-invasive, and scalable.

Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) were measured using pulse oximetry at the right hand/wrist. In each neonate, either NIRO 200NX (Hamamatsu, Japan) or INVOS 5100C (Covidien-Medtronic, USA) were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation index (cTOI) and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (crSO2), respectively. SpO2, HR, and cTOI/crSO2 during and 1 min before and after successful venous punctures were analyzed. RESULTS 70 protocols were reviewed. Data of 61 preterm neonates were analyzed. Mean gestational age was 31.5  2.2 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 1,527  541 g. In median, it needed one attempt [interquartile range (IQR) 1-2] to establish a peripheral venous catheter. In median, intravenous (IV) catheterization was successfully established 5 (IQR 4-9) min after birth. SpO2 and cTOI/crSO2 rose significantly following the percentiles during the first 10 min after the birth. HR did not change significantly. CONCLUSION Peripheral IV catheterization during postnatal stabilization of preterm infants is feasible and successful in most of the cases at first attempt.","output":"Peripheral Intravenous Access in Preterm Neonates during Postnatal Stabilization: Feasibility and Safety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S2) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild-type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild-type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-?3. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276).","output":"Ad26 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine encoding a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike immunogen induces potent humoral and cellular immune responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Handling infectious waste is a major global concern for public health and the environment if improperly hands.

OBJECTIVES to describe the nutritional intervention that has been carried out in patients with COVID-19, to estimate the presence of clinical dietitians-nutritionists (DN) in hospitals in Catalonia, and to know the organization of NTs. METHODS a cross-sectional study through an online survey directed to clinical DNs at hospitals in Catalonia (March 2021) was made. RESULTS the surveys of 36 NTs, made up of 104 DNs, have been analysed. A total of 44.44 % of NTs had to interrupt or reduce some of their usual activities during the pandemic. When nutritional screening was used, it was carried out early (24-48 h) in 56.25 % of cases, and the most common tool was the NRS-2002 (66.67 %). In 41.67 % of NTs a specific hospital diet was established, this being generally hyperproteic (89.66 %). Oral nutritional supplementation was systematically prescribed by 41.67 % of NTs, prioritizing hyperproteic (97.14 %) and hypercaloric (74.29 %) formulas. It is estimated that clinical DNs are present in approximately 61.54 % of public acute hospitals in Catalonia.

Collaboration between researchers, public health workers, and politicians has been established to deal with the epidemic. One important contribution from researchers in epidemiology is the analysis of trends so that both the current state and short-term future trends can be carefully evaluated. Gompertz model has been shown to correctly describe the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases, since it is characterized by a decrease in growth rate showing the effect of control measures. Thus, it provides a way to systematically quantify the Covid-19 spreading velocity and it allows short-term predictions and longer-term estimations. This model has been employed to fit the cumulative cases of Covid-19 from several European countries. Results show that there are systematic differences in spreading velocity among countries. The model predictions provide a reliable picture of the short-term evolution in countries that are in the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, and may permit researchers to uncover some characteristics of the long-term evolution.

BACKGROUND: An objective understanding of aerosol generation and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies can inform interventions to reduce aerosol risk from mastoidectomy and other open surgeries involving drilling. METHODS: Cadaveric and fluorescent three-dimensional printed temporal bone models were drilled under variable conditions and mitigation methods. Aerosol production was measured with a cascade impactor set to detect particle sizes under 14.1am. Field contamination was determined with examination under UV light. RESULTS: Drilling of cadaveric bones and three-dimensional models resulted in strongly positive aerosol production, measuring positive in all eight impactor stages for the cadaver trials. This occurred regardless of using coarse or cutting burs, irrigation, a handheld suction, or an additional parked suction. The only mitigation factor that led to a completely negative aerosol result in all eight stages was placing an additional microscope drape to surround the field. Bone dust was scattered in all directions from the drill, including on the microscope, the surgeon, and visually suspended in the air for all but the drape trial. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols are generated with drilling the mastoid.

We searched contemporary literature on racial, gender, and socioeconomic disparities across the LT care cascade in referral, waitlisting practices, allocation, and post-LT care. We subsequently identified gaps in the literature and future research priorities. Studies found that racial and ethnic minorities (Black and Hispanic patients) have lower rates of LT referral, more advanced liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma at diagnosis, and are less likely to undergo living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Gender-based disparities were observed in waitlist mortality and LT allocation. Women have lower LT rates after waitlisting, with size mismatch accounting for much of the disparity. Medicaid insurance has been associated with higher rates of chronic liver disease and poor waitlist outcomes. After LT, some studies found lower overall survival among Black compared to White recipients. Studies have also shown lower literacy and limited educational attainment were associated with increased post-transplant complications and lower use of digital technology. However, there are notable gaps in the literature on disparities in LT. Detailed population-based estimates of the advanced liver disease burden, LT referral and evaluation practices, including for LDLT, are lacking. Similarly, little is known about LT disparities worldwide. Evidence-based strategies to improve access to care and reduce disparities have not been comprehensively identified. CONCLUSION: Prospective registries and alternative \\"real-world\\" databases can provide more detailed information on disease burden and clinical practices.

Loss of conformational stability and decreased enzymatic activity in PAH variants result in the autosomal recessive disorder phenylketonuria (PKU), characterized by developmental and psychological problems if not treated early. One current therapeutic approach to treat PKU is based on pharmacological chaperones (PCs), small molecules that can displace the folding equilibrium of unstable PAH variants toward the native state, thereby rescuing the physiological function of the enzyme. Understanding the PAH folding equilibrium is essential to develop new PCs for different forms of the disease. We investigate here the urea and the thermal-induced denaturation of full-length PAH and of a truncated form lacking the regulatory and the tetramerization domains. For either protein construction, two distinct transitions are seen in chemical denaturation followed by fluorescence emission, indicating the accumulation of equilibrium unfolding intermediates where the catalytic domains are partly unfolded and dissociated from each other. According to analytical centrifugation, the chemical denaturation intermediates of either construction are not well-defined species but highly polydisperse ensembles of protein aggregates. On the other hand, each protein construction similarly shows two transitions in thermal denaturation measured by fluorescence or differential scanning calorimetry, also indicating the accumulation of equilibrium unfolding intermediates. The similar temperatures of mid denaturation of the two constructions, together with their apparent lack of response to protein concentration, indicate the catalytic domains are unfolded in the full-length PAH thermal intermediate, where they remain associated. That the catalytic domain unfolds in the first thermal transition is relevant for the choice of PCs identified in high throughput screening of chemical libraries using differential scanning fluorimetry.","output":"Unravelling the Complex Denaturant and Thermal-Induced Unfolding Equilibria of Human Phenylalanine Hydroxylase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Synovial biomarkers have recently been adopted as diagnostic tools for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), but their utility is uncertain.

METHODS We performed a systematic review to identify diagnostic technique studies evaluating the accuracy of alpha-defensin or leukocyte esterase in the diagnosis of PJI. MEDLINE and Embase on Ovid, ACM, ADS, arXiv, CERN DS (Conseil Europen pour la Recherche Nuclaire Document Server), CrossRef DOI (Digital Object Identifier), DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library Project), Espacenet, Google Scholar, Gutenberg, HighWire, IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers digital library), INSPIRE, JSTOR (Journal Storage), OAlster (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), Open Content, Pubget, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for appropriate studies indexed from inception until May 30, 2015, along with unpublished or gray literature. The classification of studies and data extraction were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Data extraction permitted meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity with construction of receiver operating characteristic curves for each test. RESULTS We included 11 eligible studies. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of alpha-defensin (6 studies) for PJI were 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.00) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.99), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for alpha-defensin and PJI was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.00). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase (5 studies) for PJI were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.95) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.99), respectively. The AUC for leukocyte esterase and PJI was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98). There was substantial heterogeneity among studies for both diagnostic tests.

METHODS: We sourced the vaccine economic evaluations from a previous systematic review by Nymark et al. (2009C2015) and searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase from 2015 to 2019 using the same search strategy. For tuberculosis economic evaluations, we extracted studies from 2009 to 2019 that were published in a previous review by Siapka et al. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. Studies were classified according to the categories and subcategories (e.g., herd immunity, non-specific effects, and labor productivity) defined in a framework identifying additional unintended consequences by Nymark and Vassall. Where possible, methods for estimating the additional unintended consequences categories and subcategories were described. We evaluated the reporting quality of included studies according to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) extraction guideline. RESULTS: We identified 177 vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) between 2009 and 2019 that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 98 included unintended consequences. Of the total 98 CEAs, overall health consequence categories were included 73 times; biological categories: herd immunity 43 times; pathogen response: resistance 15 times; and cross-protection 15 times. For health consequences pertaining to the supply-side (health systems) categories, side effects were included five times. On the nonhealth demand side (intrahousehold), labor productivity was included 60 times. We identified 29 tuberculosis CEAs from 2009 to 2019 that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, six articles included labor productivity, four included indirect transmission effects, and one included resistance. Between 2009 and 2019, only 34% of tuberculosis CEAs included additional unintended consequences, compared with 55% of vaccine CEAs. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of additional unintended consequences in economic evaluations of immunization and tuberculosis continues to be limited. Additional unintended consequences of economic benefits, such as those examined in this review and especially those that occur outside the health system, offer valuable information to analysts.

This approach is especially interesting when it comes to emerging diseases with high rates of infection, because the lack of a quickly cure brings many human losses until the mitigation of the epidemic, as is the case of COVID-19. In this work, we combine an in-house developed machine learning strategy with docking, MM-PBSA calculations, and metadynamics to detect potential inhibitors for SARS-COV-2 main protease among FDA approved compounds. To assess the ability of our machine learning strategy to retrieve potential compounds we calculated the Enrichment Factor of compound datasets for three well known protein targets: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (PDB 4B3P), 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (PDB 6A94), and H1 histamine receptor (PDB 3RZE). The Enrichment Factor for each target was, respectively, 102.5, 12.4, 10.6, which are considered significant values. Regarding the identification of molecules that can potentially inhibit the main protease of SARS-COV-2, compounds output by the machine learning step went through a docking experiment against SARS-COV-2 M(pro).

Studies of the fundamental aspects of these HCoV infections at the primary entry port, such as cell tropism, are seriously hampered by the lack of a universal culture system or suitable animal models. To expand the knowledge on fundamental virus-host interactions for all four HCoVs at the site of primary infection, we used pseudostratified HAE cell cultures to isolate and characterize representative clinical HCoV strains directly from nasopharyngeal material.

This study evaluates the performance of the CDC vaccine allocation strategy with respect to multiple potentially competing vaccination goals (minimizing mortality, cases, infections, and years of life lost (YLL)), under the same framework as the CDC allocation: four priority vaccination groups and population demographics stratified by age, comorbidities, occupation and living condition (congested or non-congested). Methods: We developed a compartmental disease model that incorporates key elements of the current pandemic including age-varying susceptibility to infection, age-varying clinical fraction, an active case-count dependent social distancing level, and time-varying infectivity (accounting for the emergence of more infec- tious virus strains). Under this model, the CDC allocation strategy is compared to all other possibly optimal allocations that stagger vaccine roll-out in up to four phases (17.5 million strategies). Results: The CDC allocation strategy performed well in all vaccination goals but never optimally. Under the developed model, the CDC allocation deviated from the optimal allocations by small amounts, with 0.19% more deaths, 4.0% more cases, 4.07% more infections, and 0.97% higher YLL, than the respective optimal strategies. The CDC decision to not prioritize the vaccination of individuals under the age of 16 was optimal, as was the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers. Finally, a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes compared to the CDC allocation. Interpretation: The developed approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States, or adapted for use by other countries seeking to optimize the effectiveness of their vaccine allocation strategies.

However, it is unknown whether increased TIPE2 is protective against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether increased TIPE2 can exert protective effects in a mouse model of ALI induced by LPS. METHODS: We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Three weeks later, ALI was induced by intratracheal injection of LPS into BALB/c mice. Twenty-four hours later, lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was acquired to analyse cells and protein, arterial blood was collected for arterial blood gas analysis and the determination of pro-inflammatory factor levels, and lung issues were collected for histologic examination, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TUNEL staining, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio analysis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analysis and blot analysis of protein expression. RESULTS: We found that TIPE2 overexpression markedly mitigated LPS-induced lung injury, which was evaluated by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio, and total protein expression in the BALF. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression markedly attenuated lung inflammation, as evidenced by the downregulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the BALF, lung MPO activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum. Moreover, TIPE2 overexpression not only dramatically prevented LPS-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice but also blocked LPS-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-B p65 nuclear translocation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the increased expression of AAV-mediated TIPE2 in the lungs of mice inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis and suppresses the activation of NF-B and JNK in a murine model of ALI.","output":"TIPE2 ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis and inflammation in acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects up to 1 in 3 women over their lifetime and has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although most injuries are to the head, face, and neck, the intersection of IPV and brain injury (BI) remains largely unrecognized. This article reports on unexplored COVID-19-related impacts on service providers and women survivors of IPV/BI. OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on survivors and service providers. PARTICIPANTS: Purposeful sampling through the team's national Knowledge-to-Practice (K2P) network and snowball sampling were used to recruit 24 participants across 4 categories: survivors, executive directors/managers of organizations serving survivors, direct service providers, and employer/union representatives. DESIGN: This project used a qualitative, participatory approach using semistructured individual or group interviews. Interviews were conducted via videoconferencing, audio-recorded, and transcribed. Transcripts were thematically analyzed by the research team to identify themes. FINDINGS: COVID-19 has increased rates and severity of IPV and barriers to services in terms of both provision and uptake. Three main themes emerged: (1) implications for women survivors of IPV/BI; (2) implications for service delivery and service providers supporting women survivors of IPV/BI; and (3) key priorities. Increased risk, complex challenges to mental health, and the impact on employment were discussed. Adaptability and flexibility of service delivery were identified as significant issues, and increased outreach and adaptation of technology-based services were noted as key priorities.

This required a shift to using technologies, which was previously underutilized and viewed as risky.

Three key themes characterized the changes in caseworker practices and how these impacted upon social interactions between children and their birth and carer families: communication, not location;shared not separate spaces and spontaneous not restricted interaction. First, caseworkers described how contact via technologies involved fewer logistical arrangements, shifting the focus on interactions among children and their two families and encouraging these to be flexible and child\\\\centred. Second, caseworkers discussed how spending time together virtually could build trust, as carers and birth relatives could forge relationships around shared commitment to the child's wellbeing. Third, caseworkers noted that technology\\\\facilitated communication enabled greater choice and control for children while requiring renegotiating boundaries. The findings reflect a shift in caseworker perceptions of technology\\\\facilitated contact from a risk to opportunity framework as a result of COVID\\\\19 conditions, consistent with social shaping of technology theory.

Health insurance mandates are effective mechanisms that many state policymakers use to increase the utilization of preventive health services, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The current study estimated the effects of health insurance mandate variations on CRC screening post Affordable Care Act (ACA) era. The study analyzed secondary data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Cancer Institute State Cancer Legislative Database (SCLD) from 1997-2014. BRFSS data were merged with SCLD data by state ID. The target population was U.S. adults, age 50 to 74, who lived in states where health insurance was mandated or non-mandated before and after the implementation of ACA. Using a difference-in-differences () approach with a time-series analysis, we evaluated the effects of health insurance mandates on CRC screening status based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. The adjusted average marginal effects from the  model indicate that health insurance mandates increased the probability of up-to-date screenings vs. non-compliance by 2.8% points, suggesting that an estimated 2.37 million additional age-eligible persons would receive a screening with such health insurance mandates. Compliant participants' mean age was 65 years and 57% were women (n=32,569). Our findings are robust for various model specifications. Health insurance mandates that lower out-of-pocket expenses constitute an effective approach to increase CRC screenings for the population, as a whole.","output":"Health Insurance Coverage Mandates: Colorectal Cancer Screening in the Post-ACA Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic has claimed millions of lives.

Objectives: To assess the cumulative incidence and outcomes of recognized COVID-19 for patients with PAH/CTEPH followed at accredited pulmonary hypertension centers, and to evaluate the pandemics impact on clinic operations at these centers. Methods: A survey was e-mailed to program directors of centers accredited by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. Descriptive analyses and linear regression were used to analyze results. Results: Seventy-seven center directors were successfully e-mailed a survey, and 58 responded (75%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in individuals with PAH/CTEPH was 2.9 cases per 1,000 patients, similar to the general U.S. population. In patients with PAH/CTEPH for whom COVID-19 was recognized, 30% were hospitalized and 12% died. These outcomes appear worse than the general population. A large impact on clinic operations was observed including fewer clinic visits and substantially increased use of telehealth. A majority of centers curtailed diagnostic testing and a minority limited new starts of medical therapy. Most centers did not use experimental therapies in patients with PAH/CTEPH diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions: The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in patients with PAH/CTEPH appears similar to the broader population, although outcomes may be worse.

While adverse reactions to cytotoxic drugs may be life threatening, for anti-viral agents we anticipate something different: side effects that provoke the cessation of treatment. This would correspond to treatment failure. On the other hand, success would not be yes/no but would correspond to a range of responses, from small, no more than say 20% reduction in viral load to the complete elimination of the virus. Less than total success matters since this may allow the patient to achieve immune-mediated clearance. The motivation for this article is an upcoming dose-finding trial in chronic norovirus infection.

Operative, angioembolic, and nonoperative strategies are management options, although the association between management strategy and outcomes is unknown. This study endeavored to define the epidemiology, management strategy, and outcomes after penetrating injuries to the vertebral artery presenting to trauma centers nationwide. METHODS: Patients with veterbral artery injuries were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) (2016C2017) using ICD-10-CM codes. Only those with penetrating mechanisms of injury were included in the study. Transferred patients were excluded. Study groups were defined by management strategy (Operative management, OM; angioembolization, AE; and nonoperative management, NOM). Patient demographics, injury characteristics, and outcomes were compared between groups using univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was used to examine independent risk factors for mortality and stroke. RESULTS: Penetrating injuries to the vertebral artery were rare (n = 476, < 1% of NTDB patient population). Median age was 28 [IQR 21C37] years and 81% (n = 385) of patients were male. Interpersonal violence was the most common injury intent (n = 374, 79%). Most patients were managed with NOM (n = 409, 86%), with AE and OM utilized less frequently (8% and 6%, respectively). Stab wounds were the most frequent mechanism of injury among patients managed with OM (62%), while gunshot wounds were most common among patients managed with NOM (84%) or AE (79%). Multivariate analysis of risk factors for stroke revealed only associated carotid artery injury (OR 4.236, 95% CI 1.284C13.970, p = 0.018) and AE (OR 6.342, 95% CI 1.417C28.399, p = 0.016) were independent predictors. Independent risk factors for mortality were advanced age (OR 1.026, 95% CI 1.001C1.052, p = 0.044); elevated ISS (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.008C1.052, p = 0.006); and associated traumatic brain injury (OR 3.020, 95% CI 1.333C6.843, p = 0.008). Higher ED GCS was independently associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.788, 95% CI 0.731C0.849, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral artery injuries after penetrating mechanisms are infrequent in the United States. Patients with these injuries tend to be young adult men who were injured by gunshot wounds as a result of interpersonal violence. The majority of these injuries were managed nonoperatively, with operative intervention required most commonly for patients injured by stab wounds. Risk factors for both stroke and mortality were principally due to patient factors and associated injuries. Increased risk of stroke among patients managed with angioembolization will need to be further investigated with future study to determine if this risk is imparted from the management strategy itself or from underlying injury characteristics.","output":"Penetrating injuries to the vertebral artery: interventions and outcomes from US Trauma Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has created a healthcare crisis across the world and has put human life under life-threatening circumstances. The recent discovery of the crystallized structure of the main protease (M(pro)) from SARS-CoV-2 has provided an opportunity for utilizing computational tools as an effective method for drug discovery. Targeting viral replication has remained an effective strategy for drug development. M(pro) of SARS-COV-2 is the key protein in viral replication as it is involved in the processing of polyproteins to various structural and nonstructural proteins. Thus, M(pro) represents a key target for the inhibition of viral replication specifically for SARS-CoV-2. We have used a virtual screening strategy by targeting M(pro) against a library of commercially available compounds to identify potential inhibitors. After initial identification of hits by molecular docking-based virtual screening further MM/GBSA, predictive ADME analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation were performed. The virtual screening resulted in the identification of twenty-five top scoring structurally diverse hits that have free energy of binding (G) values in the range of ?26-06 (for compound AO-854/10413043) to ?59.81 Kcal/mol (for compound 329/06315047). Moreover, the top-scoring hits have favorable AMDE properties as calculated using in silico algorithms. Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation revealed the stable nature of protein-ligand interaction and provided information about the amino acid residues involved in binding. Overall, this study led to the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) hit compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. We believe that the outcome of this study can help to develop novel M(pro) inhibitors to tackle this pandemic. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In Malaysia, the small business sector is most affected by the movement control order (MCO). The MCO has caused the closure of the retail and transport sectors that has sharply curtailed the daily operations of the majority of small entrepreneurs, leading to a loss in income. However, if small business communities make optimal use of digital applications for their business activities, their income will be less affected by the current Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the everyday use of ICT has the potential to create numerous landscape improvement and business continuity, specifically for small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs). This, in turn, would increase community participation in entrepreneurship. Therefore, it is crucial to study the role of digital marketing in strengthening new business norms among small entrepreneurs during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also imperative to identify other factors that can help boost digital business. This research examined the relationship between ICT use in empowering rural entrepreneurs during MCO in Malaysia. The study design consisted of a quantitative form for each research instrument using the Google Form online survey. This study's sample was selected using a particular sampling method (purposive sampling) and snowball sampling (snowball sampling) involving 158 small rural entrepreneurs in Penang, Malaysia. The data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 27.0 software. The findings showed that the respondents navigated the Covid-19 pandemic by carrying out business activities on the digital platform and took full advantage of the ICT applications as part of their new business norms. This study can provide input for the government to formulate strategies related to ICT in increasing awareness among rural entrepreneurs.

In about one third of patients, epilepsy is uncontrolled with current medications, leaving a vast need for improved therapies. The causes of epilepsy are diverse and not always known but one gene mutated in a small subpopulation of patients is phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Moreover, focal cortical dysplasia, which constitutes a large fraction of refractory epilepsies, has been associated with signaling defects downstream of PTEN. So far, most preclinical attempts to reverse PTEN deficiency-associated neurological deficits have focused on mTOR, a signaling hub several steps downstream of PTEN. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), by contrast, are the direct enzymatic counteractors of PTEN, and thus may be alternative treatment targets. PI3K activity is mediated by four different PI3K catalytic isoforms. Studies in cancer, where PTEN is commonly mutated, have demonstrated that inhibition of only one isoform, p110, reduces progression of PTEN-deficient tumors. Importantly, inhibition of a single PI3K isoform leaves critical functions of general PI3K signaling throughout the body intact. Here, we show that this disease mechanism-targeted strategy borrowed from cancer research rescues or ameliorates neuronal phenotypes in male and female mice with neuron-specific PTEN deficiency. These phenotypes include cell signaling defects, protein synthesis aberrations, seizures, and cortical dysplasia. Of note, p110 is also dysregulated and a promising treatment target in the intellectual disability Fragile X syndrome, pointing towards a shared biological mechanism that is therapeutically targetable in neurodevelopmental disorders of different etiologies. Overall, this work advocates for further assessment of p110 inhibition not only in PTEN deficiency-associated neurodevelopmental diseases but also other brain disorders characterized by defects in the PI3K/mTOR pathway.","output":"PI3K isoform-selective inhibition in neuron-specific PTEN-deficient mice rescues molecular defects and reduces epilepsy-associated phenotypes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to generate threats to occupational health, safety, and well-being. As a result, it presents an opportunity to deepen the field's insights into occupational health psychology (OHP), and to offer practical guidance that may help workers, organizations, and society mitigate the pandemic's negative effects. This special section of the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology (JOHP) addresses several implications of the pandemic for well-being and work behavior. The pandemic raises many additional questions deserving of research attention. Such topics include the implications of organizations' evolving workforce and workplace decisions, and work as a mechanism for public health and societal well-being.

To that end, the overarching aims of this study were to understand students' attitude toward and knowledge of COVID-19 and examine the predictors of their attitude toward hand hygiene. DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study, conducted in Saudi Arabia, enrolled interns from diverse healthcare-related fields. The questionnaire was divided into three sections: sociodemographic data, knowledge of COVID-19, and attitude toward hand hygiene. The data was expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). RESULTS: In all, 371 responses were analyzed. The median knowledge score was 20, which was considered good. There were no statistically significant differences across age, hospital setting, or gender. Of the 254 respondents who had attended an educational session, 167 (65%) had a good knowledge score and 83 (33%) had a moderate score, compared with only four (2%) who had a poor score. The cumulative median score of the respondents' attitudes was 6 (IQR [2]), which reflects a suboptimal attitude-only 38 (22%) reported a good attitude. The predicted effect of knowledge on attitude (good/suboptimal) was statistically significant (p = 0.02) using univariate logistic regression.

As a guideline, government issued directives on physical distancing and the use of face masks to curb community spread of the disease. Given that public transport has been identified as a high-risk environment for transmission, it was of interest to ascertain user and operator compliance to guidelines for public transport operations during the period, as a measure of its risk level. A roadside observer survey, of over 850 of the most popular paratransit (trotro) buses was carried out on one of the major roads in Kumasi. Compliance to the policy on physical distancing was determined using guidelines from the Ministry of Transport, while compliance to the policy on face masks was determined by the researchers themselves based on the number of commuters with/without face masks per bus. The results suggest that majority (98.0%) of buses comply with the social distancing guidelines established by the Ministry of transport, however the policy on face masks was complied with only partially in most vehicles. About 12.6% of the vehicles had fewer than three commuters without face masks, while 21.3% of buses that had fewer than 3 people with face masks. The results suggest public transport remains an area of high risk in the fight against COVID-19. It is recommended that operators are given additional directives that restrict them from allowing commuters without face masks on board their vehicles, and as well, that police enforce the policy through fines.","output":"Adherence to social distancing and wearing of masks within public transportation during the COVID 19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically impacted medical education, both bedside and academic teaching had to be adapted to comply with the reorganisation of care and social distancing measures.

There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. We aimed to explore risk factors affecting susceptibility to infection and prioritize drug repositioning candidates, based on Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on ACE2 lung expression. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a phenome-wide MR study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins causally linked to ACE2 lung expression in GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR, as these drugs may alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. RESULTS The most consistent finding was tentative evidence of an association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest genome-wide association studies on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to date (N = 898,130), T2DM was causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (P = 2.91E-03; MR-IVW). Significant associations (at nominal level; P < 0.05) with ACE2 expression were observed across multiple diabetes data sets and analytic methods for T1DM, T2DM, and related traits including early start of insulin. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased expression included inflammatory bowel disease, (estrogen receptor-positive) breast cancer, lung cancer, asthma, smoking, and elevated alanine aminotransferase. We also identified drugs that may target the top-ranked proteins in MR, such as fostamatinib and zinc. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis suggested that diabetes and related traits may increase ACE2 expression, which may influence susceptibility to infection (or more severe infection). However, none of these findings withstood rigorous multiple testing corrections (at false discovery rate <0.05). Proteome-wide MR analyses might help uncover mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression and guide drug repositioning.

The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above-median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Larger farms had significantly greater odds of experiencing mortality than smaller farms in both winter and summer. Farms which had policies of attending calvings and ensuring that calves received their first colostrum had significantly lower odds of experiencing winter mortality than farms which did not have these policies. Farms which housed calves in hutches had significantly lower odds, and those which housed calves in group pens had significantly higher odds, of experiencing summer mortality, than farms which used individual indoor calf-pens. A policy of teat removal between four weeks of age and weaning was associated with increased odds of summer mortality. At the individual calf level, calving ease, sire, navel treatment, assistance at first colostrum feeding, administration of vitamins A, D and E and anti-scour vaccines to the pregnant dam, and place of calving, were all associated with significantly altered odds of dying.

Natural agents with immune-promoting potentials such as bee products are being explored as possible treatments. Bee honey and propolis are rich in bioactive compounds that express strong antimicrobial, bactericidal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities. This review examined the literature for the anti-COVID-19 effects of bee honey and propolis, with the aim of optimizing the use of these handy products as prophylactic or adjuvant treatments for people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular simulations show that flavonoids in propolis and honey (e.g., rutin, naringin, caffeic acid phenyl ester, luteolin, and artepillin C) may inhibit viral spike fusion in host cells, viral-host interactions that trigger the cytokine storm, and viral replication. Similar to the potent antiviral drug remdesivir, rutin, propolis ethanolic extract, and propolis liposomes inhibited non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and these compounds along with naringin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Propolis extracts delivered by nanocarriers exhibit better antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 than ethanolic extracts. In line, hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving green Brazilian propolis or a combination of honey and Nigella sativa exhibited earlier viral clearance, symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital as well as less mortality than counterparts receiving standard care alone. Thus, the use of bee products as an adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 may produce beneficial effects.

Key findings and conclusions:Enteric viruses such as human noroviruses (HuNoVs) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are known to transmit through foods such as fresh produce and berries, leading to frequent multistate foodborne disease outbreaks all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 was found to share four distinctive characteristics of foodborne viruses that allow them to transmit through foods. This similarity in characteristics, recent report of detecting SARS-CoV-2 particles from frozen food packages in China, and recent suspected foodborne COVID-19 case in New Zealand, indicate that foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is more evident than previously thought possible. To support or deny this route of transmission, urgent research needs to be undertaken to answer two primary questions and many secondary ones as described in this review.","output":"Foodborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Is More Evident Than It Has Been Before"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global HIV/AIDS scientific community has begun to hail the dawn of 'the End of AIDS' with widespread anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and dramatic declines in AIDS-related mortality. Drawing on community focus groups and in-depth individual interviews conducted in rural South Africa, we examine the complex unfolding of the end of AIDS in a hard-hit setting. We find that while widespread ART has led to declines in AIDS-related deaths, stigma persists and is now freshly motivated. We argue that the shifting landscape of illness in the community has produced a new interpretive lens through which to view living with HIV and dying from AIDS. Most adults have one or more chronic illnesses, and ART-managed HIV is now considered a preferred diagnosis because it is seen as easier to manage, more responsive to medication, and less dangerous compared to diseases like cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. Viewed through this comparative lens, dying from AIDS elicits stigmatising individual blame. We find that blame persists despite community acknowledgement of structural barriers to ART adherence. Setting the ending of AIDS within its wider health context sheds light on the complexities of the epidemiological and health transitions underway in much of the developing world.","output":"The end of AIDS?

TLR4 contributes to many aging-related chronic diseases. However, whether TLR4 is involved in cardiovascular injury during the aging process has not been investigated. METHODS The effects of TLR4 on the cardiovascular system of aged mice were investigated in TLR4-/- mice. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and insulin sensitivity test (IST) were conducted to evaluate global insulin sensitivity. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac structure and performance. An isolated artery ring assay was used to measure the vasodilator function of the thoracic aorta. The inflammatory response was reflected by the serum concentration of cytokines. RESULTS TLR4 expression increased in the hearts and aortas of mice in an age-dependent manner. Loss of TLR4 increased insulin sensitivity in aged mice. Moreover, loss of TLR4 improved cardiac performance and endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in aged mice. Importantly, the increases in serum inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in the heart and aorta were also inhibited by TLR4 deficiency. CONCLUSION In summary, loss of TLR4 improved cardiac performance and endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in aged mice. The reduced inflammatory responses and oxidative stress may be the reason for the protective effects of TLR4 deficiency during aging. Our study indicates that targeting TLR4 is a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing aging-related cardiovascular disease.","output":"Loss of toll-like receptor 4 ameliorates cardiovascular dysfunction in aged mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 continues to increase significantly, especially in areas with high population density and mobility such as Jakarta, Indonesia. Spread of infectious diseases has a spatial closeness which results in cases of COVID-19 deaths also have a spatial dependency which is influenced by cases of deaths in the surrounding area. This study aims to map and predict the number of COVID-19 deaths using the Bayes Linear Mixed Model (LMM) method involving spatial random effects. The response variable is number of deaths and the explanatory variable are number of positive cases of COVID-19 and population density with sub-district area units in Jakarta. Response variable is divided into 6 schemes (PSBB 1, PSBB Transition 1, PSBB 2, PSBB Transition 2, PPKM 1 and PPKM 2) which is adjusted to the policies and social distancing activities from Jakarta provincial government, and assumed to have a normal distribution with INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation) inference approach. Some important results from this study are: in all 6 social distancing schemes, the number of positive cases of Covid-19 has a significant effect on the increase in number of deaths, while population density has a significant effect along with the increasing variance value of response data. The Bayes LMM has successfully mapped the spread of COVID-19 cases with the best RMSE value of 3.31. The mapping results show that several sub-districts with high population density and sub-districts located on Jakarta border have a high risk of death. Furthermore, the PSBB and PSBB Transition social distancing schemes are considered to be quite effective in suppressing the diversity number of deaths. However, it is different from the PPKM scheme where it is predicted that there will be an increase in the number of high-risk districts for COVID-19 up to 51% per day.","output":"Mapping Sub-districts-level and Predicting Spatial Spread of Covid-19 Death Case in Jakarta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation of in-person testing across the country. We sought to understand the feasibility of conducting virtual oral examinations as well as solicit opinions of vascular surgery program directors (PD) regarding the use of virtual platforms to conduct both low stakes mock oral examinations with their trainees and potentially real high stakes certifying examinations (CE) moving forward. METHODS: Forty-four senior vascular surgery trainees from 17 institutions took part in a virtual mock oral examination conducted by 38 practicing vascular surgeons via Zoom. Each examination lasted 30 minutes with four clinical scenarios. An anonymous survey pertaining to the conduct of the examination and opinions on feasibility of using virtual examinations for the vascular surgery CE was sent to all examiners and examinees. A similar survey was sent to all vascular surgery program directors. RESULTS: The overall pass rate was 82% (36/44 participants) with no correlation with training paradigm. 32/44 (73%) of trainees, 29/38 (76%) of examiners and 49/103 (48%) of PDs completed the surveys. Examinees and examiners thought the experience was beneficial and PDs also thought the experience would be beneficial for their trainees. While the majority of trainees and examiners believed they were able to communicate and express (or evaluate) knowledge and confidence as easily virtually as in person, PDs were less likely to agree confidence could be assessed virtually. The majority of respondents thought the CE of the Vascular Surgery Board of the American Board of Surgery could be offered virtually, although no groups thought virtual exams were superior to in person exams. While cost benefit was perceived in virtual examinations, the security of the examination was a concern. CONCLUSIONS: Performing virtual mock oral examinations for vascular surgery trainees is feasible. Both vascular surgery trainees as well as PDs feel that virtual CEs should be considered by the Vascular Surgery Board.","output":"Feasibility and acceptability of virtual mock oral examinations for senior vascular surgery trainees and implications for the certifying exam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus-infected cells secrete a broad range of interferons (IFN) which confer resistance to yet uninfected cells by triggering the synthesis of antiviral factors. The relative contributions of the various IFN subtypes to innate immunity against virus infections remain elusive. IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and other type I IFN molecules signal through a common, universally expressed cell surface receptor, whereas type III IFN (IFN-lambda) uses a distinct cell-type-specific receptor complex for signaling. Using mice lacking functional receptors for type I IFN, type III IFN, or both, we found that IFN-lambda plays an important role in the defense against several human pathogens that infect the respiratory tract, such as influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. These viruses were more pathogenic and replicated to higher titers in the lungs of mice lacking both IFN receptors than in mice with single IFN receptor defects. In contrast, Lassa fever virus, which infects via the respiratory tract but primarily replicates in the liver, was not influenced by the IFN-lambda receptor defect. Careful analysis revealed that expression of functional IFN-lambda receptor complexes in the lung and intestinal tract is restricted to epithelial cells and a few other, undefined cell types. Interestingly, we found that SARS coronavirus was present in feces from infected mice lacking receptors for both type I and type III IFN but not in those from mice lacking single receptors, supporting the view that IFN-lambda contributes to the control of viral infections in epithelial cells of both respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.","output":"Lambda interferon renders epithelial cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts resistant to viral infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on the retrofitting of a standard DP2 environmental radiation monitor replacing the photomultiplier tube with a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM).

However, there are limited data on efficacy and associated adverse events. Objective To describe the association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and clinical outcomes among hospital inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients from a random sample of all admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 25 hospitals, representing 88.2% of patients with COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan region. Eligible patients were admitted for at least 24 hours between March 15 and 28, 2020. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted from medical records. The date of final follow-up was April 24, 2020. Exposures Receipt of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, or neither. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiac arrest and abnormal electrocardiogram findings (arrhythmia or QT prolongation). Results Among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (858 [59.7%] male, median age, 63 years), those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate >22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, O2 saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L. Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3% (95% CI, 18.2%-22.4%). The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]). In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), . In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.

The area of educational focus was also novelfocusing on how the sensors themselves function, not just what they do. Precipitated by COVID-19 pandemic constraints, the team used a remote learning approach to provide lessons on sensors at a distance, providing an additional opportunity to contrast this approach with previously studied hands-on learning modes. A sample of students from four high school marine science classes completed two assessments both before and after a series of lessons on ocean sensors. This included a self-reported survey (N = 48), and an open-ended knowledge assessment (N = 40). Results showed modest gains in knowledge assessments, and students experienced statistically significant gains in confidence in their ability to explain what sensors are, confidence in their ability to use sensors and understand resulting data, and confidence in accuracy of sensor data (p < 0.05). No changes were observed for several measures of interest in ocean technology, nor were there changes in an already high belief that understanding these sensors is important to marine science careers. Notably, these findings measure a positive shift in several measures of self-efficacy and confidence, which is a new finding for sensor-based learning.

The implementation of naloxone programs, such as 'take-home naloxone' (THN), has emerged as a key intervention in reducing opioid overdose deaths. These programs aim to train individuals at risk of witnessing or experiencing an opioid overdose to recognize an opioid overdose and respond with naloxone. Naloxone effectively reverses opioid overdoses on a physiological level; however, there are outstanding questions on community THN program effectiveness (adverse events, dosing requirements, dose-response between routes of administration) and implementation (accessibility, availability, and affordability). The objective of this scoping review is to identify existing systematic reviews and best practice guidelines relevant to clinical and operational guidance on the distribution of THN. METHODS Using the Arksey & O'Malley framework for scoping reviews, we searched both academic literature and grey literature databases using keywords (Naloxone) AND (Overdose) AND (Guideline OR Review OR Recommendation OR Toolkit). Only documents which had a structured review of evidence and/or provided summaries or recommendations based on evidence were included (systematic reviews, meta-analyses, scoping reviews, short-cut or rapid reviews, practice/clinical guidelines, and reports). Data were extracted from selected evidence in two key areas: (1) study identifiers; and (2) methodological characteristics. RESULTS A total of 47 articles met inclusion criteria: 20 systematic reviews; 10 grey literature articles; 8 short-cut or rapid reviews; 4 scoping reviews; and 5 other review types (e.g. mapping review and comprehensive reviews).

CONCLUSIONS Several recent systematic reviews address the effectiveness of take-home naloxone programs, naloxone dosing/route of administration, and naloxone provision models. Gaps remain in the evidence around evaluating cost-effectiveness, training parameters and strategies, and adverse events following naloxone administration.

When stratified by social dimensions, such as race/color, it allows for the evaluation of more vulnerable populations. The study estimated the excess mortality by natural causes, separating the white and black populations in 2020. METHODS: Public civil registration data on deaths observed in 2020, corrected for under registration, were used. The expected number of deaths was estimated based on the mortality rates observed in 2019, applied to the estimated population in 2020. The difference between the values expected and observed and the proportion of excess was considered the excess mortality. RESULTS: The present study found an excess of 270,321 deaths (22.2% above the expected) in 2020. Every state of Brazil reported deaths above the corresponding expected figure. The excess was higher for men (25.2%) than for women (19.0%). Blacks showed an excess of 27.8%, as compared to whites at 17.6%. In both sexes and all age groups, excess was higher in the black population, especially in the South, Southeast, and Midwest regions. S?o Paulo, the largest in population number, had twice as much excess death in the black population (25.1%) than in the white population (11.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed racial disparities in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The higher excess found for the black suggests an intrinsic relationship with the socioeconomic situation, further exposing the Brazilian reality, in which social and structural inequality is evident.","output":"Excess Mortality due to natural causes among whites and blacks during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feed has been identified as a vector of transmission for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The objective of this study was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize PEDV cross-contamination. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-free swine feed was manufactured to represent the negative control. A 50 kg feed batch was mixed in a pilot scale feed mill for 5 min, sampled, then discharged for 10 min into a bucket elevator and sampled again upon exit. Next, a pathogenic PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 49.5 kg of PEDV-free feed to form the positive control. The positive control was mixed, conveyed and sampled similar to the negative control. Subsequently, 4 sequence batches (sequence 1 to 4) were formed by adding a 50 kg batch of PEDV-negative feed to the mixer after the prior batch was mixed and conveyed; all sequences were mixed, conveyed, and sampled similar to the negative and positive control batches. None of the equipment was cleaned between batches within a replicate. This entire process was replicated 3 times with cleaning the feed mill between replicates. Feed was then analyzed for PEDV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) and for infectivity by bioassay. Sequence 1 feed had higher (P ? 0.05) rRT-PCR Ct values than the positive batch and sequence 2 feed had higher (P ? 0.05) Ct values than sequence 1, regardless of sampled location. Feed sampled from the mixer from sequence 2, 3, and 4 was rRT-PCR negative whereas feed sampled from the bucket elevator was rRT-PCR negative from sequence 3 and 4. Bioassay was conducted using 66 mixed sex 10-d-old pigs confirmed negative for PEDV allocated to 22 different rooms. Pigs were initially 10-d old. Control pigs remained PEDV negative for the study. All pigs from the mixer positive batch (9/9) and bucket elevator positive batch (3/3) were rRT-PCR positive on fecal swabs by the end of the study. One replicate of pigs from mixer sequence 1 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi. One replicate of mixer pigs from sequence 2 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi although no detectable PEDV RNA was found in the feed. The results demonstrate sequenced batches had reduced quantities of PEDV RNA although sequenced feed without detectible PEDV RNA by rRT-PCR can be infectious. Therefore, a sequencing protocol can reduce but not eliminate the risk of producing infectious PEDV carryover from the first sequenced batch of feed.","output":"Feed batch sequencing to decrease the risk of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) cross-contamination during feed manufacturing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Incidence.

The outcomes intend to encourage increased collaboration with respect to dental guidelines in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as to improve decision making and safety for dental patients and staff. METHODS: This rapid review was conducted by 2 authors (MKV and KD), with the support of a third author (SD), to assess current guidelines related to dental AGDPs. This streamlined review approach allowed synthesis of data in an efficient manner in the rapidly evolving environment associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: The findings identified 1) a lack of consistency in reporting which procedures were deemed an AGDP; 2) that high-speed handpieces, air-water syringes, and mechanical scalers were consistently considered high-risk AGDPs; 3) a lack of consensus on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission with the use of slow-speed handpieces; 4) a general agreement, when described, that rubber dam and high-volume evacuation can significantly reduce aerosol production; and 5) a lack of consistency in reporting whether procedures constitute a low, moderate, or high risk of COVID-19 transmission. The findings are discussed in relation to the guidance and future recommendations. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that future published guidance should indicate the risk stratification (low/moderate/high) of each procedure/exposure in a standardized international approach. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this rapid review can be used by clinicians to increase their awareness of international guidance on aerosol-generating procedures in dentistry. It will also encourage those publishing future guidance to provide an internationally standardized, risk-stratified approach to describing aerosol-generating procedures.

Yet, current methods for screening these two issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and blocked by social stigma and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube has undergone drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in depression and anxiety profiles of users in a noninvasive manner. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationships of deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions with the changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. METHODS: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a US college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 features that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the correlations of deteriorating depression and anxiety profiles with each of these features. We finally demonstrated the feasibility of using the proposed features to build predictive machine learning models. RESULTS: Of the 49 participants, 49% (n=24) of them reported an increase in the PHQ-9 depression scores; 53% (n=26) of them reported an increase in the GAD-7 anxiety scores. The results showed that a number of online behavior features were significantly correlated with deteriorations in the PHQ-9 scores (r ranging between C0.37 and 0.75, all P values less than or equal to .03) and the GAD-7 scores (r ranging between C0.47 and 0.74, all P values less than or equal to .03). Simple machine learning models were shown to be useful in predicting the change in anxiety and depression scores (mean squared error ranging between 2.37 and 4.22, R(2) ranging between 0.68 and 0.84) with the proposed features. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions have strong correlations with behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using pervasive online data to establish noninvasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","output":"The Relationships of Deteriorating Depression and Anxiety With Longitudinal Behavioral Changes in Google and YouTube Use During COVID-19: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe respiratory illness due to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is triggered by an intense pro-inflammatory host response Statins, prescribed primarily for lipid reduction, are known to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and have been associated with a reduced mortality rate among COVID-19 patients taking statins as reported in two recent retrospective studies However, a meta-analysis that included nine studies showed that statin use did not improve in-hospital outcomes of those with COVID-19 In addition, concerns regarding the use of statins and an increase in COVID-19 infections have been raised, as statins may increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus Our goal was to investigate the effect of statins in COVID-19 patients in a large, diverse patient population across the United States containing nearly 120,000 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 We used propensity score matching of demographics, comorbidities, and medication indication to compare statin-treated patients (N = 2,297) with matched controls (N = 4,594) We observed a small, but statistically significant, decrease in mortality among patients prescribed statins (16 1%) when compared with matched COVID-19-positive controls (18 0 to 20 6%) These results support previous evidence that statins do not increase COVID-19-related mortality and may, in fact, have a mitigating effect on severity of the disease reflected in a slight reduction in mortality Mixed findings on effects of statins in COVID-19 patients reported in the literature should prompt prospective randomized controlled trials in order to define better who might be advantaged with respect to clinical outcomes","output":"Decreased Mortality Rate Among COVID-19 Patients Prescribed Statins: Data From Electronic Health Records in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are mutated in nearly 20% of human tumors, making them an attractive therapeutic target.

Due to the characteristics of dental settings, the risk of cross infection may be high between dental practitioners and patients. Being on the list of high-risk professions, dentists are very much expected to develop severe anxiety about the current pandemic situation. In addition, the limited provision of services and closure of dental practices raised concerns among dental professionals about the financial consequences of this closure. Therefore, the study assessed the extent of dental practice closure in various countries around the world, factors associated with this closure and whether closure and associated factors differed between private and non-private sectors. Methods: : From April to May 2020, a web-based survey was sent to dentists in several countries. The survey assessed professional factors, practice factors and country-level structural factors. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the association of practice closure with these factors. Effect modification due to private and non-private sectors was assessed. Results: : Dentists (n= 3243) participated from 29 countries. The majority (75.9%) reported practice closure with significantly higher percentage in the private than non-private sector. Fears were associated with significantly higher likelihood of closure in private (OR= 1.54, 95%CI= 1.24, 1.92) and non-private sectors (OR= 1.38, 95%CI= 1.04, 1.82).

Concurrently, sub-Saharan Africa bears the worlds largest HIV burden, with 71% of people living with HIV (PWH) living in Africa. Problematic alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use among PWH is associated with multiple vulnerabilities comprising complex behavioral, physiological, and psychological pathways that include high-risk behaviors (e.g., sexual risk-taking), HIV disease progression, and mental health problems, all of which contribute to nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy. Physiologically, severe substance use disorders are associated with increased levels of biological markers of inflammation; these, in turn, are linked to increased mortality among PWH. The biological mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of substance use among PWH remain unclear. Moreover, the biobehavioral mechanisms by which substance use contributes to adverse health outcomes are understudied in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Syndemic approaches to understanding the co-occurrence of substance use and HIV have largely been limited to high-income countries. We propose a syndemic coupling conceptual model to disentangle substance use from vulnerabilities to elucidate underlying disease risk for PWH.

Being subjected to strict social confinement is a distressful psychological experience leading to reduced emotional well-being, but it is not known how it can affect the cognitive and empathic tendencies of different individuals. Cortisol, a key glucocorticoid in humans, is a strong modulator of brain function, behavior, and cognition, and the diurnal cortisol rhythm has been postulated to interact with environmental stressors to predict stress adaptation. The present study investigates in 45 young adults (21.09 years old, SD = 6.42) whether pre-pandemic diurnal cortisol indices, overall diurnal cortisol secretion (AUCg) and cortisol awakening response (CAR) can predict individuals' differential susceptibility to the impact of strict social confinement during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on working memory, empathy, and perceived stress. We observed that, following long-term home confinement, there was an increase in subjects' perceived stress and cognitive empathy scores, as well as an improvement in visuospatial working memory. Moreover, during confinement, resilient coping moderated the relationship between perceived stress scores and pre-pandemic AUCg and CAR. In addition, in mediation models, we observed a direct effect of AUCg and an indirect effect of both CAR and AUCg, on change in perceived self-efficacy. These effects were parallelly mediated by the increase in working memory span and cognitive empathy. In summary, our findings reveal the role of the diurnal pattern of cortisol in predicting the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential biomarker for the identification of at-risk groups following public health crises.","output":"Differential Susceptibility to the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Working Memory, Empathy, and Perceived Stress: The Role of Cortisol and Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between the severe clinical course of COVID-19 and other chronic diseases such as: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and chronic renal disease.

However, few studies have focused on whether air pollution affects the efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To better guide the knowledge surrounding this vaccination, we conducted a cross-section study to identify the relationships between air pollutant exposure and plasma neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cell, CoronaVac, SINOVC, China). We recruited 239 healthcare workers aged 21C50 years who worked at Suining Central Hospital. Of these, 207 were included in this study, depending on vaccination date. The data regarding air pollutants were collected to calculate individual daily exposure dose (DED). The geometric mean of all six pollutant DEDs was applied to estimate the combined toxic effects (DED(complex)). Then, the participants were divided into two groups based on the mean value of DED(complex). The median plasma NAb titer was 12.81 AU/mL, with 85.99% vaccine efficacy in healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. In exposure group, observations included lower plasma NAb titers (median: 11.13 AU/mL vs. 14.56 AU/mL), more peripheral counts of white blood cells and monocytes (mean: 6.71  10(9)/L vs. 6.29  10(9)/L and 0.49  10(9)/L vs. 0.40  10(9)/L, respectively), and a higher peripheral monocyte ratio (7.38% vs. 6.50%) as compared to the reference group. In addition, elevated air pollutant DEDs were associated with decreased plasma NAb titers. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the relationship between air pollutant exposure and plasma NAb titers of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. This suggests that long-term exposure to air pollutants may inhibit plasma NAb expression by inducing chronic inflammation. Therefore, to achieve early herd immunity and hopefully curb the COVID-19 epidemic, vaccinations should be administered promptly to those eligible, and environmental factors should be considered as well.

Methods All participants were tested with PCR against SARS-CoV-2 at a clinical microbiology laboratory. Comparing with results from PCR tests, we evaluated the rapid tests' performances in three arms; 1) 20 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 2) 23 recovered outpatients with former PCR-confirmed COVID-19, and 3) 49 participants with suspected COVID-19 presenting at a primary care emergency room. Results All eleven tests detected antibodies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, though with varying sensitivities. In former outpatients recovered from COVID-19, there were differences between tests in the immunoglobulin type G (IgG) sensitivity, with five tests having a sensitivity below 65%. In participants with suspected COVID-19 infection, the rapid tests had very low sensitivities. Most rapid tests were easy to perform and interpret. Conclusions Rapid tests were not suited as stand-alone tests to detect present infection in a Norwegian primary care emergency room population. All the rapid tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, although sensitivities varied and were generally higher in the study arm of more severely affected participants.

Due to fear and social stigma linked with COVID-19, many individuals in the community hide their disease and do not access healthcare facilities in a timely manner. In addition, with the widespread use of social media, rumours, myths and inaccurate information about the virus are spreading rapidly, leading to intensified irritability, fearfulness, insomnia, oppositional behaviours and somatic complaints. Considering the relevance of all these factors, we aim to explore the perceptions and attitudes of community members towards COVID-19 and its impact on their daily lives and mental well-being.

As a new disease and the challenge became an opportunity for policy creation of the government. AIM: The study explored how the government as a policymaker responded to the COVID-19 pandemic within the framework of the policy window, as seen in the news media. This study also looked at how the public perceived the policy creation and the implementation. METHODS: A qualitative case study was conducted to answer the research questions by reviewing three main national news media, namely, Respublika, Media Indonesia, and Kompas, on primary communication from three policies makers (president, ministry of health, and COVID-19 task force). The searching coverage was within 1 year of the pandemic, from March 2019 to February 2020. The articles were analyzed using content and contextual analysis approaches. The articles were coded thematically using open coding in the native language, supported by MS Excel and qualitative software ATLAS.ti version 8. The data discuss with the existing literature using the policy window framework. RESULTS: We found that 147 articles were eligible for the study, which the majority of them were president communication. The president communicated in all aspects COVID-19 related policy, including integrated policy, health policy, and the economic. Ministry of health mainly focused on health policy and the task force on public education. The study showed that the government has utilized a policy window for policy creation in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy addressed all related issues that were affected by the pandemic, ranging from healthcare to financing. There were weaknesses in the implementation, such as not adequately informed to the public and some inconsistency among stakeholders.

METHODS: Literature searches were conducted to identify English language publications from peer-reviewed journals and pre-prints from January 2020 through October 12, 2020. Relevant publications were reviewed for mention of IgG or neutralization assays for SARS-CoV-2, or both, and the methods of reporting assay results. RESULTS: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG results have been reported from a limited number of studies; most studies used in-house laboratory-developed tests in limited settings, and only two semi-quantitative tests have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). As of October12, 2020, there are no neutralization assays with FDA EUA. Relatively few studies have attempted correlation of quantitative IgG titers with neutralization results to estimate surrogates of protection. The number of individuals tested is small compared to the magnitude of the pandemic and persons tested are not representative of disproportionately affected populations. Methods of reporting quantitative results are not standardized to enable comparisons and meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of standardized SARS-CoV-2 quantitative IgG and neutralization assays precludes comparison of results from published studies. Inter-assay and inter-laboratory validation and standardization of assays will support efforts to better understand antibody kinetics and longevity of humoral immune responses post-illness, surrogates of immune protection, and vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy.

Identifying the risk factors and drivers for these nosocomial transmissions is critical for infection prevention and control interventions. The main aim of our study was to quantify the relative importance of different transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is an observational cohort study using data from 4 teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, from January to October 2020. Associations between infectious SARS-CoV-2 individuals and infection risk were quantified using logistic, generalised additive and linear mixed models. Cases were classified as community- or hospital-acquired using likely incubation periods of 3 to 7 days. Of 66,184 patients who were hospitalised during the study period, 920 had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within the same period (1.4%). The mean age was 67.9 (20.7) years, 49.2% were females, and 68.5% were from the white ethnic group. Out of these, 571 patients had their first positive PCR tests while hospitalised (62.1%), and 97 of these occurred at least 7 days after admission (10.5%). Among the 5,596 HCWs, 615 (11.0%) tested positive during the study period using PCR or serological tests. The mean age was 39.5 (11.1) years, 78.9% were females, and 49.8% were nurses. For susceptible patients, 1 day in the same ward with another patient with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 was associated with an additional 7.5 infections per 1,000 susceptible patients (95% credible interval (CrI) 5.5 to 9.5/1,000 susceptible patients/day) per day. Exposure to an infectious patient with community-acquired Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or to an infectious HCW was associated with substantially lower infection risks (2.0/1,000 susceptible patients/day, 95% CrI 1.6 to 2.2). As for HCW infections, exposure to an infectious patient with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 or to an infectious HCW were both associated with an additional 0.8 infection per 1,000 susceptible HCWs per day (95% CrI 0.3 to 1.6 and 0.6 to 1.0, respectively). Exposure to an infectious patient with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 was associated with less than half this risk (0.2/1,000 susceptible HCWs/day, 95% CrI 0.2 to 0.2). These assumptions were tested in sensitivity analysis, which showed broadly similar results. The main limitations were that the symptom onset dates and HCW absence days were not available. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that exposure to patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a substantial infection risk to both HCWs and other hospitalised patients. Infection control measures to limit nosocomial transmission must be optimised to protect both staff and patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Transmission of community- and hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings in the UK: A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the onset of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world, a large fraction of the global population is or has been under strict measures of physical distancing and quarantine, with many countries being in partial or full lockdown. These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.","output":"Modeling the early phase of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic using a stochastic compartmental model and studying its implied future trajectories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2, has spread quickly worldwide. Convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from patients following recovery from COVID-19 infection and development of antibodies against the virus is an attractive option for either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment, since antibodies may have direct or indirect antiviral activities and immunotherapy has proven effective in principle and in many clinical reports. OBJECTIVE: We seek to characterize the latest advances and evidence in the use of CP for COVID-19 through a systematic review and quantitative analysis, identify knowledge gaps in this setting, and offer recommendations and directives for future research. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were continuously searched for studies assessing the use of CP for COVID-19, including clinical studies, commentaries, reviews, guidelines or protocols, and in vitro testing of CP antibodies. The screening process and data extraction were performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality appraisal of all clinical studies was conducted using a universal tool independent of study designs. A meta-analysis of case-control and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Substantial literature has been published covering various aspects of CP therapy for COVID-19. Of the references included in this review, a total of 243 eligible studies including 64 clinical studies, 79 commentary articles, 46 reviews, 19 guidance and protocols, and 35 in vitro testing of CP antibodies matched the criteria. Positive results have been mostly observed so far when using CP for the treatment of COVID-19. There were remarkable heterogeneities in the CP therapy with respect to patient demographics, donor antibody titers, and time and dose of CP administration. The studies assessing the safety of CP treatment reported low incidence of adverse events. Most clinical studies, in particular case reports and case series, had poor quality. Only 1 RCT was of high quality. Randomized and nonrandomized data were found in 2 and 11 studies, respectively, and were included for meta-analysis, suggesting that CP could reduce mortality and increase viral clearance. Despite promising pilot studies, the benefits of CP treatment can only be clearly established through carefully designed RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: There is developing support for CP therapy, particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. These studies provide important lessons that should inform the planning of well-designed RCTs to generate more robust knowledge for the efficacy of CP in patients with COVID-19. Future research is necessary to fill the knowledge gap regarding prevention and treatment for patients with COVID-19 with CP while other therapeutics are being developed.","output":"Convalescent Plasma for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Quantitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of our study was to modify our previously developed laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH) simulator to increase difficulty and then reassess validity and feasibility for using the simulator in a newly developed simulation-based continuing medical education course. METHODS Participants (N = 30) were practicing surgeons who signed up for a hands-on postgraduate laparoscopic hernia course. An LVH simulator, with prior validity evidence, was modified for the course to increase difficulty. Participants completed 1 of the 3 variations in hernia anatomy: incarcerated omentum, incarcerated bowel, and diffuse adhesions. During the procedure, course faculty and peer observers rated surgeon performance using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills-Incisional Hernia and Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills rating scales with prior validity evidence. Rating scale reliability was reassessed for internal consistency. Peer and faculty raters' scores were compared. In addition, quality and completeness of the hernia repairs were rated. RESULTS Internal consistency on the general skills performance (peer  = .96, faculty  = .94) and procedure-specific performance (peer  = .91, faculty  = .88) scores were high. Peers were more lenient than faculty raters on all LVH items in both the procedure-specific skills and general skills ratings. Overall, participants scored poorly on the quality and completeness of their hernia repairs (mean = 3.90/16, standard deviation = 2.72), suggesting a mismatch between course attendees and hernia difficulty and identifying a learning need. CONCLUSIONS Simulation-based continuing medical education courses provide hands-on experiences that can positively affect clinical practice.

Hence, this study aims to describe and analyse health facility preparedness in the light of the federalization process with regards to providing appropriate and timely maternal and neonatal health services. METHODS A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Jumla district, Nepal in 2019 covering all 31 state health facilities (HF) to assess the availability of maternal and neonatal health services including appropriate workforce and access to essential medicines. Tests of association between demographic factors and the probability of a facility experiencing a shortage of essential medicine within the last 3 months were also conducted as exploratory procedures. RESULTS Out ot 31 HFs, more than 90% of them had all their staff positions filled. Most facilities (n = 21) had experienced shortages of essential medicines within the past 3 months. The most common out of stock medicine were: Amoxicillin (n = 10); paracetamol (n = 10); Vitamin A (n = 7); and Metronidazole (n = 5). Twenty-two HFs had referred maternal and newborn cases to a higher centre within the past 12 months.

In France the concept of precariousness, akin to social deprivation, was developed and is widely used. EPICES is a short questionnaire that was developed to measure this concept. This study aimed to evaluate Differential Item Functioning (DIF) in the EPICES questionnaire between contrasted areas: mainland France, French West Indies (FWI) and French Guiana (FG). METHODS The population was taken from the INDIA study, which aimed to evaluate the impact of social inequalities on stroke characteristics and prognosis. Eligible people were patients referred to neurology or emergency departments for a suspicion of stroke. We assessed the DIF using hybrid ordinal logistic regression method, derived from item response theory. RESULTS We analysed 1 553 stroke patients, including 768 from FWI (49.5%), 289 from FG (18.6%) and 496 from mainland (31.9%). We identified five items with a moderate to large DIF in area comparisons: \\"meeting with a social worker\\", \\"complementary health insurance\\", \\"home-owning\\", \\"financial difficulties\\" and \\"sport activities\\". Correlation between EPICES score and the latent variable was strong (r = 0.84). CONCLUSION This is the first attempt to assess the DIF of the EPICES score between different French populations.

Containment strategies adopted range from complete lockdowns to remaining open with public advisories regarding social distancing. However, general principles adopted by most countries remain the same, mainly to avoid gatherings in large numbers and limit social interactions to curb the spread of disease. In Singapore, this disease had a very different progression. The first wave of the disease started with the confirmation of the first COVID-19 positive patient in Singapore on 23rd January 2020. Initially, the daily number of confirmed cases were low and manageable. With a rise in unlinked cases, the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) status was raised from yellow to orange. New cluster outbreaks in foreign worker dormitories led to the rampant spread of disease, with daily spikes of COVID-19 cases. As of 7th June 2020, we have a total of 37,910 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections, the highest in Southeast Asia, 12,999 active cases and a manageable mortality count of 25 deaths.

Indeed, several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that this condition may induce susceptibility and the development of more aggressive infectious diseases, especially those caused by some bacteria (including Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, among others) and viruses [such as coronavirus 2 (CoV2), Influenza A virus, Hepatitis B, etc.]. Although the precise mechanisms that link glycemia to the exacerbated infections remain elusive, hyperglycemia is known to induce a wide array of changes in the immune system activity, including alterations in: (i) the microenvironment of immune cells (e.g., pH, blood viscosity and other biochemical parameters); (ii) the supply of energy to infectious bacteria; (iii) the inflammatory response; and (iv) oxidative stress as a result of bacterial proliferative metabolism. Consistent with this evidence, some bacterial infections are typical (and/or have a worse prognosis) in patients with hypercaloric diets and a stressful lifestyle (conditions that promote hyperglycemic episodes). On this basis, the present review is particularly focused on: (i) the role of diabetes in the development of some bacterial and viral infections by analyzing preclinical and clinical findings; (ii) discussing the possible mechanisms by which hyperglycemia may increase the susceptibility for developing infections; and (iii) further understanding the impact of hyperglycemia on the immune system.","output":"Susceptibility for Some Infectious Diseases in Patients With Diabetes: The Key Role of Glycemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We discuss how colour flows can be used to simplify the computation of matrix elements, and in the context of parton shower Monte Carlos with accuracy beyond leading-colour.

Accordingly, the autonomic nervous system is a therapeutic target for several genitourinary pathologies including cancer, voiding dysfunction, and obstructing nephrolithiasis. Adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors) are G-Protein coupled-receptors that are distributed throughout the body. The major function of 1-adrenoceptors is signaling smooth muscle contractions through GPCR and intracellular calcium influx. Pharmacologic intervention of -and -adrenoceptors is routinely and successfully implemented in the treatment of benign urologic illnesses, through the use of -adrenoceptor antagonists. Furthermore, cell-based evidence recently established the antitumor effect of 1-adrenoceptor antagonists in prostate, bladder and renal tumors by reducing neovascularity and impairing growth within the tumor microenvironment via regulation of the phenotypic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). There has been a significant focus on repurposing the routinely used, Food and Drug Administration-approved 1-adrenoceptor antagonists to inhibit GU tumor growth and angiogenesis in patients with advanced prostate, bladder, and renal cancer. In this review we discuss the current evidence on (a) the signaling events of the autonomic nervous system mediated by its cognate - and -adrenoceptors in regulating the phenotypic landscape (EMT) of genitourinary organs; and (b) the therapeutic significance of targeting this signaling pathway in benign and malignant urologic disease.

The transfer in colostrum of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the elicited cytokines may provide crucial protection to the infant. There is limited literature on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 present in colostrum. Objective: To evaluate the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and the associated cytokines in colostrum from women who tested positive for the virus. Study Design: Between March and September 2020 we obtained bilateral colostrum samples collected on spot cards within 48 hours of delivery from 15 new mothers who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Five of these 15 COVID-19 positive women also provided bilateral liquid colostrum within 1-2 days of providing the spot card samples. Archived bilateral colostrum samples collected from 8 women during 2011-2013 were used as pre-COVID-19 controls. All samples were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an ELISA that measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM, and for concentrations of 10 inflammatory cytokines (IFN {gamma}, TNF , IL-1 {beta}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13) using a multiplex electrochemiluminescent sandwich assay. Results: Bilateral colostrum samples from 73%, 73% and 33% of the 15 COVID-19 mothers exhibited IgA, IgG, and IgM reactivity to RBD respectively. Colostrum samples from two of the 8 pre-pandemic controls showed IgA and IgG reactivity to RBD. Additionally, COVID-19 mothers had significantly higher levels of 9 of the 10 inflammatory markers (all except IFN {gamma}) as compared to the pre-COVID-19 controls. Comparable results were obtained with both the spot card-eluates and liquid samples. Conclusions: A strong humoral immune response is present in the colostrum of women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before delivering. High levels of 9 inflammatory markers were also present in the colostrum. The evolution and duration of the antibody response, as well as dynamics of the cytokine response, remain to be determined.

Methods: Rates of AMI per 100,000 member-weeks were calculated for Kaiser Permanente Southern California patients from January 1 to March 3, 2020 (prepandemic period) and from March 20 to July 31, 2020 (pandemic period), and during the same periods in 2019. Rate ratios (RRs) were calculated comparing the time periods using Poisson regression. Case fatality rates (CFRs) were also compared. Results: Rates of AMI were lower during the pandemic period of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 [3.20 vs 3.76/100,000 member-weeks;RR, 0.85;95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80C0.90].

Because of the millions of doses required, it is desirable that vaccines are not only safe and effective, but also easy to administer, store, and inexpensive to produce. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is responsible for a respiratory disease in chickens. It has no pathogenic homologue in humans. NDV is recognized as an oncolytic virus, and its use in humans for oncological treatment is being evaluated. In the present work, we have developed two types of NDV-vectored candidate vaccines, which carry the surface-exposed RBD and S1 antigens of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. These vaccine candidates were produced in specific-pathogen-free embryonating chicken eggs, and purified from allantoic fluid before lyophilization. These vaccines were administered intranasally to three different animal models: mice, rats and hamsters, and evaluated for safety, toxicity, immunogenicity, stability and efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated in a challenge assay against active SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Golden Syrian hamster model. The NDV-vectored vaccine based on the S1 antigen was shown to be safe and highly immunogenic, with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro, even with an extreme dilution of 1/640. Our results reveal that this vaccine candidate protects the lungs of the animals, preventing cellular damage in this tissue. In addition, this vaccine reduces the viral load in the lungs, suggesting that it may significantly reduce the likelihood of transmission. Being lyophilized, this vaccine candidate is very stable and can be stored for several months at 4-8?C. In conclusion, our NDV-based vaccine candidate has shown a very favorable performance in the pre-clinical study, serving as evidence for a future evaluation in a Phase-I human clinical trial.

OBJECTIVE: This review has highlighted the basic virology of SARS CoV-2 including its origin, structure, genomic characteristics, pathogenesis, immunological response and clinical manifestation along with the key difference of SARS CoV2 from the previous Coronaviruses. CONTENT: Coronaviruses are spherical and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface. It has a large positive sense, single stranded RNA genome within the nucleocapsid with a helical symmetry. It has been known to cause infection to innumerable mammalian hosts, like humans, cats, bats, civets, dogs, and camels. The viral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein encoded within the 3 end of the genome. Virus binds to the host cell by the S protein with specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol and there is fusion of the viral and cellular membranes followed by the translation of the viral genomic RNA. Following the viral replication and sub-genomic RNA synthesis, there is formation of the mature virus. The virions are then transported to the cell surface in vesicles and are released by exocytosis.","output":"Basic virology of SARS-CoV 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is an accepted concept that the pathogenicity of a virus is of polygenic nature. Because of their segmented genome, influenza viruses provide a suitable system to prove this concept. The studies employing virus mutants and reassortants have indicated that the pathogenicity depends on the functional integrity of each gene and on a gene constellation optimal for the infection of a given host. As a consequence, virtually every gene product of influenza virus has been reported to contribute to pathogenicity, but evidence is steadily growing that a key role has to be assigned to hemagglutinin. As the initiator of infection, hemagglutinin has a double function: (1) promotion of adsorption of the virus to the cell surface, and (2) penetration of the viral genome through a fusion process among viral and cellular membranes. Adsorption is based on the binding to neuraminic acid-containing receptors, and different virus strains display a distinct preference for specific oligosaccharides. Fusion capacity depends on proteolytic cleavage by host proteases, and variations in amino acid sequence at the cleavage site determine whether hemagglutinin is activated in a given cell. Differences in cleavability and presumably also in receptor specificity are important determinants for host tropism, spread of infection, and pathogenicity. The concept that proteolytic activation is a determinant for pathogenicity was originally derived from studies on avian influenza viruses, but there is now evidence that it may also be relevant for the disease in humans because bacterial proteases have been found to promote the development of influenza pneumonia in mammals.","output":"The Molecular Biology of Influenza Virus Pathogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with cancer are vulnerable to increased morbidity and mortality from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

The scientific effort to understand and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission and clinical impact has been huge, and important achievements are highlighted in this review. Diagnosis is central and is the first step in recognizing and fighting any infectious agent. Instrumental to that is the quality of the data, relying on serological and molecular surveys in addition to trustworthy clinical records. However, the fast spread of a virus adapted for human-to-human respiratory transmission raised a demand for millions of molecular tests that are simply not available. Several candidate drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials. Those with an already recognized safety profile are more auspicious, since, if proven effective, can cut several steps of production and phase 2 and 3 trials. More than one hundred vaccine prototypes are in different stages of development, however, safety and efficacy evaluations cannot be obviated, implicating, most optimistically, in at least months for us to have an effective immunization, the definite measure to allow a safe return to the pre-pandemic lifestyle.

According to current knowledge, the only method to stop the virus from spreading is prophylactic vaccination of the population. However, to achieve herd immunity, 60-72% of the population needs to be vaccinated, which is a significant challenge for current healthcare systems. As it has already been proven, having an effective vaccine is not the same as using it. Public acceptance is essential here. The study aimed to assess the changes in the attitudes of online respondents toward vaccination against COVID-19 over time. In the research, a questionnaire designed by the author of the study was used and it was distributed via the Internet in two stages. The questionnaire included a section assessing a sociodemographic status as well as the questions, designed by the author, evaluating the willingness of the respondents to get vaccinated and their main concerns associated with it. The first stage covered the period before the commencement of the population vaccination programme in Poland, i.e., 14-27 December 2020. Then, the survey was redistributed 2 months after the vaccination programme was started, i.e., 1-19 March 2021. Participation in the study was fully anonymous, voluntary and there was a possibility to opt out at any stage of the research. A total of 2048 respondents were surveyed and 26 persons refused to be involved in the research. A total number of 2022 responses were analysed. Stage I of the research involved 22.9% of the respondents (463 persons). The questions were answered by 1559 persons (72.9%) after the survey was redistributed. Among the participants of stage II of the study, 422 (27.1%) persons have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. A comparison of the responses that were collected from both stages of the study showed a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 over time. It turned out that women, residents of large cities, people with a higher level of education and healthcare workers showed a more favourable attitude toward vaccination. According to the results of the survey, chronic diseases do not have a significant impact on the attitude toward vaccinations (p = 0.155). As the social vaccination promotion campaign continued, a slight increase in the willingness to get vaccinated was observed. According to the survey, women, residents of large cities and those with higher education demonstrated more favourable attitudes toward getting vaccinated against COVID-19. It should be stressed that despite the passage of time and the increasing experience with the new types of vaccines against COVID-19, the percentage of people who are afraid of the complications after the vaccination has not decreased significantly and the concern related to the ineffectiveness of vaccination has dramatically increased. This demonstrates the limited effectiveness of the current information system regarding passing the knowledge on of the safety and efficiency of vaccination and it indicates a necessity to modernise it as soon as possible.","output":"Attitudes toward vaccination against COVID-19 in Poland. a longitudinal study performed before and two months after the commencement of the population vaccination programme in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is an urgency to respond to the long-standing deficiencies in health human resources in the long-term care (LTC) home sector, which have been laid bare by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nurse Practitioners (NPs) represent an efficient solution to human resource challenges. During the current pandemic, many Medical Directors in LTC homes worked virtually to reduce the risk of transmission. In contrast, NPs were present for in-person care. This study aims to understand the NPs' roles in optimizing resident care and supporting LTC staff during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 14 NPs working in LTC homes in Ontario, Canada was recruited. Data was generated using semi-structured interviews and examined using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four categories relating to the NPs' practices and experiences during the pandemic were identified: a) containing the spread of COVID-19; b) stepping in where needed; c) supporting staff and families; and d) establishing links between fragmented systems of care by acting as a liaison. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest that innovative models of care that include NPs in LTC homes are required moving forward. NPs embraced a multitude of roles in LTC homes, but the need to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 was central to how they prioritized their days. The pandemic clearly accentuated that NPs have a unique scope of practice, which positions them well to act as leaders and build capacity in LTC home.","output":"Nurse Practitioners Rising to the Challenge During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Long-Term Care Homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Descriptions of single clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been widely reported. However, evidence of symptoms associations was still limited. We sought to explore the potential symptom clustering patterns and high-frequency symptom combinations of COVID-19 to enhance the understanding of people of this disease. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 1,067 COVID-19 cases were enrolled. Symptom clustering patterns were first explored by a text clustering method. Then, a multinomial logistic regression was applied to reveal the population characteristics of different symptom groups. In addition, time intervals between symptoms onset and the first visit were analyzed to consider the effect of time interval extension on the progression of symptoms. RESULTS: Based on text clustering, the symptoms were summarized into four groups. Group 1: no-obvious symptoms; Group 2: mainly fever and/or dry cough; Group 3: mainly upper respiratory tract infection symptoms; Group 4: mainly cardiopulmonary, systemic, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. Apart from Group 1 with no obvious symptoms, the most frequent symptom combinations were fever only (64 cases, 47.8%), followed by dry cough only (42 cases, 31.3%) in Group 2; expectoration only (21 cases, 19.8%), followed by expectoration complicated with fever (10 cases, 9.4%) in Group 3; fatigue complicated with fever (12 cases, 4.2%), followed by headache complicated with fever was also high (11 cases, 3.8%) in Group 4. People aged 45C64 years were more likely to have symptoms of Group 4 than those aged 65 years or older (odds ratio [OR] = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.21C5.85) and at the same time had longer time intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of COVID-19 could be divided into four clustering groups with different symptom combinations. The Group 4 symptoms (i.e., mainly cardiopulmonary, systemic, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms) happened more frequently in COVID-19 than in influenza. This distinction could help deepen the understanding of this disease. The middle-aged people have a longer time interval for medical visit and was a group that deserve more attention, from the perspective of medical delays.","output":"Symptom Clustering Patterns and Population Characteristics of COVID-19 Based on Text Clustering Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Sri Lanka is endemic to cutaneous leishmaniasis and reported as the latest focus of leishmaniasis in the Asian subcontinent. Annually, the number of leishmaniasis cases is increasing; therefore, more efficient diagnostic tools, treatment methods and effective prevention measures are indispensable. For this reason, many studies were conducted regarding leishmaniasis infections in Sri Lanka; however, some areas need more attention. Thus, in this review, we comprehensively discussed the studies on leishmaniasis carried out in Sri Lanka. METHODS: Published articles on leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar and ResearchGate databases. Inclusion criteria for the articles were based on keyword searches including Leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka, Leishmaniasis vector in Sri Lanka, Sandfly species in Sri Lanka, Leishmaniasis epidemiology in Sri Lanka which are publicly accessible as of 15th July 2019. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated and summarized the leishmaniasis reports in Sri Lanka and mainly focused on clinical presentation of leishmaniasis infection, genetic characteristics of Leishmania donovani Sri Lankan strain, geographical distribution and associated environmental factors, immunological aspects of the infection, vector, reservoir host, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment, and prevention and control. Furthermore, we identified the areas where further research is needed to fill the essential knowledge gaps. CONCLUSIONS: Leishmaniasis has become a critically important parasitic infection in Sri Lanka, whereas the significant clinical form is cutaneous leishmaniasis.

This paper explains the recommended NPIs and illustrates the pharmaceutical approaches developed in parallel. Among others, general contact bans, providing material for infection prevention and control, ban of events, closing educational institutions, and restricting travel are counted among population-based measures. Additional individual preventive measures are necessary, e.g., keeping a minimum distance, reducing contacts, and wearing a mouthCnose covering as well as quarantine and isolation. Measures within the health system are based on recommendations of the Commission on Hospital Hygiene and Infection Protection (Kommission fr Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionspr?vention (KRINKO)) and specified and implemented by professional societies. Since November 2020, an antiviral therapy with remdesivir and treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone have been available as pharmaceutical interventions. Monoclonal antibodies are at this time not approved. Therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended. Recommendations are constantly adapted to the increasing knowledge on the pathogen and its means of transmission. A challenge is to strengthen the trust of the population.

Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2  40.9 (BR) to 41.1  25.3 g m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45  2.37 (BR) and 5.42  1.75 gC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 g m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 g m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3  6.6 (BR) to 14.8  9.3 g m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6  1.4 (BR) to 3.2  2.0 gC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources.

IPV is associated with an increased risk of homicide, with firearms as the most commonly used weapon. We designed this study to better understand the correlation of interpersonal trauma exposures and demographic factors on firearm perceptions among a cohort of IPV-exposed women. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-seven women in central Pennsylvania with exposure to IPV were surveyed about perceptions of gun access, safety, and gun presence in the home. Trauma variables included IPV type, IPV recency, unwanted sexual exposure, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Multivariable analyses examined three questions examining firearm perceptions controlling for trauma exposures and demographics. RESULTS: Ease of firearm acquisition: Women who were older (mean 44.92 years +/- SD 12.05), compared to women who were younger (40.91 +/- SD 11.81 years) were more likely to describe it as easy or very easy to acquire a gun (aOR 1.05, 95%CI 1.004, 1.10). Perceived safety in the proximity of a gun: Women with the highest ACE score were less likely to feel safe with a gun nearby (aOR 0.31, 95%CI 0.14, 0.67).

In response, the academic community has produced multiple forecasting models, approaches and algorithms to best predict the different indicators of COVID-19, such as the number of confirmed infected cases. Yet, researchers had little to no historical information about the pandemic at their disposal in order to inform their forecasting methods. Our work studies the predictive performance of models at various stages of the pandemic to better understand their fundamental uncertainty and the impact of data availability on such forecasts. We use historical data of COVID-19 infections from 253 regions from the period of 22nd January 2020 until 22nd June 2020 to predict, through a rolling window backtesting framework, the cumulative number of infected cases for the next 7 and 28 days. We implement three simple models to track the root mean squared logarithmic error in this 6-month span, a baseline model that always predicts the last known value of the cumulative confirmed cases, a power growth model and an epidemiological model called SEIRD. Prediction errors are substantially higher in early stages of the pandemic, resulting from limited data. Throughout the course of the pandemic, errors regress slowly, but steadily. The more confirmed cases a country exhibits at any point in time, the lower the error in forecasting future confirmed cases. We emphasize the significance of having a rigorous backtesting framework to accurately assess the predictive power of such models at any point in time during the outbreak which in turn can be used to assign the right level of certainty to these forecasts and facilitate better planning.","output":"Backtesting the predictability of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of three Ig isotypes (IgG, IgA, and IgM) sharing the same anti-spike protein Fab region were developed; we evaluated their neutralizing abilities using a pseudo-typed lentivirus coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2-transfected CrandellCRees feline kidney cells as the host cell line. Although each of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs was able to neutralize the spike-coated lentiviruses, IgM and IgA neutralized the viral particles at 225-fold and 125-fold lower concentrations, respectively, than that of IgG. Our finding that the neutralization ability of Igs with the same Fab domain was dramatically higher for IgM and IgA than IgG mAbs suggests a strategy for developing effective and affordable antibody therapies for COVID-19. The efficient neutralization conferred by IgM and IgA mAbs can be explained by their capacity to bind multiple virions.

The seroconversion rates of neutralizing antibodies were 3.3% (2 out of 60) and 95% (57 out of 60) for individuals who had received 2 and 3 doses of vaccine, respectively. For recipients of three vaccine doses, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titre for Omicron was 16.5-fold lower than for the ancestral virus (254). We isolated 323 human monoclonal antibodies derived from memory B cells in triple vaccinees, half of which recognized the receptor-binding domain, and showed that a subset (24 out of 163) potently neutralized all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Omicron. Therapeutic treatments with representative broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were highly protective against infection of mice with SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) and Omicron. Atomic structures of the Omicron spike protein in complex with three classes of antibodies that were active against all five variants of concern defined the binding and neutralizing determinants and revealed a key antibody escape site, G446S, that confers greater resistance to a class of antibodies that bind on the right shoulder of the receptor-binding domain by altering local conformation at the binding interface. Our results rationalize the use of three-dose immunization regimens and suggest that the fundamental epitopes revealed by these broadly ultrapotent antibodies are rational targets for a universal sarbecovirus vaccine.","output":"Memory B cell repertoire from triple vaccinees against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA viruses may be particularly capable of contributing to the increasing biomedical problem of infectious disease emergence. Empirical studies and epidemiological models are informative for the understanding of evolutionary processes that promote pathogen emergence, but rarely are these approaches combined in the same study. Here, we used an epidemiology model containing observations of pathogen productivity in reservoirs, as a means to predict which pathogens should be most prone to emerge in a primary host such as humans. We employed as a model system a collection of vesicular stomatitis virus populations that had previously diverged in host-use strategy: specialists, directly selected generalists and indirectly selected (fortuitous) generalists. Using data from experiments where these viral strategists were challenged to grow on unencountered novel hosts in vitro, logistic growth models determined that the directly selected generalist viruses tended to grow best on model reservoirs. Furthermore, when we used the growth data to estimate average reproductive rate across secondary reservoirs, we showed that the combined approach could be used to estimate relative success of the differing virus strategists when encountering a primary host. Our study suggests that synergistic approaches combining epidemiological modelling with empirical data from experimental evolution may be useful for developing efforts to predict which types of pathogens pose the greatest probability of emerging in the future.","output":"Combining mathematics and empirical data to predict emergence of RNA viruses that differ in reservoir use."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a very common and serious health condition which is highly prevalent among U.S. military Veterans. Because the demand for sleep medicine services often overwhelms the availability of such services, it is necessary to streamline diagnosis and treatment protocols. The goals of this study are to, (1) assess the efficacy of de-implementing the initial provider encounter for diagnosis and treatment of OSA; (2) determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT); (3) develop HSAT usage recommendations for various at-risk patient populations. METHODS: This is a large, pragmatic study that will take place in 3 VA sleep medicine programs: San Francisco, CA; Portland, OR; and Pittsburgh, PA. All Veterans referred for new sleep apnea evaluations at these sites will be included in this four-year study. Outcomes will include time from referral for OSA to sleep testing and treatment; positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment adherence measures; patient-reported clinical outcomes and measures of satisfaction; determination of the NPV of HSAT; HSAT usage recommendations for at-risk patient populations. DISCUSSION: The DREAM (Direct Referral for Apnea Monitoring) Project will inform sleep medicine providers and clinical organizations regarding strategies to streamline diagnosis and treatment protocols for OSA. Results of this study should have significant impact on clinical practices and professional guidelines.

We aimed to evaluate whether ibuprofen use in patients with COVID-19 was associated with more severe disease, compared to patients using paracetamol or no antipyretics. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 from Shamir Medical Center, Israel, we monitored any use of ibuprofen from a week prior to diagnosis of COVID-19 throughout the disease. Primary outcomes were mortality and the need for respiratory support, including oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The study included 403 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with a median age of 45 years. Of the entire cohort, 44 patients (11%) needed respiratory support and 12 (3%) patients died. One hundred and seventy-nine (44%) patients had fever, with 32% using paracetamol and 22% using ibuprofen, for symptom-relief. In the Ibuprofen group, 3 (3.4%) patients died, while in the non-Ibuprofen group 9 (2.8%) patients died (P=0.95). Nine (10.3%) patients from the Ibuprofen group needed respiratory support, as compared with 35 (11%) from the non-Ibuprofen group (P=1). When compared to exclusive paracetamol users, no differences were observed in mortality rates or the need for respiratory support among patients using ibuprofen.

Methods: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. The CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was also queried. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, anakinra, and dexamethasone - drugs used for SARS-CoV-2-were analyzed, and consensus recommendations are made. Results: The potential interactions of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran, and vortioxetine with COVID-19 treatments shall be considered less risky. Antidepressant interactions with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin enhance the risk of QT prolongation, and ECG monitoring is advised for most antidepressants. Antidepressants with lopinavir/ ritonavir involve multiple CYP enzyme interactions (except with milnacipran). Gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, topiramate, and zonisamide are safe treatment options that have no significant interactions with COVID-19 treatments. Lithium is contraindicated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin. Precaution should be taken in using valproic acid with lopinavir-ritonavir. The use of benzodiazepines does not present a risk of drug interaction with COVID-19 treatments, except lopinavir/ritonavir.

Inhaled nitric oxide may facilitate transpulmonary blood flow during iCPR and may therefore improve organ perfusion and outcome. METHODS Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced in 20 anesthetized male pigs. Animals were left untreated for 10 minutes before iCPR was attempted. Subjects received either 20 ppm of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO, n = 10) or 0 ppm iNO (Control, n = 10), simultaneously started with iCPR until 5 hours following ROSC. Animals were weaned from the respirator and followed up for five days using overall performance categories (OPC) and a spatial memory task. On day six, all animals were anesthetized again, and brains were harvested for neurohistopathologic evaluation. RESULTS All animals in both groups achieved ROSC. Administration of iNO markedly increased iCPR flow during CPR (iNO: 1.81  0.30 vs CONTROL 1.64  0.51 L/min, p < 0.001), leading to significantly higher coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) during the 6 minutes of CPR (25  13 vs 16  6 mmHg, p = 0.002). iNO-treated animals showed significantly lower S-100 serum levels thirty minutes post ROSC (0.26  0.09 vs 0.38  0.15 ng/mL, p = 0.048), as well as lower blood glucose levels 120-360 minutes following ROSC. Lower S-100 serum levels were reflected by superior clinical outcome of iNO-treated animals as estimated with OPC (3  2 vs. 5  1, p = 0.036 on days 3 to 5). Three out of ten iNO-treated, but none of the CONTROL animals were able to successfully participate in the spatial memory task. Neurohistopathological examination of vulnerable cerebral structures revealed a trend towards less cerebral lesions in neocortex, archicortex, and striatum in iNO-treated animals compared to CONTROLs.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19Crelated worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases; (2) estimate the associations between mental health and COVID-19Crelated worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (ie, physical activity, mindfulness meditation); and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between mental health and COVID-19Crelated worry, attention to news, and stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data were collected from April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19Crelated worry, attention to news, and stress; health behavior engagement; and mental health (ie, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19Crelated worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and ordinary least squares models were used to regress mental health and health behavior on COVID-19Crelated worry, attention to news, and stress; moreover, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the significance of the mediation effects. RESULTS: The median age of the respondents (N=8392) was 47 years (SD 13.8). Participants in the Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, greater worry about COVID-19, paying more attention to COVID-19Crelated news, and more stress related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001), strength of meditation habit (P<.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001) and strength of meditation habit (P<.001).

Self-Help Plus participants were significantly less likely to have any mental disorders at six-month follow-up compared to the ECAU group (21.69% vs. 40.73%; Cramer's V = 0.205, p<0.001, risk ratio: 0.533, 95% CI: 0.408-0.696). Analysis of secondary outcomes suggested that Self-Help Plus was not effective immediately post-intervention, but was associated with beneficial effects at six-month follow-up in terms of symptoms of depression, personally identified psychological outcomes, and quality of life. This is the first prevention RCT ever conducted among refugees experiencing psychological distress but without a mental disorder. Self-Help Plus was found to be an effective strategy for preventing the onset of mental disorders. Based on these findings, this low-intensity self-help psychological intervention could be scaled up as a public health strategy to prevent mental disorders in refugee populations exposed to ongoing adversities.","output":"Effectiveness of a WHO self-help psychological intervention for preventing mental disorders among Syrian refugees in Turkey: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global healthcare emergency. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from subclinical infection to multi-organ failure. In addition to the respiratory system, COVID-19 also adversely affects the kidneys. In this study, we aimed to measure the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 and its association with the disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods We conducted our study by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search using four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrial.gov) was performed. Our initial search returned 2,771 articles. After excluding review articles, duplicates, and non-relevant studies, we included 20 articles that reported an association between COVID-19 and AKI. We subsequently performed a random effect analysis to find the pooled prevalence, pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates, and 95% confidence intervals for severe COVID-19 and mortality outcomes in AKI using Cochrane RevMan (version 5.4) and R programming language (version 4.16-2). Results A total of 14,415 patients from various countries were included. Among the 20 cohorts, the median age was 55.8 8.39 years (range: 43-72 years), and 43.78% of the subjects were female. Out of a total of 14,415 patients, 3,820 developed AKI with a pooled prevalence of 11% (95% CI: 0.07-0.15; p<0.01; I(2)=98%). AKI was found to have a significant association with severe COVID-19 disease, with a pooled OR of 8.45 (95% CI: 5.56-12.56; p<0.00001; I(2)=0%). AKI was associated with significantly higher mortality in patients with COVID-19 with an OR of 13.52 (95% CI: 5.43-33.67; p<0.00001; I(2)=88%). Conclusion AKI manifests as a common COVID-19 complication, and COVID-19 patients with AKI generally have poor outcomes in terms of disease severity and mortality.","output":"The Association of Acute Kidney Injury With Disease Severity and Mortality in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine the efficacy among various vitamin D supplementation regimens on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and determine the minimal dose rate required to achieve sufficient serum concentrations (75 nmol/l) among older adults in long-term care (LTC). DESIGN: A 1-year medical history was abstracted from medical records, and a one-time blood draw to measure serum 25(OH)D concentrations was obtained. Individuals were stratified into vitamin D-supplemented and non-supplemented groups. The supplemented group was further categorised into four treatment forms: single-ingredient vitamin D(2or3), multivitamin, Ca with vitamin D or combination of the three, and by daily prescribed doses: 0C99, 10C199, 20C499, 50C999 and >100 g/d. SETTING: Five LTC communities in Austin, Texas. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy-three older (65 years) adults. RESULTS: Of the participants, 62% received a vitamin D supplement and 55% had insufficient (75 nmol/l) 25(OH)D serum concentrations. Individuals receiving single-ingredient vitamin D(2or3) supplementation received the highest daily vitamin D mean dose (725 g/d), while combination of forms was the most frequent treatment (44%) with the highest mean serum concentration (108 nmol/l). All supplementation doses were successful at reaching sufficient serum concentrations, except those<20 g/d. Using a prediction model, it was observed that 0025 g/d of vitamin D supplementation resulted in a 0008 nmol/l increase in serum 25(OH)D concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the predictive equation, results suggest that supplementation of 375 g/d of vitamin D(2or3) or combination of vitamin D is most likely to achieve sufficient serum 25(OH)D concentrations in older adults in LTC.","output":"Efficacy of various prescribed vitamin D supplementation regimens on 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels in long-term care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 causes immense psychological pressure on communities in addition to physical misery. There is currently a scarcity of data on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on Ethiopian healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and its predictors following COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers (HCWs) in southern Ethiopia. Methods: A hospital based cross-sectional study design was used among 387 randomly selected HCWs between September 25 and October 25, 2020 at four selected public hospitals in Sidama National Regional State, southern Ethiopia. Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to collect data post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Logistic regression analyses with 95% CI were used to examine the relationship between independent and outcome variables. Result: The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was found in 56.8% of participants. Significant factors that increase risk of PTSD symptoms were being female (AOR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.19, 3.05), married (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.12, 3.14) and nurses (AOR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.66, 6.63). On the other hand, HCWs working other than emergency unit such as inpatients/wards (AOR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.24, 0.75), OPD (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.24, 0.97) and other units (AOR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.25, 0.96) less likely to be affected by PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: The current study showed high levels of PTSD symptoms as psychological challenges for HCWs. Sex, age, marital status, type of profession and working environment were significant factors for PTSD symptoms in HCWs during the pandemic.

One of these is the need to (re)assess the occupational risks, particularly, biological risks. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work is to promote guidance to occupational safety and health practitioners when conducting a biological risk assessment in this context. METHODS: The main steps of the biological risk assessment are explained with some inputs regarding the novelty posed by SARS-CoV-2 and an example of a qualitative risk assessment method is presented. Also, its application to two different activities was exemplified. RESULTS: In both cases, the assessment considered that vulnerable workers were working from home or in medical leave. The results showed low or medium risk level for the assessed tasks. For medium risk level, additional controls are advised, such maintain social distancing, sanitize instruments/equipment before use, use proper and well-maintained PPE (when applicable), and promote awareness sessions to spread good practices at work. Employers must be aware of their obligations regarding biological risk assessment and OSH practitioners must be prepared to screen and link the abundance of scientific evidence generated following the outbreak, with the technical practice. CONCLUSIONS: This paper could be an important contribution to OSH practice since it highlights the need to (re)assess occupational risks, especially biological risk, to ensure a safe return to work, providing technical guidance.","output":"Biological risk assessment: A challenge for occupational safety and health practitioners during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Systems of care have been challenged to control progression of the COVID-19 pandemic Whether this has been associated with delayed reperfusion and worse outcomes in French patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unknown AIM: To compare the rate of STEMI admissions, treatment delays, and outcomes between the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and the equivalent period in 2019 METHODS: In this nationwide French survey, data from consecutive STEMI patients from 65 centres referred for urgent revascularization between 1 March and 31 May 2020, and between 1 March and 31 May 2019, were analysed The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death or non-fatal mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction RESULTS: A total of 6306 patients were included During the pandemic peak, a 13 9+/-6 6% (P=0 003) decrease in STEMI admissions per week was observed Delays between symptom onset and percutaneous coronary intervention were longer in 2020 versus 2019 (270 [interquartile range 150-705] vs 245 [140-646]min;P=0 013), driven by the increase in time from symptom onset to first medical contact (121 [60-360] vs 150 [62-420]min;P=0 002) During 2020, a greater number of mechanical complications was observed (0 9% vs 1 7%;P=0 029) leading to a significant difference in the primary outcome (112 patients [5 6%] in 2019 vs 129 [7 6%] in 2020;P=0 018) No significant difference was observed in rates of orotracheal intubation, in-hospital cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock CONCLUSIONS: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, there was a decrease in STEMI admissions, associated with longer ischaemic time, exclusively driven by an increase in patient-related delays and an increase in mechanical complications These findings suggest the need to encourage the population to seek medical help in case of symptoms","output":"ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Management and association with prognosis during the COVID-19 pandemic in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) can improve the quality of life of patients with kidney disease and prolong survival. However, peritoneal fibrosis can often occur and lead to PD withdrawal. Therefore, it is imperative to better understand how to inhibit and slow down progression of peritoneal fibrosis. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of Saikosaponin d (SSD), a monomer extracted from the plant Bupleurum, on peritoneal fibrosis and the contribution of TGF?1/BMP7/Gremlin1 pathway cross-talk in this process. To this aim, we used a model 5/6 nephrectomy and peritoneal fibrosis in rats. Rats were divided into four groups, namely a control group (saline administration); a model group (dialysate administration; group M); a SSD group (dialysate and SSD administration); and a positive drug group (dialysate and Benazepril Hydrochloride administration; group M + A). Histological analysis indicated that peritoneal fibrosis occurred in all groups. WB, ELISA, and PCR essays suggested that TGF?1 and Gremlin1 levels in group M were significantly higher than those in group C, whereas BMP7 expression was significantly lower. TGF?1, Gremlin1 and BMP7 levels were significantly lower in the group where SSD was administered than in the other groups. The expression of BMP7 in SSD group was significantly increased. In addition, levels of Smad1/5/8 as assessed by PCR, and levels of p-Smad1/5/8 expression as assessed by WB were also significantly higher in the SSD group than in the M group. Expression of vimentin and -SMA, two important markers of fibrosis, was also significantly decreased. Our study suggests a role for the TGF?1/BMP7/Gremlin1/Smad pathway in peritoneal fibrosis with potential therapeutic implications. Finally, our results also suggest that the monomer SSD may be able to reverse peritoneal fibrosis via regulation of the TGF?1/BMP7/Gremlin1/Smad pathway.","output":"Saikosaponin D Inhibits Peritoneal Fibrosis in Rats With Renal Failure by Regulation of TGF?1/ BMP7 / Gremlin1/ Smad Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Improved oncological and surgical measures now enable curative treatment of malignant lower extremity tumors in majority of cases. Complication rates associated with surgical resection of lower extremity tumors and replacement with megaendoprostheses are high. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predispose to revision surgery following the use of megaimplants in curative treatment of malignant tumors of the lower extremities. METHODS this retrospective study included patients aged  18 years who underwent implantation of a megaendoprosthesis for tumors or metastatic lesions of the lower extremities between January 2010 and December 2020. Baseline characteristics and information on adjuvant treatment, hospitalization time, comorbidities, mobility, complications, and revision surgery were considered. Primary outcomes were revision surgery and reasons for revision. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications and the duration of hospitalization. RESULTS Fifty-four patients (48% female, age 63 years, SD 15) were available for final analysis. Surgeries were performed at hip level in 37 patients (68.5%) and at knee level in 17 patients (31.5%). Revision for wound-related causes was performed in 12 cases (22.2%), with microbiological proof of infection in 8 cases (14.8%). Revision for hip joint instability was carried out in 4 cases (7.4%) and for disconnection between components of the megaimplant in 2 cases (3.7%). Those patients requiring a wound-related revision had undergone a longer primary surgical intervention than those who required an implant-related revision (276 vs 134 min, p = .002). Wound drains after the primary implantation remained longer in situ in patients who later required revision surgery for wound-related complications (5 vs 3 days, p = .020). An ASA > 3 was associated with an increased likelihood for in-hospital complications in general (p = .041), and in-hospital death in particular (p = .012). CONCLUSIONS The management of malignant tumors of the lower extremities with megaendoprostheses is associated with a high rate of wound-related complications. Swift surgical performance and early postoperative removal of wound drains minimize the risk of complications in general and the necessity of revision surgery in particular. Patients with more comorbidities were more likely to suffer in-hospital complications.","output":"Megaendoprostheses in the management of malignant tumors of the lower extremities-risk factors for revision surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite current progress in research of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, its management remains challenging, requiring an interdisciplinary team for optimal treatment. OBJECTIVE: Aim of the present study was to evaluate potential risk factors for mortality of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. METHODS: A single-center chart review of all patients treated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia over a period of 16 years, at the Medical University of Vienna, was performed. A comparison of medical parameters between survivors and non-survivors, as well as to published literature was conducted. RESULTS: During the observational period 66 patients were diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Overall survival was 84.6%. Left-sided hernia occurred in 51 patients (78.5%) with a mortality of 7.8%. In comparison, right-sided hernia occurred less frequently (n = 12) but showed a higher mortality (33.3%, p = 0.000). Critically instable patients were provided with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 32.3%, n = 21). Survival rate among these patients was 66.7%. Right-sided hernia, treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) over 15 days and the use of ECMO over 10 days were significant risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The survival rate in this cohort is comparable to the current literature.

Objective: To assess the burden of post-acute health care use after a positive versus negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling adults January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 in Ontario, Canada, using linked population-based health data. Follow-up began 56 days after PCR testing. Exposures: Individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were matched 1:1 to individuals who tested negative based on hospitalization, test date, public health unit, sex, and a propensity score of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: The health care utilization rate was the number of outpatient clinical encounters, homecare encounters, emergency department visits, days hospitalized, and days in long-term care per person-year. Mean health care utilization for test-positive versus negative individuals was compared using negative binomial regression, and rates at 95th and 99th percentiles were compared. Outcomes were also stratified by sex. Results: Among 530,232 unique, matched individuals, mean age was 44 years (sd 17), 51% were female, and 0.6% had received []1 COVID-19 vaccine dose. The mean rate of health care utilization was 11% higher in test-positive individuals (RR 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.13). At the 95th percentile, test-positive individuals had 2.1 (95% CI 1.5-2.6) more health care encounters per person-year, and at the 99th percentile 71.9 (95% CI 57.6-83.2) more health care encounters per person-year. At the 95th percentile, test-positive women had 3.8 (95% CI 2.8-4.8) more health care encounters per person-year while there was no difference for men.

Such critical course of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is thought to associate with cytokine storm as in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), although these specific data are still lacking. In this study we aimed to directly address the question, whether immune activation in COVID-19 does indeed mimic conditions as in these classical cytokine storm syndromes. METHODS: We quantified levels of 22 biomarkers in serum samples of COVID-19 (n=30, n=83 longitudinal samples in total), sHLH/MAS patients (n=50) as well as healthy controls (n=9) using bead array assay as well as single-marker ELISA and correlated results with disease outcome. RESULTS: In sHLH/MAS we observed dramatic activation of the interleukin(IL)-18-interferon (IFN)-?3 axis, while increased serum levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and IL-8, as well as strongly reduced levels of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in course of SARS-CoV-2 infection discriminate immune dysregulation in critical COVID-19 from the investigated well-recognized cytokine storm conditions.

METHOD Blood samples for analyses of thyroid hormones were obtained at 360 assessments of 298 patients and biweekly during 42 treatment periods in 36 patients. RESULTS At assessment, when most of the girls were on a weight losing course, serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were low. Great weight loss and rapid rate of weight loss were the most important predictors of low T3 concentrations. Serum free thyroxine concentrations were in the lower normal range. In premenarcheal girls, weight loss was the most important predictor of free thyroxine but this relationship was weaker in postmenarcheal girls. Serum TSH concentrations were within the normal range and only weakly related to weight changes. During treatment, T3 increased in parallel with weight but was also influenced by the short-term weight trend. CONCLUSION Serum T3 concentration is an indicator of nutritional status in adolescent girls with eating disorders.

Study Selection Randomized trials lasting at least 12 weeks that compared efficacy (change in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] level from baseline [primary outcome]; percentage of patients with HbA1c level <7% at end of study and change in body weight [secondary outcomes]) and safety (hypoglycemia) of basal insulin analogues. Data Extraction Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each outcome. All authors evaluated overall confidence in the evidence. Data Synthesis Thirty-nine trials (26 195 patients) assessed 10 basal insulin analogues. Low- to very-low-quality evidence indicated that thrice-weekly degludec (Deg-3TW) was inferior to most other regimens for reducing HbA1c level, with mean differences ranging from 0.21% (vs. degludec, 100 U/mL [Deg-100]) to 0.32% (vs. glargine, 300 U/mL [Glar-300]).

Incidence of severe hypoglycemia did not differ among regimens, except NPL, which was associated with increased risk versus Deg-100, detemir, Glar-100, and Glar-300. Limitations Results are based mostly on indirect comparisons. Confidence in summary estimates is low or very low due to individual-study limitations, imprecision, or inconsistency. Conclusion Low-quality evidence suggests that basal insulin analogues for T2DM do not substantially differ in their glucose-lowering effect. Low- and very-low-quality evidence suggests some regimens may be associated with lower risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia (Deg-100, Deg-200, and Glar-300) or less weight gain (detemir and Glar-300).

Here, an experimental set-up is used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses cause a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmits efficiently. Serological assays confirm all virus transmission events. Although the experiments do not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while traveling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms. Although the evidence for virus transmission via the air between humans under natural conditions is absent or weak for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ferrets may represent a sensitive model to study interventions aimed at preventing virus transmission.","output":"SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted through the air between ferrets over more than one meter distance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic had expanded to the US since early 2020 and has caused nationwide economic loss and public health crisis. Until now, although the US has the most confirmed cases in the world and are still experiencing an increasing pandemic, several states insisted to re-open business activities and colleges while announced strict control measures. To provide a quantitative reference for official strategies, predicting the near future trend based on finer spatial resolution data and presumed scenarios are urgently needed. In this study, the first attempted COVID-19 case predicting model based on county-level demographic, environmental, and mobility data was constructed with multiple machine learning techniques and a hybrid framework. Different scenarios were also applied to selected metropolitan counties including New York City, Cook County in Illinois, Los Angeles County in California, and Miami-Dade County in Florida to assess the impact from lockdown, Phase I, and Phase III re-opening. Our results showed that, for selected counties, the mobility decreased substantially after the lockdown but kept increasing with an apparent weekly pattern, and the weekly pattern of mobility and infections implied high infections during the weekend. Meanwhile, our model was successfully built up, and the scenario assessment results indicated that, compared with Phase I re-opening, a 1-week and a 2-week lockdown could reduce 4%-29% and 15%-55% infections, respectively, in the future week, while 2-week Phase III re-opening could increase 16%-80% infections. We concluded that the mandatory orders in metropolitan counties such lockdown should last longer than one week, the effect could be observed. The impact of lockdown or re-opening was also county-dependent and varied with the local pandemic. In future works, we expect to involve a longer period of data, consider more county-dependent factors, and employ more sophisticated techniques to decrease the modeling uncertainty and apply it to counties nationally and other countries.","output":"Evaluating the impact of mobility on COVID-19 pandemic with machine learning hybrid predictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsTo evaluate service user and carer experience of use of videoconferencing software (Microsoft Teams) during MDT meetings.To identify specific areas for improvementTo make changes based on these recommendationsMethod2 surveys were distributed to inpatients and their carers on a functional Older Adults inpatient ward (n = 21), including quantitative and qualitiative questions.

We also bring attention to another dimension that will most likely exacerbate the severity and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 in impoverished populations, that is, the comorbidities and the presence of tropical infections. Recent Findings: During this first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a poverty-related neglected disease on at least two fronts. First, is its significant impact in low-income neighborhoods in the USA, the epicenter of the pandemic. Second, is its emergence in poor urban areas of South America, and now in Asia and Africa. In both fronts, the pandemic is contributing heavily towards the loss of public health gains that we managed to achieve globally during the last two decades. Specifically, any advances made as part of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (United Nations, 2020) is eroding, and for the first time, the number of people entering extreme poverty is increasing. Adding to this descent into poverty are new disruptions in ongoing disease control programs, routine vaccination strategies, and a reduction of capacity building efforts globally. Therefore, and as highlighted by many others, we support the notion that a way forward to eliminate this coronavirus pandemic should include linking COVID-19 control to other tropical or poverty-related diseases. Summary: COVID-19 is slowing or reversing global health and development gains. To be successful and achieve the global goals including the control of pandemics such as the one seen from the COVID-19, we must rely on strong leadership leading to impactful public policies and global collaborations, including global COVID-19 vaccinations, and potentially linking them to programs for childhood and adult vaccinations and programs for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and neglected tropical disease treatments. Opportunities also include the creation of unique research opportunities and funding models and increase science engagement for international diplomacy. This can only be done with a better understanding of the relationships between coronavirus disease, poverty, and tropical diseases.","output":"Global COVID-19 Efforts as the Platform to Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School closures follows the sudden outbreak of COVID-19.

Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been adopted as the gold standard method for discriminating SARS-CoV-2 lineages, alternative methods may be required when processing samples with low viral loads or low RNA quality. To this aim, an allele-specific probe PCR (ASP-PCR) targeting lineage-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was developed and used to screen 1,082 samples from two clinical trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Probit regression models were developed to compare ASP-PCR performance against 1,771 NGS results for the same cohorts. Individual SNPs were shown to readily identify specific variants of concern. ASP-PCR was shown to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 lineages with a higher likelihood than NGS over a wide range of viral loads. The comparative advantage for ASP-PCR over NGS was most pronounced in samples with cycle threshold (C(T)) values between 26 and 30 and in samples that showed evidence of degradation. Results for samples screened by ASP-PCR and NGS showed 99% concordant results. ASP-PCR is well suited to augment but not replace NGS. The method can differentiate SARS-CoV-2 lineages with high accuracy and would be best deployed to screen samples with lower viral loads or that may suffer from degradation.

We, therefore, aimed to determine the potential associations of long-term BPV from childhood to middle age with subclinical kidney damage (SKD) and albuminuria in adulthood. METHODS: Using data from the ongoing cohort of Hanzhong Adolescent Hypertension study, which recruited children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years at baseline, we assessed BPV by SD and average real variability (ARV) for 30 years (6 visits). Presence of SKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate between 30 and 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or elevated urinary albumin-to creatinine ratio at least 30 mg/g. Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to creatinine ratio 30 mg/g. RESULTS: During 30 years of follow-up, of the 1771 participants, 204 SKD events occurred. After adjustment for demographic, clinical characteristics, and mean BP during 30 years, higher SD(SBP) , ARV(SBP) , SD(DBP) , ARV(DBP) , SD(MAP) , ARV(MAP) , and ARV(PP) were significantly associated with higher risk of SKD. When we used cumulative exposure to BP from childhood to adulthood instead of mean BP as adjustment factors, results were similar. In addition, greater long-term BPV was also associated with the risk of albuminuria. Long-term BPV from childhood to middle age was associated with higher risk of SKD and albuminuria in adulthood, independent of mean BP or cumulative exposure to BP during follow-up.

The capacity of these private network interconnects is provisioned to match the volume of the real content demand by the users. Unfortunately, in case of a surge in traffic demand, for example due to a content trending in a certain country, the capacity of the private interconnect may deplete and the content provider/distributor would have to reroute the excess traffic through transit providers. Although, such overflow events are rare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet service providers, and end-users. These include unexpected delays and disruptions reducing the user experience quality, as well as direct costs paid by the Internet service provider to the transit providers. If the traffic overflow events could be predicted, the Internet service providers would be able to influence the routes chosen for the excess traffic to reduce the costs and increase user experience quality.

Genetic analysis, measurement of drug concentrations in blood and tumors using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, and analysis of drug distribution in tumors using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry were performed. Fifteen (20%) PDXs were established using samples collected from 76 NSCLC patients with genetic alterations. The genetic alterations observed in original patients were largely maintained in PDXs.

The goal of this work is to determine whether VSV inhibits the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which are thought to serve as mRNA export factors. Confocal microscopy experiments showed that hnRNPA1, hnRNPK, and hnRNPC1/C2, but not hnRNPB1 or lamin A/C, are relocalized to the cytoplasm during VSV infection. We determined whether protein import is inhibited by VSV by transfecting cells with a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagged with either the M9 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) or the classical NLS. These experiments revealed that both the M9 NLS and the classical NLS are functional during VSV infection. These data suggest that the inhibition of protein import is not responsible for hnRNP relocalization during VSV infection but that hnRNP export is enhanced. We found that hnRNPA1 relocalization was significantly reduced following the silencing of the mRNA export factor Rae1, indicating that Rae1 is necessary for hnRNP export. In order to determine the role of hnRNPA1 in VSV infection, we silenced hnRNPA1 in HeLa cells and assayed three aspects of the viral life cycle: host protein synthesis shutoff concurrent with the onset of viral protein synthesis, replication by plaque assay, and cell killing. We observed that host shutoff and replication are unaffected by the reduction in hnRNPA1 but that the rate of VSV-induced apoptosis is slower in cells that have reduced hnRNPA1. These data suggest that VSV promotes hnRNPA1 relocalization in a Rae1-dependent manner for apoptotic signaling.","output":"hnRNPs Relocalize to the cytoplasm following infection with vesicular stomatitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of measurement quality cannot be over emphasized in medical applications, as one is dealing with life issues and the wellbeing of society, from oncology to new-borns, and more recently to patients of the COVID-19 pandemic. In all these dire situations, the accuracy of fluid delivered according to a prescribed dose can be critical. Microflow applications are growing in importance for a wide variety of scientific fields, namely drug development and administration, Organ-on-a-Chip, or bioanalysis, but accurate and reliable measurements are a tough challenge in micro-to-femto flow operating ranges, from 2.7810-4 mL/s down to 2.7810-7 mL/s (1000 L/h down to 1 L/h). Several sources of error have been established such as the mass measurement, the fluid evaporation dependent on the gravimetric methodology implemented, the tube adsorption and the repeatability, believed to be closely related to the operating mode of the stepper motor and drive screw pitch of a syringe pump. In addition, the difficulty in dealing with microflow applications extends to the evaluation of measurement uncertainty which will qualify the quality of measurement. This is due to the conditions entailed when measuring very small values, close to zero, of a quantity such as the flow rate which is inherently positive. Alternative methods able to handle these features were developed and implemented, and their suitability will be discussed.","output":"Uncertainty calculation methodologies in microflow measurements: comparison of GUM, GUM-S1 and Bayesian approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is widely believed that society is becoming increasingly polarized around important issues, a dynamic that does not align with common mathematical models of opinion formation in social networks. In particular, measures of polarization based on opinion variance are known to decrease over time in frameworks such as the popular DeGroot model. Complementing recent work that seeks to resolve this apparent inconsistency by modifying opinion models, we instead resolve the inconsistency by proposing changes to how polarization is quantified. We present a natural class of group-based polarization measures that capture the extent to which opinions are clustered into distinct groups. Using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, we show that these group-based measures display interesting, non-monotonic dynamics, even in the simple DeGroot model. In particular, for many natural social networks, group-based metrics can increase over time, and thereby correctly capture perceptions of increasing polarization. Our results build on work by DeMarzo et al., who introduced a group-based polarization metric based on ideological alignment. We show that a central tool from that work, a limit analysis of individual opinions under the DeGroot model, can be extended to the dynamics of other group-based polarization measures, including established statistical measures like bimodality. We also consider local measures of polarization that operationalize how polarization is perceived in a network setting. In conjunction with evidence from prior work that group-based measures better align with real-world perceptions of polarization, our work provides formal support for the use of these measures in place of variance-based polarization in future studies of opinion dynamics.","output":"How to Quantify Polarization in Models of Opinion Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 public health proscriptions have created severe if temporary, barriers to accessing face-to-face psychotherapy across the world. As disruptive as these are, they come on top of more long-standing barriers to getting psychotherapy faced by millions in need. eHealth interventions offer an avenue for redressing both types of barriers, but evidence about their efficacy remains a concern. This review of reviews and metaanalyses outlines the strength of evidence and effect sizes for guided and unguided approaches to eHealth interventions targeting common problems in psychotherapy (i.e., depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and general well-being). After a comprehensive search, a total of 65 reviews and meta-analyses were identified and evaluated for treatment effects, moderators, acceptability, and attrition. Findings show eHealth is acceptable and effective at improving depression, anxiety, alcohol-related problems, and general mental health compared to waitlist, and can even offer benefit as an adjunct to traditional psychotherapy. Mixed evidence was found when comparing guided versus unguided interventions as well as the strength of benefit relative to active controls and the degree to which these approaches are associated with attrition. eHealth interventions have the potential to be an effective tool for redressing both new and old psychotherapy access barriers.","output":"eHealth to redress psychotherapy access barriers both new and old: A review of reviews and meta-analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improving the design of nanoparticles for use as drug carriers or biosensors requires a better understanding of the protein-nanoparticle interaction.

Cases of Bell's palsy following COVID-19 vaccination were reported disproportionately in the vaccine group during phase 3 clinical trials and have now been reported multiple times post-licensure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated the frequency of Bell's palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate of Bell's palsy in the population but recommends surveillance for cases of Bell's palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.(1) He re we present a case of Bell's palsy following Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine administration in an HIV + patient as a potential adverse event following immunization. OBSERVATIONS: A 60-year-old male with HIV presented to the emergency department for evaluation of left facial droop. He had received the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination approximately 42 hours prior to symptom onset. Physical examination in the ED revealed left-sided facial weakness with involvement of the forehead, inability to raise left eyebrow, and inability to close left eye with sensation and strength intact in bilateral upper and lower extremities. Physical examination in our outpatient ophthalmology clinic on day 2 following symptom onset was revealing for mild exposure keratopathy, 5 mm lagophthalmos and very poor Bell's reflex in the left eye with otherwise normal exam findings. These findings were judged to be consistent with uncomplicated Bell's palsy. He was provided ophthalmic lubricating ointment to use hourly, artificial tears as needed, moisture goggles and suggested to tape eyelids nightly in addition to standard systemic glucocorticoid and antiviral therapy. The patient's facial weakness and exposure keratopathy were completely resolved at approximately 90 days following symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: and Importance: Though there is insufficient evidence at this time to support any causal association between COVID-19 vaccines and Bell's palsy, the temporal relationship between vaccination and classic clinical features of Bell's palsy in our patient certainly raises suspicion for association with COVID-19 vaccination.

This article aims to report and discuss the data of the first 8 weeks of COVID-19 epidemic in the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital of Parma. METHODS: The ED visits were analyzed as follows: total ED visits, divided in COVID-19/ non-COVID-19 cases, and in trauma-related/non-trauma-related cases; outcome (i.e., discharged, admitted, dead in the ED) of patients, altogether or stratified according to triage class; age classes of the entire ED population. RESULTS: Total ED visits decreased starting from the first days of the outbreak, then exhibiting progressive growth afterwards. COVID suspected cases rapidly increased, whereas non-COVID suspected dropped and remained well below the standard. Trauma-related cases declined, both as ED visits and as hospital admissions. The percentage and absolute number of patients admitted to hospital wards progressively increased, rapidly overwhelming the number of cases that could be discharged. The admission rate in the lowest priority classes also displayed a marked increase. The youngest age classes dramatically declined, whilst the oldest progressively increased, remaining considerably over the standard rate of the local ED. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has obliged the health care systems to undergo a paradigm shift. Even triage criteria have partially lost their meaning, as shown by the dramatic increase of hospital admissions, even in the lowest priority classes. A deep re-organizational process of the ED was undertaken. Hospitals must be constantly resilient and prepared to these new emergencies in terms of equipment, medical and nurses staff, larger bed capacity in short time, availability of intensive and sub-intensive beds, and flexibility.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on census, organization and activity of a large urban Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate whether COVID-19-ARDS differs from all-cause ARDS. METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive, mechanically ventilated COVID-19-ARDS patients were compared to two historical ARDS sub-populations 1:1 matched for PaO(2)/FiO(2) or for compliance of the respiratory system. Gas exchange, hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were recorded at 5 and 15 cmH(2)O PEEP. CT scan variables were measured at 5 cmH(2)O PEEP. RESULTS: Anthropometric characteristics were similar in COVID-19-ARDS, PaO(2)/FiO(2)-matched-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS. The PaO(2)/FiO(2)-matched-ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS populations (both with PaO(2)/FiO(2) 106  59 mmHg) had different respiratory system compliances (Crs) (39  11 vs 49.9  15.4 ml/cmH(2)O, p = 0.03). The Compliance-matched-ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS had similar Crs (50.1  15.7 and 49.9  15.4 ml/cmH(2)O, respectively) but significantly lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) for the same Crs (160  62 vs 106.5  59.6 mmHg, p < 0.001). The three populations had similar lung weights but COVID-19-ARDS had significantly higher lung gas volume (PaO(2)/FiO(2)-matched-ARDS 930  644 ml, COVID-19-ARDS 1670  791 ml and Compliance-matched-ARDS 1301  627 ml, p < 0.05). The venous admixture was significantly related to the non-aerated tissue in PaO(2)/FiO(2)-matched-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS (p < 0.001) but unrelated in COVID-19-ARDS (p = 0.75), suggesting that hypoxemia was not only due to the extent of non-aerated tissue. Increasing PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O improved oxygenation in all groups. However, while lung mechanics and dead space improved in PaO(2)/FiO(2)-matched-ARDS, suggesting recruitment as primary mechanism, they remained unmodified or worsened in COVID-19-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS, suggesting lower recruitment potential and/or blood flow redistribution. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-ARDS is a subset of ARDS characterized overall by higher compliance and lung gas volume for a given PaO(2)/FiO(2), at least when considered within the timeframe of our study.

METHODS: The Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons is an anonymous cross-sectional survey sponsored by the Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force disseminated April 14 to 24, 2020. This analysis focuses on pattern changes in vascular surgery practices in the United States including the inpatient setting, ambulatory, and vascular laboratory setting. Specific questions regarding occupational exposure to COVID-19, adequacy of personal protective equipment, elective surgical practice, changes in call schedule, and redeployment to nonvascular surgery duties were also included in the survey. Regional variation was assessed. The survey data were collected using REDCap and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 535 vascular surgeons responded to the survey from 45 states. Most of the respondents were male (73.1%), white (70.7%), practiced in urban settings (81.7%), and in teaching hospitals (66.8%). Almost one-half were in hospitals with more than 400 beds (46.4%). There was no regional variation in the presence of preoperative COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 OR protocols, adherence to national surgical standards, or the availability of personal protective equipment. The overwhelming majority of respondents (91.7%) noted elective surgery cancellation, with the Northeast and Southeast regions having the most case cancellations 94.2% and 95.8%, respectively. The Northeast region reported the highest percentage of operations or procedures on patients with COVID-19, which was either identified at the time of the surgery or later in the hospital course (82.7%). Ambulatory visits were performed via telehealth (81.3%), with 71.1% having restricted hours. More than one-half of office-based laboratories (OBLs) were closed, although there was regional variation with more than 80% in the Midwest being closed.

These records are important resources for research and analysis of TCM diagnosis knowledge. However, most of TCM clinical records are unstructured text. Therefore, a method to automatically extract medical entities from TCM clinical records is indispensable. OBJECTIVE: Training a medical entity extracting model needs a large number of annotated corpus. The cost of annotated corpus is very high and there is a lack of gold-standard data sets for supervised learning methods. Therefore, we utilized distantly supervised named entity recognition (NER) to respond to the challenge. METHODS: We propose a span-level distantly supervised NER approach to extract TCM medical entity. It utilizes the pretrained language model and a simple multilayer neural network as classifier to detect and classify entity. We also designed a negative sampling strategy for the span-level model. The strategy randomly selects negative samples in every epoch and filters the possible false-negative samples periodically. It reduces the bad influence from the false-negative samples. RESULTS: We compare our methods with other baseline methods to illustrate the effectiveness of our method on a gold-standard data set. The F1 score of our method is 77.34 and it remarkably outperforms the other baselines.

The relationship between the EDE\\\\Q\\\\global score and other variables related to ED was examined. Linear regression analysis was performed to examine the predictive power of these variables on ED behaviour. RESULTS: Thirty\\\\eight ED patients with a mean age of 15.12  1.56 years were included in the study. Of participants, 42.1% reported feeling an improvement in ED symptomatology, 71.0% reported none or rare conflict with parents due to eating, 39.5% reported often or always complying with their meal plan.

Internet search interest was found correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence in China, but not yet applied to the U.S. Therefore, we examined the association of internet search-interest with COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the U.S. METHODS: We extracted the COVDI-19 daily incidence and death data in the U.S. from two population-based datasets. The search interest of COVID-19 related terms was obtained using Google Trends. Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine correlations and predict future trends, respectively. RESULTS: There were 555,245 new cases and 22,019 deaths of COVID-19 reported in the U.S. from March 1 to April 12, 2020. The search interest of COVID, COVID pneumonia, and COVID heart were correlated with COVDI-19 daily incidence with ~12-day of delay (Pearsons r=0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and deaths with 19-day of delay (Pearsons r=0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively). The COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths appeared to both peak on April 10. The 4-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed moderate to good accuracies for predicting new cases (Pearsons r=?0.641 to ?0.833) and poor to good accuracies for daily new deaths (Pearsons r=0.365 to 0.935).

Inspired by the research of graphene, the 2D counterpart of bulk germanium, germanene, has been discovered and the characteristics of Dirac electrons have been observed. However, the optical properties of germanene still remain elusive. In this work, several layers of germanene are prepared with Dirac electronic characteristics and its morphology, band structure, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties are systematically investigated. It is surprisingly found that germanene has a fast carrier-relaxation time comparable to that of graphene and a relatively large nonlinear absorption coefficient, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene in the near-infrared wavelength range. Based on these findings, germanene is applied as a new saturable absorber to construct an ultrafast mode-locked laser, and sub-picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized. The results suggest that germanene can be used as a new type of group-IV material for various nonlinear optics and photonic applications.","output":"Germanium Nanosheets with Dirac Characteristics as a Saturable Absorber for Ultrafast Pulse Generation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: Healthcare-associated infections linked to contaminated textiles are rare but underline their potential role as a source for transmission.

Results: The survival of bacteria at room temperature was the longest on polyester (up to 206 days), whereas it was up to 90 days for some species on cotton and mixed fibers. Only low inocula of 100 CFU were found on all types of textiles with a short survival time of 3 days. Most bacterial species survived better at elevated air humidity. The infectivity of viruses on textiles is lost much faster at room temperature, typically within 2C4 weeks. Conclusions: Contaminated textiles or fabrics may be a source of transmission for weeks.

In addition to natural outbreaks, there is the potential for exposure to VEEV via aerosolized virus particles. There are currently no FDA-licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies for VEEV. Passive immunotherapy is an approved method used to protect individuals against several pathogens and toxins. Human polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) are ideal, but this is dependent upon serum from convalescent human donors, which is in limited supply. Non-human-derived PAbs can have serious immunoreactivity complications, and when \\"humanized,\\" these antibodies may exhibit reduced neutralization efficiency. To address these issues, transchromosomic (Tc) bovines have been created, which can produce potent neutralizing human antibodies in response to hyperimmunization. In these studies, we have immunized these bovines with different VEEV immunogens and evaluated the protective efficacy of purified preparations of the resultant human polyclonal antisera against low- and high-dose VEEV challenges. These studies demonstrate that prophylactic or therapeutic administration of the polyclonal antibody preparations (TcPAbs) can protect mice against lethal subcutaneous or aerosol challenge with VEEV. Furthermore, significant protection against unrelated coinfecting viral pathogens can be conferred by combining individual virus-specific TcPAb preparations.IMPORTANCE With the globalization and spread or potential aerosol release of emerging infectious diseases, it will be critical to develop platforms that are able to produce therapeutics in a short time frame. By using a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine platform, it is theoretically possible to produce antigen-specific highly neutralizing therapeutic polyclonal human antibody (TcPAb) preparations in 6 months or less. In this study, we demonstrate that Tc bovine-derived Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)-specific TcPAbs are highly effective against VEEV infection that mimics not only the natural route of infection but also infection via aerosol exposure. Additionally, we show that combinatorial TcPAb preparations can be used to treat coinfections with divergent pathogens, demonstrating that the Tc bovine platform could be beneficial in areas where multiple infectious diseases occur contemporaneously or in the case of multipathogen release.","output":"Antibody Preparations from Human Transchromosomic Cows Exhibit Prophylactic and Therapeutic Efficacy against Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The detection of SARS-CoV-2 with rapid diagnostic tests has become an important tool to identify infected people and break infection chains. These rapid diagnostic tests are usually based on antigen detection in a lateral flow approach. Aims & Methods While for PCR diagnostics the validation of a PCR assay is well established, for antigen tests e.g. rapid diagnostic tests there is no common validation strategy. Here we present the establishment of a panel of 50 pooled clinical specimens that cover a SARS-CoV-2 concentration range from approximately 1.1 x 109 to 420 genome copies per mL of specimen. The panel was used to evaluate 31 rapid diagnostic tests in up to 6 laboratories. Results Our results show that there is significant variation in the detection limits and the clinical sensitivity of different rapid diagnostic tests. We conclude that the best rapid diagnostic tests can be applied to reliably identify infectious individuals who are presenting with SARS-CoV-2 loads correlated to 106 genome copies per mL of specimen. Infected individuals displaying SARS-CoV-2 genome loads corresponding to less than 106 genome copies per mL will be identified by only some rapid diagnostics tests, while many tests miss these viral loads to a large extent.

There were 4 males and 13 females, age ranged from 25.0 to 51.0 (39.87.5) years, who were closely contacted with other COVID-19 patients. The follow-up CT examination was performed within 3 to 6 days after the initial CT examination in all patients. Six patients were treated using anti-virus, anti-inflammation and symptomatic therapy, while the other 11 patients were untreated. The subclinical CT findings and short-term follow-up were analyzed, and the CT changes of short-term follow-up were summarized. Results: The lesions of 17 COVID-19 patients were mainly located at the lower lobes of bilateral lungs (at the left lower lobe in 9 cases and at the right lower lobe in 10 cases in the subclinical stage, at the left lower lobe in 9 cases and at the right lower lobe in 11 cases in the short-term follow-up). The number of involved lung segments increased from 46 in the subclinical stage to 90 in the short-term follow-up. In the subclinical stage, the multiple lesions were found in 13 cases, while in the short-term follow-up, the number of cases with multiple lesions decreased by 7, however the cases with focal lesions increased by 6 and diffuse lesions by 4. The lesions were mainly distributed under the pleura (13 cases) or along the bronchovascular bundle(10 cases). In the short-term follow-up, the lesion in 1 case expanded from the subpleural area to neighbouring bronchovascular bundle. There were 3 main types of the lesions, including ground glass nodule, ground glass opacity and crazy-paving pattern. In the subclinical stage and short-term follow-up, the ground glass opacities were seen in all the 17 cases. In the short-term follow-up, the number of cases with ground glass nodules decreased by 4 and crazy-paving pattern increased by 4. In 6 patients after treatment, the multiple ground glass nodules became single one in 3 cases, and in other 3 cases the multiple ground glass opacities were getting smaller. However, the scope of lesions in 11 patients without treatment enlarged.

It has been suggested that the influenza vaccine might attenuate the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective single-centered cohort review of a de-identified database of 2005 patients over the age of 18 within the University of Florida health care system who tested positive for COVID-19. Comorbidities and influenza vaccination status were examined. The primary outcome was severity of disease as reflected by hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between influenza status and hospitalization. RESULTS: COVID-19-positive patients who had not received the influenza vaccination within the last year had a 2.44 (95% CI, 1.68, 3.61) greater odds of hospitalization and a 3.29 (95% CI, 1.18, 13.77) greater odds of ICU admission when compared with those who were vaccinated. These results were controlled to account for age, race, gender, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. DISCUSSION: Our analysis suggests that the influenza vaccination is potentially protective of moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 infection. This protective effect holds regardless of comorbidity. The literature points to a potential mechanism via natural killer cell activation. Though our data potentially is limited by its generalizability and our vaccination rate is low, it holds significant relevance given the upcoming influenza season.

However, the breakthrough dose was fairly low, and protection waned with time. These weaknesses triggered extensive research for better vaccine candidates.

Section 1 discusses the relevance and research design and explains the broader project of which this analysis is part. Section 2 describes the measures taken regarding unemployment benefits during the pandemic. Section 3 focuses on sick pay and sickness benefits. Section 4 discusses the special Covid-19 parental leave arrangements. The conclusions highlight the main trends in the measures taken during the first wave of the pandemic as well as their relevance for non-standard workers and the selfemployed.","output":"Non-standard Workers and the Self-employed in the EU: Social Protection During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Restrictions in elective surgery and large group gatherings as well as changes in faculty and resident schedules during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to rapid evolvement of the training curriculum for neurosurgical trainees. While necessary, these changes may have significant impact on the training of neurosurgery residents. METHODS: A survey assessing changes to resident clinical and educational workload and their sentiment about how these changes may affect their careers was distributed electronically to neurosurgery residents in the United States and Canada. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-seven resident responses were collected between April 17, 2020 and April 30, 2020. The survey respondents were spread over 29 states and Canada and were evenly spread across all residency levels (P = .619). Nearly 82% reported that the inpatient and outpatient volumes were either greatly (44.0%) or moderately (37.8%) reduced. Greater than 91% reported a significant reduction in work hours and a significant increase in resident didactics (P < .001). Nearly all residents surveyed (98.5%) reported that their program had converted to electronic platforms for their didactic lectures, and there was a significant increase in the time residents spent in didactic lectures. Residents reported converting the majority of their time outside of neurosurgery clinical responsibilities into watching remote didactic lectures, conducting research, and preparing for board examinations, while nearly 14% of trainees spent at least a portion of that time providing COVID-19 medical care. Senior residents were more likely to express concern about their educational experience as well as their future career prospects. CONCLUSION: Universally, residents have experienced reduced work hours and operative case volumes. Programs have adapted by increasing didactic time and using electronic platforms. The findings suggest that senior residents may feel the effects more than their junior counterparts. This may require more acute attention from faculty with respect to preparing senior residents for moving on to fellowship or ultimate job. It is possible that this remarkable time period will prompt a critical re-appraisal of the pre-COVID-19 adequacy of educational content in our training programs, and that enhanced educational efforts driven by this pandemic may be lasting.","output":"An Evaluation of Neurosurgical Resident Education and Sentiment During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A North American Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]urine albumin to creatinine ratio is often measured at the point-of-care in a network of clinics Because of limited data on the quality of this test, Tamika Regnier, BMedSc, and colleagues investigate this aspect using 16 years of analytical quality data Adil I Khan, MSc, PhD Adil I Khan, MSc, PhD, is an associate professor of pathology at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the medical director for point-of-care testing and clinical chemistry for the Temple University Health System Dr Khan then pursued a postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of Calgary, Canada, studying the role of L-selectin and CD44 in models of acute inflammation, followed by a postdoctoral clinical chemistry training fellowship at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas Since 2006, he has been teaching at Temple University, lecturing to pathology residents, medical students, and students of podiatric medicine","output":"Transforming Clinical Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Twitter is a useful resource to analyze peoples' opinions on various topics.

AIM: The objective of this article was to find the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and stress and their socio-demographic correlates among Indian population during the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an electronic questionnaire. A total of 354 participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Depression, anxiety and stress were measured using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), a 21-item self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 25%, 28% and 11.6% of the participants were moderate to extremely severely depressed, anxious and stressed, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated employment status (odds ratio (OR) = 1.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-3.418) and binge drinking (OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.045-3.945) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; gender (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.317-3.589), employment status (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.002-3.141) and binge drinking (OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.361-5.048) were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms; and binge drinking (OR = 3.42; 95% CI: 1.544-7.583) was significantly associated with stress symptoms. CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety and stress among Indian population during the lockdown were prevalent.

However, traditional methods of disseminating and digesting medical information can be time-consuming and cumbersome. In a pilot study, the authors used social listening to quickly extract information from social media channels to explore what people with COVID-19 are talking about regarding symptoms and disease progression. The goal was to determine whether, by amplifying patient voices, new information could be identified that might have been missed through other sources. Two data sets from social media groups of people with or presumed to have COVID-19 were analyzed: a Facebook group poll, and conversation data from a Reddit group including detailed disease natural history-like posts. Content analysis and a customized analytics engine that incorporates machine learning and natural language processing were used to quickly identify symptoms mentioned. Key findings include more than 20 symptoms in the data sets that were not listed in online lists of symptoms from 4 respected medical information sources. The disease natural history-like posts revealed that people can experience symptoms for many weeks and that some symptoms change over time. This study demonstrates that social media can offer novel insights into patient experiences as a source of real-world data. This inductive research approach can quickly generate descriptive information that can be used to develop hypotheses and new research questions. Also, the method allows rapid assessments of large numbers of social media conversations that could be applied to monitor public health for emerging and rapidly spreading diseases such as COVID-19.","output":"Social Listening as a Rapid Approach to Collecting and Analyzing COVID-19 Symptoms and Disease Natural Histories Reported by Large Numbers of Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to characterise the kinetics and durability of neutralizing antibody (Nab) response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the presence of hyperglycemia. METHODS: Using a lentiviral-vector-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay to measure Nabs, we characterised 150 patients randomly selected from a cohort of 509 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We analysed Nab response according to the presence of diabetes or hyperglycaemia, at the time of hospitalisation and during the post discharge follow-up, i.e., 1, 3 and 6 months outpatient visits. RESULTS: Among 150 randomly selected patients 40 (26.6%) had diabetes. Diabetes (HR 8.9, p < 0.001), glucose levels (HR 1.25 x 1.1 mmol/L, p < 0.001) and glucose variability (HR 1.17 x 0.6 mmol/L, p < 0.001) were independently associated with an increased risk of mortality. The neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with diabetes was superimposable, as for kinetics and extent, to that of patients without diabetes. It was similar across glucose levels and correlated with the humoral response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Positivity for Nabs at the time of hospital admission conferred protection on mortality, both in the presence (HR 0.28, p=0.046) or absence of diabetes (HR 0.26, p=0.030). The longevity of the Nab response was not affected by diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes and hyperglycaemia do not affect the kinetics and durability of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.

Many subcortical structures are known to play a crucial role in higher-order cognitive processing. However, comprehensive anatomic characterization of these structures is currently lacking in the congenital heart disease population. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the morphometry and volume of the globus pallidus, striatum, and thalamus between youth born with congenital heart disease and healthy peers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited youth between 16 and 24 years of age born with congenital heart disease who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery before 2 years of age (n = 48) and healthy controls of the same age (n = 48). All participants underwent a brain MR imaging to acquire high-resolution 3D T1-weighted images. RESULTS: Smaller surface area and inward bilateral displacement across the lateral surfaces of the globus pallidus were concentrated anteriorly in the congenital heart disease group compared with controls (q < 0.15). On the lateral surfaces of bilateral thalami, we found regions of both larger and smaller surface areas, as well as inward and outward displacement in the congenital heart disease group compared with controls (q < 0.15). We did not find any morphometric differences between groups for the striatum. For the volumetric analyses, only the right globus pallidus showed a significant volume reduction (q < 0.05) in the congenital heart disease group compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports morphometric alterations in youth with congenital heart disease in the absence of volume reductions, suggesting that volume alone is not sufficient to detect and explain subtle neuroanatomic differences in this clinical population.","output":"Characterizing the Subcortical Structures in Youth with Congenital Heart Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon complication of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection Previous reports have described its management and treatment in medical units, but have not discussed confirmatory tests or differential diagnosis We report a case of a 58 year-old male patient, who was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia and subsequently developed severe weakness, inability to move limbs, acute renal failure, significantly elevated myoglobin and creatinine kinase, and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis Continuous renal replacement therapy, the treatment modality of choice over hyperhydration due to ongoing mechanical ventilation, was effective in resolving symptoms No direct viral invasion of muscles was noted on biopsy Here, we describe his symptoms, electromyography, and muscular biopsy results, and further discuss the possible differential diagnoses Neuromuscular symptoms related to COVID-19 require careful clinical analysis In addition, detailed reports of patients course of illness and diagnoses will assist in improving care for affected patients","output":"Clinical, electromyographical, histopathological characteristics of COVID-19 related rhabdomyolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term humoral immunity and its protective role in liver transplantation (LT) patients have not been elucidated.

A total of 65 LT recipients were matched with 65 nontransplanted patients by a propensity score including variables with recognized impact on COVID-19. LT recipients showed a lower prevalence of anti-nucleocapsid (27.7% versus 49.2%; P = 0.02) and anti-spike IgG antibodies (88.2% versus 100.0%; P = 0.02) at 12 months. Lower index values of anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies were also observed in transplantation patients 1 year after COVID-19 (median, 0.49 [interquartile range, 0.15-1.40] versus 1.36 [interquartile range, 0.53-2.91]; P < 0.001).

Beyond the understanding of contextual changes in diets due to a temporary lockdown, it is of interest to study longer-term consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak as sustained changes in diets may have both an impact on population health and the environment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine both short- (after 1 month) and mid-term (after 1 year) impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on the nutritional quality and environmental impact of diets, and as a secondary objective on food choice motives. METHODS: We collected dietary data [food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)] and the importance of nine food choice motives through online questionnaires before, during, and after 1 year of the first lockdown for 524 French participants. Adherence to the French dietary recommendations was estimated using the simplified PNNS-GS2, which scores from ?17 to 11.5. Environmental impact of diets was assessed by calculating greenhouse gas emissions in CO2eq/2,000 kcal. RESULTS: We showed a short-term decrease in nutritional quality (?0.26 points on sPNNS-GS2, p = 0.017) and environmental impact (?0.17 kg CO2eq/2,000 kcal, p = 0.004) but this decrease was only temporary, and nutritional quality (?0.01 points on sPNNS-GS2, p = 0.974) and environmental impact (?0.04 kg CO2eq/2,000 kcal, p = 0.472) were not different from their initial values 1 year later. Some of the food choice motives followed the trend of a short-term increase and a mid-term stability (health, natural content, ethical concern, and weight control). On the contrary, we showed both short- and mid-term decreases in convenience, familiarity, and price motives. CONCLUSION: Changes in diets and motives observed during the first lockdown were mostly temporary. However, we highlighted a sustained decrease in the importance of perceived constraints due to food shopping and food preparation which may suggest a trend toward a more positive perception of food-related activities.","output":"Short- and Mid-Term Impacts of COVID-19 Outbreak on the Nutritional Quality and Environmental Impact of Diet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the safety of video follow-up in bariatric surgery is established, patients' perception of telemedicine visits remained unknown.

Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of information from clinical text in response to emergent diseases using natural language processing (NLP). METHODS: We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining. RESULTS: In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable.","output":"Natural Language Processing for Rapid Response to Emergent Diseases: Case Study of Calcium Channel Blockers and Hypertension in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are uncomplicated, our understanding of predictors of symptom resolution and viral shedding cessation remains limited.

Whether COVID-19 patients are at high risk of GBS is unknown. Through a systematic review of case reports, we aimed to summarize the main features of patients with GBS and COVID-19. Methods: Without any restrictions, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv (April 23 rd, 2020). Two reviewers screened and studied titles, abstracts and reports. We extracted information to characterize sociodemographic variables, clinical presentation, laboratory results, treatments and outcomes. Results: Eight reports (n=12 patients) of GBS and COVID-19 were identified; one was a Miller Fisher case. The age ranged between 23 and 77 years, and there were more men (9/102). GBS symptoms started between 5 and 24 days after those of COVID-19. The protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid samples ranged between 40 and 193 mg/dl. None of the cerebrospinal fluid samples tested positive for COVID-19. Six patients debuted with ascendant weakness and three with facial weakness. Five patients had favourable evolution, four remained with relevant symptoms or required critical care and one died; the Miller Fisher case had successful resolution. Conclusions: GBS is emerging as a disease that may appear in COVID-19 patients. Although limited, preliminary evidence appears to suggest that GBS occurs after COVID-19 onset. Practitioners and investigators should have GBS in mind as they look after COVID-19 patients and conduct research on novel aspects of COVID-19. Comparison with GBS patients in the context of another viral outbreak (Zika), revealed similarities and differences that deserves further scrutiny and epidemiological studies.","output":"COVID-19 and Guillain-Barre Syndrome: a systematic review of case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spirulina platensis is a super-food and has attracted researchers attention due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic properties. Herein, we investigated the antinociceptive effects of Spirulina in different rodent behavior models of inflammatory pain. Male Swiss mice were treated with Spirulina (3C300 mg/kg, p.o.), indomethacin (10 mg/kg, p.o.), or vehicle (0.9% NaCl 10 mL/kg). Behavioral tests were performed with administration of acetic acid (0.6%, i.p.), formalin 2.7% (formaldehyde 1%, i.pl.), menthol (1.2 mol/paw, i.pl.), cinnamaldehyde (10 nmol/paw, i.pl.), capsaicin (1.6 g/paw, i.pl.), glutamate (20 mol/paw, i.pl.), or naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.). The animals were also exposed to the rotarod and open field test to determine possible effects of Spirulina on locomotion and motor coordination. The quantitative phytochemical assays exhibited that Spirulina contains significant concentrations of total phenols and flavonoid contents, as well as it showed a powerful antioxidant effect with the highest scavenging activity. Oral administration of Spirulina completely inhibited the abdominal contortions induced by acetic acid (ED(50) = 20.51 mg/kg). Spirulina treatment showed significant inhibition of formalin-induced nociceptive behavior during the inflammatory phase, and the opioid-selective antagonist markedly blocked this effect. Furthermore, our data indicate that the mechanisms underlying Spirulina analgesia appear to be related to its ability to modulate TRMP8 and TRPA1, but not by TRPV1 or glutamatergic system. Spirulina represents an orally active and safe natural analgesic that exhibits great therapeutic potential for managing inflammatory pain disorders.","output":"Involvement of Opioid System and TRPM8/TRPA1 Channels in the Antinociceptive Effect of Spirulina platensis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physiologic changes during pregnancy may increase the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection Limited data show serious complications of COVID-19 infection and pregnancy Severe adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes such as preterm delivery, intensive care unit admission, and neonatal and intrauterine death have been reported Our knowledge of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, disease progression, and clinical course of COVID-19 is continually changing as more information and evidence emerge The present case adds further insights on COVID-19 and anesthesia considerations for patients undergoing cesarean delivery In this case report, we describe a successful spinal anesthetic in a pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19 To prepare for the likelihood of caring for women during labor and cesarean delivery, anesthesia professionals must know how to provide safe, patient-centered care and how to protect every member of the obstetric team from exposure to the virus In addition, it is paramount that our profession shares our experiences and practices to help guide our multidisciplinary approach in delivering the best care possible to these women","output":"Anesthesia Considerations of a Pregnant Woman With COVID-19 Undergoing Cesarean Delivery: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore employees' perceptions of the quality of internal communication in German organizations during the Covid-19 pandemic. In this context, the paper aims to identify antecedents and outcomes of high-quality internal communication during the pandemic. In doing so, it draws important practical and theoretical implications for pandemic-era communication, particularly surrounding issues such as employees' needs and strategic approaches to communication during the pandemic, as well as the effects of successful internal (crisis) communication. Design/methodology/approach A representative survey was conducted on employees (n = 934) working at different types of organizations in Germany. After a dimensionality check was conducted through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the proposed hypotheses were tested by conducting a structural equation model (SEM) using the R package lavaan. Findings This study identifies several antecedents of high-quality internal communication during the Covid-19 crisis, such as the frequency of communication at the beginning and during the pandemic, the dissemination of substantial information, participative communication and a clear rejection of secrecy. Furthermore, the findings show that high-quality internal communication has a positive impact on the employee-organization relationship (EOR). Originality/value This study suggests that strategic alignment of internal communications during the Covid-19 pandemic is crucial: by considering a number of factors, organizations can positively influence employees' perceptions of the quality of their internal communication.

METHODS: We surveyed 16 physicians across 3 hospitals in our healthcare system to address COVID-19 related concerns in the management of interventional and structural heart disease patients, and to formulate system wide criteria for deferring cases till after the pandemic. RESULTS: Our survey yielded common concerns centered on the need to protect patients, cath lab staff and physicians from unnecessary exposure to COVID-19; for COVID-19 testing prior to arrival to the cath lab; for clear communication between the referring physician and the interventionalist; but there was initial uncertainty among physicians regarding the optimal management of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; percutaneous coronary intervention versus thrombolytics). Patients with stable angina and hemodynamically stable acute coronary syndromes were deemed suitable for initial medical management, except when they had large ischemic burden. Most transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVI) were felt appropriate for postponement except in symptomatic patients with aortic valve area <0.5 cm(2) or recent hospitalization for heart failure (HF). Most percutaneous mitral valve repair (pMVR) procedures were felt appropriate for postponement except in patients with HF. All left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) and patent foramen ovale (PFO)/atrial septal defect (ASD) closure procedures were felt appropriate for postponement.

Tests available to make an early and effective diagnosis of viral diseases are mainly based on PCR, the gold-standard method, or in the detection of virus antigens or antibodies against them. The need for rapid diagnostic tests postulates aptamers as an alternative to antibodies. Aptamers are short single-stranded nucleic acid molecules that are selected through an in vitro process called SELEX. They show numerous advantages over antibodies, such as greater stability and chemical synthesis that minimizes variability between batches. However, they still have some limitations, for example, their low commercial availability, or the absence of standardized protocols for their characterization. In this work, different approaches for selecting aptamers against viruses are presented, as well as their targets, sequences, and binding affinities.

This similarity opens the question whether infection with one coronavirus will confer resistance to other coronaviruses? Investigating patient serum samples after SARS-CoV-2 infection in cross-reactivity studies of immunogenic peptides from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we were able to detect the production of antibodies also recognizing MERS virus antigens. The cross-reactive peptide comes from the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of the MERS virus spike protein. Indeed, the peptide of the HR2 domain of the MERS spike protein, previously proven to induce antibodies against MERS-CoV is sharing 74% homology with the corresponding sequence of SARS-CoV-19 virus. Sera samples of 47 convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, validated by RT-PCR-negative testes 30 days post-infection, and samples of 40 sera of control patients (not infected with SARS-CoV-2 previously) were used to establish eventual cross-bind reactivity with the MERS peptide antigen. Significantly stronger binding (p<0.0001) was observed for IgG antibodies in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to the control group. If used as an antigen, the peptide of the HR2 domain of the MERS spike protein allows discrimination between post-Covid populations from non-infected ones by the presence of antibodies in blood samples. This suggests that polyclonal antibodies established during SARS-CoV-2 infection has the ability to recognize and probably decrease infectiveness of MERS-CoV infections as well as other coronaviruses. The high homology of the spike protein domain suggests in addition that the opposite effect can also be true: coronaviral infections producing cross-reactive antibodies affective against SARS-CoV-19. The collected data prove in addition that despite the core HR2 region being hidden in the native viral conformation, its exposure during cell entry makes it highly immunogenic. Since inhibitory peptides to this region were previously described, this opens new possibilities in fighting coronaviral infections.","output":"Development of antibodies to pan-coronavirus spike peptides in convalescent COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we use administrative data covering Mexicos formal labor market to investigate the employment effects of the Great Lockdown (GL) Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown caused Mexicos formal sector to contract by 5% by November of 2020 By August, mens jobs started to recover, while womens jobs remain stagnant We then document heterogeneous effects by age, income, size of the firms, and economic sector activity The most affected economic agents during the pandemic include the youngest workers (15 to 29- years-old), oldest workers (over 60 years old), low-income earners, small-sized firms (6-50 workers), medium-sized firms (51-250 workers), workers in the con- struction industry, and the hospitality-focused service sectors Finally, we test dif- ferent state-level factors that may explain heterogeneity within Mexico: state-level reopenings and lockdowns, infection risk, and stimulus payments Our findings suggest more considerable employment losses in states that experienced succes- sive lockdowns","output":"The Long Downturn: The Impact of the Great Lockdown on Formal Employment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a ubiquitous proton pump that mediates the proton transmembrane transportation in various cells.

BACKGROUND Leaks after bariatric surgery remain a major source of morbidity and mortality. The association of surgical technique and devices with leaks after gastric bypass is poorly understood. SETTING Multi-centered study that included teaching and non-teaching hospitals that participate in a statewide consortium for quality improvement using a payer-funded outcome registry. METHODS We analyzed data from the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative and performed a case-control study comparing patients who sustained a leak with those who did not after primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A total of 71 (.44%) patients with leaks were identified between January 2007 and December 2011. The leak group was matched 1:2 to a control group (nonleak) based on procedure type, age, body mass index, sex, and the year in which the procedure was performed. Technique-specific case characteristics and device-specific factors were assessed by reviewing operative notes from all primary bariatric procedures in our study population. RESULTS The rate of leak decreased during the study period, and there was a significant downward trend (slope estimate: -.19961%, P = .0372). After performing multivariate analysis, the type of anastomosis (circular stapler, hand-sewn, or linear stapler) and stapler manufacturer were not associated with leaks. The use of buttressing material was associated with a higher rate of leaks (odds ratio: 8.79 [95% confidence interval: 2.49-31.01], P = .0007), whereas the use of fibrin sealant was associated with a lower rate of leaks (odds ratio .11 [95% confidence interval: .03-.41], P = .0013). These findings could not be explained by differences in measures of surgeon performance. CONCLUSION Leak rates after laparoscopic gastric bypass have fallen in Michigan despite variations in technique and device utilization. Although the type of anastomosis and stapler manufacturer do not appear to be significantly associated with leaks, it appears that the use of buttressing material was more common in cases in which leaks occurred, whereas the use of fibrin sealant was not. Given the complex interplay of multiple variables that affect surgical outcomes, future studies justifying the benefits of operative devices should be evaluated prospectively in the context of surgeon technique and skill.","output":"Technique or technology?

This review paper on prominent pandemics reveals that their dispersion is chaotic in nature having long-range memory effects and features which the existing integer-order models fail to capture. This paper thus puts forward the use of fractional-order (FO) chaos theory that has memory capacity and hereditary properties, as a potential tool to model the pandemics with more accuracy and closeness to their real physical dynamics. We investigate eight FO models of Bombay plague, Cancer and Covid-19 pandemics through phase portraits, time series, Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation analysis. FO controllers (FOCs) on the concepts of fuzzy logic, adaptive sliding mode and active backstepping control are designed to stabilise chaos. Also, FOCs based on adaptive sliding mode and active backstepping synchronisation are designed to synchronise a chaotic epidemic with a non-chaotic one, to mitigate the unpredictability due to chaos during transmission. It is found that severity and complexity of the models increase as the memory fades, indicating that FO can be used as a crucial parameter to analyse the progression of a pandemic. To sum it up, this paper will help researchers to have an overview of using fractional calculus in modelling pandemics more precisely and also to approximate, choose, stabilise and synchronise the chaos control parameter that will eliminate the extreme sensitivity and irregularity of the models.","output":"Is fractional-order chaos theory the new tool to model chaotic pandemics as Covid-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major changes in daily life and economic conditions while heightening physical and mental health problems, including health anxiety. Health authorities and elected officials have encouraged individuals to engage in health behaviors. Perceptions of and reactions to these changes could be subject to individual differences. In this line, the current study investigated the predictive roles of health promoting behaviors, sensory processing sensitivity, and their interactions with health anxiety.Design and measures: In this cross-sectional study, 355 participants (73% female, 25.9% male) whose ages range from 19 to 72 (M = 25.91, SD = 9.80) filled out self-reported measures on health promoting behaviors, sensory processing sensitivity, and health anxiety via an online platform between April and May 2020. RESULTS: It was revealed that caring for a healthy diet, taking responsibility for health and sensory processing sensitivity, but not physical activity and stress management, were associated with health anxiety. Diagnoses and perceptions of physical and mental health problems also contributed to health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Individuals with higher levels of sensory processing sensitivity and health responsibility were more likely to experience higher levels of health anxiety, while typical physical activities and stress management behaviors were less likely to have an impact during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with inflammatory changes to the olfactory bulb, and treatments with anti-inflammatory properties are hypothesized to attenuate viral injury and promote recovery of olfaction after infection. Our study investigated the efficacy of a supplement with Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and Luteolin to support recovery of olfaction in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a randomized-controlled pilot study in outpatients with history of confirmed COVID-19 with post-infection olfactory impairment that persisted  90 days after SARS-CoV-2 negative testing. Patients were randomized to two times a day olfactory rehabilitation alone or weekly olfactory rehabilitation plus daily oral supplement with PEA and Luteolin. Subjects with preexisting olfactory disorders were excluded. Sniffin' Sticks assessments were performed at baseline and 30 days after treatment. Data on gender, age, and time since infection were collected. Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test was used to compare variances of Sniff scores between groups over time, and Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess for correlations between Sniff Score and gender or duration of infection. RESULTS Among 12 patients enrolled (n=7, supplement; n=5, controls), patients receiving supplement had greater improvement in olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification score versus controls (p=0.01). Time since infection was negatively correlated with Sniff Score, and there was no correlation between gender. CONCLUSIONS Treatment combining olfactory rehabilitation with oral supplementation with PEA and Luteolin was associated with improved recovery of olfactory function, most marked in those patients with longstanding olfactory dysfunction.

The proposed algorithm for this task (CATHe) combines a neural network with sequence representations obtained from protein language models. The employed dataset consisted of remote homologues that had less than 20% sequence identity.

For a subset of these domains from homo sapiens, we structurally validated 90.86% of the predictions by comparing their corresponding AlphaFold structures with experimental structures from the CATHe predicted superfamilies.","output":"CATHe: Detection of remote homologues for CATH superfamilies using embeddings from protein language models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease that has created health care challenges worldwide. Pregnant women are particularly affected by this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to assess the levels of perceived threat (susceptibility, severity, impact), negative emotions (fear, worry), and self-efficacy of pregnant women in China related to COVID-19 and to examine their associations with mental health (depression and anxiety) and personal protective behavior (wearing a face mask). METHODS: A total of 4087 pregnant women from China completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between March 3 and 10, 2020. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety was 48.7% (1989/4087) and 33.0% (1347/4087), respectively; 23.8% participants (974/4087) reported always wearing a face mask when going out. Of the 4087 participants, 32.1% (1313) and 36.4% (1490) perceived themselves or their family members to be susceptible to COVID-19 infection, respectively; 3216-3518 (78.7%-86.1%) agreed the disease would have various severe consequences. Additionally, 2275 of the 4087 participants (55.7%) showed self-efficacy in protecting themselves from contracting COVID-19, and 2232 (54.6%) showed efficacy in protecting their family members; 1303 (31.9%) reported a high level of fear of the disease, and 2780-3056 (68.0%-74.8%) expressed worry about various aspects of COVID-19. The results of the multivariate multinominal logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived impact, fear, and worry were risk factors for probable depression and anxiety, while self-efficacy was a protective factor. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that perceived susceptibility was associated with always wearing a face mask. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese pregnant women showed high levels of mental distress but low levels of personal protective behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The year after pregnancy may be a singular opportunity to identify and initiate treatment for CVD risk, even before the onset of traditional CVD risk factors. However, clinical guidance regarding CVD risk management after adverse pregnancy outcomes is lacking. We therefore conducted a systematic review of US clinical practice guidelines and professional society recommendations to inform primary careCbased CVD risk management after adverse pregnancy outcomes. We identified 13 relevant publications. While most recommendations were based on limited or weak evidence, we identified several areas of consensus. First, individuals with an adverse pregnancy outcome associated with future CVD are likely to benefit from CVD risk assessmentaccompanied by education, counseling, and support for lifestyle modificationbeginning within the first postpartum year. Second, among clinicians, clear and consistent documentation about adverse pregnancy outcomes and recommended follow-up is important to coordinate care after pregnancy. In addition, patients need to be informed about their pregnancy complications and associated CVD risks, so that they can make informed health care and lifestyle decisions. Finally, in general, CVD prevention in the year after an adverse pregnancy outcome focuses on lifestyle modification, reserving pharmacotherapy for the highest-risk patients and those with traditional CVD risk factors. While postpartum lifestyle interventions show promise for reducing CVD risk after adverse pregnancy outcomes, continued research to determine the optimal content, timing, and long-term effects of such interventions is needed.

This study aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in students attending universities that had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak after reopening for the autumn term in September 2020. METHODS: A cross-sectional serosurvey was conducted during 02-11 December 2020 in students aged &#8804; 25 years across five universities in England. Blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were obtained using a self-sampling kit and analysed using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2a?N antibody and/or an in-house receptor binding domain (RBD) assay. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in 2,905 university students was 17.8% (95%CI, 16.5-19.3), ranging between 7.6%-29.7% across the five universities. Seropositivity was associated with being younger likely to represent first year undergraduates (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 2.0-4.9), living in halls of residence (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.7) and sharing a kitchen with an increasing number of students (shared with 4-7 individuals, aOR 1.43, 95%CI 1.12-1.82; shared with 8 or more individuals, aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.04-2.24). Seropositivity was 49% in students living in halls of residence that reported high SARS-CoV-2 infection rates (>8%) during the autumn term.

Due to a special fishing method termed 'lake enclosed in autumn', the water level is lowered and reaches its lowest point in January, which is <0.5 m deep in the middle of the lake. Our research investigated the effect of water level changes on the zooplankton community composition in Shahu Lake. METHODS: We used both DNA metabarcoding method (MBC) (18S rRNA gene V4 region) and morphological method (MOI) to track the zooplankton community structure over four seasons in Shahu Lake (China). RESULTS: Totals of 90 and 98 species of zooplankton were detected by MOI and MBC, respectively, with rotifers being the main zooplankton component. The -diversity index of both methods increased from spring to summer and decreased from summer to autumn, reaching the lowest value in winter. NMDS and a cluster analysis showed that all zooplankton communities detected by MOI and MBC were significantly separated by season. The zooplankton community in winter was separated from that of the other three seasons, but the summer and autumn communities were more similar. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the water level had significant effects on the zooplankton community composition. We found that MBC was more able to detect the differences in the zooplankton composition than MOI. MBC also had more advantages in copepod recognition.

Pressure from the blockade and ban on food exports are starting to affect agricultural supply chains, it has led to a rapid rise in global food prices. As many grain exporting countries announced a ban on grain exports, food security issues in China have attracted great international attention. This study builds the Suitability Distribution Model and Soybean-Cereal Constraint Model to explore the relationship between soybean production potential and food security. As a result, the soybean potential planting area in China is 164.3 million ha. If the outbreak prevents China from importing soybeans, the soybean planting area will need to be increased by 6.9 times to satisfy the demands. In the meantime, the cereal self-sufficiency rate will drop to 63.4%, which will greatly affect food security. Each additional unit of soybean production will reduce 3.9 units of cereals, and 1% increase in the self-sufficiency rate of soybeans will result in a 0.63% drop in cereals. It is not sustainable to sacrifice cereal to grow soybeans and to rely heavily on imports. But to ensuring the cereal security, the self-sufficiency rate of soybeans is difficult to exceed 42%. China still need to import more than 68% of the original import volume of soybean. In the short term, the outbreak will not affect food security in China, but as soybean imports decrease, insufficient supply of soybeans will affect people's quality of life. To prevent the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, China should increase soybean stocks and strengthen international cooperation in short term. In the long term, increasing the self-sufficiency rate is the fundamental solution to soybean problem, and the key to increasing soybean cultivation is to make soybean cultivation profitable and to build a sustainable soybean planting chain.

With an emphasis on immune modulation, we also look at ongoing clinical studies aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines; transfer of immunosuppressive mesenchymal stem cells; use of convalescent plasma transfusion; as well as immunoregulatory therapy and traditional Chinese medicine regimes. In examining leukocyte and cytokine activity in COVID\\\\19, we focus in particular on how these levels are altered as the disease progresses (neutrophil NETosis, macrophage, T cell response, etc.) and proposed consequences to organ pathology (coagulopathy, etc.). Viral and host interactions are described to gain further insight into leukocyte biology and how dysregulated cytokine responses lead to disease and/or organ damage. By better understanding the mechanisms that drive the intensity of a cytokine storm, we can tailor treatment strategies at specific disease stages and improve our response to this worldwide public health threat.","output":"Cytokine storm and leukocyte changes in mild versus severe SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection: Review of 3939 COVID\\\\19 patients in China and emerging pathogenesis and therapy concepts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Along with the recent development of intraluminal interventional techniques and correlated imaging methods, one-stop hybrid operation has become a new focus in clinical settings. The aim of this study is to discuss the clinical significance of the one-stop hybrid endarterectomy surgery in the treatment of complex ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. In this study, clinical data from 10 patients with complex ischemic cerebrovascular diseases (including multi-vessel severe stenosis of the internal extracranial carotid artery, single vessel series stenosis of the internal extracranial carotid artery, in-stent restenosis, complete occlusion of the common carotid or the internal carotid artery) admitted to Beijing Xuanwu Hospital and Liaocheng Brain Hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. All enrolled subjects underwent three types of hybrid operations. The clinical efficacy of this surgery was subsequently assessed in this clinical trial. The results indicated that no related surgical complications were noted during the perioperative period. Intraoperative and postoperative imaging revealed no signs of vascular stenosis, the blood supply recovered, and clinical symptoms were alleviated. The follow-up lasted for 6 to 12 months. Imaging re-examination showed no evidence of re-stenosis and good blood circulation was present in the recanalized blood vessels. Favorable treatment efficacy was achieved. The intracranial blood supply was significantly improved postoperatively. In conclusion, one-stop hybrid operation plays an important role in treating complex stenosis cerebrovascular diseases.","output":"Preliminary application of hybrid operation in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in patients with complex ischemic cerebrovascular diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the agricultural sector, the COVID-19 threatens to lead to a severe food security crisis in the region, with disruptions in the food supply chain and agricultural production expected to contract between 2.6% and 7%. From the food crop production side, the travel bans and border closures, the late reception and the use of agricultural inputs such as imported seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides could lead to poor food crop production performances. Another layer of disruption introduced by the mobility restriction measures is the scarcity of agricultural workers, mainly seasonal workers. The lockdown measures and border closures limit seasonal workers' availability to get to the farm on time for planting and harvesting activities. Moreover, most of the imported agricultural inputs travel by air, which the pandemic has heavily impacted. Such transportation disruptions can also negatively affect the food crop production system. This chapter assesses food crop production levels in 2020 -- before the harvesting period -- in all African regions and four staples such as maize, cassava, rice, and wheat. The production levels are predicted using the combination of biogeophysical remote sensing data retrieved from satellite images and machine learning artificial neural networks (ANNs) technique. The remote sensing products are used as input variables and the ANNs as the predictive modeling framework. The input remote sensing products are the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the daytime Land Surface Temperature (LST), rainfall data, and agricultural lands' Evapotranspiration (ET). The output maps and data are made publicly available on a web-based platform, AAgWa (Africa Agriculture Watch, www.aagwa.org), to facilitate access to such information to policymakers, deciders, and other stakeholders.","output":"Remote Sensing and Machine Learning for Food Crop Production Data in Africa Post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study presents a discussion on the fundamentals of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and its use as a diagnostic tool in periodontology.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective study on patients with AIH and COVID\\\\19 from 34 centers in Europe and the Americas. We analyzed factors associated with severe COVID\\\\19 outcomes, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission, and/or death. The outcomes of patients with AIH were compared to a propensity scoreCmatched cohort of patients without AIH but with chronic liver diseases (CLD) and COVID\\\\19. The frequency and clinical significance of new\\\\onset liver injury (alanine aminotransferase > 2  the upper limit of normal) during COVID\\\\19 was also evaluated. We included 110 patients with AIH (80% female) with a median age of 49 (range, 18\\\\85) years at COVID\\\\19 diagnosis. New\\\\onset liver injury was observed in 37.1% (33/89) of the patients. Use of antivirals was associated with liver injury (P = 0.041; OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.05\\\\10.78), while continued immunosuppression during COVID\\\\19 was associated with a lower rate of liver injury (P = 0.009; OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09\\\\0.71). The rates of severe COVID\\\\19 (15.5% versus 20.2%, P = 0.231) and all\\\\cause mortality (10% versus 11.5%, P = 0.852) were not different between AIH and non\\\\AIH CLD.

Understanding ICU resource needs remains an essential component of meeting current and projected needs of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients. OBJECTIVES: This study queried U.S. ICU clinician perspectives on challenging aspects of care in managing coronavirus disease 2019 patients, current and anticipated resource demands, and personal stress. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a descriptive survey methodology, an anonymous web-based survey was administered from April 7, 2020, to April 22, 2020 (email and newsletter) to query members of U.S. national critical care organizations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Through a 16-item descriptive questionnaire, ICU clinician perceptions were assessed regarding current and emerging critical ICU needs in managing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patients, resource levels, concerns about being exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and perceived level of personal stress. A total of 9,120 ICU clinicians responded to the survey, representing all 50 U.S. states, with 4,106 (56.9%) working in states with 20,000 or more coronavirus disease 2019 cases. The 7,317 respondents who indicated their profession included ICU nurses (n = 6,731, 91.3%), advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants; n = 334, 4.5%), physicians (n = 212, 2.9%), respiratory therapists (n = 31, 0.4%), and pharmacists (n = 30, 0.4%). A majority (n = 6,510, 88%) reported having cared for a patient with presumed or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. The most critical ICU needs identified were personal protective equipment, specifically N95 respirator availability, and ICU staffing. Minimizing healthcare worker virus exposure during care was believed to be the most challenging aspect of coronavirus disease 2019 patient care (n = 2,323, 30.9%). Nurses report a high level of concern about exposing family members to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median score of 10 on 0-10 scale). Similarly, the level of concern reached the maximum score of 10 in ICU clinicians who had provided care to coronavirus disease 2019 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This national ICU clinician survey identifies continued concerns regarding personal protective equipment supplies with the chief issue being N95 respirator availability. As the pandemic continues, ICU clinicians anticipate a number of limited resources that may impact ICU care including personnel, capacity, and surge potential, as well as staff and subsequent family members exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. These persistent concerns greatly magnify personal stress, offering a therapeutic target for professional organization and facility intervention efforts.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Measures: Reports From a National Survey of 9,120 ICU Clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal welfare during and as a result of transport can be assessed by using a range of behavioural, physiological, pathological and carcass-quality indicators that are described in this paper.

However, the interplay between PRV infection and SGs formation remains largely unknown. Here we showed that PRV infection markedly blocked SGs formation induced by sodium arsenate (AS) and DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT). Accordantly, the phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; was markedly inhibited in PRV-infected cells, although two eIF2&#945; kinases double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) were activated during PRV infection. Furthermore, we also found that the dephosphorylation of eIF2&#945; occurred at the early stage of virus infection but without the elevated production of GADD34 and PP1. Moreover, inhibition of PP1 activity by salubrinal could counteract PRV-mediated eIF2&#945; dephosphorylation partially and inhibit virus replication. Our results revealed that, on the one hand, PRV infection activated eIF2&#945; kinases PKR (latter inhibited) and PERK, and on the other hand, PRV encoded-functions dephosphorylated eIF2&#945; and inhibited SGs formation to facilitate virus replication.","output":"Pseudorabies virus infection inhibits stress granules formation via dephosphorylating eIF2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resilience has become important in disaster preparedness and response.

Gamma4 was the most abundant Gammaproteobacterial NCD along transects across the subtropical North Pacific. Using quantitative PCR, Gamma4 was detectable throughout the surface waters of North Pacific (7N-55N, 138E-80W), whereas GammaA was detected at <2/3 of the stations. Gamma4 was abundant during autumn-winter and positively correlated with chlorophyll a, while GammaA thrived during spring-summer and was positively correlated with temperature. Environmental clones affiliated with Gamma4 were widely detected in pelagic waters, oxygen minimum zones and even dinoflagellate microbiomes. By analysing the metabolic potential of a genome of Gamma4 reconstructed from the Tara Oceans dataset, we suggest that Gamma4 is a versatile heterotrophic NCD equipped with multiple strategies in scavenging phosphate (and iron) and for respiratory protection of nitrogenase. The transcription of nitrogenase genes is putatively regulated by Fnr-NifL-NifA and GlnD-GlnK systems that respond to intracellular oxygen and glutamate concentration.

In-hospital mortality was the primary outcome of interest. The second wave was identified as starting on 1 September 2020. Multilevel logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the relationship between mortality and demographic, comorbidity and temporal covariates. RESULTS: Over the 13 months, 374 244 unique patients had a diagnosis of COVID-19 during a hospital stay, of whom 93 701 (25%) died in hospital. Adjusted mortality rates fell from 40%C50% in March 2020 to 11% in August 2020 before rising to 21% in January 2021 and declining steadily to March 2021. Improvements in mortality rates were less apparent in older and comorbid patients. Although mortality rates fell for all ethnic groups from the first to the second wave, declines were less pronounced for Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian and black African ethnic groups.

Left eye funduscopy revealed a slightly elevated optic disc, with indistinct margins in the nasal quadrant. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve confirmed the clinical findings, illustrating an increase in the retinal nerve fiber layers thickness in the nasal quadrant, with no corresponding visual field defect. The orbit magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unveiled an intraconal mass surrounding the optic nerve on its entire intra-orbital path, confirming the diagnosis of left orbital granuloma.

The achieved nanocomposites had high surface areas and activity with more functional groups, contributing to superior antimonite elimination. The nanocomposite achieved a maximum removal capacity of 159.9 mg/g toward antimonite. And the common interfering ions of SO(4)(2-), NO(3)-, CO(3)(2-), PO(4)(3-) and SiO(3)(2-) exhibited negligible influence on antimonite removal. The mechanism study point that two factors are closely involved: surface complexation and hydrogen bonding.

However, the effectiveness of these test-and-travel strategies to reduce passenger risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission remains unknown. METHODS: In this simulation study, we developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of 100 000 US domestic airline travellers using publicly available data on COVID-19 clinical cases and published natural history parameters to assign individuals one of five health states of susceptible to infection, latent period, early infection, late infection, or recovered. We estimated a per-day risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to a daily incidence of 150 infections per 100 000 people. We assessed five testing strategies: (1) anterior nasal PCR test within 3 days of departure, (2) PCR within 3 days of departure and 5 days after arrival, (3) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection), (4) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR test 5 days after arrival, and (5) PCR test 5 days after arrival. Strategies 2 and 4 included a 5-day quarantine after arrival. The travel period was defined as 3 days before travel to 2 weeks after travel. Under each scenario, individuals who tested positive before travel were not permitted to travel. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period without isolation or quarantine (population-level transmission risk), and the key secondary outcome was the number of infectious people detected on the day of travel (passenger risk of infection). FINDINGS: We estimated that in a cohort of 100 000 airline travellers, in a scenario with no testing or screening, there would be 8357 (95% uncertainty interval 6144-12831) infectious days with 649 (505-950) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test reduced the number of infectious days from 8357 to 5401 (3917-8677), a reduction of 36% (29-41) compared with the base case, and identified 569 (88% [76-92]) of 649 actively infectious travellers on the day of flight; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 2520 days (1849-4158), a reduction of 70% (64-75) compared with the base case. The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days to 5674 (4126-9081), a reduction of 32% (26-38) compared with the base case, and identified 560 (86% [83-89]) actively infectious travellers; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 3124 (2356-495), a reduction of 63% (58-66) compared with the base case. The post-travel PCR alone reduced the number of infectious days to 4851 (3714-7679), a reduction of 42% (35-49) compared with the base case. INTERPRETATION: Routine asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 before travel can be an effective strategy to reduce passenger risk of infection during travel, although abbreviated quarantine with post-travel testing is probably needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when travelling from a high to low incidence setting.

There are a variety of methods which can be used to develop prognostic models, ranging from logistic regression and survival analysis to more complex machine learning algorithms and deep learning. Despite several models having been created for SARS-CoV-2, most of these have been found to be highly susceptible to bias. We aimed to develop and compare two separate predictive models for death during admission with SARS-CoV-2. METHOD: Between March 1 and April 24, 2020, 398 patients were identified with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in a London teaching hospital. Data from electronic health records were extracted and used to create two predictive models using: (1) a Cox regression model and (2) an artificial neural network (ANN). Model performance profiles were assessed by validation, discrimination, and calibration. RESULTS: Both the Cox regression and ANN models achieved high accuracy (83.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 73.8-91.1 and 90.0%, 95% CI 81.2-95.6, respectively). The area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the ANN (92.6%, 95% CI 91.1-94.1) was significantly greater than that of the Cox regression model (86.9%, 95% CI 85.7-88.2), p = 0.0136. Both models achieved acceptable calibration with Brier scores of 0.13 and 0.11 for the Cox model and ANN, respectively. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate an ANN which is non-inferior to a Cox regression model but with potential for further development such that it can learn as new data becomes available.

Experimentally infected gnotobiotic and conventional pigs as well as pigs with natural TGEV infection were examined. The staining technique was based on detection of the major structural protein of TGEV, the nucleocapsid, by using a pool of 3 monoclonal antibodies. Formalin and periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP)-fixed intestinal tissues from a gnotobiotic pig inoculated with virulent TGEV were used to determine optimal antibody concentrations and incubation times. The intestinal tissues remained in their respective fixatives for 6 months, and serial sections were removed at sequential times and embedded in paraffin blocks. PLP and 10% neutral buffered formalin were acceptable fixatives and preserved TGEV nucleocapsid antigenicity for up to 6 months. Formalin, in comparison with PLP as a fixative, was better for preserving original tissue morphology and provided better antigen detection. Conventional crossbred pigs were inoculated with virulent TGEV, and animals were euthanized on various postexposure days. Intestinal tissues were positive for TGEV nucleocapsid antigens on postexposure days 2, 4, and 8. The immunohistochemistry technique detected TGEV antigen in stored paraffin-embedded tissues from 14 naturally infected pigs previously confirmed as positive for TGEV using a direct immunofluorescence assay on intestinal mucosal smears, whereas 9 naturally infected pigs confirmed negative for TGEV antigen by the same immunofluorescence assay showed no staining consistent with the presence of TGEV antigen. Immunohistochemistry provides a method to detect TGEV and possibly other closely related coronaviruses such as porcine respiratory coronavirus in situ.

Moreover, technical constraints on the cash cycle and the lockdown measures have increased the demand for cash for precautionary purposes. Policies aiming at accelerating the digital economy and the most innovative means of payment can potentially make economic activity more resilient to adverse shocks. At the same time, ensuring the adequate and efficient availability of cash remains essential from a social and economic perspective.","output":"A Game Changer in Payment Habits: Evidence from Daily Data During a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: As we learn more about the paradigm of disease with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we are discovering severe multi- system involvement at an early stage, including sepsis and septic shock.1 Case Report: In March 2020, a normally fit 39-year-old Asian woman of 37 weeks gestation (G2P1) presented to the emergency department (ED) with a two-day history of fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, headache and vomiting. She was pyrexial, tachypnoeaic and tachycardic, but normotensive, alert and orientated, with oxygen saturations of 99% on air. Blood tests showed a normal serum lactate, a lymphopenia of 0.2  109/L, WCC 6  109/L, CRP 34 mg/L and D-dimer of 609 ng/mL. Her urine contained ketones ++. A chest radiograph showed mild bi-basal infiltrates. Intravenous fluids and co- amoxiclav were commenced. The fetal heart rate in ED was normal. She was admitted with a persistent tachycardia and pyrexia. The next day she had a syncopal collapse with severe hypotension. She regained consciousness on correction of her blood pressure with a fluid bolus and peripheral vasopressors. The fetal heart rate remained normal. She proceeded to develop visual hallucinations, fluctuating confusion, drowsiness and hypotension with transient response to fluids. Intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir cover for meningitis was started on microbiology advice. We proceeded with an emergency caesarean section under general anaesthesia with peripheral vasopressor support and fluid resuscitation. A healthy baby was delivered, and postoperatively the woman was extubated successfully without an oxygen or vasopressor requirement. Overnight she again became hypotensive, tachycardic and drowsy. A non-contrast CT brain was normal and a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed bilateral peripheral opacification and ground glass halo. Troponin T, BNP and a transthoracic echocardiogram were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid from a lumbar puncture showed only slightly raised glucose and her lymphocyte count remained low. On postoperative day 2 she developed a mild oxygen requirement. A repeat CTPA showed moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. Her PCR swab from admission was returned with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Blood cultures were all negative. The platelet count dropped from 102 to 88  109/L on day two. The diagnosis was confirmed as COVID-19 pneumonia with encephalopathy and thrombocytopenia secondary to sepsis. She made a complete recovery after three days on oxygen, and seven days in hospital.

Previous studies have reported pandemic-related anxiety. Anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are relatively common comorbidities. However, thus far, there is no report of any patient with undiagnosed ASD who developed anxiety disorders caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Case presentationIn this case report, we describe an 8-year-old Japanese boy with undiagnosed ASD who developed COVID-19 phobia, resulting in avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). As COVID-19 was highly publicized in the mass media and the risk of droplet infection was emphasized upon, the patient began to fear viral contamination from food, culminating in a refusal to eat or even swallow his saliva. He was admitted to a pediatric medical center in Osaka with life-threatening dehydration and was then referred to our child psychiatry department for treatment. We clinically diagnosed the patient with COVID-19 phobia resulting in ARFID. We identified the characteristics of ASD from his present social communication skills and developmental history. We provided psychoeducation of ASD for the parents as well as administered supportive psychotherapy for the patient. Shortly after our intervention, which was designed to relieve his ASD-related anxiety, his dysphagia improved. Our findings suggest that children with undiagnosed ASD may develop COVID-19 phobia. In these cases, intervention for ASD, such as sharing information with parents and teachers to explain what autism is and how it is likely to affect the childs development and function, and to make an individual education plan may be more appropriate than starting treatment for anxiety disorders as the first-line option.ConclusionCOVID-19 is the biggest pandemic in the recent past and more undiagnosed ASD patients who develop COVID-19 phobia may seek treatment. Clinicians should consider the underlying ASD in these patients and assess their developmental history, such as joint attention, as well as their present social communication skills.","output":"COVID-19 phobia in a boy with undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Awareness of COVID-19 infection risk and oscillation patterns ('waves') may affect older people's mental health.

Screening for depression risk was conducted among 8,163 older people (age  60) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) from February to August 2020. The relationships between PHQ-2, COVID-19 infection risk proxies - change in newly infected cases and effective reproductive number (Rt), and oscillations - stage of a 'wave' reported in the media, were analysed using correlation and regression.8.4% of survey respondents screened positive for depression risk. Being female (? = .08), having a pre-existing mental health issue (? = .21), change in newly infected cases (? = .05), and screening during the latency period before the media called out new waves (? = .03), contributed to higher depression risk (R2 = .06, all p <.01).While depression risk does not appear alarming in this sample, our results highlight that older people are sensitive to reporting of infection, particularly among those with existing mental health needs.

This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the percent increase in COVID-19 cases. Methods: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 38 districts of India were collected between 1st April 2020 to 30th April 2020. Taking a 5-day time lag of average values of the variables and multiple days-samples, we ran multiple models and performed appropriate hypothesis tests to decide the single preferred model for each sample data. Suitable fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models with cluster-robust standard errors were applied to quantify the district-specific associations of meteorological and other variables with COVID-19 cases. Results: All FE models revealed that every one-degree rise in AT led to a decrease in 3.909 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. All RE models showed that with one unit increase in the malaria annual parasite index, there was a significant increase in 10.835 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. In both FE and RE models, ARH was found to be negatively associated with a percent increase in COVID-19 cases, although in half of these models the association was statistically insignificant.

RESULTS The initial symptom of SARS was pyrexia and the temperature was > 38 degrees C. The natural course of fever was about 14 days. In almost all cases, the respiratory symptoms and systemic toxic manifestations were observed. They came to a climax at the second week and then decreased or nearly disappeared after the third week. The physical signs of SARS were not obvious. The moist rales were observed in 43.3% of patients. Hypoxemia was a common characteristic in SARS. The decrease in partial pressure of oxygen in artery and oxygen saturation in pulse oximeter with normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide was found in most patients at the second week. Abnormal chest X-ray including infiltration and consolidation shadows were seen in 100% of patients. The abnormal images could be found at the first day, enlarged during the second week (to a climax at the 8th or 9th day), and then recovered from the 2 week.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials of aerobic based physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care with a usual care control group or another control group that did not involve physical activity. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS Two independent reviewers screened the search results, extracted data from eligible trials and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (version 2). Inverse variance meta-analyses using random effects models examined the primary outcome of difference between the groups in MVPA (min/week) from baseline to final follow-up. The odds of meeting the guidelines for MVPA at follow-up were also analysed. RESULTS 14 566 unique reports were identified and 46 randomised controlled trials with a range of follow-ups (3-60 months) were included in the meta-analysis (n=16 198 participants). Physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care increased MVPA by 14 min/week (95% confidence interval 4.2 to 24.6, P=0.006). Heterogeneity was substantial (I2=91%, P<0.001). Limiting analyses to trials that used a device to measure physical activity showed no significant group difference in MVPA (mean difference 4.1 min/week, 95% confidence interval -1.7 to 9.9, P=0.17; I2=56%, P=0.008). Trials that used self-report measures showed that intervention participants achieved 24 min/week more MVPA than controls (95% confidence interval 6.3 to 41.8, P=0.008; I2=72%, P<0.001). Additionally, interventions increased the odds of patients meeting guidelines for MVPA by 33% (95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.50, P<0.001; I2=25%, P=0.11) versus controls. 14 of 46 studies were at high risk of bias but sensitivity analyses excluding these studies did not alter the results.

RESULTS In the first phase, 21 information elements and nine critical functionalities for the self-care application were identified, and then this application was designed by Java programming language. The evaluation of experts showed that two aspects of the quality of system user interface from the user's point of view and the overall performance of the application together obtained the highest score (6.43 from 7), which was equal to 91.85%. Then according to the experts, aspects of the degree of convenience and user-friendliness of the application received the highest score (6.10 from 7), which was equal to 87.14%, and also all aspects of the application were evaluated at an acceptable level. In general, results of the evaluation of application's usability by experts showed that the usability of the application for patients with urinary tract stones was at an acceptable level. CONCLUSION According to the results obtained from evaluating the smartphone-based application for patients with urinary tract stones, this self-care application can be used to prevent and control urinary tract stones and facilitate self-care and active patient participation in care.","output":"Prevention and control of urinary tract stones using a smartphone-based self-care application: design and evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of a drive-through (DT) screening system for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by comparing it with a conventional screening system.

This lockdown affected significantly the atmospheric pollution levels due to the restrictions of human activities. In the present study, we investigate the evolution of air quality in the Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes region, focusing on nine atmospheric pollutants (NO(2), NO, PM(10), PM(2.5), O(3), VOC, CO, SO(2), and isoprene). In Lyon, center of the region, the results indicated that NO(2), NO, and CO levels were reduced by 67%, 78%, and 62%, respectively, resulting in a decrease in road traffic by 80%. However, O(3), PM(10), and PM(2.5) were increased by 105%, 23%, and 53%, respectively, during the lockdown. The increase in ozone is explained by the dropping in NO and other gases linked to human activity, which consume ozone. Thus, the increase of solar radiation, sunshine, temperature, and humidity promoted the O(3) formation during the lockdown. Besides, rising temperature enhances the BVOC emissions such as isoprene. In addition, volatile organic component (VOC) and SO(2) remain almost stable and oxidation of these species leads to the formation of ozone and organic aerosol, which also explains the increase in PM during the lockdown.

Several sporting activities were represented with American football as the most prevalent (30.7%). In summary, we found that sports with an aspect of impact, collision, or microtrauma can lead to subsequent stroke. These sport-related traumatic events were often difficult to diagnose because of the longer interval before ischemia occurred.

Previous studies reveal that individuals who experienced child abuse (CA), especially those who suffer from complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), are at a higher risk of reacting with fear and stress when faced with stressful life-events. OBJECTIVE: To test whether exposure to CA is implicated in a higher risk of COVID-19-related fear and acute stress, and whether CPTSD intervenes in such processes. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A convenience sample of 837 adults participated in the study during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel. METHODS: Participants completed self-report questionnaires, assessing child physical, sexual and emotional abuse, CPTSD (ITQ), COVID-19-related acute stress disorder (COVID-19 ASD; ASDS) and fear of COVID-19. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that participants who experienced CA were higher than participants who did not experience CA in COVID-19 ASD (p = .032), but not in fear of COVID-19 (p = .65). Mediation analyses demonstrated two significant paths: in the first, CA was associated with elevated fear of COVID-19 (effect = .061, .059; p < 0.05) and COVID-19 ASD (effect = .14, .084; p < 0.05) through the mediation of CPTSD; in the second path, when controlling for the mediation of CPTSD, CA was associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 (effect = -.15; p = 0.001), and COVID-19 ASD (effect = -.12; p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal a complex pattern, indicating that CPTSD may be a risk factor for elevated levels of COVID-19 distress among individuals who experienced CA.

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 physicians who had worked in either COVID ICU or Isolation ward. A survey of 23 questions was designed to assess the work-related Burnout using the Copenhagen burnout inventory and the implementation of NIH guidelines. RESULTS Among the 200 physicians, 151 (75.5%) were well informed of the guidelines, of which 52 (34.4%) participants believed the guidelines were not sufficient. These 34.4% of individuals showed a mean burnout score of 70.05% (p-value 0.001). Medical registrars and Medical Officers suffered the highest burnout mean percentage score of 76% and 72.42%, respectively. 89 (44.5%) individuals arranged PPE suits on their own and suffered a burnout score of 71.3% 14.35 (p-value <0.001). Seventy-two (36%) claimed their administration was not cooperative in resolve safety issues. These individuals showed a mean burnout score of 74.3% 13.82 (p-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS Lack of physician's faith in the adequacy of the NIH guidelines has been found to be a significant factor in contributing to work-related Burnout. Due to the shortage of PPE, a majority of physicians have to reuse their PPE multiple times and even have to personally arrange their PPE suits, which further compounds the burnout.

Understanding and improving motor inhibition could benefit adaptive behavior in both health and disease. We recently found that presenting surprising, task-unrelated sounds when stopping is necessary improves the likelihood of successful stopping. In the current study, we investigated the neural underpinnings of this effect. Specifically, we tested whether surprise-related stopping improvements are due to a genuine increase in motor inhibition. In Experiment 1, we measured motor inhibition in primary motor cortex of male and female humans by quantifying corticospinal excitability (CSE) via transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography during a hybrid surprise-Go/NoGo task. Consistent with prior studies of motor inhibition, successful stopping was accompanied by nonselective suppression of CSE; that is, CSE was suppressed even in task-unrelated motor effectors. Importantly, unexpected sounds significantly increased this motor-system inhibition to a degree that was directly related to behavioral improvements in stopping. In Experiment 2, we then used scalp encephalography to investigate whether unexpected sounds increase motor-inhibition-related activity in the CNS. We used an independent stop-signal localizer task to identify a well characterized frontocentral low-frequency EEG component that indexes motor inhibition. We then investigated the activity of this component in the surprise-Go/NoGo task. Consistent with Experiment 1, this signature of motor inhibition was indeed increased when NoGo signals were followed by unexpected sounds. Together, these experiments provide converging evidence suggesting that unexpected events improve motor inhibition by automatically triggering inhibitory control.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ability to stop ongoing actions rapidly allows humans to adapt their behavior flexibly and rapidly. Action stopping is important in daily life (e.g., stopping to cross the street when a car approaches) and is severely impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, finding ways to improve action stopping could aid adaptive behaviors in health and disease. Our current study shows that presenting unexpected sounds in stopping situations facilitates successful stopping. This improvement is specifically due to a surprise-related increase in a neural mechanism for motor inhibition, which rapidly suppresses the excitability of the motor system after unexpected events. These findings suggest a tight interaction between the neural systems for surprise processing and motor inhibition and yield a promising avenue for future research.","output":"Perceptual Surprise Improves Action Stopping by Nonselectively Suppressing Motor Activity via a Neural Mechanism for Motor Inhibition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has caused fear and panic worldwide, forcing healthcare systems to disregard conventional practices and adopt innovation to contain the infection and death. Globally, there has been a rapid proliferation of research studies and clinical trials assessing risks, infectivity and treatment. METHODS: This review assesses the opportunities and challenges in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region to engage in the conduct of high quality clinical trials during the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Opportunities are abundant for conducting clinical trials in MENA countries, including substantial cost savings, academic health centers, integrated health information systems, international accreditation, and international collaborations. Yet, the MENA region has missed out on opportunities to advance patient research during prior infectious disease outbreaks caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, as evidenced by the lack of concerted research and clinical trials from the region. A large vulnerable population, especially the poor expatriate work force, the current isolation of the health centers, and the lack of an expert network or field trained task force, all contribute to challenges preventing the formation of a pan Arab research enterprise for epidemics. CONCLUSION: Quality clinical research is critical during public health emergencies to identify treatments and solutions.

These workers have been dealing with drastic changes in the care they provide to their residents including cancelation of group activities and communal dining and even restrictions of activities outside rooms. Healthcare workers have also been devoting more time and energy to perform COVID-related medical duties. Geriatric facilities have been facing shortages in equipment and supplies, as well as staffing shortages. Finally, healthcare workers have been facing challenges regarding their personal safety and that of their families. Consequently, we hypothesized the presence of high levels of burnout among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: To evaluate burnout in healthcare workers in French acute care geriatric facilities, we used an online survey based on the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Eighty-four healthcare workers answered the survey, during April of 2020. Results: Analysis demonstrated that they were experiencing medium levels of burnout, exhaustion, and disengagement. Conclusion: This level of burnout reflected their fatigue, loss of energy, and/or feelings of being overextended and exhausted. Considering the expected cumulative impact of various stressors, the medium level of burnout observed has come as a surprise to us and might actually be considered as relatively good news.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 28 March and 7 August 2020, recorded by a private healthcare center located in North-West Italy. Association among seroprevalence and demographic and occupational variables was evaluated using chi square test and the seroprevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: We collected the results for 23568 serological tests from a sample of 22708 workers from about 1000 companies. Median age was 45 years and about 60% of subjects were male. The overall seroprevalence was 4.97% [95%CI 4.69C5.25].

Herein, a Fe(3)O(4)@MoS(2)-Ag nanozyme with defect-rich rough surface was constructed by a simple hydrothermal method and in-situ photodeposition of Ag nanoparticles. The nanozyme exhibited good antibacterial performance against E. coli ( 69.4%) by the ROS destruction and release of Ag(+), while the nanozyme could further achieve an excellent synergistic disinfection ( 100 %) by combining with the near-infrared photothermal property of Fe(3)O(4)@MoS(2)-Ag. The antibacterial mechanism study showed that the antibacterial process was determined by the collaborative work of peroxidase-like activity, photothermal effect and leakage of Ag(+). The defect-rich rough surface of MoS(2) layers facilitated the capture of bacteria, which enhanced the accurate and rapid attack of OH and Ag(+) to the membrane of E. coli with the assistance of local hyperthermia. This method showed broad-spectrum antibacterial performance against Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria and fungal bacteria. Meanwhile, the magnetism of Fe(3)O(4) was used to recycle the nanozyme.

The research method used in this research is the descriptive exploratory qualitative research method. The purpose of this research is to determine the appropriate empowerment model for MSMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic and to contribute in the form of an academic policy paper for relevant stakeholders. This study uses a desk study and interview technique. Desk studies are carried out through secondary data tracking. Interviews were conducted with regional apparatus organizations (OPD) which handle MSMEs and MSMEs actors. From the research conducted it is known that the efforts made by the Provincial / Regency / City Governments within the scope of DIY or CSO in order to help MSMEs actors to survive in this pandemic situation if they are framed by using the empowerment models are used the second and third models. The second model seeks to strengthen the potential or power possessed by the community by implementing concrete steps accommodating various inputs providing good infrastructure and facilities. The third model seeks to empower the community in the sense of protecting and defending the interests of the weak community.

Interestingly, the heteroleptic gold(I)-bisNHC complex 10 was 10 times more toxic than cisplatin or auranofin towards Ishikawa cells. Ex vivo studies found that complex 10 was characterised with a stronger anticancer effect than auranofin in the EC organoid model. Additionally, in vivo studies showed that complex 10 possessed a stronger anticancer effect (IRT = 44.86%) than auranofin (IRT = 19.93%) in the xenograft model of EC. Mechanistically, complex 10 could suppress the expression of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in vitro and in vivo, which are essentially involved in EC development.

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv data and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials for published articles that reported the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or its compounds was done. We identified 1071 published studies and 7 studies were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of a total of 4984 patients, of which 1721 (34.5%) received hydroxychloroquine or its congeners (HCQ group) while 3091 (62.01%) received standard of care or had included antiviral medication (control group). The pooled estimate of successful treatment in the hydroxychloroquine group and the control group was 77.45% and 77.87% respectively, which indicated similar clinical outcomes in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group. The odds ratio of a favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine was 1.11 (95 CI 0.72 to 1.69) (p = 0.20). The pooled risk difference of favourable outcome with hydroxychloroquine versus control group was 0.00 (95 CI -0.03 to 0.03) which was statistically not significant (p = 0.10). Conclusions: The present evidence shows no benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients affected by mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.

METHODS CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched to identify randomised, crossover studies in healthy individuals that compared the following interventions: (i) fasted exercise with a standardised post-exercise meal [FastEx + Meal], (ii) fasted exercise without a standardised post-exercise meal [FastEx + NoMeal], (iii) fed exercise with a standardised post-exercise meal [FedEx + Meal], (iv) fed exercise without a standardised post-exercise meal [FedEx + NoMeal]. Studies must have measured ad libitum meal energy intake, within-lab energy intake, 24-h energy intake, energy expenditure, subjective hunger, acyl-ghrelin, peptide YY, and/or glucagon-like peptide 1. Random-effect network meta-analyses were performed for outcomes containing 5 studies. RESULTS 17 published articles (23 studies) were identified. Ad libitum meal energy intake was significantly lower during FedEx + Meal compared to FedEx + NoMeal (MD: -489 kJ; 95% CI, -898 to -80 kJ; P = 0.019). Within-lab energy intake was significantly lower during FastEx + NoMeal compared to FedEx + NoMeal (MD: -1326 kJ; 95% CI, -2102 to -550 kJ; P = 0.001). Similarly, 24-h energy intake following FastEx + NoMeal was significantly lower than FedEx + NoMeal (MD: -2095 kJ; 95% CI, -3910 kJ to -280 kJ; P = 0.024). Energy expenditure was however significantly lower during FastEx + NoMeal compared to FedEx+NoMeal (MD: -0.67 kJ/min; 95% CI, -1.10 to -0.23 kJ/min; P = 0.003). Subjective hunger was significantly higher during FastEx + Meal (MD: 13 mm; 95% CI, 5-21 mm; P = 0.001) and FastEx + NoMeal (MD: 23 mm; 95% CI, 16-30 mm; P < 0.001) compared to FedEx + NoMeal. CONCLUSION FastEx + NoMeal appears to be the most effective strategy to produce a short-term decrease in energy intake, but also results in increased hunger and lowered energy expenditure. Concerns regarding experimental design however lower the confidence in these findings, necessitating future research to rectify these issues when investigating exercise meal timing and energy balance.

Temperature-sensitive mutants were isolated using 5-fluorouracil and 5-azacytidine as mutagen. Six RNA+ mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575C676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (>50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination. A variety of explanations could account for the increased rates of recombination in the S gene.","output":"Evidence for variable rates of recombination in the MHV genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One year has elapsed since a team of Chinese scientists reported the first case of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China on January 8, 2020, after sequencing the first viral genetic material.

The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful.","output":"Management of COVID-19: the risks associated with treatment are clear, but the benefits remain uncertain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fundamental objective of this paper is to identify the informative knowledge and challenges of home quarantine (HQ) during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Bangladesh To test the effect of informative knowledge on the challenges of HQ is also considered in this study A highly structured questionnaire has been prepared using Google form and sent to the university students through several social media such as e-mail, WhatsApp and Facebook A total of 246 students successfully completed the questionnaire Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS-22 version) was applied to complete the data analysis procedures The major findings showed that 75% university students of Bangladesh have a good knowledge about HQ during COVID-19 and based on their perceptions, in Bangladesh, there are some major challenges (lack of consciousness of the people, lack of basic supports from government and lack of medical and financial supports) of HQ during the period of COVID-19 In addition, the informative knowledge has significant effect on challenges of HQ","output":"Informative knowledge and challenges of home quarantine during COVID-19 in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automated driving system - dedicated vehicles (ADS-DVs), specially designed for people with various disabilities, can be beneficial to improve their mobility.

In order to address the design challenge, we followed the human-centered design process. First, we conducted user research with caregivers of people with ASD. Second, we identified their user needs, including safety, monitoring and updates, individual preferences, comfort, trust, and reliability. Third, we generated a large number of ideas with brainstorming and affinity diagrams, based on which we proposed an ADS-DV prototype with a mobile application and an interior design. Fourth, we tested both the low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes to fix the possible issues.

The development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is difficult due to many obstacles, such as the lack of knowledge of important proteins, genes, and mutations of the viral genome. In this study, we selected and utilized 852 strains of COVID-19 from major countries in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) global virus bank. The information of these strains was processed by using Nextstrain software, a program that provided a visual phylogenetic tree, transmission map, and diversity panel that explains entropy and number of mutations for each codon in the genome. The general data about the spread and evolution of COVID-19 supported the current knowledge that it began in China and spread throughout the country in an interrelated manner instead of a clear \\"patient zero\\" manner. A recent study reported that codon 614 on COVID-19 spike protein (S614) was an important codon for viral spread, specifically, a mutation from aspartic acid to glycine facilitated the spread of the virus. Therefore, we chose to geographically track this mutation during the spread of COVID-19 to investigate where it emerged and whether it can affect the spread COVID-19. Our results showed that the glycine mutation first emerged in France. Also, the transmission rates in France versus China, where the mutation was not prevalent, did reflect the hypothesized change in viral behavior.","output":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences reveals transmission path and emergence of S-D (614G) mutation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ferritin, the cellular protein storage for iron, has emerged as a key molecule in the immune system, orchestrating the cellular defense against inflammation. At the end of 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread throughout China and other countries around the world, resulting in a viral pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the correlation between ferritin and disease severity in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained clinical and laboratory data regarding 39 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals in Israel. RESULTS: A significant increase in ferritin levels was demonstrated in patients with moderate and severe disease, compared to patients with mild disease (P = 0.006 and 0.005, respectively). Severe patients had significantly higher levels of ferritin (2817.6 ng/ml) than non-severe patients (708.6 ng/ml) P = 0.02. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary cross-sectional study, elevated ferritin levels were shown to correlate with disease severity in 39 patients from Israel with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Our results further strengthen the hypothesis that severe COVID-19 disease might be due to an underlying dysregulated hyperimmune response. In order to identify these patients early and prioritized resources, we believe that all patients with COVID-19 should be screened for hyperferritinemia.","output":"Ferritin as a Marker of Severity in COVID-19 Patients: A Fatal Correlation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Deux vagues dpidmie de COVID-19 se sont succdes en France au printemps et  lautomne 2020.

We aimed to study the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (V(T)) on the distributions of regional ventilation and perfusion by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in healthy and injured lungs. METHODS: One-hit acute lung injury model was established in 6 piglets by repeated lung lavages (injured group). Four ventilated piglets served as the control group. A randomized sequence of any possible combination of three V(T) (7, 10, and 15 ml/kg) and four levels of PEEP (5, 8, 10, and 12 cmH(2)O) was performed in all animals. Ventilation and perfusion distributions were computed by EIT within three regions-of-interest (ROIs): nondependent, middle, dependent. A mixed design with one between-subjects factor (group: intervention or control), and two within-subjects factors (PEEP and V(T)) was used, with a three-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Two-way interactions between PEEP and group, and V(T) and group, were observed for the dependent ROI (p = 0.035 and 0.012, respectively), indicating that the increase in the dependent ROI ventilation was greater at higher PEEP and V(T) in the injured group than in the control group. A two-way interaction between PEEP and V(T) was observed for perfusion distribution in each ROI: nondependent (p = 0.030), middle (p = 0.006), and dependent (p = 0.001); no interaction was observed between injured and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Large PEEP and V(T) levels were associated with greater pulmonary ventilation of the dependent lung region in experimental lung injury, whereas they affected pulmonary perfusion of all lung regions both in the control and in the experimental lung injury groups.","output":"Real-time effects of PEEP and tidal volume on regional ventilation and perfusion in experimental lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A vaccine antigen, when launched as DNA or RNA, can be presented in various forms, including intracellular, secreted, membrane\\\\bound, or on extracellular vesicles (EVs).

Currently, there are only limited studies focusing on a long-term effect of HBCT, which means it is essential to do more research in this study field. AIM This study aimed at investigating a 1-year effect of a randomized controlled study using Cardiac Rehabilitation through the Global Position System (CR-GPS) compared to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Study focused on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with coronary heart disease (CAD). DESIGN A long-term follow-up of a randomized study. SETTING Patients were enrolled, and the intervention was performed in an outpatient or homebased model. The results were obtained and evaluated in a hospital. POPULATION Patients who participated in the CR-GPS study were diagnosed with CAD with low to moderate cardiovascular risk. METHODS Patients enrolled in the study were eligible participants who had previously completed a 12-week HBCT program using a wrist heart rate (HR) monitor or attended a traditional CBCR. Primary outcome was the change in CRF expressed in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), and the secondary outcomes were self-reported HRQL, objectively measured anthropometric characteristics, and mortality and hospitalization rates. RESULTS 44 patients (76%) completed the long-term follow-up. The average peak of pVO2 was higher after 1-year follow-up in the telerehabilitation group (HBCT 25.5 ml / kg / min compared to the active control group CBCR 23.6 ml / kg / min p = 0.047). No statistically significant difference between the two groups was found after long-term follow-up for the parameter HRQL. For both groups, there was a significant improvement in the range of perceptions of general health. There was no death case and no difference in hospitalization rate between the groups. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the HBCT model. It has been demonstrated that it induces satisfactory long-term effects in pVO2, exercise performance, and perceived general health in CAD patients with low to moderate cardiovascular risk.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective follow-up of 170 children aged 1C8.6 years through the CFLI season by daily parental diary for CFLI episodes and nasal secretion sampling using PCR assays for adenovirus, coronavirus (types 229E and OC43), influenza virus (types A and B), parainfluenza (types 1C3) virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RESULTS: Virus was detected in 415 of 956 independent assays: 425 CFLI episodes and 531 non-CFLI periods were sampled; samples from 270 (64%) CFLI episodes and 145 (27%) non-CFLI periods contained virus detected by PCR. Rhinovirus was most frequently detected at 64%, followed by mixed viruses at 12%, RSV at 7%, and the other viruses at 3C5% of all detections. About 85% of RSV, influenza A and adenovirus detections were associated with a CFLI, whereas less than 62% of other virus detections were associated with CFLI.

Understanding the epidemiology of CA-MRSA is critical for developing control measures. METHODS At a 464-bed public hospital in Chicago and its more than 100 associated clinics, surveillance of soft tissue, abscess fluid, joint fluid, and bone cultures for S aureus was performed. We estimated rates of infection and geographic and other risks for CA-MRSA through laboratory-based surveillance and a case-control study. RESULTS The incidence of CA-MRSA skin and soft tissue infections increased from 24.0 cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 164.2 cases per 100,000 people in 2005 (relative risk, 6.84 [2005 vs 2000]). Risk factors were incarceration (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-3.67), African American race/ethnicity (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.28-2.87), and residence at a group of geographically proximate public housing complexes (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.25-4.98); older age was inversely related (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96 [for each decade increase]).

Limited progress has been made since the formulation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Strategy in 2010. WHO is seeking to accelerate progress in implementing international efforts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The threat to global health posed by tobacco is well understood by policy communities and populations globally; by contrast alcohol is much less so, despite available evidence. THE COMPETITION FOR EPISTEMIC AUTHORITY: Global alcohol corporations have sought to become trusted sources of advice for policy makers and consumers, while continuing to grow their markets. Evidence-informed public health messaging faces formidable competition from transnational corporations as the worlds of corporate and political communications, social and mainstream media become increasingly linked, presenting new opportunities for corporate actors to shape global health governance. Alcohol messaging that uses means of persuasion tied to industry agendas does not tell a clear story about commercial determinants of health, and does not contribute to health improvement. On the contrary, the basic tenets of an evidence-informed population-based approach are denied and the policy measures supported by high quality evidence are being opposed, because they are inimical to commercial interests. A David and Goliath metaphor for this state of affairs, which seems to fit at first glance, may unwittingly reinforce the status quo. CONCLUSION: Public opinion on alcohol and policy issues varies across time and place and can be influenced by dedicated public health interventions. Alcohol marketing dominates people's thinking about alcohol because we currently allow this to happen. Greater ambition is needed in developing countermarketing and other interventions to promote evidence-informed ideas with the public. Alcohol policies need to be further developed, and implemented more widely, in order to arrest the growing burden of alcohol harms across the world.","output":"Alcohol marketing versus public health: David and Goliath?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This study was conducted to delineate potential sites of exit and duration of shedding of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Two experiments of 6 pigs each were conducted. Pigs were farrowed in isolation, weaned at 7 days of age, and housed in individual HEPA filtered isolation chambers. In each experiment, 3 pigs served as controls and 3 were inoculated intranasally with PRRSV (ATCC VR-2402) at 3 weeks of age. In a first experiment, on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 post inoculation (PI), pigs were anesthetized and intubated. The following samples were collected: serum, saliva, conjunctival swabs, urine by cystocentesis, and feces. Upon recovery from anesthesia, the endotracheal tube was removed, rinsed, and the rinse retained. In the second experiment, the sampling schedule was expanded and serum, saliva, and oropharyngeal samples were collected from day 55 to day 124 PI at 14 day intervals. Virus was isolated in porcine alveolar macrophages up to day 14 from urine, day 21 from serum, day 35 from endotracheal tube rinse, day 42 from saliva, and day 84 from oropharyngeal samples. No virus was recovered from conjunctival swabs, fecal samples, or negative control samples. This is the first report of isolation of PRRSV from saliva. Virus-contaminated saliva, especially when considered in the context of social dominance behavior among pigs, may play an important role in PRRSV transmission.

Furthermore, current research has focused on the commercialization of the plant because of its treatment in clinical anxiety and depression, psychological and psychiatric disorders, improving mood, promoting relaxation and happiness. In addition, several studies have focused on the isolation and characterization of various beneficial bioactive compounds including alkaloids from the Sceletium tortuosum plant. Sceletium was reviewed more than a decade ago and new evidence has been published since 2008, substantiating an update on this South African botanical asset. Thus, this review provides an extensive overview of the biological and pharmaceutical properties of Sceletium tortuosum as well as the bioactive compounds with an emphasis on antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and other significant biological effects. There is a need to critically evaluate the bioactivities and responsible bioactive compounds, which might assist in reinforcing and confirming the significant role of kanna in the promotion of healthy well-being in these stressful times.","output":"A Chewable Cure Kanna: Biological and Pharmaceutical Properties of Sceletium tortuosum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Children develop symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more rarely than adults upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pediatric oncology and hematology patients may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 due to their underlying disease or treatment. We investigated COVID-19 and seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, respectively, in a Swedish cohort of pediatric oncology and hematology patients. PROCEDURE Patients (n = 136) were recruited between June 2020 and September 2021 at Uppsala University Children's Hospital, Sweden. Up to six consecutive blood samples per patient were analyzed for wild-type anti-S1 IgM and IgG antibodies (including after vaccination, n = 4). Clinical data on COVID-19 (including polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test results) were collected from electronic medical records. A questionnaire was completed at recruitment. RESULTS A cumulative seroprevalence (IgM and IgG) of 33% (45/136 patients, 95% confidence interval: 25%-41%) was observed in this patient cohort, of whom 66% (90/136 patients) were under severe immunosuppressive treatment during the study period. Increasing patient age (p = .037) and PCR test results (p < .002) were associated with seropositivity in nonvaccinated cases. Most seropositive, nonvaccinated cases (32/43, 74%) were never PCR-verified for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 13 patients with PCR-verified infection, nine (69%) reported mild disease. A majority (63%) reported continued school attendance during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Swedish pediatric oncology and hematology patients developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, despite their diagnosis and/or treatment, and the observed seroprevalence was similar to that in national pediatric outpatients. PCR-verified cases underestimate the true incidence of COVID-19 in this patient cohort.","output":"COVID-19 seroprevalence and clinical picture in Swedish pediatric oncology and hematology patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A variety of neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 infections have been reported.

Very quickly, a French registry was set up on behalf of the French Society of Transplantation allowing the collection of confirmed cases of Covid-19 occurring in kidney transplant recipients in almost all French centers. The analysis of this registry in conjunction with the data from the Agence de la Biomdecine (Cristal) has enabled us to obtain instructive results. We first showed that the incidence of severe forms among transplant patients hospitalized for Covid-19 was 46% and that their mortality was 22.8%. The risk factors for severe forms and mortality are described. Then we showed, by comparing transplant patients with immunocompetent patients matched for the main severity factors of the disease, that mortality among transplant patients was higher (17.9% vs 11.4%; P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, a creatinine level at admission above 115 mol/L was associated with death, whereas being transplanted was not. Finally, comparing the transplant cohort with patients on the kidney transplant waiting list during the period from February to June 2020, we found that patients on the waiting list had a higher Covid-19-related excess mortality than transplant patients, mainly in areas of low viral circulation. In conclusion, the French Registry of transplant patients with Covid-19, which was rapidly set up at the beginning of the epidemic, has already enabled us to draw several lessons about this initially unknown infection, particularly in kidney transplant patients, a population which appeared to be particularly at risk.","output":"[Covid-19 in kidney transplantation: Lessons from the French Registry]./ Covid-19 en transplantation rnale, le?ons du registre fran?ais"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most complex infectious swine diseases and the greatest concern to the pig industry owing to its high mortality and no effective vaccines available to prevent the disease.

Patients with an identified pathogen did not differ from those with TD of unknown etiology in terms of the time of onset of illness or the median frequency of unformed stools in the first 24 hours. In contrast, the median frequency of unformed stools between 24 and 48 hours (i.e., on the second day) was 1.0 among patients with no pathogen and 2.0 among those with enteric pathogens identified (P < .001). A similar difference was evident on the third day (1.0 vs. 2.5). Moreover, a lower proportion of patients with no pathogen identified had watery stools (28% vs. 55%). The durations of diarrhea and concomitant symptoms were significantly shorter and the recovery from TD was significantly quicker among the patients without an identified pathogen. Patients with one or more invasive pathogens had disease that was clearly more severe than that of patients with no pathogen identified; the difference in severity of disease was less marked for patients with invasive vs. noninvasive pathogens. Individuals with diarrhea due to Campylobacter species tended to have the most severe disease, whereas diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli seemed milder than that caused by other agents.

We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV PTM peptide binds to and interacts with phospholipid model membranes, and, at the same time, it adopts different conformations when bound to membranes of different compositions. As it has been already suggested for other viral fusion proteins such as HIV gp41, the region of the SARS-CoV protein where the PTM peptide resides could be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes working synergistically with other membrane-active regions of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein to heighten the fusion process and therefore might be essential for the assistance and enhancement of the viral and cell fusion process.","output":"Interaction of a peptide from the pre-transmembrane domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein with phospholipid membranes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increase in the number of patients and death rates make Covid-19 a serious pandemic situation.

Our aim is to clarify the relationship between telework and employees job performance through a moderated mediation model. METHODS: This study employed two-wave surveys with the aim of reducing the potential risk of common method bias. The 1309 participants of the survey were mainly employees who used telework during COVID-19, and they were mostly in positions such as product design and scheme planning. SEM was used to test the hypotheses. RESULTS: Results from two-wave surveys of 1309 Chinese employees indicated that telework positively influenced job performance via job crafting. That is, job crafting played a mediating role between telework and job performance. And performance-prove goal orientation positively moderated the relationship between telework and job crafting but performance-avoid goal orientation negatively moderated the relationship between them. CONCLUSION: This study shows that telework can improve job performance through job crafting in COVID-19, in response to the paradox implied in the literature. In addition, we use COR theory to explain the role of performance goal orientation and job crafting in telework. We add these variables to the theoretical framework of COR theory, thereby enriching the theoretical research from the COR theory perspective.","output":"How and When Telework Improves Job Performance During COVID-19?

Effective reconstruction of the MCL with reduction of irritation to the elbow has rarely been reported. This study introduces a minimally invasive elbow MCL reconstruction technique and evaluates the valgus stability. Methods: Eight fresh-frozen elbow specimens underwent reconstruction of the anterior bundle of the MCL (AMCL) first with the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia patches, followed by reconstruction of the posterior bundle of the MCL (PMCL) with the triceps tendon patches. The valgus angles of each specimen were examined in three stages as follows: intact MCL, reconstruction of the AMCL alone, and reconstruction of the MCL (including AMCL and PMCL). Finally, specimens were loaded to failure, and failure modes were recorded. Results: AMCL reconstruction alone had similar valgus stability at all testing angles (p = 0.080, 30 flexion; p = 0.064, 60 flexion; p = 0.151, 90 flexion; p = 0.283, 120 flexion) compared with the intact MCL, as did MCL reconstruction (p = 0.951, 30 flexion; p = 0.739, 60 flexion; p = 0.841, 90 flexion; p = 0.538, 120 flexion). More importantly, a significant difference existed between the MCL reconstruction and the AMCL reconstruction alone at 30 flexion (p = 0.043) and 60 flexion (p = 0.013) but not at the 90 flexion (p = 0.369) and 120 flexion (p = 0.879). The mean maximum failure torque of MCL reconstruction was 24.02 Nm at 90 elbow flexion. Conclusion: Both AMCL reconstruction alone and MCL reconstruction provided valgus stability comparable with the native MCL, and importantly, MCL reconstruction provided more valgus stability than AMCL reconstruction alone at 30 flexion and 60 flexion of the elbow. Therefore, the new MCL reconstruction technique might be a useful guide for the treatment of elbow MCL injuries or deficiencies.","output":"Biomechanical Evaluation of a Low-Invasive Elbow Medial Collateral Ligament Reconstruction Technique With Fascia and Tendon Patches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious respiratory diseases are highly contagious and very common, and thus can be considered as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We followed up the incidence rates (IRs) of eight infectious respiratory diseases, including chickenpox, measles, pertussis, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, rubella, and meningococcal disease, after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in South Korea, and then compared those with the IRs in the corresponding periods in the previous 3 years. Overall, the IRs of these diseases before and after age- or sex-standardization significantly decreased in the intervention period compared with the pre-intervention periods (p < 0.05 for all eight diseases). However, the difference in the IRs of all eight diseases between the IRs before and after age-standardization was significant (p < 0.05 for all periods), while it was not significant with regard to sex-standardization. The incidence rate ratios for eight diseases in the pre-intervention period compared with the intervention period ranged from 3.1 to 4.1. These results showed the positive effects of the mitigation measures on preventing the development of respiratory infectious diseases, regardless of age or sex, but we need to consider the age-structure of the population to calculate the effect size.

Home-based telerehabilitation was defined as a specific remote rehabilitation intervention that used any kind of technological device allowing healthcare professional/patient interaction. Information regarding the effect and feasibility (intervention completion rate) of home-based telerehabilitation was extracted from eligible articles. We used the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials to assess methodological quality of the included articles. Eventually, six studies were included as eligible articles. The overall risk of bias judgement was assessed as High in five studies. All studies were conducted in either China or South Korea, and heterogeneity in terms of participants health condition and intervention regimen was observed across the studies. Our narrative-based analysis showed that compared with conventional rehabilitation, either equal or better effects on physical function were reported across the six studies.

High well-being is an intrinsically worthy goal for individuals, communities and nations. Multiple measures of well-being exist, yet we lack information to identify benchmarks, geographical disparities and targets for intervention to improve population life evaluation in the USA. DESIGN: Using data from the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index, we conducted retrospective analyses of a series of cross-sectional samples. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We summarised select well-being outcomes nationally for each year, and by county (n=599) over two time periods, 2008C2012 and 2013C2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We report percentages of people thriving, struggling and suffering using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Scale, percentages reporting high or low current life satisfaction, percentages reporting high or low future life optimism, and changes in these percentages over time. RESULTS: Nationally, the percentage of people that report thriving increased from 48.9% in 2008 to 56.3% in 2017 (p<0.05). The percentage suffering was not significantly different over time, ranging from 4.4% to 3.2%. In 2013C2017, counties with the highest life evaluation had a mean 63.6% thriving and 2.3% suffering while counties with the lowest life evaluation had a mean 49.5% thriving and 6.5% suffering, with counties experiencing up to 10% suffering, threefold the national average. Changes in county-level life evaluation also varied. While counties with the greatest improvements experienced 10%C15% increase in the absolute percentage thriving or 3%C5% decrease in absolute percentage suffering, most counties experienced no change and some experienced declines in life evaluation.

The aim. To evaluate the features of the perioperative period after coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with the history of COVID-19. Materials and methods. The research is based on the analysis of data from patients who were operated at the Department of Transplantation and Heart Surgery of Shalimov National Institute of Surgery and Transplantation for the last 2 years. The article presents a comparative analysis of the perioperative period after coronary artery bypass grafting on a beating heart in patients with and without the history of COVID-19. Both groups of patients were basically equivalent in demographics, incidence of comorbidities, NYHA functional class, ejection fraction, and the difference between them was insignificant. Severe course of previous COVID-19 was noted only in 2 (10%) patients, moderate in 6 (30%), mild in 12 (60%). The most common finding was 11% to 30% damage of the lung tissue which was observed in 10 (50%) patients. Residual effects of spiral computed tomography immediately before surgery were detected in 6 (30%) cases. Results and discussion. In the early postoperative period there were such complications as: acute myocardial infarc-tion, acute renal failure, acute cerebrovascular accident, sternal infection. In the early postoperative period, patients in both groups developed complications: 14 (70%) patients in group 1 vs. 7 (35%) patients in group 2. Acute renal failure (ARF) was verified by a 1.5C1.9-fold increase in creatinine levels compared to baseline, or 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 mmol/l), and was significantly more common in the group of patients after COVID-19 (6 [30%]) than in the group of patients without the history of COVID-19 (2 [10%]). The incidence of myocardial infarction confirmed by high levels of highly specific troponin T and changes in electrocardiography also prevailed in group 1 with 4 (20%) patients vs. 2 (10%) patients in group 2 (P <0.001). In patients with a history of COVID-19, the duration of ventilation and the need for additional oxygen-ation was higher compared to those who did not have COVID-19. We found that patients with the history of COVID-19 had more abundant exudates in the first 24 hours: 113  36.4 ml in group 1 vs. 78  26.8 ml in group 2 without COVID-19. The length of stay of the patients in the ICU differs in both groups: 78.4  14.1 hours in group 1 and 52.8  12.1 hours in group 2 (P <0.01), and is observed as a consequence of the above-mentioned complications accompanying early postoperative period. Conclusions. Analysis of the results of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients with a history of COVID-19 showed that the postoperative course in them is more severe compared with patients who did not have COVID-19. The patients with the history of COVID-19 who are candidates for coronary artery bypass grafting are more likely to devel-op acute myocardial infarction and acute renal failure manifested by increased creatinine in the postoperative period. ? 2021 The Authors.

As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50) = 3 M) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction. Methylene blue inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2 spike bearing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells with similar IC(50) (3.5 M). Hence, this PPI inhibitory activity could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.","output":"Methylene Blue Inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 SpikeCACE2 Protein-Protein InteractionCa Mechanism that can Contribute to its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed exceptional demands on Intensive Care Units (ICU) across the world C particularly requiring patients to be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Laryngeal injury following intubation is a common occurrence, therefore this study aims to analyse airway, voice, and swallow (AVS) outcomes of patients intubated for COVID-19 pneumonitis and compares it to intubated non-COVID-19 respiratory patients and other ICU admissions. METHOD: We collected data from inpatient records, and follow-up clinics on intubated adult patients discharged from a tertiary care hospital ICU between 01/03/20 and 30/04/20. Patients were assessed with the AVS Scale, Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10). RESULTS: 86 patients were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonitis, 17 patients were admitted with non-COVID-19 respiratory failure, and 26 patients were admitted with a non-respiratory diagnosis. The COVID-19 cohort demonstrated higher rates of AVS difficulties (airway 59% vs 44% and 31%, voice 40% vs 19% and 19%, swallow 21% vs 6% and 12%).

Up to January 13, 2022, 320,944,953 cases of infection and 5,539,160 deaths have been reported worldwide. COVID-19 has negatively impacted the blood supply chain by drastically reducing blood donation. Therefore, developing models to design effective blood supply chains in emergencies is essential. This research offers a novel multi-objective Transportation-Location-Inventory-Routing (TLIR) formulation for an emergency blood supply chain network design problem. We answer questions regarding strategic, operational, and tactical decisions considering disruption in the network and blood shelf-life. Since, in real-world applications, the parameters of the proposed mathematical formulation are uncertain, two flexible uncertain models are proposed to provide risk-averse and robust solutions for the problem. We applied the proposed formulations in a case study. Under various scenarios and realizations, we show that the offered robust model handles uncertainties more efficiently and finds solutions that have significantly lower costs and delivery time. To make a reliable conclusion, we performed extensive worst-case analyses to demonstrate the robustness of the results.

Hereby, we present our recent experience with ATG administration both as induction therapy and as an anti-rejection treatment. MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients transplanted during the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic who were treated with thymoglobulin. The ATG dosing, lymphocyte number and percentage in blood smear, adverse effects (thrombocytopenia and infectious complications), and kidney graft function up to 12 months and patients outcomes were analyzed and compared to KTRs who received basiliximab induction. RESULTS: During pandemic, a total of 31 patients were treated with ATG and 59 received basiliximab. The median cumulative ATG doses were 275 (175C325) mg in the induction subgroup and 263 (200C275) mg in the anti-rejection treatment subgroup. Mild thrombocytopenia was noted in 7 (22.6%) and 13 (29.5%) patients, respectively. There were more infectious complications among patients treated with ATG as compared with the basiliximab subgroup (32.3 vs 10.2%, P<0.01), but there were similar incidence rates of thrombocytopenia. Kidney graft function up to 12 months after transplant was comparable (1.1 [1.0C1.9] vs 1.1 [1.0C1.4] mg/dl, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 1. ATG use in the induction protocol or as the anti-rejection treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be safe and the risk of adverse events is acceptable. 2.

During the governance process, it is found that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) change in the same trend among some areas and the opposite in others, which brings some difficulties to take measures in a planned way. Therefore, this study adopted multi-year and large-scale air quality data to explore the distribution of correlation between PM2.5 and O3, and proposed a concept called dynamic similar hu lines to replace the single fixed division in the previous research. Furthermore, this study discussed the causes of distribution patterns quantitatively with geographical detector and random forest. The causes included natural factors and anthropogenic factors. And these factors could be divided into three parts according to the characteristics of spatial distribution: broadly changing with longitude, changing with latitude, and having local characteristics. Overall, regions with relatively more densely population, higher GDP, lower altitude, higher humidity, higher atmospheric pressure, higher surface temperature, less sunshine hours and more accumulated precipitation often corresponds to positive correlation coefficient between PM2.5 and O3, no matter in which season. The parts with opposite conditions that mentioned above are essentially negative correlation coefficient. And what's more, humidity, global surface temperature, air temperature and accumulated precipitation are four decisive factors to form the distribution of correlation between PM2.5 and O3.

The aim was to compare how fear of COVID-19 is manifested in people living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) compared to other GI conditions; and, how fear of COVID-19 is manifested across different demographic backgrounds (employment status, education level and country of residence) among IBD respondents using a large international sample. METHODS: Participants with a GI condition (18years of age) were recruited from 22 countries through a web-based questionnaire. Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial information was collected in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. An adaptation of the scale developed for IBD by Trindade & Ferreira (2020) measuring fear of COVID-19 (FoC; original items 1C9) and GI specific fear of COVID-19 (GI-FoC; new items 10C14) was used. RESULTS: In 831 participants (312 IBD), there were no significant differences in FoC between IBD and other GI conditions; whilst significant increases in GI-FoC were found in IBD respondents (mean [SD]: 13.5 [5.5] vs. 10.9 [5.0], p<0.01). The greatest fears of IBD respondents were: their condition would get worse; impact on access to medical support; being at increased risk of getting COVID-19; and being at increased risk of death if they got COVID-19. Among IBD respondents, persons on sick leave had significantly more general FoC than those who were employed, and significantly more GI-FoC compared to the employed or respondents outside of the labour market (Figures 1a and 1b). Persons living in a rural setting had significantly more general FoC and GI-FoC (Figures 2a and 2b). These persons were fearful of contracting COVID-19, having contact with someone with respiratory symptoms, having contact with healthcare professionals, going outside, meeting people, having contact with someone who was in contact with an infected person, having contact with someone infected with COVID-19, and that their IBD means being at increased risk of death if they got COVID-19. There were no differences in general FoC and GI-FoC according to educational background. However, respondents with higher education were less afraid of dying from COVID-19.

This survey sought to determine Idaho pharmacists willingness to provide different COVID-19 related services, assess needed resources to provide such services, and identify and prioritize other unmet community needs. We conducted a nine-question, cross-sectional survey distributed to pharmacists with addresses located in Idaho.

We previously reported that avian respiratory viruses, including lentogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV), can induce up-regulation of chicken galectin (CG)-1B in the primary target organ. In this study, we investigated whether CG-1B participated in the infectious process of NDV in chickens. We demonstrated that velogenic NDV induced up-regulation of CG-1B in target organs. We also found that CG-1B directly bound to NDV virions and inhibited their hemagglutination activity in vitro We confirmed that CG-1B interacted with NDV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein, in which the specific G4 N-glycans significantly contributed to the interaction between CG-1B and HN glycoprotein. The presence of extracellular CG-1B, rather than the internalization process, inhibited adsorption of NDV. The interaction between intracellular CG-1B and NDV HN glycoproteins inhibited cell-surface expression of HN glycoprotein and reduced the titer of progeny virus in NDV-infected DF-1 cells. Significantly, the replication of parental and HN glycosylation mutant viruses in CG-1B knockdown and overexpression cells demonstrated that the replication of NDV was correlated with the expression of CG-1B in a specific glycan-dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that CG-1B has anti-NDV activity by binding to N-glycans on HN glycoprotein.","output":"Chicken galectin-1B inhibits Newcastle disease virus adsorption and replication through binding to hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) remains a global health problem.

Lectins, a ubiquitous group of proteins that specifically bind glycosylated molecules, are interesting compounds that could be used for this purpose, with demonstrated anti-HIV properties. In addition, potential coinfecting pathogens, including other enveloped viruses, bacteria, yeasts and fungi, and protozoa, display sugar-coated macromolecules on their surfaces, making them potential targets of lectins.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 51- year old male, with no prior medical history, no medication, and non-smoker arrived at the emergency department with exercise induced dyspnea during 4C5 weeks and for the last 48 h dyspnea at rest. Seven weeks before hospitalization, he felt difficulties taking deep breaths for some days but no other symptoms. Oxygen saturation at rest was 93%. Troponin T was 1200 mg/L (ref < 15 mg/L). CT angiography revealed widespread bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism. Additional findings were ground glass opacities that could match Covid-19. The patient tested negative for SARS -CoV-2. Full dose tinzaparin was given for 2 days in hospital, followed by apixaban for 6 months. Recovery has been uneventful so far. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term breathing difficulties might be relatively common after non-hospitalized symptomatic Covid-19. The frequency of PE in this group is unknown. We report a case of suspected covid-19 with widespread PE and a long history of dyspnea but no other symptoms. In our case slight hypoxia and laboratory testing indicated significant disease, which was proven with contrast angiography.

However, there are only a limited number of studies investigating the effects of COVID-19 in individuals with mental illnesses. We aimed to reveal the fear of COVID-19, somatosensorial amplification levels, anxiety, depression, and stress levels of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Method: We evaluated 500 participants in three groups. This study enrolled 137 patients with MDD, 140 patients with GAD, and 223 healthy controls. Participants were evaluated with the Whiteley Index-7, Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SSAS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and The Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the groups' SSAS, DASS-21, Whiteley Index, and The Fear of COVID-19 Scale scores. In the post hoc analysis, Whiteley Index and DASS-21 subscale scores were higher in patient groups than in the control group (p<0.001). Regression analysis revealed that Whiteley Index, COVID-19 Fear, and DASS-S had a significant effect on somatosensorial amplification. Conclusion: The findings of our study show that MDD and GAD patients are susceptible to normal bodily sensations. COVID-19 fear and hypochondriasis appear to be essential determinants of somatosensorial amplification.

Since science is currently strengthening its structures of self-regulation in parallel to the professions, this raises the question to what extent the scientific community is concerned with negligence, and if not, whether it should be. By means of comparative analysis of medical and scientific codes of conduct, we aim to highlight the role (or lack thereof) of negligence provisions in codes of conduct for scientists, and to discuss the normative consequences for future codes of conduct. METHODS: We collected scientific and medical codes of conduct in a selection of OECD countries, and submitted each code of conduct to comparative textual analysis. RESULTS: Negligence is invariably listed as an infraction of the norms of integrity in medical codes of conduct, but only rarely so in the scientific codes. When the latter list negligence, they typically do not provide any detail on the meaning of negligence. DISCUSSION: Unlike codes of conduct for professionals, current codes of conduct for scientists are largely silent on the issue of negligence, or explicitly exclude negligence as a type of misconduct. In the few cases where negligence is stipulated to constitute misconduct, no responsibilities are identified that would help prevent negligence. While we caution against unreasonable negligence provisions as well as disproportionate sanctioning systems, we do argue that negligence provisions are crucial for justified trust in the scientific community, and hence that there is a very strong rationale for including negligence provisions in codes of conduct.

Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of LPO (C11-Biodipy(581/591))-expressing PBMCs/monocytes in AOSD patients and healthy control (HC) subjects was determined by flow-cytometry analysis. Expression of ferritin and cytokines on PBMCs/macrophages was examined by immunoblotting. Plasma levels of LPO-related metabolites and cytokines were determined by ELISA and the MULTIPLEX platform, respectively. LPO MFI on PBMCs/monocytes were significantly higher in patients (median 4456 and 9091, respectively) compared with HC (1900, p < 0.05, and 4551, p < 0.01, respectively).

In its simplest form R(0) can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vectors life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R(0) for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R(0) by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R(0) formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. CONCLUSION: Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the diseases reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.","output":"Robustness of the reproductive number estimates in vector-borne disease systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 resulted in 346 probable SARS cases and 37 deaths in Taiwan.

Analytical performance was assessed by serial dilution of quantified reference material and cell culture stocks in transport medium, including pretreatment for chemical inactivation. For clinical evaluation, residual portions of 164 predetermined patient samples containing SARS-CoV-2 (n=52), influenza A (n=43) or influenza B (n=19), as well as a set of negative samples, were subjected to the novel multiplex assay.Results. The assay demonstrated comparable analytical performance to currently available commercial tests, with limits of detection of 94.9 cp ml-1 for SARS-CoV-2, 14.6 cp ml-1 for influenza A and 422.3 cp ml-1 for influenza B.

Yet, there is still insufficient understanding of the factors associated with parents non-adherence to immunizations in contexts outside of Western countries. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) to investigate non-adherence to immunizations for children aged 6 months to 6 years in Saudi Arabia based on the number of immunizations missing or delayed by more than one month; and (b) to examine the underlying factors that predict the extent of non-adherence based on the Health Belief Model framework. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 22 randomly selected primary health care centers. Structured interviews were also conducted to collect data using the modified Health Belief Model questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the predictors of the extent of non-adherence. RESULTS: Based on data from 220 participants, 51.8% of parents did not adhere with childhood immunizations. There was no significant relationship between parents sociodemographic characteristics and the extent of their hesitancy about childrens immunizations. The linear combination of perception of infectious disease severity, perception of their childrens susceptibility, perception of immunization benefits, perception of fewer barriers to obtaining immunizations, cues to action related to immunizations, and self-efficacy predicted the extent of non-adherence to immunizations (F (11.220) = 2.595, p < 0.001) and explained 12% of its variance. Yet, only perceived childrens susceptibility, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy independently predicted parents non-adherence.

Evidence is emerging that countries where sub-national governments have undertaken unilateral social distancing measures to combat the pandemic with little or no coordination have performed less well in controlling the spread of the disease. We explore analytically whether agreement on a common social distancing policy among sub-national governments, i.e. states or provinces, can lead to a better outcome than if each state or province pursues its own social distancing policy in isolation. A key feature of our model is that it accounts for the inter-jurisdictional spillover effects of each sub-national jurisdiction's policy choice with respect to social distancing. Our results show that, in the absence of a national mandatory agreement, a sub-national agreement with sufficient coordination of social distancing policy among states yields a more effective and efficient control of a pandemic compared to states choosing policy unilaterally. These findings strongly support calls for greater cooperation among and assistance for sub-national governments to improve the effectiveness of their social distancing efforts in controlling the pandemic.","output":"National and Sub-National Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a patient with subclinical coccidioidomycosis who experienced rapid disease dissemination shortly after SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting host immune response dysregulation to coccidioidomycosis by SARS-CoV-2.

Comparing adverse events between hospitalized and outpatients revealed no statistically significant differences in pneumothorax (9%, n = 2 vs 5%,n = 3), tube thoracostomy placement (5%, n = 1 vs 2%, n = 1), grade 2 bleeding (9%, n = 2 vs 0%, n = 0), escalation in level of care (5%, n = 1 vs 0%, n = 0), 30-day mortality (9%, n = 2 vs 2%, n = 1), and 60-day mortality (9%, n = 2 vs 4%, n = 2) (p > 0.05 for all). No deaths were attributed to the procedure. 95% of cases received a multidisciplinary conference diagnosis (hospitalized 100%, n = 22 vs outpatients 93%, n = 51, p = 0.32). CONCLUSION: Our experience supports that TBLC may be a safe and effective modality for acutely ill-hospitalized patients with DPLD. Further efforts to enhance procedural safety and to determine the impact of an expedited tissue diagnosis on patient outcomes are needed.","output":"Transbronchial Lung Cryobiopsy is Safe and Effective for Diagnosing Acutely Ill Hospitalized Patients with New Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Investor sentiment, the willingness of market participants to invest, is a difficult concept to measure. Exploring the relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns can reveal how investor sentiment affects the operation of the stock market. Such an understanding can assist market participants in making more rational investment decisions based on market laws. Such an understanding can also assist regulators in their roles of supervision and policy making. Methodology: Although the E-GARCH model has the advantage of considering volatility clustering, it has not previously been used to investigate the impact of investor sentiment changes on the Shanghai Composite Index's market return. This research therefore applies the E-GARCH approach to data from 2015 to 2018, to explore the influence of investor sentiment on the return rate of the Shanghai Composite Index. Main Findings: There are three main findings. First, when the investor sentiment is increased by the same amount, the rate of return before a stock market crash will have a smaller increase than the rate of change after the crash, which is a new finding. Second, the rate of return on stocks is susceptible to emotional sentiment, rather than simply depending on stock price. Third, the tendency of retail investors to follow the crowd is less in periods of pessimism than it is in periods of optimism, which, in turn, can push up stock yields. Application: Based on these research results, this article can provide insights to understand how investors' subjective judgments on future earnings affect their investment behavior and how great the impact is on the market. At the same time, it can help investors make more rational investment decisions based on an understanding of market laws, and help regulators with guidance for their supervision and policy making. Originality/Value: This paper contributes to the theory of the investor sentiment index, improving the index construction method by adding two sentiment proxy indicators: investor activity ACT and stock market leverage level. After constructing the sentiment index and comparing it with the stock market index (Shanghai Composite Index), the fit is found to be improved.","output":"Using E-GARCH to Analyze the Impact of Investor Sentiment on Stock Returns Near Stock Market Crashes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and purpose  During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the teaching centers in Chile have shifted to online resources. We decided to do a survey on orthopedic residents regarding this type of education to assess for strengths and weaknesses of digital education in orthopedic programs. Methods  A survey was performed targeting 110 orthopedic residents belonging to different training programs around the country. 100 residents completed the survey. Results  86% stated that their programs are using online education. When asked in detail, 86% had been involved in webinars, 28% had received online presentations, 12% had participated in online tests, and 7% had evaluated patients. Webinars were rated (1 = very unsatisfactory, 10 = very satisfactory) with a mean grade of 8.1 (1C10), online presentations 7.3 (1C10), online tests 3.8 (1C8), and online patient evaluations 2.9 (1C9). When asked if, after the end of the pandemic, they would continue using the online modalities, 82% would continue attending webinars, 72% would continue watching online presentations, 27% would continue performing online tests, and 33% of the residents would continue performing online evaluations of patients.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the effects of PEEP augmentation on respiratory mechanics, quantitative computed lung tomography (qCT) findings, and its relationship with ICP modifications. Secondary aims included the assessment of the correlations between different factors (respiratory mechanics and qCT features) with the changes of ICP and how these factors at baseline may predict ICP response after greater PEEP levels. Methods: A prospective, observational study included mechanically ventilated patients with acute brain injury requiring invasive ICP and who underwent two-PEEP levels lung CT scan. Respiratory system compliance (Crs), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)), mean arterial pressure (MAP), data from qCT and ICP were obtained at PEEP 5 and 15 cmH(2)O. Results: Sixteen examinations (double PEEP lung CT and neuromonitoring) in 15 patients were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 54 years (interquartile range, IQR = 39C65) and 53% were men. The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 8 (IQR = 3C12). Median alveolar recruitment was 2.5% of total lung weight (?1.5 to 4.7). PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O increased ICP [median values from 14.0 (11.2C17.5) to 23.5 (19.5C26.8) mmHg, p < 0.001, respectively]. The amount of recruited lung tissue on CT was inversely correlated with the change () in ICP (rho = ?0.78; p = 0.0006). Additionally, Crs (rho = ?0.77, p = 0.008), PaCO(2) (rho = 0.81, p = 0.0003), and MAP (rho = ?0.64, p = 0.009) were correlated with ICP. Baseline Crs was not predictive of ICP response to PEEP. Conclusions: The main factors associated with increased ICP after PEEP augmentation included reduced Crs, lower MAP and lung recruitment, and increased PaCO(2), but none of these factors was able to predict, at baseline, ICP response to PEEP. To assess the potential benefits of increased PEEP in patients with acute brain injury, hemodynamic status, respiratory mechanics, and lung morphology should be taken into account.","output":"Effects of Positive End-Expiratory Pressure on Lung Recruitment, Respiratory Mechanics, and Intracranial Pressure in Mechanically Ventilated Brain-Injured Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Certain pediatric ophthalmology procedures require time-sensitive surgical care to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly important for anesthesia and surgical care providers to protect themselves during medically necessary procedures requiring general anesthesia care.

The viewing system allowed effective and safe intubation of pediatric patients for ophthalmological surgery while minimizing the risk of disseminating aerosolized droplets. The authors concluded that this viewing system and modified intubation technique may reduce the risk of transmitting SARSCoV-2 and other highly transmissible pathogens to operating room personnel.

However, the optimal surgical margin is still under debate. Precancerous lesions exist in tumor-adjacent tissues beyond the histological margin. However, potential precancerous epigenetic variation patterns beyond the histological margin of pGGO are yet to be discovered and described. RESULTS: A genome-wide high-resolution DNA methylation analysis was performed on samples collected from 15 pGGO at tumor core (TC), tumor edge (TE), para-tumor tissues at the 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm beyond the tumor, and peripheral normal (PN) tissue. TC and TE were tested with the same genetic alterations, which were also observed in histologically normal tissue at 5 mm in two patients with lower mutation allele frequency. According to the difference of methylation profiles between PN samples, 2284 methylation haplotype blocks (MHBs), 1657 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs), and 713 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Two different patterns of methylation markers were observed: Steep (S) markers sharply changed at 5 mm beyond the histological margin, and Gradual (G) markers changed gradually from TC to PN. S markers composed 86.2% of the tumor-related methylation markers, and G markers composed the other 13.8%. S-marker-associated genes enriched in GO terms that were related to the hallmarks of cancer, and G-markers-associated genes enriched in pathways of stem cell pluripotency and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Significant difference in DNA methylation score was observed between peripheral normal tissue and tumor-adjacent tissues 5 mm further from the histological margin (p < 0.001 in MHB markers). DNA methylation score at and beyond 10 mm from histological margin is not significantly different from peripheral normal tissues (p > 0.05 in all markers). CONCLUSIONS: According to the methylation pattern observed in our study, it was implied that methylation alterations were not significantly different between tissues at or beyond P10 and distal normal tissues. This finding explained for the excellent prognosis from radical resections with surgical margins of more than 15 mm. The inclusion of epigenetic characteristics into surgical margin analysis may yield a more sensitive and accurate assessment of remnant cancerous and precancerous cells in the surgical margins.","output":"DNA methylation patterns at and beyond the histological margin of early-stage invasive lung adenocarcinoma radiologically manifested as pure ground-glass opacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Radiation protection is multifarious, and consequently, a radiographers' application of radiation protection is multifaceted. Studies have shown varying radiation protection practices among radiographers. The first quantitative phase of this explanatory, sequential mixed-method study used the theory of planned behaviour to explore South African radiographers' radiation protection behaviour. Overall, South African radiographers' attitudes to radiation protection, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and radiation protection intention was high. This second phase of the study aimed to explore the reasons for South African radiographers' radiation protection practices. METHODS: This study used an exploratory and descriptive qualitative approach. Data was collected through 13 in-depth semi-structured telephone interviews. Thematic analysis was used in order to uncover original phenomena. Data saturation was achieved and the study adhered to trustworthiness and ethical measures. RESULTS: Thematic analysis identified two themes. The participants had the appropriate radiation protection knowledge, but radiation protection compliance remained a personal choice. Impediments such as feeling rushed during imaging of trauma and challenging patients, patients knowledge of radiation protection, resources, imaging referrals, inadequate training when transitioning from analogue to digital radiography and managerial support contributed to radiation protection compliance. Strategies such as further education, research and a change in mindset were suggested to further foster radiation protection compliance. CONCLUSION: Even though participants' knowledge of radiation protection aligned with the legislated guidelines, limited internalising of the knowledge resulted in compliance being a personal choice. Participants reflected on their insouciant attitude and observed a similar attitude in their radiographer colleagues. Patient and work-related impediments were identified to contribute to radiation protection compliance. Strategies to further foster compliance were suggested. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Understanding the reasons for radiographers' choice in radiation protection will allow the development of strategies that foster optimum application of radiation protection practises. Developing a radiation protection culture that enhances personal compliance supported by education and evidence should be considered.","output":"South African radiographers' radiation protection practices, a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we would like to reveal some of the many challenges during the time of the twofold simultaneous trauma; the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating earthquake in Zagreb.

These CNS morphometries are associated with stress-related psychiatric illnesses and represent endophenotypes of stress-related psychiatric illness development. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC), may contribute to the biological embedding of the environment but are understudied and not well understood. How 5mC relates to CNS endophenotypes of psychiatric illness is also unclear. In 97 female, African American, trauma-exposed participants from the Grady Trauma Project, we examined the associations of childhood trauma burden (CTQ), adult trauma burden, low income and low education with blood-derived 5mC clusters and variability in brain region measurements in the amygdala, hippocampus and frontal cortex subregions. To elucidate whether peripheral 5mC indexes CNS endophenotypes of psychiatric illness, we tested whether 73 brain/blood correlated 5mC clusters, defined by networks of correlated 5mC probes measured on Illuminas HumanMethylation Epic Beadchip, mediated the relationship between ASEs and brain measurements. CTQ was negatively associated with rostral middle frontal gyrus (RMFG) SA ({beta} = - 0.231, p = 0.041). Low income and low education were also associated with SA or CT in a number of brain regions. Seven 5mC clusters were associated with CTQ (pmin = 0.002), two with low education (pmin = 0.010), and three with low income (pmin = 0.007). Two clusters fully mediated the relation between CTQ and RMFG SA, accounting for 47% and 35% of variability respectively. These clusters were enriched for probes falling in DNA regulatory regions, as well as signal transduction and immune signaling gene ontology functions. Methylome-network analyses showed enrichment of macrophage migration (p = 9x10-8), T cell receptor complex (p = 6x10-6), and chemokine-mediated signaling (p = 7x10-4) pathway enrichment in association with CTQ. Our results support prior work highlighting brain region variability associated with ASEs, while informing a peripheral inflammation-based epigenetic mechanism of biological embedding of such exposures.

All patients were operated on by the same surgical team, and the navel was the only point of entrance. Post-surgical pain was assessed using a numerical scale at the time of discharge. RESULTS None of the patients required conversion to conventional laparoscopy. The mean surgical time was 4014 (16-80) minutes. There were no complications during or after the surgery. The mean post-surgical pain score was 31 (1-7) and the mean hospital stay was 187 (9-42) hours. CONCLUSION SILS is a safe and effective technique for appendicitis.

At the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender, women of color may be disadvantaged in terms of COVID-19 outcomes due to their role as essential workers, their higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, their increased stress and anxiety from the loss of wages and caregiving, and domestic violence. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors among adult women residing in the United States. METHODS: Between May and June 2020, women were recruited into the Capturing Womens Experiences in Outbreak and Pandemic Environments (COPE) Study, a web-based cross-sectional study, using advertisements on Facebook; 491 eligible women completed a self-administered internet-based cross-sectional survey. Descriptive statistics were used to examine racial and ethnic differences (White; Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; Black; Hispanic, Latina, or Spanish Origin; American Indian or Alaskan Native; multiracial or some other race, ethnicity, or origin) on COVID-19 outcomes, stressors, fear, and prevention behaviors. RESULTS: Among our sample of women, 16% (73/470) reported COVID-19 symptoms, 22% (18/82) were concerned about possible exposure from the people they knew who tested positive for COVID-19, and 51.4% (227/442) knew where to get tested; yet, only 5.8% (27/469) had been tested. Racial/ethnic differences were observed, with racial/ethnic minority women being less likely to know where to get tested. Significant differences in race/ethnicity were observed for select stressors (food insecurity, not enough money, homeschooling children, unable to have a doctor or telemedicine appointment) and prevention behaviors (handwashing with soap, self-isolation if sick, public glove use, not leaving home for any activities). Although no racial/ethnic differences emerged from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, significant racial/ethnic differences were observed for some of the individual scale items (eg, being afraid of getting COVID-19, sleep loss, and heart racing due to worrying about COVID-19). CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of COVID-19 testing and knowledge of where to get tested indicate a critical need to expand testing for women in the United States, particularly among racial/ethnic minority women. Although the overall prevalence of engagement in prevention behaviors was high, targeted education and promotion of prevention activities are warranted in communities of color, particularly with consideration for stressors and adverse mental health.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Differences in COVID-19 Outcomes, Stressors, Fear, and Prevention Behaviors Among US Women: Web-Based Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dietary intake of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2-6) has risen dramatically in recent decades.

While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching two electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.81-3.90), male sex (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.39-3.04) and severe obesity (OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.31-5.05). Active cancer (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.04-2.04) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles.

These observations raise the possibility that the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the CNS may play a critical role in survival from a lethal CNS infection. Transient DTH response to nonviral antigens induced an accumulation of monocytes in the CNS that was maximal at 48 h post-challenge and virtually resolved by 5 days post-challenge. By contrast the induction of prolonged DTH responses resulted in the accumulation of a large number monocytes that persisted in the CNS for at least 5 days post-challenge.

STUDY SELECTION: Primary studies characterizing the prevalence, levels, and duration of antibodies in adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); reinfection incidence; and unintended consequences of antibody testing. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators sequentially extracted study data and rated quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Moderate-strength evidence suggests that most adults develop detectable levels of IgM and IgG antibodies after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and that IgG levels peak approximately 25 days after symptom onset and may remain detectable for at least 120 days. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that IgM levels peak at approximately 20 days and then decline. Low-strength evidence suggests that most adults generate neutralizing antibodies, which may persist for several months like IgG. Low-strength evidence also suggests that older age, greater disease severity, and presence of symptoms may be associated with higher antibody levels. Some adults do not develop antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection for reasons that are unclear. LIMITATIONS: Most studies were small and had methodological limitations; studies used immunoassays of variable accuracy.

METHODS: 163 health care workers (HCW) of the Padua University Hospitals, who underwent a complete vaccination campaign with BNT162b2 vaccine were asked to collect serum samples at 12 (t12) and 28 (t28) days after the first inoculum to allow the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies (Ab) using chemiluminescent assays against the spike (S) protein and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the virus, respectively. RESULTS: Significant differences were found at t12 for infection-na?ve and subjects with previous-natural infection who present higher values of specific antibodies, while no significant differences have been found between t12 and t28. No statistically significant difference was found between male and female, while lower Ab levels have been observed in subjects older than 60 years at t12 but not at t28. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms observed differences in vaccine responses between infection-na?ve and subjects with previous natural infection at t12 but not for a longer time.

We review the literature on craniofacial chondroblastomas with particular emphasis on extratemporal lesions. Case Presentation A 27-year-old woman presented with severe headache, left facial dysesthesias, and diplopia. Physical examination revealed hypesthesia in the left maxillary nerve dermatome, and complete left abducens nerve palsy. Imaging demonstrated an expansile intraosseous mass originating in the upper clivus with extension superiorly into the sella turcica and laterally to involve the medial wall of the left cavernous sinus. The tumor was completely resected via an endoscopic endonasal approach, with postoperative improvement in lateral gaze palsy. Histopathology was consistent with chondroblastoma.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this manuscript is to describe our experience developing an antimicrobial stewardship (AS) module as a clinical decision support tool in the Epic electronic health record (EHR). SUMMARY: Clinical decision support systems within the EHR can be used to decrease use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, improve antibiotic selection and dosing, decrease adverse effects, reduce antibiotic costs, and reduce the development of antibiotic resistance. The Johns Hopkins Hospital constructed an AS module within Epic. Customized stewardship alerts and scoring systems were developed to triage patients requiring stewardship intervention. This required a multidisciplinary approach with a team comprising AS physicians and pharmacists and Epic information technology personnel, with assistance from clinical microbiology and infection control when necessary. In addition, an intervention database was enhanced with stewardship-specific interventions, and workbench reports were developed specific to AS needs. We herein review the process, advantages, and challenges associated with the development of the Epic AS module. CONCLUSION: Customizing an AS module in an EHR requires significant time and expertise in antimicrobials; however, AS modules have the potential to improve the efficiency of AS personnel in performing daily stewardship activities and reporting through a single system.","output":"Development of an antimicrobial stewardship module in an electronic health record: Options to enhance daily antimicrobial stewardship activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) has been described as a novel and often severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We aimed to describe the characteristics of children admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) presenting with MIS-C in comparison with those admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection with other features such as COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A multicentric prospective national registry including 47 PICUs was carried out. Data from children admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or fulfilling MIS-C criteria (with or without SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation) were collected. Clinical, laboratory and therapeutic features between MIS-C and non-MIS-C patients were compared. RESULTS: Seventy-four children were recruited. Sixty-one percent met MIS-C definition. MIS-C patients were older than non-MIS-C patients (p = 0.002): 9.4 years (IQR 5.5-11.8) vs 3.4 years (IQR 0.4-9.4). A higher proportion of them had no previous medical history of interest (88.2% vs 51.7%, p = 0.005). Non-MIS-C patients presented more frequently with respiratory distress (60.7% vs 13.3%, p < 0.001). MIS-C patients showed higher prevalence of fever (95.6% vs 64.3%, p < 0.001), diarrhea (66.7% vs 11.5%, p < 0.001), vomits (71.1% vs 23.1%, p = 0.001), fatigue (65.9% vs 36%, p = 0.016), shock (84.4% vs 13.8%, p < 0.001) and cardiac dysfunction (53.3% vs 10.3%, p = 0.001). MIS-C group had a lower lymphocyte count (p < 0.001) and LDH (p = 0.001) but higher neutrophil count (p = 0.045), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and procalcitonin (p < 0.001). Patients in the MIS-C group were less likely to receive invasive ventilation (13.3% vs 41.4%, p = 0.005) but were more often treated with vasoactive drugs (66.7% vs 24.1%, p < 0.001), corticosteroids (80% vs 44.8%, p = 0.003) and immunoglobulins (51.1% vs 6.9%, p < 0.001). Most patients were discharged from PICU by the end of data collection with a median length of stay of 5 days (IQR 2.5-8 days) in the MIS-C group. Three patients died, none of them belonged to the MIS-C group. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C seems to be the most frequent presentation among critically ill children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MIS-C patients are older and usually healthy. They show a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and shock and are more likely to receive vasoactive drugs and immunomodulators and less likely to need mechanical ventilation than non-MIS-C patients.","output":"Severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents: from COVID-19 pneumonia to multisystem inflammatory syndrome: a multicentre study in pediatric intensive care units in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Replicating recombinant vector vaccines consist of a fully competent viral vector backbone engineered to express an antigen from a foreign transgene. From the perspective of viral replication, the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be detrimental. Thus vaccine revertants that delete or inactivate the transgene may evolve to dominate the vaccine virus population both during the process of manufacture of the vaccine as well as during the course of host infection. A particular concern is that this vaccine evolution could reduce its antigenicitythe immunity elicited to the transgene. We use mathematical and computational models to study vaccine evolution and immunity. These models include evolution arising during the process of manufacture, the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth, plus innate and adaptive immunity elicited during the course of infection. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the short period of within-host growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant growth may only weakly interfere with vaccine growth in the host and thus have a limited effect on immunity to vaccine. Overall, we find that within-host vaccine evolution can sometimes compromise vaccine immunity, but only when the extent of evolution during vaccine manufacture is severe, and this evolution can be easily avoided or mitigated.","output":"Recombinant vector vaccine evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developmental delays/disorders in young children are identified as a public health priority.

In particular, genetic data coupled with dates and locations of sampled isolates can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathogens during outbreaks. Thus far, phylogenetic methods have been used to tackle this issue. Although these approaches have proved useful for informing on the spread of pathogens, they do not aim at directly reconstructing the underlying transmission tree. Instead, phylogenetic models infer most recent common ancestors between pairs of isolates, which can be inadequate for densely sampled recent outbreaks, where the sample includes ancestral and descendent isolates. In this paper, we introduce a novel method based on a graph approach to reconstruct transmission trees directly from genetic data. Using simulated data, we show that our approach can efficiently reconstruct genealogies of isolates in situations where classical phylogenetic approaches fail to do so. We then illustrate our method by analyzing data from the early stages of the swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Using 433 isolates sequenced at both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, we reconstruct the likely history of the worldwide spread of this new influenza strain.

ABSTRACT The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is characterized in its more severe form, by an acute respiratory failure which can worsen to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and get complicated with thrombotic events and heart dysfunction. Therefore, admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is common. Ultrasound, which has become an everyday tool in the ICU, can be very useful during COVID-19 pandemic, since it provides the clinician with information which can be interpreted and integrated within a global assessment during the physical examination. A description of some of the potential applications of ultrasound is depicted in this document, in order to supply the physicians taking care of these patients with a adapted guide to the intensive care setting. Some of its applications since ICU admission include verification of the correct position of the endotracheal tube, contribution to safe cannulation of lines, and identification of complications and thrombotic events. Furthermore, pleural and lung ultrasound can be an alternative diagnostic test to assess the degree of involvement of the lung parenchyma by means of the evaluation of specific ultrasound patterns, identification of pleural effusions and barotrauma.

Building on the Job Demands-Resources model, we examined day-level relationships between job demands, home demands and emotional exhaustion during telework. Moreover, we tested if leisure crafting (i.e., the proactive pursuit and enactment of leisure activities targeted at goal setting, socializing, growth and development) is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. We expected that proactive personality would be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was predicted to relate negatively to job performance. METHODS We tested our assumptions using a daily diary study on seven consecutive days with 178 employees (964 observations in total). RESULTS Multilevel path analysis supports the assumptions that daily job demands as well as daily home demands during telework are positively related to emotional exhaustion. As predicted, we found leisure crafting to be negatively related to emotional exhaustion, and proactive personality to be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was negatively related to job performance.

This function may be particularly important in the case of new and emerging infectious diseases, which are unfamiliar to both the public and health professionals. We conducted a content analysis of the coverage in six Canadian newspapers of two emerging infectious pathogens in British Columbia (BC), West Nile virus and Cryptococcus gattii (C. gattii), between 2001 and 2006. C. gattii was first identified in the Canadian Pacific Northwest in 1999, having previously been restricted to tropical and subtropical areas. By summer 2006, C. gattii had killed at least eight people and was responsible for over 150 hospitalizations in the province of BC, as well as significant morbidity and mortality among companion animals. West Nile virus reached Canada in 2001 and has since caused significant morbidity and mortality. It has not, to date, reached BC. Despite the much higher incidence of disease and death caused by C. gattii in BC, West Nile virus received five times more news coverage in the British Columbian and national newspapers examined. Surprisingly, the local newspaper closest to the center of the British Columbia C. gattii outbreak had a much lower proportion of coverage of the disease than other papers in the province.

Survival of patients between high-risk and low-risk groups was compared by kaplan-Meier analysis. Moreover, we assessed the effects of existing common drugs on survival of patients with high-risk. Results Based on the LASSO, four variables (white blood cell, C-reactive protein, whether lymphocyte  0.8  10 9 /L, and whether lactate dehydrogenase  400 U/L) were selected for construction of the nomogram. Patients in the total cohort were stratified into low-risk group (total point < 160) and high-risk group (total point  160). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that there was significant difference in survival of patients between high-risk and low-risk groups (8-week survival rate: 71.41% vs 100%, P < 0.0001).

Of the 15-20% patients that develop pulmonary symptoms, a sub-set develops an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rapidly progressing into a critical condition. Marked elevation of cytokines/chemokines is observed with elevation of additional markers of inflammation, coagulation, and organ damage such as CRP, D-dimer, LDH, Ferritin and Troponin-I. This hyperinflammation leads to worsening of oxygen saturation due to pulmonary infiltration and exudation, organ damage, and dysfunction of coagulation pathway and may lead to multi-organ failure. AREAS COVERED: The role of anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibodies such as Itolizumab, in cytokine storm. EXPERT OPINION: Itolizumab, an anti-CD6 humanized IgG1 mAb, binds to domain-1 of CD-6 that is responsible for priming, activation, and differentiation of T-cells. Itolizumab significantly reduces T-cell proliferation along with substantial downregulation of the production of cytokines/chemokines.

Notably, immune cells express GABAA-receptors (GABAA-Rs) whose activation has anti-inflammatory effects such that GABA administration can ameliorate disease in models of type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19. Here, we show that oral GABA, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), does not affect the course of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, oral administration of the BBB-permeable GABAA-R-specific agonist homotaurine ameliorates monophasic EAE, as well as advanced-stage relapsing-remitting EAE (RR-EAE). Homotaurine treatment beginning after the first peak of paralysis reduced the spreading of Th17 and Th1 responses from the priming immunogen to a new myelin T cell epitope within the CNS. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) isolated from homotaurine-treated mice displayed an attenuated ability to promote autoantigen-specific T cell proliferation. The ability of homotaurine treatment to limit epitope spreading within the CNS, along with its safety record, makes it an excellent candidate to help treat MS and other inflammatory disorders of the CNS.","output":"Homotaurine limits the spreading of T cell autoreactivity within the CNS and ameliorates disease in a model of multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retirement is a question that dangles lower in the mind The closer it gets, the more not grasping it requires reasons to continue Sadly, COVID-19 finally caused enough difficulty for my partner that those reasons proved insufficient The government's recently launched consultation on integrating care in the era after the abandonment of the internal market in the NHS puts the emphasis on Primary Care Networks as the functional units of primary and community care There is scope here finally to end the period of hostilities towards single-handed practices Place-based care is what smaller practices are most expert in and why we are so often rated so highly by our patients The super-practice industrial model may have its place but has proven no panacea In the end, the biggest risk to primary care everywhere is any reason that causes retirement to dangle lower in the mind of all those for whom it is a choice","output":"And then there was one"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Australia, schools and faculties of education are mandated to abide by a policy requiring preservice teachers (pst s), to complete supervised professional placement (pe) in schools.

The ever-increasing demand for health care resources emphasizes the need to streamline care pathways with the ultimate aim of ensuring that patients receive timely and optimal care.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the feasibility of using natural language processing and machine learning to automate the triage of patients with musculoskeletal conditions by analyzing information from referral letters. Specifically, we aim to determine whether referral letters can be automatically assorted into latent topics that are clinically relevant, that is, considered relevant when prescribing treatments. Here, clinical relevance is assessed by posing 2 research questions. Can latent topics be used to automatically predict treatment? Can clinicians interpret latent topics as cohorts of patients who share common characteristics or experiences such as medical history, demographics, and possible treatments? METHODS: We used latent Dirichlet allocation to model each referral letter as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics and model each topic as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. The topic model was evaluated in the context of automating patient triage. Given a set of treatment outcomes, a binary classifier was trained for each outcome using previously extracted topics as the input features of the machine learning algorithm. In addition, a qualitative evaluation was performed to assess the human interpretability of topics. RESULTS: The prediction accuracy of binary classifiers outperformed the stratified random classifier by a large margin, indicating that topic modeling could be used to predict the treatment, thus effectively supporting patient triage.

Our aim was to explore Finnish paramedics professional quality of life, using the Professional Quality of Life Scale, with associations to EMS assignment experiences as well as formal and informal defusing need and use over a 12-month period. METHODS: A quantitative study of 257 Finnish paramedics using a cross-sectional design. Study outcomes were secondary traumatic stress (STS), compassion satisfaction (CS), and burnout (BO) scores using the modified 9-item Short Professional Quality of Life scale (ProQOL). Likert-type scales were used to collect participants recollections of assignment experiences and defusing from a 12-month period. Associations were explored using Spearmans correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Short ProQOL score medians were STS 4.00 (IQR 3), BO 6.00 (IQR 3) and CS 13.00 (IQR 3). STS and BO correlated to experiences of social emergencies and traumatic events while BO correlated to experiences of threat situations (r = 0.206, p = .001). Paramedics perceived a need for defusing in general associated with STS (r = 0.178, p < .001) and participated in informal defusing. Participation in defusing of any form did not associate with ProQOL scores. CONCLUSIONS: Finnish paramedics more frequent experiences of social emergencies, traumatic events, and paramedic-directed threat situations were associated with higher levels of STS and BO.

Abstract A huge number of web sites appear every day, overcrowding the existing body of medical and non-medical information in the net; Sources are not always reliable and usually covers commercial and propaganda purposes. This may arise an special concern regarding the dissemination of mislead concepts and practices on the response to pandemic Flu. But not everything is negative on this specific matter. An example of this is the possibility of early detection of new cases of Flu, due to the easy access to information regarding clinical symptoms that search engines like Google or Yahoo, provide to the general population. A new online-based method of outbreak surveillance, appear to be a useful tool, an it been denominated infodemiology. This method allows a real-time monitoring of cases and predicts the expansion of the disease, through continuous and structured analysis of information available on the internet. Another aspect to remark is the quality and promptness of information available on the web, provided by the institutions responsible for controlling infections in the world (e.g World Health Organization), improving the response to a pandemic threat.","output":"Ayudas desde la red para el control de la epidemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an unusual cutaneous reaction, most often related with a hypersensitivity reaction to commonly used drugs.

To date, little has been done to counteract the impacts of public health emergencies and disasters on the aging populations, particularly in African American and Latinx communities. Methods: We administered a survey to community-dwelling minority older adults, 55+, in the Houston metroplex, between 11/2020 and 01/2021. The survey assessed how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted minority older adults. This thematic analysis focused on open-ended questions regarding daily health management, biggest health concerns, and personal experiences with COVID-19. Results: A total of 575 older adults completed the survey. The mean age was 69 years, 74% were female, 71% reported English as their primary language and 27% were college educated. Three main themes of COVID-19 related concerns emerged from the thematic data analysis: 1) Fear of contracting COVID-19 from family members and fear of passing COVID-19 on to family members. 2) Social needs, including prolonged isolation from family/friends to stay safe, obtaining basic necessitates such as food, medications, and transportation . (3) Personal experiences focused on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of family/community members. Conclusions: These older minority adults framed their experiences and concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of family and their community. Their personal relationships permeated their responses and demonstrate the importance of integrating a family lens into future disaster planning, response and recovery efforts for minority older adults.","output":"Framing the COVID-19 Pandemic Through a Family Lens: Results of a Qualitative Thematic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 in the entire world has put the humankind in danger The assets of probably the biggest economies are worried because of the enormous infectivity and contagiousness of this illness The ability of ML models to conjecture the quantity of forthcoming patients influenced by COVID-19 which is by and by considered as a likely danger to humanity Specifically, four standard estimating models linear regression (LR), least total shrinkage and determination administrator (LASSO) Support vector Machine (SVM) have been utilized in this examination to figure the undermining components of COVID-19 Three sorts of expectations are made by every one of the models, for example, the quantity of recently tainted cases, the quantity of passing, and the quantity of recuperations But in the can't foresee the precise outcome for the patients To defeat the issue, Proposed strategy utilizing the exponential smoothing (ES) anticipate the quantity of COVID-19 cases in next 30 days ahead and impact of preventive estimates like social seclusion and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 ? 2021 Karadeniz Technical University All rights reserved","output":"COVID-19 future forecasting using supervised machine learning models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies, T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily and have pivotal roles in the immune system.

A market survey of telematics firms provided an overview of available data, and identified several candidate sources for location-based and engine-based telematics data on personal vehicles. Data were then purchased from three different vendors: StreetLight Data, Moonshadow Mobile, and Otonomo. These data were applied in case studies conducted in the Denver metro area, U.S., to assess strengths and weaknesses of telematics for developing emission inventories. Case studies included using telematics to estimate regional vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for annual emission inventories;tracking the VMT impacts of COVID shutdown;generating location- and time-specific vehicle activity inputs for project scale \\"hot spot\\" air quality analysis;and estimating the distribution of fuel fill level from real-world data, which is important for evaporative emissions. These case studies confirmed that telematics can serve a growing range of emission inventory use cases, and use of these data may help improve emission inventory accuracy. However, there are also several limitations of the data to consider in preparing emission inventories;for example, it can be difficult to assess the representativeness of telematics data because of a lack of vehicle information.

We aimed at evaluating the prognostic value of abnormal LFT on admission and during hospitalization of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study that included 298 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, between 05/2020 and 02/2021, in 6 hospitals from 5 countries in South America. We analyzed demographic and comorbid variables and laboratory tests on admission and during hospitalization. LFT over twice the upper limit of normal (ALEx2) were also evaluated in relation to a variety of factors on admission and during hospitalization. De novo-ALEx2 was defined as the presence of ALEx2 at one week of hospitalization in patients without ALEx2 on admission. Patients were followed until hospital discharge or death. Multivariable analysis was used to evaluate the association between ALEx2 on admission and during hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: Of the total of 298 patients, 60% were male, with a mean age of 60 years, and 74% of patients had at least one comorbidity. Of those, 137 (46%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit and 66 (22.1%) patients died during hospitalization. ALEx2 on admission was present in 87 (29.2%) patients and was found to be independently associated with 1-week mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 3.55; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.05C12.05). Moreover, 84 (39.8%) out of 211 patients without ALEx2 at admission developed de novo-ALEx2, which was independently associated with mortality during second week of hospitalization (OR = 6.09; 95%CI 1.28C29) and overall mortality (OR = 2.93, 95%CI 1.05C8.19). CONCLUSIONS: A moderate elevation of LFT during admission was associated with a poor short-term prognosis in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In addition, moderate elevation of LFT at one week of hospitalization was an independent risk factor for overall mortality in these patients.","output":"Abnormal Liver Tests during Hospitalization Predict Mortality in Patients with COVID-19: A Multicenter Study from South America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Early differentiation between emergency department (ED) patients with and without corona virus disease (COVID-19) is very important. Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. METHODS: In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a RT-PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. RESULTS: Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihood ratio (LR)+ 2.81 and LR- 0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score &#8805;3; n = 17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score &#8805;2; n = 137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative RT-PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. DISCUSSION: The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19.

Calcified clots are composed of large amounts of calcium phosphate which influences their mechanical properties and may serve as a model for testing this hypothesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recanalization and complication rates of calcified thromboemboli in patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent thrombectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of all calcified intracranial thromboemboli in patients suffering an acute ischemic stroke, referred for endovascular therapy at two centers between January 2013 and July 2016. RESULTS Eight patients with a calcified intracranial clot underwent stent retriever thrombectomy (five women; mean age 80 years). Mean clot attenuation was 305 HU (range 150-640 HU). Successful reperfusion defined, as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade 2b-3 was achieved in only one patient (12.5%). Two periprocedural adverse events occurred: one peripheral vessel perforation which was coiled and one inadvertent stent retriever detachment due to fracture of the stent retriever wire. CONCLUSION Stent retriever thrombectomy of calcified thromboemboli seems less effective than with other types of clots. Different mechanical properties of calcified clots may render them stiffer and less accessible for stent retrievers. When faced with a calcified intracranial thromboembolus in clinical practice, a more contained approach may be warranted in view of low recanalization rates, and the potential for periprocedural adverse events.","output":"Thrombectomy of calcified emboli in stroke.

Moreover, patients may refrain from PA given a perceived fear of SCD complications. OBJECTIVES: 1) Evaluate whether SCD children engage differently in PA compared to their peers. 2) Evaluate the cardiopulmonary impact of PA in a group of SCD patients. DESIGN/METHODS: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCD patients aged 8-17 years old consented to answer a PA questionnaire (PAQ) and have their school peers answer the same PAQ. PAQ, a well-described surrogate marker of PA, is a standardized questionnaire evaluating PA during the last 7 days. Patients and their peers were approached only during the school year. A set of HbSS patients were invited to participate in a supervised exercise test including pre- and post-effort PFT, echocardiography, EKG, measurement of troponins and NT-proBNP and a methacholine challenge to evaluate exercise-induced bronchial hyperreactivity. T-test was used as statistical analysis, using SPSS V24. The study received IRB approval. RESULTS: Questionnaires from 25 SCD children (13 SS and 12 SC) were compared with 36 matched-school peers. SCD patients were overall less active (p=0.04). While their level of activity was similar at school, SCD patients were overall less active after school (p=0.028), in the evening (p=0.008) and weekends (p=0.049). While the difference was significant for both SS and SC patients, SS were less active than SC, although this difference was statistically not significant. Five HbSS patients on HU were subjected to an exercise test. There were no statistical differences in the pre- and post-PA evaluations including measurements of troponin, NT-proBNP and functional testing. None of them had exercise-induced hyperreactivity. CONCLUSION: Overall, SCD patients are less active than their peers, mostly outside of school. The absence of cardiopulmonary modifications during PA is reassuring, although our study was limited to 5 HbSS patients on HU. Whether HU has a protective role cannot be excluded. Our results encourage us to further evaluate PA interventions outside of school in SCD patients.

We propose that antisense PMOs represent a promising class of therapeutic agents that may be useful for combating filoviral infections. We have previously shown that mice treated with a PMO whose sequence is complementary to a region spanning the start codon of VP24 mRNA were protected against lethal Ebola virus challenge. In the present study, we report on the abilities of two additional VP24-specific PMOs to reduce the cell-free translation of a VP24 reporter, to inhibit the in vitro replication of Ebola virus, and to protect mice against lethal challenge when the PMOs are delivered prior to infection. Additionally, structure-activity relationship evaluations were conducted to assess the enhancement of antiviral efficacy associated with PMO chemical modifications that included conjugation with peptides of various lengths and compositions, positioning of conjugated peptides to either the 5' or the 3' terminus, and the conferring of charge modifications by the addition of piperazine moieties.

A remote monitoring team, blinded to ECG-LW type, assessed frequency and type of alarm events by using total counts and rates per 100 patient days. Event rates were compared by using generalized linear mixed-effect models for differences and noninferiority between wire types. RESULTS In 1611 patients and 9385.5 patient days of ECG monitoring, patient characteristics were similar between groups. Rates of alarms for no telemetry, leads fail, or leads off were lower in disposable ECG-LWs (adjusted relative risk [95% CI], 0.71 [0.53-0.96]; noninferiority P < .001; superiority P = .03) and monitoring (artifact) alarms were significantly noninferior (adjusted relative risk [95% CI]: 0.88, [0.62-1.24], P = .02; superiority P = .44).

The main aim of this review is to highlight findings of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced neuroinflammatory signaling in brain parenchyma from the inflammasome perspective. In addition, we discuss the limited data of the contribution of inflammasomes to other aspects of migraine pathophysiology, foremost the activation of the trigeminovascular system and thereby the generation of migraine pain. MAIN BODY: Inflammasomes are signaling multiprotein complexes and key components of the innate immune system. Their activation causes the production of inflammatory cytokines that can stimulate trigeminal neurons and are thus relevant to the generation of migraine pain. The contribution of inflammasome activation to pain signaling has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is the best characterized inflammasome and there is emerging evidence of its role in a variety of inflammatory pain conditions, including migraine. In this review, we discuss, from an inflammasome point of view, cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced neuroinflammatory signaling in brain parenchyma, the connection with genetic factors that make the brain vulnerable to CSD, and the relation of the inflammasome with diseases that are co-morbid with migraine, including stroke, epilepsy, and the possible links with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Neuroinflammatory pathways, specifically those involving inflammasome proteins, seem promising candidates as treatment targets, and perhaps even biomarkers, in migraine.","output":"Migraine and neuroinflammation: the inflammasome perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relational algebra (RA) comprises a basis of important operations, sufficient to power state-of-the-art reasoning engines for Datalog and related logic-programming languages. Parallel RA implementations can thus play a significant role in extracting parallelism inherent in a wide variety of analytic problems. In general, bottom-up logical inference can be implemented as fixed-point iteration over RA kernels; relations dynamically accumulate new tuples of information according to a set of rules until no new tuples can be discovered from previously inferred tuples and relevant rules (RA kernels). While this strategy has been quite successful in single-node contexts, it poses unique challenges when distributed over many-node, networked clustersespecially regarding how the work-load is balanced across available compute resources. In this paper, we identify two fundamental kinds of load imbalance and present a strategy to address each. We investigate both spatial load imbalanceimbalance across each relation (across compute nodes)and temporal load imbalanceCimbalance in tuples produced across fixed-point iterations. For spatial balancing, we implement refinement and consolidation procedures. For temporal balancing, we implement a technique that permits the residual workload from a busy iteration to roll over to a new iteration. In sum, these techniques permit fully dynamic load-balancing of relational algebra that is robust to changes across time.","output":"Load-Balancing Parallel Relational Algebra"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper explores the grave issue for modern-day research of mass media communication C fake news.

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of nemolizumab in adolescents with moderate to severe AD as well as the relationship between nemolizumab concentrations and clinical efficacy and the effect of nemolizumab on protein biomarkers. METHODS: Open-label, 16-week study of nemolizumab in patients aged 12C17 years with moderate to severe AD (baseline EASI  16, IGA  3, and BSA  10%) and associated pruritus with baseline average daily peak pruritus numeric rating scale (PP-NRS) intensity of at least 4. Nemolizumab was administered subcutaneously as a loading dose of 60 mg at baseline, followed by 30 mg every 4 weeks until week 12 with background topical corticosteroids (TCS) or calcineurin inhibitors (TCI). Subsequently patients were followed for 8 weeks more. Stratum corneum (SC) and plasma samples were collected for biomarker assessments. RESULTS: Twenty patients participated, with a mean age of 14.8  1.6 years. The PK of nemolizumab was described by a one-compartment model with linear elimination, a first-order absorption, and a mean half-life of 16.7  4.1 days. Mean trough concentrations ranged from 2935  1029 ng/mL to 3292  2018 ng/mL over the 16-week treatment period. There was a marked improvement in rash, itch, and sleep with a decrease from baseline to week 16 in EASI by 66.5  32.5%, in PP-NRS by 43.2  37%, and in sleep disturbance numeric rating scale by 53.5  47.8%. The popPK and PK/PD analyses confirmed that model-predicted exposure and efficacy of nemolizumab were similar in adolescents compared to adults receiving the same dosing regimens. Age did not impact PK parameters, while the main source of PK variability was body weight. Analyses of SC samples identified a panel of AD-related pro-inflammatory biomarkers that were upregulated in lesional skin (compared to non-lesional skin) and correspondingly downregulated in clinical responders to nemolizumab (based on EASI75 and PP-NRS  4). Four biomarkers (CCL20, CCL22, CCL27, and VEGF) had changes that were 1.9C3.5-fold higher in EASI responders than in EASI non-responders (all p < 0.05). Analysis showed no significant correlation between plasma biomarkers and clinical scores. Adverse events were experienced by 33.3% of subjects (n = 6) and were primarily mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Nemolizumab PK and safety profiles in adolescents with moderate to severe AD are consistent with previous nemolizumab studies in adults. PK/PD models demonstrate similar exposureCresponse profiles in 12- to 17-year-old adolescents and adults for three clinical endpoints (EASI, IGA, and PP-NRS). Nemolizumab treatment reversed AD-related pro-inflammatory biomarkers in skin, indicating that the neuroimmune cytokine IL-31 is an important mediator of multiple pathways in AD.

How have different countries reacted to these troubling circumstances? What policies have been implemented to alleviate the pernicious effects of the pandemic on gender and labor inequalities? We examine the policies offered in Denmark, Germany, and the United States, three countries that represent distinct welfare regimes. We find important differences among the policy solutions provided, but also in the cultural infrastructures that allow policies to work as intended, or not. In Denmark, a social-democratic welfare state, robust federal salary guarantee programs supplemented an already strong social safety net. The country was among the first to lock down and reorganize health careand also among the first to reopen schools and child care facilities, acknowledging that parents employment depends on child care provisioning, especially for mothers. Germany, a corporatist regime, substantially expanded existing programs and provided generous subsidies. However, despite an ongoing official commitment to reduce gender inequality, the cultural legacy of a father breadwinner/mother caregiver family model meant that reopening child care facilities was not a first priority, which pushed many mothers out of paid work. In the U.S. liberal regime, private organizationsparticularly in privileged economic sectorsare the ones primarily offering supports to working parents. Patchwork efforts at lockdown and reopening have meant a lengthy period of limbo for working families, with disastrous consequences for women, especially the most vulnerable. Among such varied solutions to the consequences of the pandemic, those of liberal regimes seem to be worsening inequalities.

We analysed the clinical outcomes of patients with concurrent COVID-19 and malaria infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study that assessed prospectively collected data of all patients who were admitted between May and December 2020 to the Universal COVID-19 treatment center (UCTC), Khartoum, Sudan. UCTC compiled demographic, clinical, laboratory (including testing for malaria), and outcome data in all patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at that clinic. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during the hospital stay. We built proportional hazard Cox models with malaria status as the main exposure and stepwise adjustment for age, gender, cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, and hypertension. RESULTS: We included 591 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who were also tested for malaria. Mean (SD) age was 58 (16.2) years, 446/591 (75.5%) were males. Malaria was diagnosed in 270/591 (45.6%) patients. Most malaria patients were infected by Plasmodium falciparum (140/270; 51.9%), 121/270 (44.8%) were coinfected with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Median follow-up was 29 days.

Survivors of COVID-19 may be left with substantial functional deficits requiring ongoing care. We aimed to determine whether pre-admission frailty was associated with increased care needs at discharge for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients were included if aged over 18 years old and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 27 February and 10 June 2020. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used to assess pre-admission frailty status. Admission and discharge care levels were recorded. Data were analysed using a mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, and admission CRP as a marker of severity of disease. RESULTS: Thirteen hospitals included patients: 1671 patients were screened, and 840 were excluded including, 521 patients who died before discharge (31.1%). Of the 831 patients who were discharged, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 58C81 years) and 369 (44.4%) were women. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 6C24). Using the CFS, 438 (47.0%) were living with frailty ( CFS 5), and 193 (23.2%) required an increase in the level of care provided. Multivariable analysis showed that frailty was associated with an increase in care needs compared to patients without frailty (CFS 1C3). The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were as follows: CFS 4, 1.99 (0.97C4.11); CFS 5, 3.77 (1.94C7.32); CFS 6, 4.04 (2.09C7.82); CFS 7, 2.16 (1.12C4.20); and CFS 8, 3.19 (1.06C9.56).

In this region, An. stephensi was first detected in a livestock quarantine station near a major seaport in Djibouti in 2012, in Ethiopia in 2016, in Sudan in 2018 and Somalia in 2019. Anopheles stephensi often uses artificial containers as larval habitats, which may facilitate introduction through maritime trade as has been seen with other invasive container breeding mosquitoes. If An. stephensi is being introduced through maritime traffic, prioritization exercises are needed to identify locations at greatest risk of An. stephensi introduction for early detection and rapid response, limiting further invasion opportunities. Here, we use UNCTAD maritime trade data to 1) identify coastal African countries which were most highly connected to select An. stephensi endemic countries in 2011, prior to initial detection in Africa, 2) develop a ranked prioritization list of countries based on likelihood of An. stephensi introduction for 2016 and 2020 based on maritime trade alone and maritime trade and habitat suitability, and 3) use network analysis to describe intracontinental maritime trade and eigenvector centrality to determine likely paths of further introduction on the continent if An. stephensi is detected in a new location. Our results show that in 2011, Sudan and Djibouti were ranked as the top two countries with likelihood of An. stephensi introduction based on maritime trade alone, and these were indeed the first two coastal countries in the HoA where An. stephensi was detected. Trade data from 2020 with Djibouti and Sudan included as source populations identify Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Morocco as the top five countries with likelihood of An. stephensi introduction. When factoring in habitat suitability, Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Morocco, and Libya are ranked highest. Network analysis revealed that the countries with the highest eigenvector centrality scores, and therefore highest degrees of connectivity with other coastal African nations were South Africa (0.175), Mauritius (0.159), Ghana (0.159), Togo (0.157), and Morocco (0.044) and therefore detection of An. stephensi in any one of these locations has a higher potential to cascade further across the continent via maritime trade than those with lower eigenvector centrality scores. Taken together, these data could serve as tools to prioritize efforts for An. stephensi surveillance and control in Africa. Surveillance in seaports of countries at greatest risk of introduction may serve as an early warning system for the detection of An. stephensi, providing opportunities to limit further introduction and expansion of this invasive malaria vector in Africa.","output":"Using marine cargo traffic to identify countries in Africa with greatest risk of invasion by Anopheles stephensi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in the world The epidemic of the new coronavirus pneumonia has been preliminarily controlled successfully in China At this time, how to construct the clinical laboratory in the hospital?

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major pathogen of ARTIs in children. In this study, we aimed to investigate the epidemiology and genotypic diversity of HMPV in children hospitalized with ARTIs in Beijing, China. METHODS: Hospitalized children aged < 14 years with ARTIs were enrolled from April 2017 to March 2018; nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped based on a partial N gene. Whole genome sequences were determined for samples with high viral loads. RESULTS: 4.08% (52/1276) enrolled paediatric patients were identified as having HMPV infection. The epidemic season is winter and early spring, children aged  4 years were more susceptible to HMPV infection (47/52, 90.38%). The co-infection rate were 36.54% (19/52), the most common co-infected virus were influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. The main diagnoses of HMPV infection were pneumonia (29/52, 55.77%) and bronchitis (23/52, 44.23%), while the main clinical manifestations were cough, fever, rhinorrhoea, and sneeze. Among 48 HMPV-positive specimens, A2b (19/48, 39.58%) and B1 (26/48, 54.17%) were the main epidemic subtypes. Patients with HMPV genotype A infection had a higher viral load compared to genotype B patients (6.07 vs. 5.37 log(10) RNA copies/ml). Five complete sequences of HMPV were obtained. This is the first report of a whole genome sequence of HMPV-B1 isolated in China. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV is an important respiratory pathogen in paediatric patients. Cases of HMPV infection could burden hospitals in the epidemic season. HMPV viral loads and genotypes have no correlation with co-infection or clinical characteristics.","output":"Epidemiology and genotypic diversity of human metapneumovirus in paediatric patients with acute respiratory infection in Beijing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzes the specific linkages between symptoms within individual COVID patients belonging to at-risk groups.

Among the major groups of viruses, RNA viruses contribute significantly to the global mortality and morbidity index associated with viral infection. Despite multiple routes of entry adopted by these viruses, facing complement is inevitable. The initial interaction with complement and the nature of this interaction play an important role in determining host resistance versus susceptibility to the viral infection. Many RNA viruses are potent activators of complement, often resulting in virus neutralization. Yet, another facet of virus-induced activation is the exacerbation in pathogenesis contributing to the overall morbidity. The severity in disease and death associated with RNA virus infections shows a tip in the scale favoring viruses. Growing evidence suggest that like their DNA counterparts, RNA viruses have co-evolved to master ingenious strategies to remarkably restrict complement. Modulation of host genes involved in antiviral responses contributed prominently to the adoption of unique strategies to keep complement at bay, which included either down regulation of activation components (C3, C4) or up regulation of complement regulatory proteins. All this hints at a possible \\"hijacking\\" of the cross-talk mechanism of the host immune system.

The psychiatric status was assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the acute symptom burden and protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of 50 days following the diagnosis of COVID-19, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s), with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell/taste, headache and difficulty in concentration, being the most common symptoms reported. Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, perceived stigmatization, and a negative view on the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the presence of protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were also frequent in this period, and these were related to the posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity.

Almost overnight, providers of prenatal care adopted virtual visits and reduced visit schedules. These changes stood in stark contrast to the 12 to 14 in-person prenatal visit schedule that had been previously recommended for almost a century. As maternity care providers consider what prenatal care delivery changes we should maintain following the acute pandemic, we may gain insight from understanding the evolution of prenatal care delivery guidelines. In this paper, we start by sketching out the relatively unstructured beginnings of prenatal care in the 19th century. Most medical care fell within the domain of laypeople, and childbirth was a central feature of female domestic culture. We explore how early discoveries about \\"toxemia\\" created the groundwork for future prenatal care interventions, including screening of urine and blood pressure-which in turn created a need for routine prenatal care visits. We then discuss the organization of the medical profession, including the field of obstetrics and gynecology. In the early 20th century, new data increasingly revealed high rates of both infant and maternal mortalities, leading to a greater emphasis on prenatal care. These discoveries culminated in the first codification of a prenatal visit schedule in 1930 by the Children's Bureau. Surprisingly, this schedule remained essentially unchanged for almost a century. Through the founding of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, significant technological advancements in laboratory testing and ultrasonography, and calls of the National Institutes of Health Task Force for changes in prenatal care delivery in 1989, prenatal care recommendations continued to be the same as they had been in 1930-monthly visits until 28 weeks' gestation, bimonthly visits until 36 weeks' gestation, and weekly visits until delivery. However, coronavirus disease 2019 forced us to change, to reconsider both the need for in-person visits and frequency of visits. Currently, as we transition from the acute pandemic, we should consider how to use what we have learned in this unprecedented time to shape future prenatal care. Lessons from a century of prenatal care provide valuable insights to inform the next generation of prenatal care delivery.","output":"The evolution of prenatal care delivery guidelines in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tetracyclines (TetraC) are widely used in dermatology for both inflammatory and infectious dermatoses; recently both in vivo and in vitro studies started to suggest also a potential antiviral effect.

METHODS Using data from the randomized controlled SENTIS trial, we explored outcomes of cerebral blood flow augmentation using the NeuroFlo? device in patients categorized by age strata at 70 and 80 years. We evaluated outcomes of overall serious adverse event (SAE) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) rates, freedom from all-cause and stroke-related mortality, and independent functional outcome as defined by the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS 2).

Functional community structure between these monodominant and mixed forests has, however, not yet been compared. Additionally, little is known about nondominant species in the monodominant forest community. These two topics are addressed in this study. We investigate the functional community structure of 10 one\\\\hectare plots of monodominant and mixed forests in a central region of the Congo basin, in DR Congo. Thirteen leaf and wood traits are measured, covering 95% (basal area weighted) of all species present in the plots, including leaf nutrient contents, leaf isotopic compositions, specific leaf area, wood density, and vessel anatomy. The trait\\\\based assessment of G. dewevrei shows an ensemble of traits related to water use and transport that could be favorable for its location near forest rivers.

The decreased workload is a risk factor for burnout as important as increased workload and repeated exposure to COVID\\\\19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Burnout prevention and treatment interventions must target the correct risk factors and identify nurses at risk to be cost\\\\effective.","output":"Determinants of the risk of burnout among nurses during the first wave of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Belgium: A cross\\\\sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been believed to originate in China and spread later to other parts of the world. It is well acknowledged that the first diseased individuals appeared in China as early as in December 2019, and possibly even earlier in November. It has also been well established that the virus stroke Italy later in January or in February 2020, distinctly after the outbreak in China. Paper by Apolone et al. published in a local Italian medical journal in November 2020 however exposed this chronology to doubt. By fitting early part of the epidemic curve with the exponential model and extrapolating it backwards in time, we could estimate the day-zero of the epidemic and calculated its confidence intervals in Italy and China. We also calculated how probable it is that Italy encountered the virus prior 1 January 2020. We determined an early portion of the epidemic curve representing unhindered exponential growth which fit the exponential model with high determination >0.97 in both countries. We suggest that the day-zero in China and Italy was 8 December (95% CI: 3 Dec., 20 Dec.) and 22 January (95% CI: 16 Jan., 29 Jan.), respectively. We could with high confidence reject that Italy encountered the virus earlier than China (p <0.01).

We present further analyses from this study by body mass index (BMI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Safety and effectiveness were assessed across BMI subgroups (<25, 25 to <30, and 30 kg/m2). RESULTS: Data were available for 876, 566, and 201 patients in the BMI subgroups, respectively. Incidence of adverse drug reactions [ADR] with linagliptin was 11.42%, 11.31%, 10.45%, respectively. The most common ADR of special interest was hepatic disorders (n [%]: 6 [0.68], 7 [1.24] and 3 [1.49], respectively). Additional use of glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) increased with BMI (15.0%, 19.1%, 24.4% of patients; P < 0.001). In the overall population, a sustained decrease in HbA1c was observed in all BMI subgroups. In patients receiving linagliptin with no additional GLDs, changes in HbA1c were -0.58%0.04, -0.62%0.04, and -0.77%0.11. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of linagliptin in Japanese patients with T2D, across BMI subgroups no new safety concerns were observed.

For serodiagnosis of echinococcosis, especially cystic disease, most screening tests rely on crude or purified Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid. To resolve limitations associated with native antigens in serological tests, the use of standardized and highly pure antigens produced by chemical synthesis offers considerable advantages, provided appropriate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is achieved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Making use of the growing collection of genomic and proteomic data, we applied a set of bioinformatic selection criteria to a collection of protein sequences including conceptually translated nucleotide sequence data of two related tapeworms, Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus. Our approach targeted alpha-helical coiled-coils and intrinsically unstructured regions of parasite proteins potentially exposed to the host immune system. From 6 proteins of E. multilocularis and 5 proteins of E. granulosus, 45 peptides between 24 and 30 amino acids in length were designed. These peptides were chemically synthesized, spotted on microarrays and screened for reactivity with sera from infected humans. Peptides reacting above the cut-off were validated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Peptides identified failed to differentiate between E. multilocularis and E. granulosus infection. The peptide performing best reached 57% sensitivity and 94% specificity. This candidate derived from Echinococcus multilocularis antigen B8/1 and showed strong reactivity to sera from patients infected either with E. multilocularis or E. granulosus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides proof of principle for the discovery of diagnostically relevant peptides by bioinformatic selection complemented with screening on a high-throughput microarray platform. Our data showed that a single peptide cannot provide sufficient diagnostic sensitivity whereas pooling several peptide antigens improved sensitivity; thus combinations of several peptides may lead the way to new diagnostic tests that replace, or at least complement conventional immunodiagnosis of echinococcosis. Our strategy could prove useful for diagnostic developments in other pathogens.","output":"Serodiagnosis of Echinococcus spp. Infection: Explorative Selection of Diagnostic Antigens by Peptide Microarray"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Thus far, MERS outbreaks have been reported from Saudi Arabia (2013 and 2014) and South Korea (2015). No specific vaccine has yet been reported against MERS. PURPOSE: To address the urgent need for an MERS vaccine, in the present study, we have designed two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) against MERS utilizing several in silico methods and tools. METHODS: The design of both the multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) are composed of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, screened form thirteen different proteins of MERS-CoV. Both the MEVs also carry potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes as well as interferon--inducing epitopes. Human -defensin-2 and -defensin-3 were used as adjuvants to enhance the immune response of MEVs. To design the MEVs, short peptide molecular linkers were utilized to link screened most potential CTL epitopes, HTL epitopes and the adjuvants. Tertiary models for both the MEVs were generated, refined, and further studied for their molecular interaction with toll-like receptor 3. The cDNAs of both MEVs were generated and analyzed in silico for their expression in a mammalian host cell line (human). RESULTS: Screened CTL and HTL epitopes were found to have high propensity for stable molecular interaction with HLA alleles molecules. CTL epitopes were also found to have favorable molecular interaction within the cavity of transporter associated with antigen processing. The selected CTL and HTL epitopes jointly cover upto 94.0% of worldwide human population. Both the CTL and HTL MEVs molecular models have shown to have stable binding and complex formation propensity with toll-like receptor 3. The cDNA analysis of both the MEVs have shown high expression tendency in mammalian host cell line (human). CONCLUSION: After multistage in silico analysis, both the MEVs are predicted to elicit humoral as well as cell mediated immune response. Epitopes of the designed MEVs are predicted to cover large human population worldwide. Hence both the designed MEVs could be tried in vivo as potential vaccine candidates against MERS.","output":"Structural basis of development of multi-epitope vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome using in silico approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging Various cutaneous manifestations have been observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet exacerbations of psoriasis have been reported sporadically Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH) is an uncommon, sterile pustular dermatosis involving one or more digits In some rare cases, ACH may evolve into generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), which is a severe, and potentially life-threatening, form of psoriasis that manifests itself with widespread eruptions of pustules We describe the first case of a patient in whom ACH abruptly progressed into GPP during COVID-19 A combination of infliximab and acitretin was used allowing swift clinical improvement","output":"Acrodermatitis Continua of Hallopeau Evolving into Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Following COVID-19: A Case Report of a Successful Treatment with Infliximab in Combination with Acitretin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The potential financial burden of American football-related concussions (FRC) is unknown.

DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Twelve IDP camps across six areas of the Lower Shabelle region in Somalia. PARTICIPANTS: 401 adult Somali IDP camp residents. RESULTS: The majority of participants were female (86%) and had received no formal education (89%). While 58% reported being in good health, half of the participants reported having one or more pre-existing conditions. Though 77% of respondents reported taking at least one COVID-19 preventative public health measure, respondents reported a lack of access to adequate sanitation, an inability to practice social distancing and nearly universal inability to receive a COVID-19 screening exam. Questions assessing knowledge surrounding COVID-19 prevention and treatment yielded answers of I dont know for roughly 50% of responses. The majority of participants were not familiar with basic information about the virus or confident that they could receive medical services if infected. 185 (47%) respondents indicated that camp living conditions needed to change to prevent the spread of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study highlights low levels of COVID-19 knowledge and limited access to essential prevention and treatment resources among individuals living in Somali IDP camps.

High intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to enhance connectivity between basal ganglia nuclei and cortical areas, including the SMA. The aim of this project was to determine the effects of high intensity lower extremity exercise on motor control patterns underlying a manual dexterity task. METHODS PD participants completed eight weeks of high intensity aerobic exercise under forced or voluntary exercise (FE or VE) modalities. Grasping forces for each limb were quantified during a functional bimanual dexterity task. Data were collected while OFF antiparkinsonian medication at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and eight weeks after exercise cessation (EOT+8). RESULTS Eight weeks of high intensity exercise improved MDS-UPDRS Motor III clinical ratings by more than 4 points (~15%) for the FE and VE groups. Time to complete the task decreased nearly 30% across both groups as well. The control and coordination of grasping forces, simultaneity of force initiation, and rate of grip and load force exhibited significant improvements following exercise. In general, improvements in biomechanical outcomes were sustained following exercise cessation. CONCLUSION High intensity aerobic exercise, achieved via a forced or voluntary mode, improved PD symptoms and bimanual dexterity. Sustained improvement of upper extremity motor control following exercise cessation indicates high intensity exercise enhances CNS functioning and suggests exercise may be a candidate for altering PD progression.","output":"High intensity aerobic exercise improves bimanual coordination of grasping forces in Parkinson's disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare facility-onset Clostridioides difficile infection rates substantially dropped in a Mexican hospital after its conversion to a full COVID-19 setting, despite heavy contamination of the environment the previous year.

Approach and Results: Medical records of 616 pneumonia patients who were admitted to the Yichang Central People's Hospital in Hubei, China, from January 1 to March 23, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated in the dedicated COVID-19 units, and the patients with CAP were admitted to regular hospital campus. Risks of VTE were assessed using the Padua prediction score. All the patients received pharmaceutical or mechanical VTE prophylaxis. VTE was diagnosed using Duplex ultrasound or computed tomography pulmonary angiogram. Differences between COVID-19 and CAP groups were compared statistically. All statistical tests were 2 sided, and P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data managements and analyses were performed by IBM SPSS, version 24, software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Of the 616 patients, 256 had COVID-19 pneumonia and 360 patients had CAP. The overall rate of VTE was 2% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 3.6% in CAP group, respectively (P=0.229). In these two groups, 15.6% of the COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 10% of the CAP patients were categorized as high risk for VTE (Padua score, >4), which were significantly different (P=0.036). In those high-risk patients, the incidence of VTE was 12.5% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 16.7% in CAP group (P=0.606). Subgroup analysis of the critically ill patients showed that VTE rate was 6.7% in COVID-19 group versus 13% in CAP group (P=0.484). In-hospital mortality of COVID-19 and CAP was 6.3% and 3.9%, respectively (P=0.180). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with hypercoagulable state.

The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune response is complex because it is regulated by various processes taking part at the intracellular, tissue, and host levels. To gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19, we formulate a multiscale model that integrate the main mechanisms which regulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 across multiple scales. The model describes the effect of type I interferon on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside cells. At the tissue level, we simulate the interactions between infected cells and immune cells using a hybrid agent-based representation. At the same time, we model the dynamics of virus spread and adaptive immune response in the host organism. After model validation, we demonstrate that a moderately weak inhibition of virus replication by type I IFN could elicit a strong adaptive immune response which accelerates the clearance of the virus.

With the immediate need for remote care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care systems have rapidly incorporated digital technologies to support the delivery of remote care options, including medication treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). In responding to the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and scientific communities strongly support and advocate for greater use of TM-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to improve access to care and have suggested that broad use of TM during the pandemic should be sustained. Nevertheless, research on the implementation and effectiveness of TM-based MOUD has been limited. To address this knowledge gap, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) funded (via the NIH HEAL Initiative) a study on Rural Expansion of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (Rural MOUD; CTN-0102) to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of adding TM-based MOUD to rural primary care for expanding access to MOUD. In preparation for this large-scale, randomized controlled trial incorporating TM in rural primary care, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop and pilot test implementation procedures. In this commentary, we share some of our experiences, which include several challenges, during the initial two-month period of the feasibility study phase. While these challenges could be due, at least in part, to adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic and new workflows to accommodate the study, they are notable and could have a substantial impact on the larger, planned pragmatic trial and on TM-based MOUD more broadly. Challenges include low rates of identification of risk for OUD from screening, low rates of referral to TM, digital device and internet access issues, workflow and capacity barriers, and insurance coverage. These challenges also highlight the lack of empirical guidance for best TM practice and quality remote care models. With TM expanding rapidly, understanding implementation and demonstrating what TM approaches are effective are critical for ensuring the best care for persons with OUD.","output":"Is telemedicine the answer to rural expansion of medication treatment for opioid use disorder?

Our objective was to precisely quantify the effects modified or mediated by PA and SB using the recently developed four-way effect decomposition. METHODS Our analysis included 22,117 adults (aged20 years) participating in the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Moderate recreational activity (MRA), moderate work activity (MWA), and walk or bicycle for transportation, were measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). A four-way decomposition was applied with PA and SB as mediator to decompose the total effects of CVDs on depression into four components: controlled direct effect (CDE), pure indirect effect (PIE), reference interaction (INTref), and mediated interaction effect (INTmed). RESULTS There were statistically significant associations between CVDs, MRA, and depression, with the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of being 1.73 (1.42~2.30), 1.81 (1.42~2.30), respectively. With MRA as a mediator, there were interaction and mediation effects in the associations between CVDs and depression, and the proportions attributable of INTref, INTmed, and PIE were 94.08% (P<0.001), 3.92% (P = 0.007), and 1.68% (P = 0.006), respectively. Furthermore, the mediation effect was statistically significant in females rather than males. CONCLUSIONS MRA strongly modified and mediated the effects of CVDs on depression, especially in females. Our results suggested that sufficient MRA (at least 150 min per week) was considered as requirement for preventing depression in CVDs patients in females.","output":"The effects of physical activity and sedentary behavior in the associations between cardiovascular diseases and depression: A four-way decomposition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the daily abnormal stock price returns of a sample of 154 publicly-traded hospitality firms from 23 different countries representing over $400 billion in combined market capitalization around the time that COVID-19 was first viewed by stock market participants as a majorpossibly even existentialthreat.

In this paper, we look at these different impacts and the norms related to the use of biological weapons and cyber campaigns. By doing so, we anticipate the advent of a combined cyber and biological warfare.

Patients and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies reporting clinical data about COVID-19 patients, published until 25th March 2020. The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 patients complaining of GI symptoms. Secondary endpoints were the pooled prevalence of cases with COVID-19 positive stool samples, and of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We used random-effects model for meta-analysis. Results: Thirty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis. Out of 4434 COVID-19 patients, the pooled prevalence of GI manifestations was 11.51% (95% CI : 8.16 to 15.35). The most frequent GI symptom was diarrhea (7.78% of cases ; 95% CI : 5.05 to 11.04), followed by nausea/vomiting (3.57% ; 95% CI : 1.87 to 5.80), poor appetite (2.39% ; 95%CI : 0.55 ; 5.46) and abdominal pain (0.78% ; 95% CI : 0.26 to 1.57).

The spread of these infections and the epidemiological imperative to describe variation across the virus genome have highlighted the importance of sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) are designed to detect viral nucleocapsid protein with positive results suggestive of the presence of replicating virus and potential infectivity. In this study, we developed a protocol for recovering SARS-CoV-2 RNA from spent RADT devices of sufficient quality that can be used directly for whole virus genome sequencing. The experimental protocol included the spiking of RADTs at different concentrations with viable SARS-CoV-2 variant Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7), lysis for direct use or storage. The lysed suspensions were used for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. In parallel, we also tested the stability of the viral RNA in the RADTs and the RNA extracted from the RADTs was used as a template for tiling-PCR and whole virus genome sequencing. RNA recovered from RADTs spiked with SARS-CoV-2 was detected through RT-qPCR with C(t) values suitable for sequencing and the recovery from RADTs was confirmed after 7 days of storage at both 4 and 20C. The genomic sequences obtained at each time-point aligned to the strain used for the spiking, demonstrating that sufficient SARS-CoV-2 viral genome can be readily recovered from positive-RADT devices in which the virus has been safely inactivated and genomically conserved. This protocol was applied to obtain whole virus genome sequence from RADTs ran in the field where the omicron variant was detected. The study demonstrated that viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 suitable for whole virus genome sequencing can be recovered from positive spent RADTs, extending their diagnostic utility, as a risk management tool and for epidemiology studies. In large deployment of the RADTs, positive devices could be safely stored and used as a template for sequencing allowing the rapid identification of circulating variants and to trace the source and spread of outbreaks within communities and guaranteeing public health.","output":"Inactivation and Recovery of High Quality RNA From Positive SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Tests Suitable for Whole Virus Genome Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is spreading almost all over the world at present, which is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Despite the scientific evidence, there is still a sustained debate and concern about the efficacy of antidepressants, with widely differing opinions among the population about their positive and negative effects, which may condition peoples attitudes towards such treatments. Our aim is to investigate Twitter posts about antidepressants in order to have a better understanding of the social consideration of antidepressants. Methods: We gathered public tweets mentioning antidepressants written in English, published throughout a 22-month period, between 1 January 2019 and 31 October 2020. We analysed the content of each tweet, determining in the first place whether they included medical aspects or not. Those with medical content were classified into four categories: general aspects, such as quality of life or mood, sleep-related conditions, appetite/weight issues and aspects around somatic alterations. In non-medical tweets, we distinguished three categories: commercial nature (including all economic activity, drug promotion, education or outreach), help request/offer, and drug trivialization. In addition, users were arranged into three categories according to their nature: patients and relatives, caregivers, and interactions between Twitter users. Finally, we identified the most mentioned antidepressants, including the number of retweets and likes, which allowed us to measure the impact among Twitter users. Results: The activity in Twitter concerning antidepressants is mainly focused on the effects these drugs may have on certain health-related areas, specifically sleep (20.87%) and appetite/weight (8.95%). Patients and relatives are the type of user that most frequently posts tweets with medical content (65.2%, specifically 80% when referencing sleep and 78.6% in the case of appetite/weight), whereas they are responsible for only 2.9% of tweets with non-medical content. Among tweets classified as non-medical in this study, the most common subject was drug trivialization (66.86%). Caregivers barely have any presence in conversations in Twitter about antidepressants (3.5%). However, their tweets rose more interest among other users, with a ratio 11.93 times higher than those posted by patients and their friends and family. Mirtazapine is the most mentioned antidepressant in Twitter (45.43%), with a significant difference with the rest, agomelatine (11.11%). Conclusions: This study shows that Twitter users that take antidepressants, or their friends and family, use social media to share medical information about antidepressants. However, other users that do not talk about antidepressants from a personal or close experience, frequently do so in a stigmatizing manner, by trivializing them.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate these trends using real-world data from a national cohort database in South Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the National Health Insurance Service database, we collected and analyzed data for critically ill adult patients with ARDS who were admitted to intensive care units in South Korea between 2010 and 2019. RESULTS: The final analysis included 25431 patients with ARDS. The 30-, 90-, and 365-day mortality rates in 2010 were 43.8%, 56.5%, and 68.2%, respectively. These rates had gradually decreased to 36.6%, 50.2%, and 58.8%, respectively, by 2019. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for patients with ARDS started in 2014 at a rate of 5.1% (118/2309), which gradually increased to 8.3% (213/2568) by 2019. The rate of neuromuscular blockade treatment gradually increased from 22.6% (626/2771) in 2010 to 30.9% (793/2568) in 2019. The renal replacement therapy rate gradually increased from 5.7% (157/2771) in 2010 to 12.0% (307/2568) in 2019.

METHODS: We systemically collected and analyzed data from the Korea TB cohort database from January to May 2020. Groups were categorized as before-pandemic and during-pandemic based on TB notification period. Presentation delay was defined as the period between initial onset of symptoms and the first hospital visit, and healthcare delay as the period between the first hospital visit and anti-TB treatment initiation. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with delays in TB treatment. RESULTS: Proportion of presentation delay > 14 days was not significantly different between two groups (48.3% vs. 43.7%, P = 0.067); however, proportion of healthcare delay > 5 days was significantly higher in the during-pandemic group (48.6% vs. 42.3%, P = 0.012).

Biochemical markers may help with management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients; however, their utility is still under investigation. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate, and high sensitivity troponin T (TnT) levels in 67 patients who were admitted to a Canadian tertiary care centre for management of COVID-19. Logistic, cause-specific Cox proportional-hazards, and accelerated failure time regression modelling were performed to assess the associations of initial analyte concentrations with in-hospital death and length of stay in hospital; joint modelling was performed to assess the associations of the concentrations over the course of the hospital stay with in-hospital death. RESULTS: Initial TnT and CRP concentrations were associated with length of stay in hospital. Eighteen patients died (27%), and the median initial TnT concentration was higher in patients who died (55 ng/L) than those who lived (16 ng/L; P < 0.0001). There were no survivors with an initial TnT concentration > 64 ng/L. While the initial TnT concentration was predictive of death, later measurements were not. Only CRP had prognostic value with both the initial and subsequent measurements: a 20% increase in the initial CRP concentration was associated with a 14% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1-29%) increase in the odds of death, and the hazard of death increased 14% (95% CI: 5-25%) for each 20% increase in the current CRP value. While the initial lactate concentration was not predictive of death, subsequent measurements were.

Insights into AKI mechanisms may be provided by analyzing the temporal associations of clinical parameters reflecting disease processes and AKI development. METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of 223 consecutive COVID-19 patients treated at 3 sites of a tertiary care referral center to describe the evolvement of severe AKI (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 3) and identify conditions promoting its development. Descriptive statistics and explanatory multivariable Cox regression modeling with clinical parameters as time-varying covariates were used to identify risk factors of severe AKI. RESULTS: Severe AKI developed in 70 of 223 patients (31%) with COVID-19, of which 95.7% required kidney replacement therapy. Patients with severe AKI were older, predominantly male, had more comorbidities, and displayed excess mortality. Severe AKI occurred exclusively in intensive care unit patients, and 97.3% of the patients developing severe AKI had respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and inflammatory markers (serum procalcitonin levels and leucocyte count) were independent time-varying risk factors of severe AKI. Increasing inflammatory markers displayed a close temporal association with the development of severe AKI. Sensitivity analysis on risk factors of AKI stage 2 and 3 combined confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Severe AKI in COVID-19 was tightly coupled with critical illness and systemic inflammation and was not observed in milder disease courses. These findings suggest that traditional systemic AKI mechanisms rather than kidney-specific processes contribute to severe AKI in COVID-19.","output":"Critical Illness and Systemic Inflammation Are Key Risk Factors of Severe Acute Kidney Injury in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concomitance of a migratory wave and the hospital crisis once again raises the question of the care that the French healthcare system is able to provide to migrants.

The identity of the cell lineages that underpin the infection-associated loss of olfaction could be critical for the clinical management of 2019-nCoV-infected individuals. Recent research has confirmed the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as key host-specific cellular moieties responsible for the cellular entry of the virus. Accordingly, the ongoing medical examinations and the autopsy reports of the deceased individuals indicate that organs/tissues with high expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other putative viral entry-associated genes are most vulnerable to the infection. We studied if anosmia in 2019-nCoV-infected individuals can be explained by the expression patterns associated with these host-specific moieties across the known olfactory epithelial cell types, identified from a recently published single-cell expression study. Our findings underscore selective expression of these viral entry-associated genes in a subset of sustentacular cells (SUSs), Bowmans gland cells (BGCs) and stem cells of the olfactory epithelium. Co-expression analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and proteinCprotein interaction among the host and viral proteins elected regulatory cytoskeleton protein-enriched SUSs as the most vulnerable cell type of the olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, expression, structural and docking analyses of ACE2 revealed the potential risk of olfactory dysfunction in four additional mammalian species, revealing an evolutionarily conserved infection susceptibility.

Using an image-based high-content screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that selectively disrupted the processing and accumulation of IAV glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Selective disruption of IAV glycoprotein processing and accumulation by 6-TG and 6-TGo correlated with unfolded protein response (UPR) activation and HA accumulation could be partially restored by the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA). Chemical inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) restored accumulation of NA monomers in the presence of 6-TG or 6-TGo, but did not restore NA glycosylation or oligomerization. Thiopurines inhibited replication of the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), which also correlated with UPR/ISR activation and diminished accumulation of ORF1ab and nucleocapsid (N) mRNAs and N protein, which suggests broader disruption of coronavirus gene expression in ER-derived cytoplasmic compartments. The chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) had little effect on the UPR and did not affect IAV or HCoV-OC43 replication. Consistent with reports on other CoV Spike (S) proteins, ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused UPR activation. 6-TG treatment inhibited accumulation of full length S0 or furin-cleaved S2 fusion proteins, but spared the S1 ectodomain. DBeQ, which inhibits the p97 AAA-ATPase required for retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins during ER-associated degradation (ERAD) restored accumulation of S0 and S2 proteins in the presence of 6-TG, suggesting that 6-TG induced UPR accelerates ERAD-mediated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 glycoproteins. Taken together, these data indicate that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective host-targeted antivirals that trigger the UPR and disrupt accumulation of viral glycoproteins. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of these thiopurines in limiting IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication in cell culture models. IMPORTANCE Secreted and transmembrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are folded and modified prior to transport. During infection, many viruses burden the ER with the task of creating and processing viral glycoproteins that will ultimately be incorporated into viral envelopes. Some viruses refashion the ER into replication compartments where viral gene expression and genome replication take place. This viral burden on the ER can trigger the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to increase the protein folding and processing capacity of the ER to match the protein load. Much remains to be learned about how viruses co-opt the UPR to ensure efficient synthesis of viral glycoproteins. Here, we show that two FDA-approved thiopurine drugs, 6-TG and 6-TGo, induce the UPR in a manner that impedes viral glycoprotein accumulation for enveloped influenza viruses and coronaviruses. These drugs may impede the replication of viruses that require precise tuning of the UPR to support viral glycoprotein synthesis for the successful completion of a replication cycle.","output":"Thiopurines activate an antiviral unfolded protein response that blocks viral glycoprotein accumulation in cell culture infection model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) initially most appreciated for its pulmonary symptoms, is now increasingly recognized for causing multi-organ disease and stroke in the setting of a hypercoagulable state.

Mechanical thrombectomy was challenging and ultimately unsuccessful resulting in limited reperfusion of <67% of the affected vascular territory, and thrombectomized clot was over 50 mm in length, at least three times the average clot length. The final stroke size was estimated at 224 cubic centimeters. On admission her D-dimer level was 94,589 ng/mL (normal 0-500 ng/ml).

METHODS: Single-center cross-sectional study of 126 consecutive patients with IgA nephropathy. Health literacy was assessed using the HLS-EU-47 questionnaire. Determinants of vaccine acceptance such as contextual influences, individual and group influences, and vaccine-specific issues were adapted from the World Health Organization framework. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (38.1%) with IgAN nephropathy completed the survey between June and August 2021. The participants' median age was 40.5 (31.6, 52.8) years with median disease duration of 2.8 (1.3, 4.3) years. The median general health literacy index was 31.74 (29.88, 35.82) with significantly greater difficulty in the competency of appraising health information and in the domain of disease prevention (p < 0.001).

According to the May 2021 American Perspectives Survey, Americans report having fewer close friendships than they once did, talking to their friends less often, and relying less on their friends for personal support1. Additionally, 49% have three or fewer close friends in 2021, compared to 27% in 1990. 17% have no friends in their core social network. Loneliness has been associated with physical and mental health risks. We sought to explore whether loneliness was also a barrier to seeking mental health services. 90 surveys were collected from rural New York. Respondents were aged 51 to 90, Caucasian (96.6%), and female (73.3% vs, 26.7%). Overall, 34.8% said they lived alone. 29.2% would seek mental health services for feelings of loneliness, while 75.4% would do so if isolated from family. Those who felt detached or isolated from others were significantly less likely to seek help from a counselor (r = - 0.25) or MD (r = - 0.37). Isolation also negatively related to measures on the resiliency scale (Purpose: - 0.22, Perseverance: - 0.33, being ok alone: - 0.32), and positively related to depression (r = .65). Those scoring higher on the okay with being alone scale had an increased likelihood of seeking counseling (r = 0.22). Thus, isolation and loneliness are complex topics.

SARS-CoV is not closely related to other coronaviruses but shares a similar genome organization. Entry of coronaviruses into target cells is mediated by the viral S protein. We functionally analyzed SARS-CoV S using pseudotyped lentiviral particles (pseudotypes). The SARS-CoV S protein was found to be expressed at the cell surface upon transient transfection. Coexpression of SARS-CoV S with human immunodeficiency virus-based reporter constructs yielded viruses that were infectious for a range of cell lines. Most notably, viral pseudotypes harboring SARS-CoV S infected hepatoma cell lines but not T- and B-cell lines. Infection of the hepatoma cell line Huh-7 was also observed with replication-competent SARS-CoV, indicating that hepatocytes might be targeted by SARS-CoV in vivo. Inhibition of vacuolar acidification impaired infection by SARS-CoV S-bearing pseudotypes, indicating that S-mediated entry requires low pH. Finally, infection by SARS-CoV S pseudotypes but not by vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotypes was efficiently inhibited by a rabbit serum raised against SARS-CoV particles and by sera from SARS patients, demonstrating that SARS-CoV S is a target for neutralizing antibodies and that such antibodies are generated in SARS-CoV-infected patients. Our results show that viral pseudotyping can be employed for the analysis of SARS-CoV S function. Moreover, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV infection might not be limited to lung tissue and can be inhibited by the humoral immune response in infected patients.","output":"S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus mediates entry into hepatoma cell lines and is targeted by neutralizing antibodies in infected patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alzheimers disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disorder primarily affecting the elderly.

Thus, there is an increasing need for staff who can manipulate the ventilator appropriately. There is a need for a support system that will enable the operator to manipulate the equipment appropriately for the situation, especially when an alarm happens. Methods: The operators behavior during the ventilator alarm was video-recorded. The verbal protocol data were also recorded to examine the thinking during the manipulation. After the experiment, the video recordings were reviewed with the participants and interviewed about the reasons for their speeches and behaviors. Results: As a result of behavioral analysis of each participant, behavioral patterns split into Skilled Group (SG) and Inexperienced Group (IG) around about 17 s after the alarm happened. From the verbal protocol data and interview data obtained from the experiment, the reasons why the behaviors divided into two groups were analyzed. Based on these results, the cognitive reasons behind the behavior were clarified. In addition, a cognitive model of the operators when a ventilator alarm happens was built.

However, the traditional approach of the percolation process can be inefficient when analysing a large-scale, dynamic network for an extended period. Not only is it time-consuming but it is also hard to identify the connected components. Recent studies demonstrate that spatial containers restrict mobility behaviour, described by a hierarchical topology of mobility networks. Here, we leverage crowd-sourced, large-scale human mobility data to construct temporal hierarchical networks composed of over 175 000 block groups in the USA. Each daily network contains mobility between block groups within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and long-distance travels across the MSAs. We examine percolation on both levels and demonstrate the changes of network metrics and the connected components under the influence of COVID-19. The research reveals the presence of functional subunits even with high thresholds of mobility. Finally, we locate a set of recurrent critical links that divide components resulting in the separation of core MSAs. Our findings provide novel insights into understanding the dynamical community structure of mobility networks during disruptions and could contribute to more effective infectious disease control at multiple scales.

RESULTS: Utilization of available CCP collections capacity followed increases in COVID\\\\19 hospital discharges with a lag. Utilization never exceeded 75% of available capacity in most simulations. Demand was met for most of the simulation period in most simulations, but a substantial portion of demand went unmet during early, sharp increases in hospitalizations. For epidemic trajectories that included multiple epidemic peaks, second wave demand could generally be met due to stockpiles established during the decline from an earlier peak. Apheresis machine capacity (number of machines) and probability that COVID\\\\19 recovered individuals are willing to donate were the most important supply\\\\side drivers of ability to meet demand.

Findings indicated that, while efficiency is well supported, diversity, adaptability, and cohesion can be enhanced. The existing rating system provides a strong base upon which improvements can be made, but falls short of adequately encouraging the wide adoption of resilience needed for long-term sustainability.

This study aims to provide a non-invasive modality that can be used to predict the response of SRNS children to CPA therapy. Subsequently, the proteinuria duration was shortened to reduce the risk of glomerular damage. The present study aims to determine whether there is a correlation between baseline serum TGFB and proteinuria in SRNS children six months after receiving CPA treatment. The author hypothesized that there would be a negative correlation between those variables. METHOD: A prospective-cohort-study was conducted at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung, Indonesia. A total of 88 SRNS children, aged 1 to 18 were accessed for serum TGF- level before receiving CPA therapy for six months, and clinical signs were observed. Furthermore, after six months of CPA treatment, the subjects were divided into CPA responder and non-responder based on the presence of proteinuria, then the data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression to adjust age and gender. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant relationship between TGF- and the risk of non-response to CPA therapy, after accounting for age, gender, baseline GFR, baseline ureum, and baseline urinary protein, the adjusted-OR was 1.051 (95% CI 1.007, 1.097, p = 0.022).

METHODS: We conducted this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study, collecting data from eight ICUs in Japan. Patients aged  20 years with orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 h, and those who received SLT due to PED, defined as patients with modified water swallowing test scores of 3 or lower, were included. The primary outcome was dysphagia at hospital discharge, defined as functional oral intake scale score < 5 or death after extubation. Secondary outcomes included dysphagia or death at the seventh, 14th, or 28th day after extubation, aspiration pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality. Associations between the timing of SLT initiation and outcomes were determined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 272 patients were included. Of them, 82 (30.1%) patients exhibited dysphagia or death at hospital discharge, and their time spans from extubation to SLT initiation were 1.0 days. The primary outcome revealed that every day of delay in SLT initiation post-extubation was associated with dysphagia or death at hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02C1.18). Similarly, secondary outcomes showed associations between this per day delay in SLT initiation and dysphagia or death at the seventh day (AOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05C1.55), 14th day (AOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13C1.58), or 28th day (AOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.07C1.36) after extubation and occurrence of aspiration pneumonia (AOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02C1.17), while per day delay in post-extubation SLT initiation did not affect in-hospital mortality (AOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97C1.12).

The COVID-19 pandemic not only disrupted the health systems and the economy, but also significantly impacted routine immunization programs. Aim To study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on the routine immunization coverage program in the province of Laghman, Afghanistan. Methods A comparative cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted to understand the impact of COVID-19 on routine childhood immunization during the study period. Secondary data was used from the Ministry of Health from April to July 2020 and compared with the historical data of the same period in 2019. Student t-test was used to test the association between the mean changes in the daily immunization coverage. A p-value<0.05 was considered as statistically significant with 95% confidence interval. Results There was a 21.4% significant (p<0.01) decline in the total immunization coverage during AprilCJuly 2020 compared to AprilCJuly 2019. This reduction was diverse across all districts and all vaccine antigens. The most affected district was Alingar, and the most affected vaccines were measles and OPV4, with 28% declines, followed by PCV3 at 26%, and DPT3, IPV, OPV3, PCV2 and rotavirus at 23%. The outreach vaccination coverage declined by 56.1% compared to the fixed, at 13.4%. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic seriously affected the routine immunization in Afghanistan. On average, 325 children per day missed out on a lifesaving vaccine in Laghman province which put them at risk of getting preventable diseases. To provide access to routine immunization during pandemics, the study suggests a set of customized interventions to strengthen and sustain routine immunization.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown on Routine Immunization in the Province of Laghman, Afghanistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A rhodamine-based fluorescent probe (Rho-GSH) was rationally designed and synthesized, using nitrobenzene as recognition group for monitoring and imaging GSH in vitro and in vivo. In the presence of GSH, Rho-GSH undergoes sequential nucleophilic substitution and spiro-ring-opening reaction, resulting the fluorescence increase of probe, which enables quantitative detection of GSH with \\"off-on\\" fluorescence. The cascade reaction also enables Rho-GSH to rapidly detect GSH (3 s). In addition, Rho-GSH exhibited outstanding selectivity in detecting GSH vs cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy). Based on the outstanding detection performance and superior biocompatibility of Rho-GSH, it was used to visualize GSH in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating its highly selectivity for GSH detection (with respect to Cys and Hcy). Rho-GSH can help visually distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells by fluorescence imaging, demonstrating the overexpression of GSH in cancer cells. Because of the outstanding analytical capabilities of Rho-GSH for GSH detection, Rho-GSH may be useful for cancer diagnosis and clinical evaluation.","output":"Construction of a unique fluorescent probe for rapid and highly sensitive detection of glutathione in living cells and zebrafish"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of our study was to explore relations between parents' and children's fear of COVID-19, parents' dispositions (emotion regulation, self-efficacy, the anxiety trait) and their distress (due to the pandemic, the national state of emergency [NSE] and curfews) and how these variables have been affecting the quality of parental pandemic practices during the COVID-19 NSE in Serbia.

A new laparoscopic device is reported in this article that assists liver resection laparoscopically. METHODS From October 2006 to the present, patients suitable for liver resection were assessed carefully for laparoscopic resection with the laparoscopic Habib Sealer (LHS). Detailed data of patients resected laparoscopically with this device were collected prospectively and analyzed. RESULTS In all, 28 patients underwent attempted laparoscopic liver resection. Four cases had to be converted to an open approach because of extensive adhesions from previous colonic operations. Twenty-four patients completed the procedure comprising tumorectomy (n = 7), multiple tumoretcomies (n = 5), segmentectomy (n = 3), and bisegmentectomies (n = 9). Vascular clamping of portal triads was not used. The mean resection time was 60 +/- 23 min (mean +/- SD), and blood loss was 48 +/- 54 mL. None of the patients received any transfusion of blood or blood products perioperatively or postoperatively. Postoperatively, 1 patient developed severe exacerbation of asthma that required steroid therapy, and 1 other patient had a transient episode of liver failure that required supportive care. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.6 +/- 2 days (mean +/- SD). At a short-term follow up, no recurrence was detected in patients with liver cancer.

Currently, the main treatment of glaucoma still relies on surgery. Glaucoma patients often suffer from various psychological problems like anxiety and depression not only because of the lack of understanding of the surgical treatment of glaucoma, but also the long-term stress and the poor prognosis. As alternative therapies, non-pharmacological interventions can greatly alleviate psychological burdens and improve sleep quality in surgically treated glaucoma patients. Randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacologic interventions for glaucoma have been reported, although the results remain conflicting. Evidences for determining the efficacy of non-pharmacologic interventions for glaucoma are scant. This study aims to assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in patients with postoperative glaucoma through a network meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search of relevant literatures published before August 2021 about the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in patients with postoperative glaucoma will be performed in Wanfang, VP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese BioMedicine Literature Database, Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of science. Two reviewers will be independently responsible for literature screening and selection, quality assessment, and data extraction. WinBUGS 1.4 will be used for the network meta-analysis. RESULTS: This meta-analysis will provide additional and stronger evidences for non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in patients with postoperative glaucoma, which will help clinicians and decision makers to make an optimal therapeutic strategy. CONCLUSION: This study will provide a reliable evidence-based basis for the clinical application of non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality in patients with postoperative glaucoma.

We are reporting the outcomes of recipients with SHKT treated with IL2-RA as induction therapy. This is a single center, retrospective study of 26 patients who received SHKT at our institution from Dec 2018 to Oct 2021. A multidisciplinary team composed of heart and kidney transplant medical and surgical members determined appropriate recipient-donor SHKT candidate pairs. The majority of patients received IL2-RA induction therapy, and all patients received triple immunosuppression therapy with prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. Adjustments in long term therapy were made in collaboration between the heart and kidney transplant teams. From Dec 2018 to Oct 2021, 26 patients underwent SHKT. 23 patients (88%) were male, the median age was 57 years, and 5.4% were  65 years. 18 patients (69%) had non ischemic cardiomyopathy and 24 patients (92%) had CKD (mean GFR  35%). 18 patients were listed Status 2 and 2 patient Status 5. One patient received a DCD donor and 12 patients (46%) received hep C donors. 25 patients (96%) received induction therapy with IL2-RA. During the first 3 months post-transplant, the only patient who received ATG had 7 severe infections;11 patients (44%) and 13 patients (52%) who received IL2 -RA had no infections and  4 mild infections, respectively. One patient died due to COVID 19 pneumonia complicated by multisystem organ failure. For a median follow up period of 410 (187-707) days, 8% patients in the IL2-RA induction cohort experienced a 2R/3A heart rejection, 8% patients remained on HD due to primary kidney graft non-function, and the survival rate was 96%.

No tools are available to determine whether a resident will meet minimum case requirements. Disruptions to surgical case volume, such as pandemics or leaves, make predicting case log progress difficult. The purpose of this study was to create a webpage-based risk tool to predict areas of concern based on current case logs, program case volume, and disruptions to training. Methods: A surgical case volume risk calculator was created in MATLAB then converted into a website. Baseline data were from a large, single training institution. A first order differential equation model calculates risk of deficiency in 13 major case categories. The model assumes a linear relationship between average case rate per resident per category, including qualifiers such as training site, disruption to case volume, and current case volume. The model calculates risk ranging from a recoverable deficit (moderate) with case redistribution, to critical deficit (high) based on inadequate program total case volume. Results: Using baseline model institutional data, a 12-month disruption to normal case volume from COVID-19 pandemic for a second-year surgical resident, critical deficiencies were predicted in breast and endoscopy (Fig. 1). Conclusion: Disruptions in clinical training result in case deficiencies, and risk evaluation can be captured. Modification of schedules, rotations, and curricula will be different based on major category, and moderate vs critical deficits. The next steps are to expand the core data set to multiple institutions and validate with external sites and varied disruptions.

Using data from national phone surveys implemented in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda during the pandemic and the pre-COVID-19 national face-to-face surveys that served as the sampling frames for the phone surveys, this paper documents selection the biases in individual-level analyses based on phone survey data. In most cases, individual-level data are available only for phone survey respondents, who we find are more likely to be household heads or their spouses and non-farm enterprise owners, and on average, are older and better educated vis-a-vis the general adult population. These differences are the result of uneven access to mobile phones in the population and the way that phone survey respondents are selected. To improve the representativeness of individual-level analysis using phone survey data, we recalibrate the phone survey sampling weights based on propensity score adjustments that are derived from a model of an individuals likelihood of being interviewed as a function of individual- and household-level attributes. We find that reweighting improves the representativeness of the estimates for phone survey respondents, moving them closer to those of the general adult population. This holds for both women and men and for a range of demographic, education, and labor market outcomes. However, reweighting increases the variance of the estimates and, in most cases, fails to overcome selection biases. This indicates limitations to deriving representative individual-level estimates from phone survey data.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study is to investigate patterns and predictors of family violence, such as child maltreatment and harsh punishment, during the first eight weeks of the pandemic after initial stay-at-home orders in North Carolina. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants included 120 families with children ages 4C11 (53% non-White, 49% female) and a primary caregiver (98% female) living in rural and suburban areas in North Carolina. Participants were recruited based on high risk of pre-pandemic family violence exposure. METHODS: Caregivers completed weekly surveys during the pandemic assessing family violence, caregiver employment status, and caregiver emotion reactivity. In addition, all caregivers completed pre-pandemic surveys on family violence. RESULTS: Mixed-effects models revealed that family violence was highest following initial stay-at-home orders and decreased linearly over time. Higher pre-pandemic child violence exposure and caregiver unemployment were associated with higher initial family violence. Higher caregiver emotion reactivity was associated with changes in family violence across time. CONCLUSIONS: We observed high levels of family violence following stay-at-home orders, especially in families with higher baseline violence, higher caregiver emotion reactivity, and caregiver unemployment or underemployment. These associations suggest that vulnerable families may respond to the additional stressor of stay-at-home orders with increased violence and thus need additional support in moments of crisis.","output":"Predictors of family violence in North Carolina following initial COVID-19 stay-at-home orders()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Monitoring recovery process of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients released from hospital is crucial for exploring residual effects of COVID-19 and beneficial for clinical care. In this study, a comprehensive analysis was carried out to clarify residual effects of COVID-19 on hospital discharged patients. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-eight cases with laboratory measured data at hospital discharge record and five follow-up visits were retrospectively collected to carry out statistical data analysis comprehensively, which includes multiple statistical methods (e.g., chi-square, T-test and regression) used in this study. RESULTS: Study found that 13 of 21 hematologic parameters in laboratory measured dataset and volume ratio of right lung lesions on CT images highly associated with COVID-19. Moderate patients had statistically significant lower neutrophils than mild and severe patients after hospital discharge, which is probably caused by more efforts on severe patients and slightly neglection of moderate patients. COVID-19 has residual effects on neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of patients who have hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). After released from hospital, female showed better performance in T lymphocytes subset cells, especially T helper lymphocyte% (16% higher than male). According to this sex-based differentiation of COVID-19, male should be recommended to take clinical test more frequently to monitor recovery of immune system. Patients over 60 years old showed unstable recovery process of immune cells (e.g., CD45a+alymphocyte) within 75 days after discharge requiring longer clinical care. Additionally, right lung was vulnerable to COVID-19 and required more time to recover than left lung. CONCLUSIONS: Criterion of hospital discharge and strategy of clinical care should be flexible in different cases due to residual effects of COVID-19, which depend on several impact factors. Revealing remaining effects of COVID-19 is an effective way to eliminate disorder of mental health caused by COVID-19 infection.","output":"Longitudinal changes of laboratory measurements after discharged from hospital in 268 COVID-19 pneumonia patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona pandemic 2019 (CoViD-19) has encouraged social movement for the physical distancing and awareness for the use of natural products of medicinal plants for home remedies Scientists are working to unravel the genetic makeup of corona virus i e , the causative agent of CoViD-19 in order to find treatments for the infection Until now, even medicine and vaccine have been formulated in order to help cure the disease The primary objective of this article is to identify and analyse the published articles in the areas of complementary herbal plant application for antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, ways to enhanced immunity, and to cure infectious symptoms One of the paramount options including the use of herb-based medicinal derivatives have been proposed to cure infections with the positive outcome Most of the established traditional medicinal systems like Traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda have recommended a list of several potent herbal and essential oils that ease the symptoms of infections by their regular massaging on the scalp These results can serve as a yard stick for the efficacious utilisation of food plants as home remedy and for the development of clinical study on disease prevention from natural resources in a global context","output":"Fighting against severe acute respiratory syndrome: A systematic review on plant foods and natural products as complementary herbal medicines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Purpose] This study aimed to consider the influence of a three-month video exercise program on the physical function of older females.

Aim: The main aim of this study was to investigate the influence of selected sociodemographic and clinical parameters on anxiety and depression symptoms in paramedics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: The study involved 387 paramedics working in Medical Rescue Teams in Poland. The majority of respondents were male (72.35%). In order to achieve the aim of the study, an online diagnostic survey was conducted using a questionnaire of the authors own design and standardized questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and General Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7). Results: Significantly higher values were observed for all analysed scales in females compared to males. The main factors influencing the occurrence of anxiety and depression symptoms were gender, seniority at work, family relations, use of sleeping pills. Alcohol consumption increased in this professional group during the pandemic. Conclusions: Females and users of sleep medication who work in the emergency department during a pandemic are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety. A longer length of service and satisfying relationships with family are factors in reducing these symptoms. Paramedics who are in informal relationships and single manifest more emotional problems compared to those who are married. Increased alcohol consumption can be considered as a way of coping with stress.

Recordings were obtained during rest for both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication states. We analyzed the bilateral LFP channels that had the maximum beta power in the OFF state and the cortical sources that had the maximum coherence with the selected LFP channels in the alpha band. Our findings revealed the inherent nonlinearity in the PD data as subcortical high beta (20 - 30 Hz) band and cortical alpha (8 - 12 Hz) band activities. While the former was discernible without medication (p=0.015), the latter was induced upon the dopaminergic medication (p<6.10-4). The degree of subthalamic nonlinearity was correlated with contralateral tremor severity (r=0.45, p=0.02). Conversely, for the cortical signals nonlinearity was present for the ON medication state with a peak in the alpha band and correlated with contralateral akinesia and rigidity (r=0.46, p=0.02). This correlation appeared to be independent from that of alpha power and the two measures combined explained 34 % of the variance in contralateral akinesia scores.

Methods: A community-based cohort study was conducted from May to September 2021 in a selected geographic area in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The estimated sample size was 10,232. We enumerated individuals from all eligible households and periodically updated vaccination and COVID-19 infection data. We computed vaccine effectiveness with its 95% confidence interval for two doses of the Covishield vaccine against any COVID-19 infection. Results: We enrolled 69,435 individuals, of which 21,793 were above 45 years. Two dose coverage of Covishield in the 18+ and 45+ age group was 18% and 31%, respectively. The overall incidence of COVID-19 infection was 1099 per 100,000 population.

Methods: In this comparative study in Indian subjects, we recruited 510 COVID-19 patients and retrieved DNA from 520 controls from a repository. Associations between variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with disease severity were identified by whole exome sequencing (WES, na?=a?20) and targeted genotyping (na?=a?1010). Molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) were performed to explore functional relevance of the variants. Cleavage of spike glycoprotein by wild and variant TMPRSS2 was determined in HEK293T cells.

He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any normal post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart. Comment: With the pandemic impact of SARS-COV-2, a range of issues unfolds, also for medicolegal investigations into deaths, as we report the first Swiss case with post-mortem CT where death had occurred due to a SARS-COV-2 infection, with features of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as an outpatient. As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies.

Methods: This review was conducted by searching PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, the Scopus database, the Web of Science Core Collection database, and the SciELO citation index, from 1989C2021. An example of a search strategy used in PubMed Central is: Virtual reality [All Fields] AND (neurosurgical procedures [MeSH Terms] OR (neurosurgical [All Fields] AND procedures [All Fields]) OR neurosurgical procedures [All Fields] OR neurosurgery [All Fields] OR neurosurgery [MeSH Terms]). Using this search strategy, we identified 487 (PubMed), 1097 (PubMed Central), and 275 citations (Web of Science Core Collection database). Results: Articles were found and reviewed showing numerous applications of VR/AR in neurosurgery. These applications included their utility as a supplement and augment for neuronavigation in the fields of diagnosis for complex vascular interventions, spine deformity correction, resident training, procedural practice, pain management, and rehabilitation of neurosurgical patients. These technologies have also shown promise in other area of neurosurgery, such as consent taking, training of ancillary personnel, and improving patient comfort during procedures, as well as a tool for training neurosurgeons in other advancements in the field, such as robotic neurosurgery. Conclusions: We present the first review of the immense possibilities of VR in neurosurgery, beyond merely planning for surgical procedures. The importance of VR and AR, especially in social distancing in neurosurgery training, for economically disadvantaged sections, for prevention of medicolegal claims and in pain management and rehabilitation, is promising and warrants further research.","output":"Virtual Reality in Neurosurgery: Beyond Neurosurgical Planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the agent of COVID-19, is similar to two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in causing life-threatening maternal respiratory infections and systemic complications. Because of global concern for potential intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their infants, this report analyzes the effects on pregnancy of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory RNA viruses, and examines the frequency of maternal-fetal transmission with SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (HPIV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV). There have been no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission reported with COVID-19 or any other coronavirus infections. Influenza virus, despite causing approximately one billion annual infections globally, has only a few cases of confirmed or suspected intrauterine fetal infections reported. RSV is in an unusual cause of illness among pregnant women, and with the exception of one premature infant with congenital pneumonia, no other cases of maternal-fetal infection are described. Parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus can produce symptomatic maternal infections but do not cause intrauterine fetal infection. In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses. This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event. Potential mechanisms of fetal protection from maternal viral infections are also discussed.","output":"INFECTIONS IN PREGNANCY WITH COVID-19 AND OTHER RESPIRATORY RNA VIRUS DISEASES ARE RARELY, IF EVER, TRANSMITTED TO THE FETUS: EXPERIENCES WITH CORONAVIRUSES, HPIV, hMPV RSV, AND INFLUENZA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Clinicopathological and Gene Expression Profile (CP\\\\GEP) model was developed to accurately identify patients with T1CT3 primary cutaneous melanoma at low risk for nodal metastasis. OBJECTIVES: To validate the CP\\\\GEP model in an independent Dutch cohort of patients with melanoma. METHODS: Patients (aged  18 years) with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 2007 and 2017 at the Erasmus Medical Centre Cancer Institute were eligible. The CP\\\\GEP model combines clinicopathological features (age and Breslow thickness) with the expression of eight target genes involved in melanoma metastasis (ITGB3, PLAT, SERPINE2, GDF15, TGFBR1, LOXL4, CXCL8 and MLANA). Using the pathology result of SLNB as the gold standard, performance measures of the CP\\\\GEP model were calculated, resulting in CP\\\\GEP high risk or low risk for nodal metastasis. RESULTS: In total, 210 patients were included in the study. Most patients presented with T2 (n = 94, 45%) or T3 (n = 70, 33%) melanoma. Of all patients, 27% (n = 56) had a positive SLNB, with nodal metastasis in 0%, 30%, 54% and 16% of patients with T1, T2, T3 and T4 melanoma, respectively. Overall, the CP\\\\GEP model had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 905% [95% confidence interval (CI) 779C96.2], with an NPV of 100% (95% CI 722C100) in T1, 893% (95% CI 728C963) in T2 and 750% (95% CI 301C954) in T3 melanomas. The CP\\\\GEP indicated high risk in all T4 melanomas. CONCLUSIONS: The CP\\\\GEP model is a noninvasive and validated tool that accurately identified patients with primary cutaneous melanoma at low risk for nodal metastasis.

Untangling the cause could be helpful to governments attempting to curb or prevent similar surges around the world.Method: We retrospectively studied the comparative secondary attack rate, incidence proportion rate and extent of unrestricted social interactions contribution between the first and the second wave of COVID-19.Findings: The first and second wave epidemiological statistics expressly show that unrestricted social interaction accounted for more than 42% of all COVID-19 cases. The 58% increment of secondary attack rate in the second wave's indicating changes in the pattern of unrestricted social interaction amongst household members. The secondary attack rate rose 2.5-fold for the age group <10years, rose 88% for the age group >50years, while it remains stable in the age group 10-50years. We find significantly higher incidence proportion rate, ~39%, in household size of two- and three members in the second wave while it was significant in household size of four or more members in the first wave.Interpretation: Changes in the pattern of unrestricted social interaction, which escalated the secondary attack rate by 58%, and higher incidence proportion rate even in household size of two- and three members in the second wave could lead to the unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases in the second wave.Funding Information: The authors not received any funding for this work.Declaration of Interests: We declare no competing interests.Ethics Approval Statement: Partition of the respondents in this study was completely voluntary, anonymous and consensual.

Human ACE2 acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is also widely expressed in epithelial cells of the lungs, heart, kidney, and pancreas. It is considered an important drug target for treating SARS-CoV-2 as well as pulmonary diseases, heart failure, hypertension, renal diseases, and diabetes. Despite the critical importance, the mechanism of ligand binding to the human ACE2 receptor remains unknown. Here, we have addressed this challenge through all-atom simulations using a novel ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD) method. Microsecond time scale LiGaMD simulations have unprecedentedly captured multiple times of spontaneous binding and unbinding of a potent inhibitor MLN-4760 in the ACE2 receptor. With ligand far away in the unbound state, the ACE2 receptor samples distinct Open, Partially Open, Closed, and Fully Closed conformations. Upon ligand binding to the active site, conformational ensemble of the ACE2 receptor is biased toward the Closed state as observed in the X-ray experimental structure. The LiGaMD simulations thus suggest a conformational selection mechanism for ligand recognition by the highly flexible ACE2 receptor, which is expected to facilitate rational drug design targeting human ACE2 against coronaviruses and other related human diseases.","output":"Mechanism of Ligand Recognition by Human ACE2 Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) have had considerable success at crossing species barriers; both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 have been transmitted on multiple occasions from SIV-infected natural host species. However, the precise evolutionary and ecological mechanisms characterizing a successful cross-species transmission event remain to be elucidated. Here, in addition to expanding and clarifying our previous description of the adaptation of a diverse, naturally occurring SIVsm inoculum to a new rhesus macaque host, we present an analytical framework for understanding the selective forces driving viral adaptation to a new host. A preliminary analysis of large-scale changes in virus population structure revealed that viruses replicating in the macaques were subject to increasing levels of selection through day 70 postinfection (p.i.), whereas contemporaneous viruses in the mangabeys remained similar to the source inoculum. Three different site-by-site methods were employed to identify the amino acid sites responsible for this macaque-specific selection. Of 124 amino acid sites analyzed, 3 codons in V2, a 2Camino acid shift in an N-linked glycosylation site, and variation at 2 sites in the highly charged region were consistently evolving under either directional or diversifying selection at days 40 and 70 p.i. This strong macaque-specific selection on the V2 loop underscores the importance of this region in the adaptation of SIVsm to rhesus macaques. Due to the extreme viral diversity already extant in the naturally occurring viral inoculum, we employed a broad range of phylogenetic and numerical tools in order to distinguish the signatures of past episodes of selection in viral sequences from more recent selection pressures.","output":"Adaptation of a Diverse Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Population to a New Host Is Revealed through a Systematic Approach to Identify Amino Acid Sites under Selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: In this study, we aimed to assess the frequency of patient emergency visits to the Otorhinolaryngology (ORL) Department during coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and compare it with that before coronavirus COVID-19.

Resurgence of host-virus interactions in recent literature emphasizes the key role of mitochondria and host metabolism on viral life processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to damage of mitochondria that generate toxic compounds, importantly mitochondrial DNA, inducing systemic toxicity, leading to damage of multiple organs in the body.

In 2007, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law and Department of Health released draft Guidelines for ethical allocation of ventilators for adults. In 2015, updated guidelines were released to ensure that: (1) revisions reflect the publics values and (2) the triage protocol is substantiated by evidence-based clinical data. We summarize the development and content of the 2015 Guidelines compared with the 2007 version, emphasizing new/revised aspects of the ethical considerations and clinical protocol. METHODS: We compared the 2007 and 2015 guidelines, with particular emphasis on the ethical issues and clinical protocols. RESULTS: The 2015 Guidelines retained much of the ethical and clinical framework of the 2007 draft. The triage protocol was revised using evidence-based clinical data. Patients with the highest likelihood of short-term survival with ventilator therapy have priority access. Protocol consists of exclusion criteria, the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and periodic clinical assessments. Guidance is provided on secondary triage criteria.

METHODS Existing interventions were identified from a systematic review and our own grey literature search. We then characterized interventions using the Behaviour Change Wheel, a framework to inform and drive behavior change, and matched interventions to behavioural targets, audiences, and identified barriers and facilitators. Feedback from the CPEG DKA prevention working group was incorporated into the intervention plan. RESULTS We identified 27 interventions. Our proposed target behaviors are: 1) prompt recognition of symptoms of diabetes in children; 2) urgent attendance to medical care with a request for an office-based test for diabetes; and 3) rapid confirmation of diagnosis and urgent consultation with pediatric diabetes experts. We initially identified four possible intervention functions including education, training, environment restructuring, and enablement. Feedback from the working group favoured education intervention functions including symptom recognition messages targeting parents, caregivers, teachers, and providers and messages about how to make a rapid diagnosis and need for urgent referral targeting providers.

Objective: To compare chest CT features of COVID-19, influenza, and OP using a multireader design, and to assess radiologists' performance in distinguishing between these conditions. Methods: This retrospective study included 150 chest CT examinations in 150 patients (mean age 5816 years) with diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or non-infectious OP (50 randomly selected abnormal CT examinations per diagnosis). Six thoracic radiologists independently assessed CT examinations for 14 individual CT findings and Radiologic Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 category and recorded a favored diagnosis. CT characteristics of the three diagnoses were compared using random effects models; readers' diagnostic performance was assessed. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly different (p<.05) from influenza pneumonia for seven of 14 chest CT findings, though different (p<.05) from OP for 4 of 14 findings [central or diffuse distribution in 10% and 7% of COVID-19 vs 20% and 21% of OP; unilateral distribution in 1% of COVID-19 vs 7% of OP; non-tree-in-bud nodules in 32% of COVID-19 vs 53% of OP; tree-in-bud nodules in 6% of COVID-19 vs 14% of OP]. A total of 70% of cases of COVID-19, 33% of influenza, and 47% of OP had an RSNA COVID-19 category of typical (p<.001). Mean percentage of correct favored diagnoses compared to actual diagnoses was 44% for COVID-19, 29% for influenza, and 39% for OP.

The aim of this study was to prospectively analyze patient's willingness for discharge and barriers to discharge beyond postoperative day #1 (POD#1) after SA. METHODS: In this prospective study, patients undergoing primary or revision SA (anatomic, reverse, or hemiarthroplasty) at our institution were enrolled to determine their willingness and concerns for discharge after SA. Patient's willingness for discharge was inquired daily until discharge. Demographic information, patient's medical history, intraoperative details (duration of surgery, estimated blood loss, intraoperative complication), discharge disposition, length of stay (LOS), and reasons for extension of LOS beyond POD#1 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients who underwent SA were included. Eight patients were discharged on POD#0, 114 patients on POD#1, 37 patients on POD#2, and 25 patients after POD#2. One hundred nineteen (119) patients were discharged to home, 40 were discharged to home with services, 15 were discharged to nursing facilities, and 10 were discharged to rehabilitation centers. Reasons for extension of LOS past POD#1 included patients failing to clear home safety evaluation (n = 4), inadequate pain control (n = 6), worsening of preexisting medical conditions (n = 8), delay in patient disposition (awaiting placement in a rehabilitation facility [n = 6] and awaiting culture results [n = 9]). Social reasons (n = 29) were the most common reasons for extension of LOS. These included patients requesting an extra day of stay (n = 20), patients requesting rehabilitation facility placement (n = 5), lack of a timely ride home (n = 2), and family-related reasons (death in the family [n = 1], lack of home help [n = 1]). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study demonstrates modifiable factors associated with LOS beyond POD#1 (inadequate pain control, logistic delays in disposition, and patient-related social concerns) after SA.

However, bronchoconstriction causes airway narrowing, parenchymal distortion, dynamic hyperinflation, and the emergence of ventilation defects (VDefs) affecting transmural pressure. This study aimed to investigate the changes in transmural pressure caused by bronchoconstriction in a bronchial tree. Transmural pressures before and during bronchoconstriction were estimated using an integrative computational model of bronchoconstriction. Briefly, this model incorporates a 12-generation symmetric bronchial tree, and the Anafi and Wilson model for the individual airways of the tree. Bronchoconstriction lead to the emergence of VDefs and a relative increase in peak transmural pressures of up to 84% compared to baseline. The highest increase in peak transmural pressure occurred in a central airway outside of VDefs, and the lowest increase was 27% in an airway within VDefs illustrating the heterogeneity in peak transmural pressures within a bronchial tree. Mechanisms contributing to the increase in peak transmural pressures include increased regional ventilation and dynamic hyperinflation both leading to increased alveolar pressures compared to baseline. Pressure differences between intraluminal and alveolar pressure increased driven by the increased airway resistance and its contribution to total transmural pressure reached up to 24%. In conclusion, peak transmural pressure in lungs with VDefs during bronchoconstriction can be substantially increased compared to dilated airways in healthy homogeneous lungs and is highly heterogeneous.

The problem of minimizing coverage lines however is typically solved using heuristics that do not guarantee optimality. In this work, we propose a turn-minimizing coverage planning method that computes the optimal number of axis-parallel (horizontal/vertical) coverage lines for the environment in polynomial time. We do this by formulating a linear program (LP) that optimally partitions the environment into axis-parallel ranks (non-intersecting rectangles of width equal to the tool width).

Cases were reports of fatal outcomes with the drugs of interest and non-cases were all other reports for these drugs registered between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019. Data with hydroxychloroquine (or metformin) alone were compared with the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin. Results are reported as ROR (reporting odds ratio) with their 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Of the 10,771 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) involving hydroxychloroquine, 52 were recorded as 'fatal outcomes'. In comparison with hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 57.7 (23.9-139.3). In comparison with metformin alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 6.0 (2.6-13.8). CONCLUSION: Our study identified a signal for the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin that appears to be more at risk of fatal outcomes (particularly by completed suicides) than one of the two drugs when given alone.","output":"A New Drug-Drug Interaction Between Hydroxychloroquine and Metformin?

Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not only a short-term infection but that patients (pts) recovering from SARS-CoV2 infection complain of persisting symptoms including: fatigue, diffuse myalgia and weakness, which may lead to chronic fatigue syndrome. There is currently no evidence that nutritional supplements and/or physical exercise can assist in the recovery of pts with chronic fatigue syndrome. 1-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA) is an endogenic substance that is produced in the liver when nicotinic acid is metabolized. 1-MNA demonstrates anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Therefore, we investigated whether 1-MNA supplements could improve exercise tolerance and decrease fatigue among patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2. MethodsThe study population was composed of pts after COVID-19, expressing subjective feelings of limited tolerance to exercise. The selected pts were randomized into two groups: GrM0 - without supplementation; GrM1 - with 1-MNA supplementation. At the beginning of the study (Phase 0), in both groups, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was carried out and fatigue assessment with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was performed. After 1 month (Phase 1), a follow up FSS and 6MWT once more were performed in both groups. ResultsA significant improvement in the mean distance covered in the 6MWT was noted among the pts in GrM1, compared to those in GrM0. We also noted that in GrM1 the 6MWT distance was significantly higher after 1 month of supplementation with 1-MNA, compared to the beginning of the study (515.18 m in Phase 0 vs 557.8m in Phase 1; p = 0.000034). In GrM1, significantly more pts improved their distance in the 6MWT (23 out of 25 pts, equal to 92%), by a mean of 47 meters, compared to GrM0 (15 of 25 pts, equal to 60%) (p = 0.0061). After one month, significantly more patients in the group without 1-MNA had severe fatigue (FSS [] 4) compared to the group with supplementation (GrM1 = 5 pts (20%) vs GrM0 = 14pts (56%); p = 0.008). Conclusions1-MNA supplementation significantly improved physical performance in a 6-minute walk test and reduced the percentage of patients with severe fatigue after COVID-19. The comprehensive action of 1-MNA, including anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects, as well as activation of the SIRT1 enzyme, may be beneficial for the recovery of patients with persistent symptoms of fatigue and low tolerance to exercise after COVID-19.","output":"Use of 1-MNA to Improve Exercise Tolerance and Fatigue in Patients After COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El presente trabajo aborda la accin de los agentes sociales durante la crisis provocada por el COVID\\\\19, analizando las experiencias de dilogo social tripartito surgidas en Espa?a, Italia y Portugal.

Wellbeing was highest in primary school children and boys and lowest in those who were at secondary school children, who were girls and, those who preferred not to give a gender. Among primary school children, higher wellbeing was seen for those who played with lots of others (rather than alone), were of Asian ethnicity (OR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.3), had a safe play area (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.67 to 2.56) and had more sleep.

Veterans are a highly trauma-exposed population, and VHA has long offered effective telemental health services. Natural disasters and pandemics like COVID-19 are known to be traumatic. Those with preexisting trauma exposure and mental health conditions are often at greater risk than the general population for long-term adverse health sequelae. Application of trauma-informed principles to telehealth care is critical and timely. Observations Trauma-focused care (including telemental health) refers to evidence-based treatment models that directly facilitate recovery from trauma-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite the widespread availability of trauma-focused treatment in VHA, not all veterans chose to engage in it. In contrast, trauma-informed care (TIC) is a global, \\"universal precautions\\" approach to providing strengths-based, collaborative quality medical care in any discipline or location. In this article the authors, all primary care and mental health clinicians at VHA, advocate for the application of the 6 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration principles of trauma-informed care to telehealth. Using examples from telehealth research conducted in trauma-exposed patient populations, we illustrate the characteristics of telehealth that are well suited to delivery of trauma-informed care and suggest readily applicable strategies that can be used across disciplines including primary care and medical/surgical specialties. A primary care patient case scenario is included to illustrate how telehealth visits can be trauma-informed. Conclusions Telehealth expansion has occurred nationally out of necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to investigate whether physical activity, and the timing and balance of physical activity and sleep/rest, were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity. Data from 91,248 UK Biobank participants with accelerometer data and complete covariate and linked COVID-19 data to July 19, 2020, were included. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity-in relation to overall physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), balance between activity and sleep/rest, and variability in timing of sleep/rest-was assessed with adjusted logistic regression. Of 207 individuals with a positive test result, 124 were classified as having a severe infection. Overall physical activity and MVPA were not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas a poor balance between activity and sleep/rest was (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.81]). This finding was related to higher daytime activity being associated with lower risk (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93) but higher movement during sleep/rest being associated with higher risk (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.42) of severe infection. Greater variability in timing of sleep/rest was also associated with increased risk (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.35). Results for testing positive were broadly consistent. In conclusion, these results highlight the importance of not just physical activity, but also quality sleep/rest and regular sleep/rest patterns, on risk of COVID-19.

Viral diagnostic testing in patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI) is a necessary tool for patient management; therefore, sensitive and specific tests are required. This scoping literature review evaluated the analytical validity of commercially available sample-to-answer RSV diagnostic tests in different contexts. Content: PubMed and Embase were queried for studies reporting on the analytical validity of tests for RSV in patients with RTI (published January 2005-January 2021). Sensitivity and specificity of RSV tests and information on study design, patient, and setting characteristics were extracted from 77 studies that met predefined inclusion criteria. A literature gap was identified for studies of RSV tests conducted in adult-only populations (5.3% of total sub-records), and in outpatient (7.5%) or household (0.8%) settings. Overall, RSV tests with analytical time >30 min had higher sensitivity (62.5-100%) versus RSV tests with analytical time []30 min (25.7-100%), this sensitivity range could be partially attributed to the different modalities (antigen versus molecular) used. Molecular-based rapid RSV tests had higher sensitivity (66.7-100%) and specificity (94.3-100%) than antigen-based RSV tests (25.7-100% and 80.3-100%). Summary: Molecular-based RSV tests should be considered for first-line use when possible, given their high sensitivity and specificity and that adults with RTI typically have low viral load, necessitating a highly sensitive test.

An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post hoc Dunn tests to assess differences in these features among baseline, prelockdown, and during lockdown periods. We also studied behavioral differences by age, gender, BMI, and educational background. RESULTS: We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices between prelockdown and during lockdown periods (P<.001 for all five countries). We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility features and increased virtual sociality through phone use. People were more active on their phones (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), spending more time using social media apps (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), particularly around major news events. Furthermore, participants had a lower heart rate (P<.001 for Italy and Spain; P=.02 for Denmark), went to bed later (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), and slept more (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We also found that young people had longer homestay than older people during the lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low BMI group walked more. CONCLUSIONS: RADAR-base, a freely deployable data collection platform leveraging data from wearables and mobile technologies, can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioral changes in response to public health interventions as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19. RADAR-base may be a viable approach to implementing an early warning system for passively assessing the local compliance to interventions in epidemics and pandemics, and could help countries ease out of lockdown.","output":"Using Smartphones and Wearable Devices to Monitor Behavioral Changes During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China was characterized by a distinctive subexponential increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting with an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak.

The fire also communicates warnings and predictions to those who can listen and understand it, like this Nenets woman. Back cover: The UK National Health Service (NHS) designed its Covid\\\\19 ('track and trace') app to avoid ambiguities like those of Siberian fire interpretation, but in doing so, it creates a climate of detachment and cynicism. This app serves as a critical public health technology by warning users that they have been near someone who has subsequently turned out to be infected. So why has it encountered so much resistance and non\\\\cooperation? In this issue, Roza Laptander and Piers Vitebsky look for an answer by comparing these on\\\\screen phone alerts with messages from the domestic fire of nomadic Siberian reindeer herders as it crackles alerts about potential illnesses or accidents. Though these prediction technologies may seem radically different, they are both instruments for thinking about possible futures and adjusting behaviour. They are both forms of divination that differ not so much in their logic as in their embeddedness in wider cosmologies of person, fate and society. The Siberian fire generates meaning as a focal point within many narrative strands concerning family, landscape and the movement of animals;its properties contribute to local ideas of normality, and acceptance of its messages is rooted in intimacy and entanglement. This highlights how the Covid\\\\19 app belongs to a state of emergency and exception. Its statistical idiom of risk and its culturally hyper\\\\valued focus on privacy deliberately conceal the identities of people caught in the chain of infection, thereby blocking social and narrative coherence.

The disease is still not very well characterized, and factors associated with severe clinical course are not well known. METHODS: The main objectives were to determine the demographic, clinical and laboratory manifestations of COVID-19 and to identify the factors associated with severe clinical course. We searched the PubMed for studies published between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 17, 2020, and included them if they were in English language, published in full, were retrospective or prospective observational or case control study with data on clinical, laboratory and imaging features of adult patients with COVID-19 disease from single or multiple centers. Studies that included exclusively pediatric patients were excluded. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data was displayed as n (%) or mean (SD). The meta-analysis on factors associated with severe clinical course was performed using the random effects model, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes. FINDINGS: We included 58 studies (6892 patients) for the systematic review on clinical manifestations and 21 studies (3496 patients) for meta-analysis on factors associated with severe clinical course. The mean age of patients with COVID-19 is 49.716.3 years with a male to female ratio of 1.2:1. Common symptoms and their frequency are: fever (83.4%), cough (60.5%), fatigue (33.8%), sputum (28.9%), dyspnea (22.1%), myalgia (20.6%), chest tightness / pain (16.3%), sore throat (13.5%), headache (11.2%), diarhhea (7.5%), nasal congestion / rhinorrhea (6.7%), nausea / vomiting (5.6%), pain abdomen (4.6%), and hemoptysis (1.7%). The comorbidities associated with COVID-19 are: hypertension (18.4%), diabetes mellitus (9.8%), cardiovascular diseases (8.8%), endocrine diseases (5.8%), gastrointestinal diseases (5%), CLD (3%), and COPD (2.8%). Among the laboratory parameters WBC was low in 27%, high in 9%, platelets were low in 22.9%, creatinine was high in 6.5%, AST was high in 25.3%, ALT was high in 22.7%, bilirubin was high in 8.8%, albumin was low 60.1%, CT chest was abnormal in 89%, CRP was high in 67.5%, LDH was high in 52%, D-dimer was high in 34.8%, CK was high in 14.4%, and procalcitonin was high in 15.4%. Factors significantly associated severe clinical course (with their ORs) are as follows: High CRP (5.78), high procalcitonin (5.45), age >60 (4.82), dyspnea (4.66), high LDH (4.59), COPD (4.37), low albumin (4.34), high D-dimer (4.03), cardiac disease (3.88), low lymphocyte count (3.22), any associated comorbidity (3.16), diabetes mellitus (3.11), high WBC count (2.67), high bilirubin level (2.55), high creatinine (2.34), high AST (2.31), hypertension (2.30), low platelets (1.78), High ALT (1.69), high CK (1.66), fever spikes 39C (1.59), diarrhea (1.55), male gender (1.47), and sputum (1.35). INTERPRETATION: Identification of these factors associated with severe COVID-19 will help the physicians working at all levels of healthcare (primary, secondary, tertiary and ICU) in determining which patients need home care, hospital care, HDU care, and ICU admission;and thus, prioritize the scarce healthcare resource use more judiciously. Many of these identified factors can also help the public at large in the current COVID-19 epidemic setting, to judge when they should seek immediate medical care. Funding Statement: None.

Nevertheless, in some cases, damage of the host tissue inflicted by the virus itself or by the elicited immune response may result in severe disease courses. Thus, regulatory mechanisms are necessary to control virus-induced and immune pathology. This ensures immune responses are elicited in a potent but controlled manner. In this review, we will outline how immune regulation may contribute to this process. We focus on regulatory T cells and co-inhibitory receptors and outline how these two regulatory immune components allow for and may even promote potent but not pathologic immune responses. By enabling a balanced immune response, regulatory mechanisms can thus contribute to pathogen control as well as tissue and host protection.","output":"Dampening anti-viral immunity can protect the host."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Diabetes has been shown to be a risk factor for corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. The characteristics of patients with diabetes vulnerable to this infection are less specified. We aim to present the characteristics of patients with diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Design: A retrospective case series. Setting: A single clinical centre in the UK. Methods We have retrospectively collected the demographics, medical characteristics and outcome of all patients with diabetes admitted to hospital over two-week period with COVID-19 infection. All cases were diagnosed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal and nasal swabs. Results A total of 71 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period of whom 16 (22.5%) patients had diabetes and were included in this case series. There was no significant difference between patients with compared to those without diabetes regarding age, gender or clinical presentation. However, comorbidities were more common in patients with diabetes specially hypertension {75% v 36.4%, a difference of 38.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5 to 58.3} and chronic kidney disease (37.5 v 5.5, a difference of 32% (1.6 to 51.6). Patients with diabetes were significantly more obese than those without diabetes (56.2% v 21.8% a difference of 34.4%, 95% CI 7.7 to 61.1). About one third (31.3%) of patients with diabetes were frail. Mean {standard deviation (SD)} duration of diabetes was 10 (2.8) years and mean (SD) HbA1c was 60.3 (15.6) mmol/mol. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was common (37.5%, 25% and 18.8% respectively). There was no significant difference in the outcomes between patients with compared to those without diabetes. Conclusion Patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 were significantly more obese and had high prevalence of comorbidities than those without diabetes. Other features of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 infection included long duration of diabetes, less tight glycaemic control and common use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs and NSAIDs.","output":"Characteristics of patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 infection-a brief case series report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Implementation of the surgical safety checklist (SSC) plays a significant role in improving surgical patient safety, but levels of compliance to a SSC implementation by surgical team members vary significantly. We aimed to investigate the factors affecting satisfaction levels of gynecologists, anesthesiologists, and operating room registered nurses (OR-RNs) with SSC implementation. METHODS: We conducted a survey based on 267 questionnaires completed by 85 gynecologists from 14 gynecological surgery teams, 86 anesthesiologists, and 96 OR-RNs at a hospital in China from March 3 to March 16, 2020. The self-reported questionnaire was used to collect respondents demographic information, levels of satisfaction with overall implementation of the SSC and its implementation in each of the three phases of a surgery, namely sign-in, time-out, and sign-out, and reasons for not giving a satisfaction score of 10 to its implementation in all phases. RESULTS: The subjective ratings regarding the overall implementation of the SSC between the surgical team members were different significantly. Too many operations to check was the primary factor causing gynecologists and anesthesiologists not to assign a score of 10 to sign-in implementation. The OR-RNs gave the lowest score to time-out implementation and 82 (85.42%) did not assign a score of 10 to it. Surgeon is eager to start for surgery was recognized as a major factor ranking first by OR-RNs and ranking second by anesthesiologists, and 57 (69.51%) OR-RNs chose Too many operations to check as the reason for not giving a score of 10 to time-out implementation. No one initiates and Surgeon is not present for sign out were commonly cited as the reasons for not assigning a score of 10 to sign-out implementation. CONCLUSION: Factors affecting satisfaction with SSC implementation were various. These factors might be essentially related to heavy workloads and lack of ability about SSC implementation. It is advisable to reduce surgical team members excessive workloads and enhance their understanding of importance of SSC implementation, thereby improving surgical team members satisfaction with SSC implementation and facilitating compliance of SSC completion.","output":"The surgical safety checklist: a quantitative study on attitudes and barriers among gynecological surgery teams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and is regarded as the gold standard for confirmation of infection.

Prior research has documented the association between media exposure to terrorism and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The present study replicated and extended these findings in a French sample. A population-based sample (N = 1,760) was drawn from a national web-enabled panel in June 2016. Hours of attack-related media exposure (i.e., TV-watching, viewing internet images, engaging in social media exchanges) in the 3 days following the attacks were assessed. Multivariate regression models, adjusting for gender, age, direct exposure (i.e., witnessing in person or knowing someone injured or killed), residential area, social support, pre-attack mental health service utilization, and other adverse life events, examined the association between media exposure and PTSS (assessed using the self-report PCL-5).

MethodsWe identified relevant studies by searching the PubMed, Embase, and medRxiv databases from December 2019 to October 1, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models. Only reports with multivariate adjusted results were included to avoid the impact of potential confounding factors. ResultsA total of six studies with 377,265 patients were identified. Overall, in the categorical analysis, a low serum vitamin D level was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09- 1.97, I2=81%), hospitalization (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.22-2.74, I2=0%), but not in-hospital death (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 0.27-27.61).

There are no detailed data on the possible changes in the epidemiology and treatment of DRFs in children and adults during the Covid pandemic. The purpose of our study was a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on distal radius fractures (DRF) epidemiology, including both children and adults and various fracture fixation methods in two large trauma centers in Poland. METHODS: This study compared the medical data on the treatment of distal radius fractures in Poland in two periods: the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 15 to October 15, 2020) and the corresponding period prior to the pandemic (from March 15 to October 15, 2019). We assessed detailed data from two trauma centers for pediatric and adult patients. Outpatients seeking medical attention at emergency departments and inpatients undergoing surgery at trauma-orthopedic wards were evaluated. We compared epidemiological data, demographic data, treatment type, and hospital stay duration. RESULTS: The total number of patients hospitalized due to DRF during the pandemic was 180, it was 15.1% lower than that from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (212). In the case of adult patients, the total number of those hospitalized during the pandemic decreased significantly (by 22%) from 132 to 103 patients. Analysis of the individual treatment methods revealed that the number of adults who underwent conservative treatment was considerably (by 30.3%) significantly lower in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 119 to 83 patients.

Intramuscular electromyography was used to record individual MU potentials (MUPs) and near fibre MUPs (NFMs) from deep and superficial regions of the VL during 25% maximum voluntary contractions, in 83 males (15 young (Y), 17 young athletes (YA), 22 old (O) and 29 master athletes (MA)).

MUP amplitude and NF MUP area were greater, and MUPs were more complex in deep MUPs from Y, YA and O (all p<0.05) but did not differ across depth in MA (all p>0.07). These data suggest MU characteristics differ according to depth within the VL which may be influenced by both ageing and exercise.

METHODS: In April 2020, UK health systems were challenged to expand critical care capacity rapidly during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic so that they could accommodate patients with respiratory and multiple organ failure. Here, we describe the preparation and adaptive responses of a large critical care unit to the oncoming burden of disease. Our changes were similar to the revolution in manufacturing brought about by 'Long Shops' of 1853 when Richard Garrett and Sons of Leiston started mass manufacture of traction engines. This innovation broke the whole process into smaller parts and increased productivity. When applied to COVID-19 preparations, an assembly line approach had the advantage that our ICU became easily scalable to manage an influx of additional staff as well as the increase in admissions. Healthcare professionals could be replaced in case of absence and training focused on a smaller number of tasks. RESULTS: Compared with the equivalent period in 2019, the ICU provided 30.9% more patient days (2599 to 3402), 1845 of which were ventilated days (compared with 694 in 2019, 165.8% increase) while time from first referral to ICU admission reduced from 193.8123.8 min (SD) to 110.776.75 min (SD). Throughout, ICU maintained adequate capacity and also accepted patients from neighbouring hospitals. This was done by managing an additional 205 doctors (70% increase), 168 nurses who had previously worked in ICU and another 261 nurses deployed from other parts of the hospital (82% increase).Our large tertiary hospital ensured a dedicated non-COVID ICU was staffed and equipped to take regional emergency referrals so that those patients requiring specialist surgery and treatment were treated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We report how the challenge of managing a huge influx of patients and redeployed staff was met by deconstructing ICU care into its constituent parts.

The functional plasticity of Tregs is a key feature of this lineage, as it allows them to adapt to different microenvironments, adopt transcriptional programs reflective of their environments and tailor their suppressive capacity in a context-dependent fashion. Tregs, particularly effector Tregs (eTregs), are abundant in many types of tumors. However, the functional and transcriptional plasticity of eTregs in tumors remain largely to be explored. Although depletion or inhibition of systemic Tregs can enhance anti-tumor responses, autoimmune sequelae have diminished the enthusiasm for such approaches. A more effective approach should specifically target intratumoral Tregs or subvert local Treg-mediated suppression. This mini-review will discuss the reported mechanisms by which the stability and suppressive function of tumoral Tregs are modulated, with the focus on eTregs and a subset of eTregs, follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells, and how to harness this knowledge for the future development of new effective cancer immunotherapies that selectively target the tumor local response while sparing the systemic side effects.","output":"Lineage Reprogramming of Effector Regulatory T Cells in Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Upon the introduction of autonomous vehicles into daily traffic, it becomes increasingly likely that autonomous vehicles become involved in accident scenarios in which decisions have to be made about how to distribute harm among involved parties.

Participants judgments reflect self-protective tendencies even when utilitarian motives clearly favor one of the available options. However, with an increasing number of lives at stake, utilitarian preferences increased. In a fifth experiment, we tested whether these results were tainted by social desirability but this was not the case. Overall, the results confirm that strong differences exist among passengers, pedestrians, and observers about the preferred course of action in critical incidents. It is therefore important that the actions of autonomous vehicles are not only oriented towards the needs of their passengers, but also take the interests of other road users into account. Even though utilitarian motives cannot fully reconcile the conflicting interests of passengers and pedestrians, there seem to be some moral preferences that a majority of the participants agree upon regardless of their perspective, including the utilitarian preference to save several other lives over ones own.","output":"Self-protective and self-sacrificing preferences of pedestrians and passengers in moral dilemmas involving autonomous vehicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To identify occupational risk factors for ALS using well-characterized participants with ALS (P-ALS), sibling controls (S-controls), and matched population controls (P-controls) within the National ALS Registry. We also compared oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers between groups. Methods: P-ALS were recruited over 4 years. Demographic, socioeconomic, and medical data were ascertained from medical records and structured interviews. P-ALS were followed prospectively for 2 years or until death, whichever came sooner. S-controls and age-, sex-, race/ethnicity-, and residential location-matched P-controls were recruited over 3 years. Occupational exposure to lead and agricultural chemicals (ACs) were assigned by an occupational hygienist, blinded to case status. OS biomarkers in urine were measured. Results: P-ALS (mean age 62.8 years; 63% males) resided across the United States. Demographic and socioeconomic variables did not differ among P-ALS, S-controls, and P-controls. P-ALS were more likely to report occupations with exposure to lead (adjusted OR (aOR)=2.3, 95% CI 1.1, 4.6) and ACs (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2, 4.6) compared to pooled controls. Among those with occupations with exposure to both lead and ACs, aOR was 7.2 (95% CI 2.0, 26.1). Urinary 8-oxo-dG was significantly elevated among P-ALS (11.07  5.42 ng/mL) compared to S-controls, P-controls, or pooled controls (pooled 7.43  5.42 ng/mL; p < 0.0001) but was not associated with occupational exposure to either lead or ACs. Conclusions: Findings reveal increased risk of ALS diagnosis among those with occupational exposure to lead and ACs and increased OS biomarkers among cases compared to controls.

However, it is not clear how children's real-time interactions with peers affect their language development; nor is it clear whether these processes differ between children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and two other groups of children, those with general developmental delays () and typically developing (TD) children. We used objective measures of movement and vocalizations to quantify children's real-time dyadic vocal interactions and quantify classroom social networks. Participants included 56 preschoolers (22 female; M = 50.14 months) in five inclusive classrooms for children with ASD or  and their TD peers. Each class was observed monthly on two to five occasions. Overall, children vocalized more to peers who had vocalized more to them in the previous observation. These dyadic vocalization patterns were associated with group differences in social network analyses. Modularity, the cohesiveness of group ties, was lower among children with ASD than it was among TD children or children with .

Trainees raised concerns that the elective restart and need for higher theatre activity to clear backlogs would impact on training opportunities. This study evaluated the resumption of training associated with a ring-fenced elective centre (EC). METHODS: The EC was established in July 2020 and three time periods were determined: pre-COVID (10/19-2/20), 1st wave of COVID (3/20-7/20) and post EC go-live (8/20-12/20). Data was collated from the E-Logbooks of General Surgery Registrars. RESULTS: The normal all-speciality pre COVID theatre-activity averaged 1052 cases/month. During the first wave elective activity decreased to 254 cases/month (24% of normal activity). Within 5 weeks of establishment of the EC, theatre activity was near normal despite a reduced number of theatres (with higher theatre utilisation). Pre COVID, trainees accessed 22.9 cases per month which then dropped to 7.7 cases during the first wave of COVID. Post the go live of the EC, trainees were able to operate on 20 cases per month almost back to normal training levels. Prior to the impact of the second wave, each trainee had developed a deficit of 90 cases during the 5 months pause. CONCLUSION: The ring-fenced elective centre has protected training opportunities for higher surgical trainees. However, the pause in training requires a targeted training recovery plan to overcome the deficit secondary to the first and subsequent waves of COVID to ensure that the JCST target of 1200 cases can be met for CCT.","output":"TP8.2.10 Impact of COVID-19 on General Surgery Training in a University Hospital with Ring Fenced Elective Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in individuals who are further removed from injury (up to three years) and to identify injury specific characteristics that are associated with an increased risk for persistent PTSD symptoms. DESIGN Cross-sectional, retrospective cohort. SETTING Level I Trauma CenterPATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: 243 patients operatively treated for orthopaedic trauma between March 2017 through June 2018. INTERVENTION Orthopaedic trauma requiring operative intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome was score on the PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5 (PCL-5) survey. A score of 31 or higher was considered concerning for PTSD. RESULTS 49 respondents scored positive for PTSD out of 239 (20.5%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated an increased risk of PTSD for patients with a history of smoking and those that required delayed re-operation (greater than 90 days post-operative). Caucasian race and low energy mechanisms of injury were associated with decreased risk of PTSD. Fracture locations were not associated with a higher likelihood of PTSD. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of PTSD symptoms in patients up to three years after surgery remains higher than the estimated prevalence of PTSD in the general United States population. It is similar to previously documented rates of PTSD for patients less than one year after injury. Long-term complication requiring re-operation was associated with an increased risk of persistent PTSD symptoms.

The current study explored the predictors associated with critical illness and mortality based on symptoms at the time of admission and initial physical examination findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 249 records of laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 patients were analyzed. Demographic profile and findings of initial physical examination were collected and analyzed. Bivariate logistic and multivariable stepwise forward regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of critical illness and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 249 records of SARS-COV-2 patients were retrospectively studied, of whom 66 (26.5%) developed a critical illness, and 58 (23.29%) died. The mean age of patients was 45.15 (16.34) years; 171 (68.71%) were men. From 27 potential predictors for developing a critical illness, 15 were reported independent predictors for critical illness, and 13 were for increased risk of mortality. Stepwise forward regression reported dyspnea as a single strongest predictor (OR, 5.800, 95% CI-2.724?12.346; p = 0.001, R(2) = 0.272) to develop critical illness.

However, it is likely to be very difficult to ensure that adolescents keep apart from one another since peer interactions are extremely significant for them. Aims: We examined the utility of the Theory of Planned Behavior enhanced with a construct of the Protection Motivation Theory for predicting physical distancing behavior among adolescents during the period following the national lockdown imposed in Italy to tackle the pandemic. Method: Measures of attitude, subjective norm, perceptions of behavioral control, perceptions of threat regarding personal health and the health of loved ones, and intention were administered to the participants (N = 363) at baseline. Measures of physical distancing behavior were then administered 3 weeks later (N = 350). Results: The tested structural equation model accounted for 77% of variance in intention and 25% of variance in behavior. Perceived behavioral control and attitude were important predictors of intention and behavior, while the data did not support the hypothesized impact of perceptions of threat. Limitation: Due to the observational nature of the data caution should be taken in drawing causal inferences. Conclusion: The results suggest that programs for increasing physical distancing behavior in adolescents by concentrating exclusively on risks to their health or that of their loved ones might prove to be ineffective. Instead, it seems likely that prevention campaigns targeting adolescents will be more successful if they focus on perceived behavioral control and attitude. ? 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.","output":"Adolescents at a Distance: The Importance of Socio-Cognitive Factors in Preventive Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Evaluating whether there is a clinical benefit of using extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy in two indications.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Randomized controlled trials and prospective studies with concurrent control were eligible for the evidence synthesis. The quality of the individual studies and the strength of the available evidence were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, respectively. For the preventive treatment of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we found very low-quality inconclusive evidence for mortality (five randomized controlled trials, n = 163), length of stay in the ICU (five randomized controlled trials, n = 163), and length of hospitalization (three randomized controlled trials, n = 101). Very low-quality inconclusive evidence was found for (serious) adverse events (four randomized controlled trials, n = 148). For the therapeutic treatment of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy in patients with sepsis/septic shock, we found very low-quality inconclusive evidence for mortality up to 60-day follow-up (two randomized controlled trials, n = 117), organ function (two randomized controlled trials, n = 117) and length of stay in the ICU (one randomized controlled trial, n = 20). Very low-quality inconclusive evidence was found for (serious) adverse events (two randomized controlled trials, n = 117). CONCLUSIONS Given the available evidence, the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption therapy in combination with standard care in the investigated indications was not established.

Observational studies examining H1N1 vaccine uptake by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality, and disability status in US settings were included. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility. Single-reviewer data abstraction was confirmed by a second reviewer. We conducted independent dual quality assessment, and collective strength of evidence assessment. RESULTS: We included 21 studies. African American/Black, Latino, and low-socioeconomic status participants had disproportionately lower H1N1 vaccination rates (low- to moderate-strength evidence). However, Latinos were more likely than Whites to intend to be vaccinated, and African American/Blacks and participants with lower-socioeconomic status were just as likely to intend to be vaccinated as their White and higher-socioeconomic status counterparts (low-strength evidence). Vaccine uptake for other groups has been insufficiently studied. Factors potentially contributing to disparities in vaccine uptake included barriers to vaccine access, inadequate information, and concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy.

Our objective was to assess the clinical severity of human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus that has recently emerged in China. METHODS: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of A(H7N9) who were hospitalised, we estimated the risk of fatality, mechanical ventilation, and admission to the intensive care unit based on censored data during the currently ongoing outbreak. We also used information on laboratory-confirmed cases detected through sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance to estimate the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections to date and the symptomatic case fatality risk. FINDINGS: Among 123 hospitalised cases, 37 cases had died and 69 had recovered by May 28, 2013. Hospitalised cases had high risks of mortality (36%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 26%C45%), mechanical ventilation or mortality (69%; 95% CI: 60%C77%), and ICU admission or mechanical ventilation or mortality (83%; 95% CI: 76%C90%), and the risk of these severe outcomes increased with age. Depending on assumptions about the coverage of the sentinel ILI network and health-care seeking behavior for cases of ILI associated with A(H7N9) virus infection, we estimated that the symptomatic case fatality risk could be between 160 and 2,800 per 100,000 symptomatic cases. INTERPRETATION: We estimated that the severity of A(H7N9) is somewhat lower than A(H5N1) but higher than seasonal influenza viruses and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The estimated risks of fatality among hospitalised cases and symptomatic cases are measures of severity that should not be affected by shifts over time in the probability of laboratory-confirmation of mild cases and should inform risk assessment.

Among possible etiologies, oxidative stress (OS) is currently extensively studied, with emerging evidence showing its involvement in endothelial dysfunction and in different cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as HTN, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target. While there is a clear physiological equilibrium between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants essential for many cellular functions, excessive levels of ROS lead to vascular cell impairment with decreased nitric oxide (NO) availability and vasoconstriction, which promotes HTN. On the other hand, transcription factors such as nuclear factor erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mediate antioxidant response pathways and maintain cellular reductionCoxidation homeostasis, exerting protective effects. In this review, we describe the relationship between OS and hypertension-induced endothelial dysfunction and the involvement and therapeutic potential of Nrf2 in HTN.","output":"Oxidative Stress in Arterial Hypertension (HTN): The Nuclear Factor Erythroid Factor 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) Pathway, Implications and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the gold standard bariatric procedure. Typically, the procedure necessitates five to seven small skin incisions for trocar placement. The senior author (AA Saber) has developed a three-trocar approach for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHODS Sixteen patients underwent triple-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between May 2009 and August 2009. The same surgeon performed all surgical interventions. The umbilicus was the main point of entry for all patients and the same operative technique and perioperative protocol were used in all patients. RESULTS A total of sixteen triple-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses were performed. The procedures were successfully performed in all patients. Mean operating time was 145.4 min. None of the patients required conversion to an open procedure. There were no mortalities or post-operative technical complications noted during the immediate post-operative period. CONCLUSION Three trocar laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is safe, technically feasible and reproducible. This technique may be considered a \\"precursor\\" to single-incision laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.","output":"Three trocar laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric bypass: a novel technique en route to the single-incision laparoscopic approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In China, environmental pollution due to municipal solid waste (MSW) over-generation is one of the countrys priority concerns. The increasing volume and complexity of the waste poses serious risks to the environment and public health. Currently, the annual growth of MSW generation is estimated to be approximately 8C10% and will increase to 323 million metric tons (Mt) by 2030. Based on the secondary data collected from a literature survey, this article critically evaluates the recent progress of MSW management (MSWM) in China and offers new insights into the waste sector in the era of Industry 4.0. This helps decision makers in China to plan a smooth transition nationwide to a circular economy (CE) in the waste sector. It is evident that digitalization is a driving force for China to move towards low-carbon development strategies within the framework of CE. Through digitalization, the waste sector has promoted prevention, reduction, reuse, and recycling (3Rs) of waste before waste disposal in landfills. A proper implementation of digitalization-based waste recycling has contributed to an efficient cooperation between the government and private sector, increased job opportunities, and promoted the conservation of resources. It is anticipated that this work not only contributes to the establishment of an integrated MSWM system in China, but also improves local MSWM through digitalization in the framework of a CE.","output":"Transformation of Solid Waste Management in China: Moving towards Sustainability through Digitalization-Based Circular Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The study aims to assess the impact of the second COVID-19 pandemic wave on migraine characteristics. METHODS: This is an observational cross-sectional study conducted on migraine patients previously interviewed during the first Italian pandemic outbreak. A second structured telephone interview was conducted between 20 November 2020 and 18 January 2021. We compared migraine characteristics among T0 (before pandemic), T1 (during the first pandemic phase), and T2 (during the second pandemic phase). RESULTS: Among the 433 patients interviewed during the first pandemic phase, 304 cases were finally considered. One hundred forty-eight patients had a control visit between March 2020 and December 2020, 120 had an in-person visit, 14 by phone, the remainder used telemedicine software provided by the hospital. Frequency of headache, number of symptomatic drugs and headache intensity worsened during T2, compared to T0 and T1, especially in episodic migraine. Headache intensity increased relating to the negative emotional impact of the pandemic. Migraine management during the pandemic did not influence the clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: The prolongation of the pandemic seems to have a negative impact on migraine evolution.

Methods Data was collected for 96 patients with neck of femur fractures who presented to the emergency department between March 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020. This data set included information about their COVID-19 status. Parameters including inpatient complications, hospital quality measures, mortality rates, and training opportunities were compared between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative groups. Furthermore, our current cohort of patients were compared against a historical control group of 95 patients who presented with neck of femur fractures before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Seven (7.3%) patients were confirmed COVID positive by RT-PCR testing. The COVID positive cohort, when compared to the COVID negative cohort, had higher rates of postoperative complications (71.4% vs 25.9%), increased length of stay (30.3 days vs 12 days) and quicker time to surgery (0.7 days vs 1.3 days).The 2020 cohort compared to the 2019 cohort, had an increased 30-day mortality rate (13.5% vs 4.2%), increased number of delayed cases (25% vs 11.8%) as well as reduced training opportunities for Orthopaedic trainees to perform the surgery (51.6% vs 22.8%).

The Pandemic Equation predicts how the quarantine removal and business opening lead to a spike in the pandemic curve. The effective vaccination reduces the new daily infections predicted by the Pandemic Equation. The pandemic curves in many localities have similar time dependencies but shifted in time. The Pandemic Equation parameters extracted from the well advanced pandemic curves can be used for predicting the pandemic evolution in the localities, where the pandemics is still in the initial stages.

SETTING: The study population included students from senior and junior college classes in public schools in Enugu metropolis, Nigeria. METHOD: A school-based cross-sectional study design was employed for the study. A two-stage sampling technique was used to select 496 students (mean age = 16.5, s.d. = 1.9 years; 52.2% female) in six out of 33 public colleges in Enugu metropolis, Nigeria during the lockdown period occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Validated questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, resilience and social support were used to collect information. RESULTS: Most of the students reported depressive symptoms, whilst just over a third of the sample reported anxiety or both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses revealed that being male and reporting higher levels of social support and the ability to bounce back from stress were associated with less anxiety. Being younger and reporting a moderate level of support were associated with more depressive symptoms, whilst the ability to bounce back was associated with fewer depressive symptoms.

To boost the latter in the area of Clinical Trials (CT) Oversight (CTO), many international programs and Regional Centers for Regulatory Excellence (RCORE) initiatives offer various trainings to help strengthen human resource capacity. Here, we aimed at evaluating the training outcomes (at home-institution level) of sponsored fellows for one of such capacity strengthening interventions; a measure that is less often reported and thus remains poorly understood. METHOD: The Global Health Protection Programme's VaccTrain project sponsored nine regulatory staff from eight National Medicines Regulatory Authorities (NMRAs) in sub-Saharan Africa for the RCORE CT Training Fellowship by FDA Ghana in a particular year. Using a systematized evaluation framework based on the theory of change, we assessed the individual- and NMRA-level achievement of pre-defined training outcomes. For this purpose, data was collected at pre-training and at short- and long-term evaluation time-points using a survey instrument. RESULTS: At pre-training, our data revealed existence of differential expectations and orientations among the training participants, thus providing an early indication of potential distinctive patterns in achievement of desired training outcomes. In a short-term post-training follow-up evaluation, a two-group clustering of fellows based on the achievement of training outcomes where only one group (representing 44%) reported achievement of CTO-related outcomes was observed. At this time-point, achievement of training outcomes was associated with the vibrancy of CT activity and existence of a comprehensive technical structure for CTO. In a further long-term follow-up evaluation, our data revealed a successful achievement of CTO-related individual- and/or institutional-level outcomes in all but one fellow. Here again, availability of a robust technical structure for CTO (and perhaps fellow affiliation/selection)Cbut not CT vibrancyCshowed a trend of temporal association with achievement of training outcomes. CONCLUSION: Given the pivotal role operational structures of international standards at home institutions play in translating training-acquired knowledge into measurable CTO-related outcomes, we encourage that capacity strengthening projects aimed at achieving health-related targets of Sustainable Development Goals adopt an approach built on this foundation.","output":"The Pivotal Role of Quality Technical Structures for Clinical Trials Oversight in the Achievement of Long-Term Capacity Strengthening Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not only about development and protecting environment, but also about public participation during all the process It is not an exaggeration that public participation is claimed as one of the key indicators of the effectiveness of EIA Therefore, even in pandemic conditions while development still must go on at the same time, public participation can be avoided in the EIA process In a wide range of international arrangements and national regulation, there are several guidance in accommodating public participation such as the Aarhus Convention 1998 and Indonesian national regulation This article compares and analyses those legal procedures in mitigating unexpected conditions The result shows that both of them are still feasible to be applied even in abnormal circumstances Some barriers are identified especially related to implementing advanced technology Therefore, how these aspirations are conveyed and accepted must be done in various alternative ways ?

Design: Descriptive and interrupted time series analysis using anonymised individual-level population-scale data for 1.32 billion records of dispensed CVD medications across 15.8 million individuals in England, Scotland and Wales. Setting: Community dispensed CVD medications with 100% coverage from England, Scotland and Wales, plus primary care prescribed CVD medications from England (including 98% English general practices). Participants: 15.8 million individuals aged 18+ years alive on 1st April 2018 dispensed at least one CVD medicine in a year from England, Scotland and Wales. Main outcome measures: Monthly counts, percent annual change (1st April 2018 to 31st July 2021) and annual rates (1st March 2018 to 28th February 2021) of medicines dispensed by CVD/ CVD risk factor; prevalent and incident use. Results: Year-on-year change in dispensed CVD medicines by month were observed, with notable uplifts ahead of the first (11.8% higher in March 2020) but not subsequent national lockdowns. Using hypertension as one example of the indirect impact of the pandemic, we observed 491,203 fewer individuals initiated antihypertensive treatment across England, Scotland and Wales during the period March 2020 to end May 2021 than would have been expected compared to 2019. We estimated that this missed antihypertension treatment could result in 13,659 additional CVD events should individuals remain untreated, including 2,281 additional myocardial infarctions (MIs) and 3,474 additional strokes. Incident use of lipid-lowering medicines decreased by an average 14,793 per month in early 2021 compared with the equivalent months prior to the pandemic in 2019. In contrast, the use of incident medicines to treat type-2 diabetes (T2DM) increased by approximately 1,642 patients per month. Conclusions: Management of key CVD risk factors as proxied by incident use of CVD medicines has not returned to pre-pandemic levels in the UK. Novel methods to identify and treat individuals who have missed treatment are urgently required to avoid large numbers of additional future CVD events, further adding indirect cost of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular disease prevention and management in England, Scotland and Wales: A population-scale descriptive analysis of trends in medication data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The system of two transiting Neptune-sized planets around the bright, young M-dwarf AU Mic provides a unique opportunity to test models of planet formation, early evolution, and star-planet interaction.

We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional and cognitive responses and behavioral coping among Chinese residents. METHODS: An online investigation was run from 5 February to 25 February 2020, which recruited a total of 616 Chinese residents. Self-designed questionnaires were used to collect demographic information, epidemic knowledge and prevention of COVID-19 and characteristics of medical workers. The emotional and cognitive responses were assessed via the Symptom Check List-30 (SCL-30) and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Behavioral coping was assessed via Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). RESULTS: In total, 131 (21.3%) medical workers and 485 (78.7%) members of the general public completed the structured online survey. The structural equation models showed that emotional response interacted with cognitive response, and both emotional response and cognitive response affected the behavioral coping. Multivariate regression showed that positive coping enhanced emotional and cognitive responses, while negative coping reduced emotional and cognitive responses. The emotional response (depression, anxiety and photic anxiety) scores of the participants were higher than the norm (all p < 0.001); in particular, the panic scores of members of the general public were higher than those of medical workers (p < 0.05), as well as the cognitive response (paranoia and compulsion). Both positive and negative coping scores of the participants were lower than the norm (p < 0.001), and the general public had higher negative coping than medical workers (p < 0.05).

It focuses on three cities - Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York City - and utilizes city-level daily pollutant data for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2:5). Each city had three time periods (pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown) determined by the enactment and relaxation of gathering restrictions. T-tests were used to compare air pollution measured during the three periods against a baseline created from the mean pollutant concentrations from 2015 to 2019. The results show that the lockdowns were effective in reducing CO concentrations in all three cities. Reductions in NO2 during lockdowns were supported by results from New York and Seattle, the cities with colder and more humid climates. Only Los Angeles, the warmest and driest city, saw reductions in O3 concentrations during the lockdowns. Reductions in PM2:5 concentrations during lockdowns were observed in Los Angeles and New York, but not in Seattle. These findings support devising policies to reduce CO, NO2, and PM2:5 through discouraging private vehicle travel in large urban areas.

Accordingly, the ongoing use of CP to prevent ESBL-PE transmission to healthy nurses was evaluated. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in three hospitals. Hospital 1 required CP, Hospital 2 had recently stopped CP, and Hospital 3 had stopped it three years previously. Questionnaires and stool-collection containers were distributed to all patient care nurses in those three hospitals. The Returned samples were tested using the agar dilution technique. Results A total of 269 out of 733 nurses volunteered to participate; 140 met the inclusion criteria (no recent hospitalization, antibiotic use, or known ESBL-PE colonization) and provided samples. Among them, 15% were ESBL-positive. Compared to nurses from Hospital 3, nurses from Hospital 1 were 59% less likely to be colonized, while nurses from Hospital 2 were 62% more likely to be colonized. Conclusion In hospitals where CP is in place for ESBL-positive patients, ESBL-PE prevalence in nursing staff was significantly lower. Additionally, a work experience of two to four years increased the odds of ESBL-PE colonization in comparison with longer nursing experience. CP may be a justifiable means of protection against ESBL-PE transmission to healthy nurses.

Restrictions imposed in the UK in response to the pandemic led to rapid health and housing service alterations. We aimed to examine PWID experiences of: 1) challenges relating to the COVID-19 public health measures; 2) changes to opioid substitution therapy (OST) and harm reduction services; and 3) perceived effects of COVID-19 on drug use patterns and risk behaviour. METHODS: : Telephone semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 PWID in Bristol, Southwest of England. Analysis followed a reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: : Concern about COVID-19 and adherence to public health guidance varied. Efforts made by services to continue providing support during the pandemic were appreciated and some changes were preferred, such as less frequent OST collection, relaxation of supervised consumption and needle and syringe programmes (NSP) home delivery. However, remote forms of contact were highlighted as less beneficial and more difficult to engage with than in-person contact. Public health guidance advising people to stay home led to increased isolation, boredom, and time to ruminate which impacted negatively on mental health. Lockdown restrictions directly impacted on sources of income and routine. Changes in drug use were explained as a consequence of isolation and fewer interactions with peers, problems accessing drugs, reduced drug purity and reduced financial resources. CONCLUSION: : This study captures the significant impacts and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of PWID. While rapid adaptations to service delivery to help mitigate the risks of COVID-19 were appreciated and some changes such as relaxation of supervised daily OST consumption were viewed positively, barriers to access need further attention.

Diet was associated with reduced risk of gestational diabetes (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.82), preterm delivery (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22-0.84), large for gestational age neonate (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.47), neonatal intensive care admission (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.95), and total adverse maternal (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.92) and neonatal outcomes (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.72). Physical activity was associated with reduced GWG and reduced risk of gestational diabetes (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75), hypertensive disorders (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.90), cesarean section (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95), and total adverse maternal outcomes (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86). Diet with physical activity was associated with reduced GWG (-1.35 kg; 95% CI, -1.95 to -0.75) and reduced risk of gestational diabetes (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.96) and total adverse maternal outcomes (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95). Mixed interventions were associated with reduced GWG only. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found level 1 evidence that antenatal structured diet and physical activity-based lifestyle interventions were associated with reduced GWG and lower risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The findings support the implementation of such interventions in routine antenatal care and policy around the world.","output":"Association of Antenatal Diet and Physical Activity-Based Interventions With Gestational Weight Gain and Pregnancy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose an unprecedented challenge for the entire world and the healthcare system. Different theories have been proposed elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms attributing to high mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 infection. Out of them, thrombosis and procoagulant state have managed to earn the maximum limelight. We conducted an observational study based on data from randomly selected 349 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection in a community-based hospital in New York City during the first wave of the COVID-19 viral surge in March 2020. The main objective of our study was to assess the risk and occurrence of thrombotic events (both venous and arterial) among the hospitalized patients including the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU admissions with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome in our study was defined as the thrombotic events that included myocardial infarction (MI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The study correlated the association of thrombotic events with the level of biomarkers of interest: D-dimer >1000 ng/ml, troponin-I >1 ng/ml, or both. The association of D-dimers and troponin-I with thrombotic events was measured using both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard (PH) regression analysis. Out of a total of 349 patients, 78 patients (22.35%) were found to have elevated biomarkers (D-dimer >1000 ng/ml and/or troponin-I >1 ng/ml) and were categorized as a high-risk group. Eighty-nine patients developed thrombotic complications (evidence of more than one thrombotic event was found in several patients). Two-hundred seventy-one (77.65%) patients had no documentation of thrombosis. The incidence of thrombotic events included myocardial infarction (MI; N=45; 12.8%), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA; N=16; 4.5%), deep venous thrombosis (DVT; N=16; 4.5%), and pulmonary embolism (PE; N=9; 2.57%).","output":"Observational Study of Thrombotic Events in a Random Cohort of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients at a Community-Based Hospital of New York City During the Beginning of the 2020 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) is essential to elicit goals, values, and preferences of care in older adults with serious illness and on trajectories of frailty. An exploration of ACP uptake in older adults may identify barriers and facilitators. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an integrative review of research on the uptake of ACP in older adults and create a conceptual model of the findings. METHODS: Using Whittemore and Knafl's methodology, we systematically searched four electronic databases of ACP literature in older adults from 1996 through December 2019. Critical appraisal tools were used to assess study quality, and articles were categorized according to level of evidence. Statistical and thematic analysis was then undertaken. RESULTS: Among 1081 studies, 78 met inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis evaluated ACP and variables within the domains of demographics, psychosocial, disability and functioning, and miscellaneous. Thematic analysis identified a central category of enhanced communication, followed by categories of 1) provider role and preparation; 2) patient/family relationship patterns; 3) standardized processes and structured approaches; 4) contextual influences; and 5) missed opportunities. A conceptual model depicted categories and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced communication and ACP facilitators improve uptake of ACP. Clinicians should be cognizant of these factors.

With the use of probiotics like curd (dahi) and micronutrient-rich leaf protein concentrate (LPC), this immune recovery may be hastened. This study was conducted to assess the impact of supplementation of curd and LPC on nutritional status, and immunity as assessed by anthropometry, haemoglobin, ferritin levels, T- cell subpopulation and C-reactive protein (CRP), in children suffering from PEM. METHODS Eighty moderate to severely malnourished children (1-5 yr) were randomized to receive either curd or LPC in addition to WHO recommended two-step diet over 15 days. Nutritional, immunological and haematological parameters were measured before and after supplementation and compared within the groups. RESULTS The change in weight, haemoglobin level and CD4:CD8 T-cell subpopulation was significant in both the groups after supplementation. Response of CRP was blunted in PEM.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of telemedicine for patient consultation and its effect on radiotherapy simulation and treatment processes. Methods: A standardized simulation requisition directive was used for all consults (telemedicine and inperson) undergoing simulation for external beam radiation therapy at a single tertiary care institution from January to December 2020. These directives were reviewed at daily multidisciplinary peer review meetings;modifications occurring as a result of this review were prospectively recorded in a departmental quality database. Descriptive statistics were used to identify characteristics associated with consultation type. Mann Whitney and Chisquare tests were used to compare continuous and categorical variables. Results: 1500 consecutive patients were reviewed in this prospective peer review process;444 (29.6%) had telemedicine visits preceding simulation and 1056 (70.4%) had in-person consults. The median time between physician simulation order and date of simulation was 5 days (IQR: 2-11 days) for telemedicine visits and 4 days (IQR: 1-8 days) for in-person consults (p<0.05). Significant differences were observed in telemedicine usage across months (p<0.05) with the highest percentage in July, September, and August (50%, 45.9% and 45%, respectively). As a result of prospective multidisciplinary peer review, 397 modifications in 290 simulations were recorded in total;101/444 (22.7%) telemedicine simulations had modifications compared to 189/1056 (17.9%) following inperson consultation (p<0.05). The most common modifications for telemedicine visits resulted from immobilization device changes (n=32, 23.5%), arm positioning (n=19, 14.0%), and changes in the radiotherapy care path (n=17, 12.5%). For telemedicine consults, the median radiotherapy fraction dose was 2.66 Gy (2-4 Gy) and median fraction number was 16 (5-28). There was no difference for fractionation preference between telemedicine and in person consults (p=0.084). Seven (1.6%) telemedicine visits and 7 (0.7%) in-person consults needed resimulation during the entire study period (p=0.136). Conclusions: Telemedicine is a powerful tool with the potential to revolutionize the radiation oncology daily practice. In the initial learning phase, it appears that there is a higher frequency of simulation modifications for patients evaluated by telemedicine. Therefore, as departmental processes incorporate telemedicine in the future, thorough attention is needed to encourage review of common modifications as well as identify patients at high risk of error at time of simulation who may also benefit from in-person evaluation prior to simulation.","output":"A prospective multidisciplinary review of radiotherapy processes during the telemedicine era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic came as an unexpected challenge to many healthcare systems around the world. Many centers struggled to provide COVID-19 ICU-level care while also maintaining adequate care for non-COVID-19-related conditions, especially in critical care specialty units like trauma and burn. We present a case series of our early experiences treating COVID-19 in a burn center. METHODS: We present a case. RESULTS: See Table 1. Though one case was admitted prior to initiation of universal testing, routine infection-control protocols limited exposure to personnel and prevented transmission to staff. In May 2020, we implemented the use of N95 mask and eye protection during all aerosolizing procedures, N95 mask use in all ORs, and universal surgical mask use in all rooms regardless of COVID-19 status. An in-house risk-stratification system was used to screen patients based on symptoms and exposure. Burn-center admissions were screened at a lower threshold than throughout the institution given the unique nature of burn injury. Eventually, because of increasing community spread, all admissions to the hospital were universally screened with RT-PCR prior to admission. To minimize exposure to non-COVID patients and Burn Center staff, COVID-19 positive burn admissions were assessed on a case-by-case basis. High acuity patients were admitted to the Burn Center and followed by the COVID consult team. Lower acuity patients were admitted to the Burn Center but were treated on the medical COVID unit and followed by the burn consult service. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID 19 pandemic has strained healthcare systems worldwide. Development and implementation of universal screening, testing, infection-control precautions, and triage strategies are critical elements of burn care during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we prepare for future surges due to more transmissible variants, implementation of standard protocols enables continued provision of quality care, preservation of the healthcare workforce, and efficient use of resources.","output":"758 Constant evolution: Early experiences treating COVID-19 in a burn center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction COVID-19 can cause dyspnea through many mechanisms, and uncovering the underlying etiology greatly affects management. Diagnostic examinations can help uncover pulmonary, cardiac, or hematologic conditions that can contribute to post-viral COVID dyspnea. Hypothesis Non-exertional dyspnea could be caused by maskophobia and not cardiopulmonary conditions. Methods A 59-year-old woman with no history of heart failure and a history of mild exercise-induced asthma, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, depression, and migraines was hospitalized for resting dyspnea. Three months prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and a repeat test was positive a week prior to presentation. Upon exercise, oxygen saturation improves. The patient does not endorse dyspnea regularly, with shortness of breath only when wearing a mask. Orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea were absent. Vital signs were normal. The patient was treated with antivirals, and because of her asthma history, was prescribed 10 days of oral steroids. Supplemental O2 was given for initial mild hypoxia, and the patient was discharged with an oxygen prescription at 1 L/min throughout the day. Upon follow-up, diagnostic testing was performed to assess the etiology of her dyspnea symptoms. D-dimer, complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (EKG) did not demonstrate any evidence of infarction or cardiomyopathy. Chest X-ray did not show pulmonary infiltrate or cardiomegaly. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Nuclear stress testing did not demonstrate any cardiac ischemia. Pulmonary function testing showed mild reactive airway disease consistent with prior asthma history. The symptoms of dyspnea would resolve once the patient removes her mask. Results Dyspnea can be caused by dysfunction anywhere along the pathway from environment oxygen intake to oxygen delivery to the end organs. The most common organ systems involved are pulmonary, cardiac, or hematologic. Anxiety can also cause dyspnea in the absence of a physiologic mismatch between oxygen supply and demand. Cardiopulmonary evaluation is the initial step in the workup of exertional dyspnea. Chest X-ray can assess for the presence of pneumonia, and labs such as D dimer indicate the likelihood of blood clots and pulmonary embolism. Exertional symptoms are evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Heart failure can be suspected with abnormal systolic or diastolic function on an echocardiogram. However, if the diagnostic exams do not show any exertional abnormalities of the heart related to dyspnea, and symptoms only occur with the use of a mask, this may reflect an unusual case of non-exertional dyspnea from maskophobia. Conclusions Because masks are becoming a norm during the COVID-19 era, non-exertional dyspnea may represent maskophobia. In the absence of significant laboratory, imaging, and cardiopulmonary investigation, wearing masks could be a cause of non-exertional dyspnea during the era of COVID-19.","output":"Maskophobia As A Cause Of Non-exertional Dyspnea In The Era Of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on society have yet to be truly revealed; there is no doubt that the pandemic has severely affected the daily lives of most of humanity. It is to be expected that the research activities of scientists could be impacted to varying degrees, but no data exist on how COVID-19 has affected research specifically. Here, we show that the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already diversely and negatively affected bee research at a global level.
